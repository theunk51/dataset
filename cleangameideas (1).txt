ocje4l|1v1 Horror Strategy Game (plus first person controls)| \n\nHello  everyone! I have a new game idea that I think could be great, but  before I pursue it I want to see if others think it could be successful  as well. It is a horror strategy game that would have a similar feel to  chess where you have pieces (horror characters) that you can move around  a board/map while the player themselves can also run around and act as  another character. Think of FNAF-like movement where each character can  be moved from room to room. Each player would have a team of characters  that they could move around. Characters can fight each other, there is  also player v player and player v character. You would control the  characters with a tablet while you run around as the player, using  sounds and clues given by each character to figure out where the enemy  is.\n\nI  think exploring these ideas alone could result in a cool game, but I  still need an end game or win condition. I thought of maybe progressing  the characters to certain places to control areas in the map (domination  kind of gameplay) or maybe just kill the other team.\n\nIf  there is anything you would add or get rid of, or maybe a cooler win  condition please let me know! I think the mechanics could be really cool  if done right, but I want to see what other people think.
ocg0lf|AI manipulation|so what if this was a stealth game was about manipulating AI, so like if there's a croakadile(frog/crocodile) then it'l bite the player but if you put a dragonsly(sly dragonfly) in the guards pocket then it will get distracted. you might even be able to steal it and tame it, and you could trick it into gobbling up guards in the next mission. wouldn't have crazy graphics, so low poly 3D gameplay could work. of course, you could do whatever you want with the idea, this is just a suggestion if you have no ideas. i don't know how many people it would take, with what budget, and for how long, so i'll mark it AAA.
oce74w|My internship is boring, any idea for a game about cartography ?|I'm stuck in an internship for a cartography company, and all they are doing is back-end or integration stuff that I don't like, so I'm wondering whether I could convince the boss to let me make a game that promote his company for them.\n\nBut I'd need a good idea!\n\nIt could be about maps, topology, winds, currents...\n\nI hope you get inspired! :D
ocd2yt|Bureaucratic nightmare puzzle game|You are a young entrepreneur excited to start your own business. The only step left to take is to get the official approval from the government, but it is when you meet the dystopian bureaucracy that you learn that this is going to be the hardest part of your journey.\n\nYou start at the gates of a huge government building, in front of you are long, lifeless corridors with countless doors to either side. In you hand, you have got a form, and the address of the office you have to go to. After finding the right place, a door labelled with strange glyphs and a very non-descriptive job title. Making your way inside and presenting your documents to the worker, you are promptly rejected: it is not possible for them to grant your request without first being presented with further documents. They give you a few vague hints as to who might be responsible for those and send you off on your odyssey through the building, navigating the maze like corridors to finding the right people and fulfilling their increasingly ridiculous demands based on their increasingly unhelpful hints.\n\nThe main gameplay concept consists of two tasks: Learning the language of bureaucracy to know what you need to do, and figuring out how you can actually meet those requirements. \n\nThere are three main objects to the gameplay: Door labels, responses, documents, and forms. The door labels, as you will figure out while playing the game, are not random. Encoded in them are where in the building the door is located, and what the person inside is responsible for. Learning to interpret those will allow you to more quickly find where you need to go: If you need to acquire some document, you will need to ask yourself, what glyphs and job title someone providing it should have, and what place in the building those would correspond to. The responses you get from workers in response to providing documents or forms, initially, serve as a sort of tutorial, giving you some clues as to what some things might mean, but will, later on, also mainly consists of codes whose main function is to inform you (as soon as you know how to interpret them) as to what the person actually requires of you. Documents are what you might get from the bureaucrats for providing them with forms and documents. They are usually tokens of success (doing what the person required of you), but may later on also contain information dependent on how you filled in the forms (again in the form of glyphs and weird codes) that could be part of another persons requirements. Forms are, apart from figuring out whom to talk to and presenting documents, your main way to interact with the game. You are handed forms by some people and are then tasked to fill them out: On the form, you will find some glyphs up top that tell you what the form is about, as well as a few multiple choice questions, labelled only by glyphs whose answers are (you guessed it) again glyphs. Once you have submitted the form, you will receive a response indicating whether you have filled out the form correctly, and you may receive some of the previously mentioned documents.\n\nOver the course of the game, your main challenge will shift: At the beginning, you will feel quite lost, not sure what any of the glyphs mean and not really knowing why your forms are accepted or rejected. Once you start to learn the codes, though, and you feel like you finally understand how the bureaucratic machine works, your focus will change to figuring out how exactly you need to answer the forms to get what you want. This might be as simple as figuring out which of the responses satisfy all of the multiple requirements, or it may require you to think outside of the box: If I need to submit this form to multiple people, do the documents they give me actually depend on my answers, or can I change the form before giving it to the second worker? Does the bureaucrat actually care about all of the document, or could I get away with handing them the wrong one?\n\nWill you be able to navigate the bureaucratic nightmare and finally be able to start your own business?\n\nTLDR: Heaven's Vault meats Papers, Please with more puzzles.
ocd1rn|Figuring out my zombie/ish/undead trope characters for my fighting game, this is what I have so far|One is a combat medic female nurse who was in love with her bf/lover general doctor, who she tried to save and protect, but the doctor ended up becoming more and more of a monster, almost zombie-Frankenstein monster. You can switch between both duo fighters back and forth. The medic being more fast and close range but weaker and the monster doctor being more slow and stronger.\n\nA parasitic infected zombie with symbiote abilities that was turned into a zombie in a lab. Can use it's symbiote parts as assistance to attack.\n\nAn early 20th century German alchemist who has been trying to find a cure during the Spanish Flu, who had become some form of a plague-like zombie and has been living the past 100's of years with this plague curse in isolation. He's sort of like a Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde type character. He can turn into a stronger plague zombie each time he injects himself.\n\nA female telekinetic ghost from feudal Japan. She goes on with vengeance after her father and family were killed. She wears a kimono with long black hair covering her face with a spirit like undead appearance and uses telekinesis to attack. Possibly the use of necromancy of ghosts from her fallen homeland.\n\nAn undead zombie female also from feudal Japan. She carries vengeance after her husband was killed. SHE WAS AN Onna-musha female samurai warrior that had samurai armor and uses a naginata as her primary weapon. She is very fast, like a fast moving zombie and will rush in to jump, attack and slash at you and even teleport.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do any of you think of my zombie trope ideas?

Each player antes a fee at the beginning of the game and the last player standing takes it all!
oc7dpo|Rhythm game, but also a side-scrolling shooter at the same time?????|The main character is a musician who fights monsters in their city and has collaborations with other artists (multiplayer... maybe), in this post I compiled some ideas for the game in no particular order.\n\nThe fighter (chosen/main character?) gets dropped off on a stage and receives a weapon + amount of ammo that corresponds to the chosen difficulty, (easy mode gives you a lot of ammo and guns, for example) \n\nUsing the amount of ammo the fighter receives, they have to win against the monster before it runs out. The monster will attack or show its weakness to the beat of the music, allowing the fighter to damage the monster (while it shows weakness) or doge.\n\nTaking damage, falling off the stage, or getting hit by the surroundings gives the fighter a permanent debuff which can last the entire game, or for only a few minutes ( bad aim, slowing down, lower defense, etc ) depending on the chosen difficulty.\n\nThe level ends with a grade, telling the player how well they've done, and the public's opinion on the fighter, the grade is decided by the following;\n\n*Is the monster killed by the fighter? Wounded enough for others to take care of it with ease, or gotten away with minimal damage?*\n\n*Is the fighter wounded during the fight?*\n\n*What equipment did the fighter use?*\n\n*What outfit did the fighter wear? ( flashy outfits make the public think you're cool, but doesn't affect the grade too much)*\n\nIf the fighter receives too many bad grades or is unable to continue fighting, they will retire.\n\nObviously inspired by games like Touhou and Friday Night Funkin, and if anyone's interested in programming this game,,, I can be your pixel art artist.
oc5yl3|An idea for animal AI|I think it would be ccol to make animal AIs more like the mutants in The Forest. In The Forest when you first meet mutants they act more curious and act based on your actions. Also in real life many animals including predators aren't really just boring herbivours which their only purpose is only for resources/food and running away from players nor dangerous hunters which always hunt whatever they see crossing their eyes. They also make mistakes, are clumsy and do "stupid" or funny things or other weird stuff.\n\nDid you know that in Africa male elephants are reported to have sex with wild hippos? What if you were playing this hypothetical game where you would casually pick up four wheeled vehicle and driving along until suddenly a some kind of huge animal/alien like creature starts chasing you... You try to drive as fast as possible but you can't out run the beast. You panicly jump out of the vehicle and flee only to realise that the creature doesn't have any intrest in you... It seems to try to make an impression for the vehicle and starts some kind of sexual display and an attempt to mate with it. This doesn't last long however so you better take advantage of the situation and LEAVE!\n\n\nThese types of occurances will make them more unpredictable and makes the player cautious every time whether harmless or dangerous looking the animal may be.
oc35gs|Game/Simulation idea based on creating your own nerf guns and playing PvP matches like paintball.|I always liked playing nerf guns and having with my friends you play in the house and shooting at each other after you run out of Foam darts you find them across the house. I thought what if players could create all these set pieces of guns according to their will and create their own guns, for example, Pistols, Shotguns, Assault rifles and even they can mix these types like having shotgun as an attachment in rifles. then share them among their friends and worldwide, Then use their guns to test and play with friends. \n\nInitially, they start with limited resource items and then progress by winning matches and they get rewards to build more setpieces or guns.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective, of course, to make players feel immersed while creating the guns and shooting.\n\nThe multiplayer PvP follows the rules of deathmatch and paintball. The levels can be houses, outer environments, paintball arenas, etc...

obunbm|2D Top-Down Barren Planet Survival|Core Premise: You're in cryo with a few others, in a settler pod flying to a brand new paradise. You pass through an asteroid belt, and the ship gets pummeled, frying the nav system, and waking you up. You're able to steer the thing to the closest planet before the whole ship starts breaking apart. It's lifeless. Congratulations. You and your crew just inherited a wasteland planet of your very own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a settler ship, it came equipped with everything you need to survive on a beautiful jungle planet... You're not on one. You've got seeds, saplings, a wrecked ship with limitless O2... if you stay on it... and an H2O generator for a small amount of water over time. You've also got exactly one O2 tank and a mask, the one from the ship's cockpit. The rest are somewhere floating around that asteroid belt with the back end of the ship... You're alone, and you can't get anyone out of cryo until there's plenty of food, water, and oxygen to go around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main idea is simple enough. You leave the ship with the O2 tank, and can scout for a little while before returning for more oxygen. You can collect some resources, but there isn't much out there. You need food, so it's time to plant some crops and trees in the tiny O2 bubble the ship is providing you. Everything will grow pretty fast because it's all futuristic, and genetically modified... not because it's a video game or anything...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFully grown crops will expand the O2 bubble just around them, but it will disappear once you've harvested them. You can plant trees to expand it better. They will provide a bunch of different resources, sparingly, like apples, or rubber. They will grow on the tree every once in a while, but will regrow over and over. The problem is, you've only got a limited number of saplings and seeds, and they all got jumbled up when you crashed. So, planting the original lot is a gamble. You won't get anything to grow unless it has at least some O2, so trying to plant beyond the bubble is pointless. You need to cut down trees for their saplings, but this will take away some of the O2 bubble, so you need to keep replanting. Only fully grown trees give enough O2 to expand it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe broader your O2 bubble, the further you can explore, and the more the ground slowly becomes fertile with local plant-life (not all friendly), expanding out from your ship. This planet once had life, so there's plenty to explore. Maybe you can find something to help you survive...\n\nThe goal is to awaken some shipmates to automate some tasks, as well as bring life to this planet. There's also some building involved, just like any settler game, like lumber mills, and things of this nature.
obngb9|Point and click adventure set in a pokemon-like universe. (Or just a pokemon fangame)|And by that i mean monkey island with pokemon battles. That's pretty much it. You go around, have humorous conversations with other trainers, do item puzzles, and occasionally battle with your set (relatively small, only 3 or 4 mons) team, who are just as much characters as the humans, on a quest to do something that ISN'T becoming leauge champion.\n\n If we somehow COULD make it a pokemon fangame without getting sued (although judging by exactly WHAT Nintendo does or does not dmca being based on whether or not they're making a game with the same ideas [new mainline pokemon game, rereleasing mario 64, metroid 2 remake, mario 1 battle royale, etc], i think we'll be safe), I'd base a few things off of the kanto arc of the anime, such as having that one jigglypuff as part of your party, your rival(s) are as petty as the team rocket trio (with a nice jab at the old "obvious disguise" routine with the heroes immediately knowing it's them, but everyone else is still fooled, and the story forces them (the heroes) into going along with it.), and there are a few episodes adapted into the game.\n\nA few ideas for the team:\n\nAn eevee saved from the evil team, who did experiments on them to have them change evolutions at will like type:null. (Taken from the manga, and also used to add more variety to other trainers' teams)\n\nThe aforementioned jigglypuff, who acts like a showbiz diva\n\nA lucario who goes through a similar arc to ash's charizard\n\nPikachu libre, who wants to become famous in the battle frontier (or equivalent)\n\nA ditto with an identity crisis\n\nA male gardevoir or female gallade\n\nA shuckle who is convinced that he can evolve, and gets into wacky hyjinks attempting to do so (yes, i DID take that from dorkly, thanks for noticing!)\n\nA porygon-z that gets further corrupted and becomes missingno (Although it doesn't get the "glitchy cuthullu" portrayal missingno usually gets, instead it's trying to find a way to fix itself and un-evolve into a porygon-2.) If used, a puzzle should involve using its item duplication powers somehow.
objl14|Would this be possible in an fps?|I've been a fan of first-person shooters for years now.   A dream of mine is to maybe develope my own one day. Fingers crossed. \n\nThe one thing I've always wanted is to eliminate lobbies. At least the traditional sense of them. With the power of the new consoles and their loading speeds, I think it's possible.  \nWhat if after every match ends, instead of going back to the pregame screen, you saw the characters traveling to the next map as a cinematic or mini-game? \nIt's not ground breaking but I'm pretty sure people would enjoy it.

obec86|Simple yet expandable rougelike ideas?|I'm looking for some new rougelike ideas that have a simple premise yet can be expanded upon into a full game if needed. My goal is to release *any* game, however, I always aim too ambitious and it never comes to fruition. I have many years of professional game dev experience (in a team) so don't worry if it's technically challenging. I'm just looking for something I can dedicate some time too away from my job as a solo personal project.\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas.
obcx7l|Health / Mana Bar Mechanic|I recently thought of a interesting take on the normal health / mana bar system. Instead of having two bars, one for health and one for mana, you only have one.\n\n The catch is the helsrh amd mana bars grow from opposite sides and whenever there is empty space they both grow to fill in the empty space.\n\nSo lets say ur bar is 100 units. You could start off with 50 health and 50 mana. Lets say you take 20 damage and your health and mana grow at the same rate. Eventually you will get to 40 health and 60 mana. Then lets say you cast a spell that costs 50 mana. If you let your bar fill up, you'll have 65 health and 35 mana. \n\nThis introduces a bunch of play styles. Like you could play super safe and have alot of health, or you could be powerful but fragile. \n\nFrom a game narrative perspective theres a bunch of ways to take this. One I really like is that the mechanic is a cursed placed on a powerful wizard. \n\nNot sure what type of game this mechanic should be used in. My first thoighht was some action game / metroidvania would be best. \n\nI thought of this mechamic a while ago. I thinknots really interesting, but Im kinda burnt out rn. So hopefully someone else can make use of it

op885f|Randomly Generated story game|Would anyone play a game that every time you restarted all the ai, shops, cities and pretty much everything changed?\nYou would build a storyline in one play through where you join a faction and they have randomly generated rivals and motives, then if you want you could restart and everything would be different. \nAll ai have different attributes that are randomly assigned and you can interact with all of them some of them may have things for you to do, some of them may despise you completely despise you. \nLike entering an randomly generated AI world, with no specific storyline until you create one. \nPlease drop a comment if you like the idea.
op5axx|Turn based party type game|I want to make a game I could play with my friends where each person takes turns. It doesn’t have to be like an RPG, or a fight, just something casual like a party game. I also want characters to be significantly involved somehow, like they have different advantages or something. But it would have to be one person at a time, and it couldn’t be a card game of any sort cause everyone is looking at the same screen, and you wouldn’t be able to hide your cards. What are some game genres or ideas that would fit this criteria?
op3yar|A life sim or romance sim thats like GTA but way more of a casual game?|I've always wanted to find a game that was open world, mainly casual gameplay, has romance and is in first person. \nLike if The Sims, GTA and a Bethesda game were merged together. Kinda. Basically a game with the casual-ness of The Sims, the graphics and pov of GTA, and with like companions and some romance stuff, like a Bethesda game. Not a whole lot of combat involved, if any, and it would mainly focus on immersion and everyday life. NPCs with backstories and unique personalities that you can befriend, bring along with you, romance, etc. I guess it would have to have some sort of storyline too, for people to be interested. \nI'm no game developer. I'm just constantly searching for games that are similar to this concept. I love casual gameplay but I also love RPGs. I guess I just wish there was an RPG that wasn't so combat-heavy and was more immersive.

oozhfx|I’d love to make a game based around sound with someone|Hello, an Idea has just popped into my head whilst I was brainstorming and I think it could be really cool if done well. Perhaps even a franchise based around senses.\n\nBasically, the game is based around sound with minimal amounts of graphical aspects (otherwise it wouldn’t work). You have to listen carefully to even the quietest of sounds so that you can try to find out what happened to you before you had a coma. My inspiration is before your eyes since the story will be the same sort of structure.\n\nThe game would last somewhere between 1-4 hours so that you could do it in one sitting. I’m not sure about the details so I’m open to suggestions. Let me know what you think!
ooqkp9|A James Bond game that uses Alpha Protocol as a template|Super Bunnyhop pointed out that Hitman is the best Bond game for the aforementioned reasons, and IO Interactive is currently making a Bond game. However, I believe that crown goes to Alpha Protocol. \n\nAlpha Protocol, despite its flaws and glitches, is the only game I felt like playing as James Bond. My ideal game would be remaking Alpha Protocol into a Bond game, featuring the Daniel Craig model, a few script changes, bug fixing, John Barry score (or David Arnold score), and the functional combat system. Throw Blacklist's gameplay into here, and I would not play anything else anymore.
ooq4rt|I am developing a post cold war period game|\nI am developing a game that tells the story of a man and his dog in a period after the cold war that caused the collapse of the Russian rupee and consequently anarchy, the game will have firewatch-like and Metal-like graphics. Gear Solid 5 for the mechanics, with a cue taken from the basics of The Last of Us. Could you tell me if a game in this type of dystopia has already been created?
oon3vl|A game about storming a terrorist filled tower with only a baton|It's called BatonForce. Basically you are a member of a SWAT team, who, despite his superiors' orders, storms a building filled with terrorists. The negotiations have ended and you are only one against the enemy.\n\nBasically you use the baton for most of the time. You smash windows, whack terrorists and do all kinds of cool action-movie shit with it, like reflecting bullets, use it as a bat to hit smaller items as projectiles and such. You can also take dropped weapons off the ground, empty the whole magazine into an enemy and hit the empty gun towards another.\n\nAbout 100 floors, saves after every floor, yadda, yadda. The environment is highly destructible and you can even break holes into walls with explosives and shotguns.
oom9zo|A single player FPS where you play as an exterminator|So basically people pay you to help get rid of pests in their homes by shooting them.\n\nBut your company has a strict no property damage policy: The client gets some of their money back every time you miss and accidentally shoot their furniture or walls or ceiling or whatever. Your goal is to remove the infestation while making as few mistakes as possible.
oom36h|A hero shooter/platform fighter hybrid|I'll list down the elements the game uses from each genre\n\nTeam Shooter:\n\nObjective-oriented game modes (Capture the flag, Payload etc.)\n\nLarger Maps\n\nRespawn points\n\nMove cooldown (No ammo packs, it reloads by itself)\n\nTeam-based, obviously\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlatform Fighter:\n\nThird-person 2D fighting game viewpoint\n\nDirectional moves (which direction you input decides which move you use)\n\nKnockback\n\nPlatforms\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would be a mix of ranged and melee fighters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther ideas:\n\nCombo Mechanic: When you successfully land an attack the cooldown for its next use is halved.\n\nRespawn portal: When you die, you are transported to another map where you must reach a portal to respawn back into the game. Attacking enemies in this map will knock them back, which can stop them from reaching the portal
ook551|A game like Golf Clash but for math?|Thoughts on this idea:  \n\nGolf clash is amazing.  You play 1vs1 in golf holes, each player taking a turn.  The winner wins all the coins and trophies. To enter a game you need a certain amount of coins and trophies, and the higher the level the harder the holes are and the more you win.\n\nI want to take the same concept and apply it to math!  You play a random person 1vs1.  It costs X coins to enter the match, you each get asked a few questions, and the winner gets all the coins.  Coins can be used to unlock new levels, buy fun math things that help you in the game, new skins, new avatars, etc.   Can do everything from really simple arithmetic questions to more complex stuff.  \n\nI think the game could be a lot of fun to play and practice math skills, and can be used to learn and introduce new concepts. \n\nCould also be really fun to do the same thing with coding problems.  You enter random games with people and compete to solve a quick coding problem - kinda like the social network movie interview process.\n\nWhat do you think? Any feedback would be awesome!

ooc3aj|An open-world TMNT game|An open-world game based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Game mechanics could be based on *Marvel’s Spider-Man,* *Marvel’s Avengers,* and *Star Wats Jedi: Fallen Order.* It could have enemies spawning all around the place. There’d be a story and bosses as well. You’d be able to play as all four turtles, each one having customization, specifically in skins, which could be inspired by the five TV shows, all the movies, comics, and other games.

There would be ring outs and support type Battle Monsters that would make a return from both the Pokken and Tekken series. The story mode would be a whole different story altogether. It would play like a Dynasty Warriors game where you have to fight off a plethora of mechanical monstrosities while also completing various small objectives around the much bigger battle arena. This would culminate in fighting off said Battle Arena's boss, a boss which will test all your fighting game know how.
oo22eg|An FPS equivalent to Smash Bros.|Basically, a first person multiplayer deathmatch, where players can choose between famous FPS protagonists, like Doomguy, Gordon Freeman, Chell etc. and gameplay would depend on which character you play, matching their respective games, with a few minor tweaks for balance.\n\nGame Mechanic Examples:\n\nDoomguy can use the SSG's Meathook to grapple other players, but unlike Doom Eternal, the players can still still move around, but slower.\n\nGordon Freeman can use the Gravity Gun to pick up and launch props found around each map.\n\nChell can use the Portal Gun to move herself and others around the map, typically trying for environmental kills or fall damage kills. Also she doesn't take fall damage.\n\nAny thoughts on this idea? New character and mechanic suggestions perhaps?
oo18a3|Open world monster evolution game|So I thought about this for a minute now but I have a game idea that’s different so the game is a open world monster game so u start off as a weak monster who escapes a lab you must try to eat and consume humans or animals every chance you get but you will be hunted every time when you first start off you’re this humanoid small monster who must sneak around to eat on animals in the lab while you’re being hunted by security than after consuming enough you can evolve and customize what aspects you want such as armor to not take a lot of damage or claws or the ability to fly or breathe under water and you level up every chance you get by consuming and causing mayhem you will also be dealing with other monsters that escaped and must find and kill them around the city you will go form a small 4’10 monster to the size of Godzilla if you level up through the whole game
oo0il8|Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror| Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits.\n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. Here is link to google doc file with world backstory and general game idea:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAnd let me make clear one thing - I didn't go to describe all those different actual gameplay mechanics like - what exactly main character will use as his weapons, or what type of upgrade he can install, or what type of enemies game will have - yet, because the purpose of this concept is describe what exactly this game is about. I believe before you go to all technical details you should define the main idea of the game and what are you trying to say to the player.\n\nSo please let me know if you think this story is shit, or maybe you liked it but you'd change or add something. Thank you for your time!

onrlsj|A New Gen VR RPG|Hello there, thanks for droppin' by to read!   \n\n\nI am Marshal and something I desired since I've gotten a VR system was an RPG that felt right. Having multiple paths to choose, personalization(Character creation), and a good combat mechanic. The last time I played something that reminded me of my idea was Dynasty Warriors, a great RPG series. Or Conqueror's Blade, a good MMO RPG.  \n\n\nNow, my idea.   \nThis is a first person VR game. A constant throughout the game will be you will fight as the commander and you will fight alongside your troops.  Your decisions will directly affect the performance of your Army and overall Kingdom.\n\n It is a game where you play as a strategist/commander in a fictional land. You build up the character you are, such as picking the personality, looks, and even the upcoming of your family(Being a commoner or royal). After the selection there will be a tutorial explaining mechanics, how the states are at war, and side characters. Maybe even a mock battle?\n\nAfter the tutorial you will be on the road to protect your own state, talk to other states to avoid conflict, grow bonds, or declare war. Below is a list of features that the game would be based off. We will call these the "Rules and Guidelines of the Kingdom"\n\n1. Every state you fight there will be different enemies abilities, looks and equipment), aspects. The size of your army, the haul of food, and the location itself (being near a river or other geographical perks) will come into play when you converse with diplomatic personnel. \n\n2. You must make sure you do not run low on these four core things, Food, Army, Population, and Morale.\n\n3. During the conflict you may have to sacrifice one of the core items to elevate another, this would be based off your own strategy and Army construct. \n\n4. Each Army will have to equip their Army with default communications, weapons, transportation, uniforms, armor and skill level.\n\n5. You will have the ability to increase the default levels based on achievements e.g. kill streak, staying alive for a certain period of time or after a battle. These increases can be applied to any default level item. \n\n6. You will have the ability for you to play as your commander or conscript, depending on tasks and battle performance this will lower or increase your units morale. \n\n7. This game would not have levels. You will not fight to get to the next level instead you will have milestones. Once a pre determined goal is achieved you would have the option to advance your kingdom/society according to one of the four core values (Food, Army, Population and Morale).\n\n8. There will be a metric where you can marry a leader of another Army, this would create an alliance in order to share all resources of each Kingdom.\n\nEndgame Ideas:\n\n1. you will start to face harder enemies, spies and rebellions within kingdom based off in-game morale.  As Morale increases the less likely rebellions will happen and vice versa. \n\nIn the end once you have taken over all of the states the game will end with the player choosing to rather end the game at that point or continue it. If you end it there, a cut scene will appear showing the kingdom stats and then credits. If you continue the game, the game will have more rebellions and a new enemy will appear and the game will continue.
onqxwl|Assassins Creed spin-off game that plays like a combo of AC and Hitman.|The AC story wouldn’t be tainted at all by this but this idea definitely builds off of both of those titles. \n\nThe game would be called “Animus” rather than AC. For those that are unfamiliar the Animus is the machine in AC that can recreate the memories of people from the past and let you experience them as if you were actually there. \n\nIn the new Hitman World of Assassination trilogy- agent 47 finds himself in 20 different ‘destinations’ across the globe, with different targets in each. Each destination is a total sandbox, you can assassinate your targets in any way you can think. You can unlock different weapons and starting locations by mastering each destination.\n\nOk now that some of the background info is out of the way. My idea is that rather than a destination, your character goes into the animus to a certain time period. Your character would play as an ancient assassin in an ancient setting, like the coliseum or pyramids, or Great Wall of China. And you’d assassinate real people that actually lived and were assassinated, and you’d be using real historical weapons to eliminate your targets.
onqmr2|Realistic pizza delivery sim|Sounds boring at first glance but I've driven a wrx for delivery for years and I get in to a lot of street racing while delivering. I've been thinking about an idea for a more realistic not nfs type delivery game where you take deliveries but also have the chance to race people while you're at work like drags and short sprints and also after work for more cash.  \n\nI like the idea of a realistic base for money like maybe taking out a loan to buy a better car and pay the loan back at the penalty of your "heat" raising against the police or something. I have a thousand more ideas but wanted to make this post as short as possible
onlg2z|A monster hunting game, but the game is designed so that 90% of the battle is planning and preparation. No leveling up; no unlock trees; just going out into the world to get the things you'll need for the battle plan you've come up with.|I like Monster Hunter, Dauntless and a number of other monster hunting games well enough. What I *don't* like is the grind. The vast majority of those games is spent leveling up gear and stats, and picking up random ingredients strewn about the map(s). This game will replace that with something a little different.\n\nLike *Breath of the Wild* you're given one and only one objective: Defeat the END BOSS MONSTER.\n\nYou can't level up or make "stronger" gear; however, the boss monster is weak to X weapon, susceptible to Y traps, is impaired by Z poison, and it inflicts reduced damage to N armor. You'll have to defeat four different boss monsters to get the materials needed to make those items. And each of those monsters will have their own required gear that you'll need to defeat smaller monsters for.\n\nEach monster is a small puzzle. Other than the END BOSS MONSTER, you aren't told what the monsters' weaknesses are or what strategies to use. You'll have to figure them out on your own by observing them, stalking them, researching/asking about them in town, and by fighting them underprepared to test out strategies. Once you have it figured out, you gather your gear, drink some expensive temporary buffs and put your strategy to the test.\n\nIt's important to point out that no gear makes you stronger, per se. You can only beat monsters through smarter strategies and better skill.

onh6i7|Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror|Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits. \n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. So let's go:\n\n**The Long Road** \- game about space truckers adventure.\n\n*Main idea*\n\nDefine for yourself - what do you understand as a reality? Would you agree to live in a world of dreams, live through adventure, experience all emotions and be ok with it knowing that it's all going inside high-tech VR machine? Life is a process of getting experience and emotions. Any emotions and feelings are real for you as a person, as long as you are aware of where you are and who you are, regardless of what world you are in. So is there any difference between them?\n\n*Elevator-Pitch*\n\nHave you ever experienced derealization? Maybe even for a second couldn't understand whether you were dreaming or not? What do you say if you stay in that second forever? \n\n*Setting* \n\nFuture world. Big spaceship with a cargo going through a long journey to another stellar system. Such journeys are possible all because of the new technology which allow to a space ship use space-time shrinking to quickly travel to a long distance. But as all technologies this one have some limitations. Ship couldn't travel to  any destination though a one jump, there was a possible max distance and very long engine recharging process. But because of this, space travels which before took several dozen thousands of year now only take 20-40 years to most of the systems. Even though space travel progressed dramatically in terms of time they occupied, they still took a pretty long time for a human, so all ships aimed to travel far should have been equipped with hibernate capsules. When a ship travels during engine recharge brakes, which even with most modern models would take 5-10 years, all crew members should be passing waiting time in those capsules, and when engine recharged all crew should be awake to manually control the next jump. Jump usually took 2-5 days depending on a engine model and travel distance.\n\nIn our journey ship crew  have to deliver very important cargo from one point to another and along with it test new hibernate capsules which would allow to crew members not to lose time between jumps in unconscious dreams but use this time to experience different experience in preliminary prepared virtual sceneries to stimulate their brain activity and prevent brain degradation. This degradation was known as a "professional" sickness of space truckers. When a person spent several dozens of years in a capsule some parts of the brain were degraded too much and after a journey the whole crew had to take 1-2 year of break to restore their health to be able to travel again. New capsules should have fixed that. \n\nIt's a long journey though a cold dark space inside a tin can where you can't leave. You can't make this journey faster. \n\n*Plot and world backstory*\n\nFuture. Humanity made a breakthrough in space travel. First engine which able to affect space-time is developed. Using this engine you can make jumps through a really long distance. Thanks to this technology this was a start of a "far" space exploration era. This engine had his limitation though. You can't travel to any point in a space, just to limited maximum amount of distance. When engine was created limit was about 0.5 light years. Recharging process of that engine would take about 15 years. \n\nFirst hibernate capsules were developed a bit earlier and were used in solar system exploration travels. They also have been used on pilgrim ships - special ships with a crew who agreed to have this one-way trip to the closest star systems with habitable planets. \n\nTechnology developed with time. Humanity domesticated more and more systems with time. Engine development allowed it to increase distance but recharging times still were pretty long. Most modern engines still would take around 5 years to recharge. Private corporations \n\nplaced their production facilities over many different systems allow communities there to grow. To transport goods, supplies and people corporations tried to use autonomous trucks at first, but pretty quickly realized that during jumps the ship becomes too unstable and needs manual control. Also those trucks pretty quickly become an easy target for a space pirates. It was obvious - ships needed a crew.\n\nThat's how space truckers came to life. Small groups of people were sent on a several dozen years journey. During flight crew usually used working shifts and were always divided into groups of 2 people - pilot and engineer. When the engine recharges each group at some point has to be awake to monitor ships systems and make sure the recharging process goes without issues.\n\nIn our journey crew got new assignment from a head office.

onh0m3|Game concept / The Long Road|Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits. \n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. So let's go:\n\n**The Long Road** \- game about space truckers adventure.\n\n*Main idea*\n\nDefine for yourself - what do you understand as a reality? Would you agree to live in a world of dreams, live through adventure, experience all emotions and be ok with it knowing that it's all going inside high-tech VR machine? Life is a process of getting experience and emotions. Any emotions and feelings are real for you as a person, as long as you are aware of where you are and who you are, regardless of what world you are in. So is there any difference between them?\n\n*Elevator-Pitch*\n\nHave you ever experienced derealization? Maybe even for a second couldn't understand whether you were dreaming or not? What do you say if you stay in that second forever? \n\n*Setting* \n\nFuture world. Big spaceship with a cargo going through a long journey to another stellar system. Such journeys are possible all because of the new technology which allow to a space ship use space-time shrinking to quickly travel to a long distance. But as all technologies this one have some limitations. Ship couldn't travel to  any destination though a one jump, there was a possible max distance and very long engine recharging process. But because of this, space travels which before took several dozen thousands of year now only take 20-40 years to most of the systems. Even though space travel progressed dramatically in terms of time they occupied, they still took a pretty long time for a human, so all ships aimed to travel far should have been equipped with hibernate capsules. When a ship travels during engine recharge brakes, which even with most modern models would take 5-10 years, all crew members should be passing waiting time in those capsules, and when engine recharged all crew should be awake to manually control the next jump. Jump usually took 2-5 days depending on a engine model and travel distance.\n\nIn our journey ship crew  have to deliver very important cargo from one point to another and along with it test new hibernate capsules which would allow to crew members not to lose time between jumps in unconscious dreams but use this time to experience different experience in preliminary prepared virtual sceneries to stimulate their brain activity and prevent brain degradation. This degradation was known as a "professional" sickness of space truckers. When a person spent several dozens of years in a capsule some parts of the brain were degraded too much and after a journey the whole crew had to take 1-2 year of break to restore their health to be able to travel again. New capsules should have fixed that. \n\nIt's a long journey though a cold dark space inside a tin can where you can't leave. You can't make this journey faster. \n\n*Plot and world backstory*\n\nFuture. Humanity made a breakthrough in space travel. First engine which able to affect space-time is developed. Using this engine you can make jumps through a really long distance. Thanks to this technology this was a start of a "far" space exploration era. This engine had his limitation though. You can't travel to any point in a space, just to limited maximum amount of distance. When engine was created limit was about 0.5 light years. Recharging process of that engine would take about 15 years. \n\nFirst hibernate capsules were developed a bit earlier and were used in solar system exploration travels. They also have been used on pilgrim ships - special ships with a crew who agreed to have this one-way trip to the closest star systems with habitable planets. \n\nTechnology developed with time. Humanity domesticated more and more systems with time. Engine development allowed it to increase distance but recharging times still were pretty long. Most modern engines still would take around 5 years to recharge. Private corporations \n\nplaced their production facilities over many different systems allow communities there to grow. To transport goods, supplies and people corporations tried to use autonomous trucks at first, but pretty quickly realized that during jumps the ship becomes too unstable and needs manual control. Also those trucks pretty quickly become an easy target for a space pirates. It was obvious - ships needed a crew.\n\nThat's how space truckers came to life. Small groups of people were sent on a several dozen years journey. During flight crew usually used working shifts and were always divided into groups of 2 people - pilot and engineer. When the engine recharges each group at some point has to be awake to monitor ships systems and make sure the recharging process goes without issues.\n\nIn our journey crew got new assignment from a head office. They are getting brand new “truck” with the newest hibernate capsules. They should pick up and deliver very important cargo to a pretty distant stellar system. Along with delivery they have a "small side quest" -  test new hibernate capsules. Those brand new capsules instead of putting a person in an unconscious dream allowed him to experience different sets of emotions in prepared scenarios in order to stimulate their brain, so after a trip crew wouldn't need time to restore their health.

ojawv3|New enemies for Pacman|what new type of enemies would you come up with for Pacman?
oj8jbf|A class customization made for RP and immersing yourself in your character.|So recently, while trying to come up with new builds to do for Skyrim, (I made a Vampire Warlord. I know you didn't ask.) I had an idea for a mechanic that basically allowed you to take free range of creating a class, like Skyrim, but a bit more complex in some areas and a bit more simple in others.  \n\n\nSo here's how it would work: Most RPG's (and this mechanic is RPG focused) have the usual skill trees with perks and talents, but in this class customization, you could select three skill trees where you learn their skills faster than any other, helping to immerse yourself in your class. (For example, if you wanted to make some type of mage, you could select light armor, some form of magic, and idk let's say alchemy/potions as your three skill tree buffs.) At the start of creating your class, you would also start with a few points which you can put into these skill trees to start them off leveled up a bit. (Kind of like Neverwinter Nights or Baulder's Gate) And then you give yourself a class trait. You start out with a few basic ones, but more can be unlocked by playing the game, long quest chains, etc. These class traits would be a skill that you can only have one of to help make your class a little more unique.  \n\n\nThe last step of this class customization would be choosing from a backstory for your character which will give you certain advantages but might give you a disadvantage or two, and once again help to immerse yourself in your character. (Ex: Like if your chosen backstory was farmer, you would have advantages in eating and medium/light armor but would have a slight disadvantage when it came to magic/spells). Some of these backstories would start the player off in a new area leading to a new intro and possibly a few short side quests, although they could lead back to the main story. These backstories could also be unlocked by playing the game, as in, beating story arcs, long quest chains, beating the game (and getting different endings if the devs are into that) etc. Maybe you can make your own backstory with it's own lore but it would have the normal starting area and not give any advantages or disadvantages.  \n\n\nTo wrap up, you name your class and go on your way. This type of class customization would be fantastic (although, I will agree it likely needs some fine tuning) for RPG games. The unlockable class traits and backstories could possibly add lots of replay value to the game, something devs usually hope to give players the experience of, without making the game feel unfair at the start. This type of class customization could also give players a lot of creativity and power over what type of story they want to play. It could now be easier to play the demonic villain, it could now be easier to play someone with a hate for the undead, it could now be easier to play an old grumpy mage hermit, etc etc. and truly immerse yourselves into these roles. (The only thing that would make this perfect is if more modern RPG's had vast dialogue trees like older D&amp;D games) I won't ever be making this (I never could get into programming, I tried four times) but I hope someone does someday. It would be ***magnificent*** \[insert Italian hand emoji\] .
oj8g1f|Racing Royal|This game seems very simple to imagine and yet I have never seen a game like this anywhere. The Battle Royal mechanic has been overused and yet almost every game looks the same. A good way to revolutionize this type of game is I think via a Battle Royal racing game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Racing Royal the race is drawn as the game goes on, in an Open World city. The player closest to the head of the race is the first, the closest to the first is the second, the closest to the second is the third and so on until the last. Every 10 (20 or 30) seconds the last one in the race is eliminated. Players can choose not to follow the race route, to take shortcuts or to collect upgrades that appear all over the map. The winner of the race is the last person still driving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you know a game that look like this I would realy like to play it.
oj5wbu|FP GAME IDEA|Hey Guys I'am looking for a first person game idea. So far I've only got cutting tree's with an axe on my game. I was rhinking about a chicken killer game, but I don't know how I can make a game about that, any ideas?
oj5uu1|A game where you primarily play as Venom|I think that Sony and PlayStation are missing out by making an M-Rated Venom video game. The game would feature a younger Eddie Brock when he just gets the symbiote and after being embarrassed/humiliated by Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The game's Story would have a symbiote who is experienced with combat and other powers from other past hosts before Peter put it under containment allowing players to have many other powers to play with in an open world sandbox with many great action locals to destroy/play with. It would have a story where Eddie uses the suit to track down super villians and Spider-Man along with saving the city from a massive threat of a symbiote invasion or a robotic take over and eventually teaming up with all the heroes/villians he has faced throughout is story. The main feature I would want to implement to not have to warrant a skill tree would be the decision to spare the Heroes/villians you encounter to help you with the final confrontation or to consume the hero/villian and have more powers to use in the final confrontation. This final confrontation would be either Doc Ock or Spider-Man with his own symbiote (either carnage after realizing there would be no one to kill if Venom would win or some other symbiote that would actually have good intentions). The game would have 5 different endings. One where you stop Doc Ock. One where you see the good side in Doc Ock's plan and help him. One where you kill Spider-Man and cause a symbiote invasion using the radioactive part of Spider-Man's blood to multiply the amount of symbiotes creating "Venom Country". And one where you stop to reconsider what you have just done and let Spider-Man bring you to justice. The Last ending would be where you free Carnage from a mental institute and go on a killing spree all throughout the big apple. A carnage DLC would be something I would love to add to the game along with a Silver Sable DLC where you hunt Venom down. Of course Rated-M for drug abuse, Intense violence, blood and gore, and strong language. The game should be made by Insomniac, Rocksteady, and Neversoft. Tell me what you all think in the comments!
oj1fdd|Giving directions simulator|The core concept is a game centred around giving directions to passerbys through hand gestures (or any other form of cardinal direction) around a small open world city. \n\nPersonally, I'm imagining it as a rainy night in a small, dingy city. Most of the light coming from streetlamps and the signs on clubs and restaurants. Occasionally, various NPCs stop you on your way around town to ask you for directions to the aforementioned clubs and restaurants. The core mechanic would be to do your best to familiarize yourself with the city and point the NPCs in the right direction using only cardinal directions.  e.g '' Take a left, then another left, then a right, then straight until you reach Club Flamingo''\n\nAs for further ideas, I'd encourage creative freedom, there's a few ways a game with those mechanics could go. High score/reputation system/infinite walking simulator/social sim, etc.\n\nWould like to hear your own thoughts/ideas here.

oiwvil|3v1 Groovy TPS|There are 4 players(3v1) in a 3D space. 3 of the players are the hackers or “ disablers” and the other the powerful  “firewall” system, programmed to protect the AI core at the center of the map. This player will have access to the security system of the facility. They control guards, enable turrets release traps and more to try and stop the disablers. Disablers will have abilities they can use to defend and heal their teammates or to attack and disable the firewall. every round, players can improve their skills and equipment, and the AI can upgrade its system.  The Disablers team wins a match by shutting down the core, and the Firewall can win by successfully defending until the time has run out, or killing all of the Disablers.  The game is finished when one team wins three rounds . There are a number of characters with unique abilities to choose from. \n\nVisuals:\nThe game and characters will have a minimalistic and colorful retro design based on 70s sci-fi with heavy psychedelic influence. Dark humor and blood. \n“How would the world look If AI was invented in the 70s”
oiv6ap|Druid mechanic|This could work for all sorts of games but I think an mmo would be the most fun.\n\nThe druid archetype is often associated with nature and shape-shifting. My idea takes it to another level. Imagine if you could shape-shift into passive entities (like a horse or a tree) and blend into the environment.\n\n This could allow for creative gank setups on players, removing aggro from hostile mobs, or even integrate into some quests.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are?
oio6i8|I need help with story premise|I have a concept for the game: player appears in a city at night, you can head distant urban noises and lights in windows, but you can't see a single soul around. Sort of liminal space city. I see it as a horror game (not screamers&amp;chases horror but rather one with heavy intimidating atmosphere, possible without screamers or enemies at all)\n\nI came up with this recently and I liked it, so I'd really like to make some short intermediate-level game. But the problem is that I just can't think of anything decent other than cliche "it's in your head and the character is actually in coma irl"
oin45a|Voxel-based, chemistry focused terraforming simulator on an alien planet.|Soil management is complicated. You need the three basics like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, etc... but also a ton of other micro and macro nutrients. They're hard enough to come by on earth, but on an alien world they might be even harder!\n\nYou start off on a barren, but reasonably earth-like planet. You scan some rocks near water and that get some sunlight. You add lichen, and watch it break down the rock. Rain falls and washes away the broken down rocks, which then add nutrients to the voxels below.\n\nKeep going until you have enough nutrients that you can add nitrogen fixing bacteria to the ground below. \n\nThen you move onto mosses, etc... and eventually turn the planet green!
oin3st|Hunger Games but you’re the Head Gamemaker|This idea has been in my head for a while. I found out that I love management games but I also enjoy some hack and slash. But imagine if you could do both. Here’s my idea:\nYou’re a Head Gamemaker in Panem and it’s your job to create a Hunger Games worthy of broadcast. Imagine if you could decide the arena. Turn it into a desert! An arctic! Or a city! It could be those like sandbox-y Planet Coaster-esque retraining but the tributes actually interact with it. You could decide which weapons are available. You get info on the tributes and can tailor it as suited. You could cause effects such as the fire in Hunger Games, or the clock in Catching Fire (might be a bit much haha but still)\n\nMAYBE you could even watch like tribute showcases, give scores and stuff based on their attributes.\n\nI was even thinking about like mutts and the sort. Imagine if you could do something like genetically engineer mutts, make can go for a specific tribute, etc, give them features. You can choose where to release them. Perhaps as the Games progresses, you get an entertainment rating, etc. Or like maybe you could do something with the tribute parade, and interviews etc. \n\nThis would be micro management on a whole other level. \n\nAt the end of the game you could get like an overall entertainment rating, how much people enjoy the Games, etc those things. \n\nOof I’m getting really excited haha
oimx3w|Arcade soccer game with some Mario Kart vibe|Hello there, here is a simple idea I got as some soccer tournaments just ended this week, I would like your opinion/thoughts about that, so any comment would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nMy main references are Super Mario Strikers and Rocket League, as you can play with small teams in quite small stadiums, the action is quite fast and the style quite arcade. The idea would be to remain in a cartoon style and throw some funny situations along the game. Something like Kopanito but in a smaller arena, with maybe less characters and of course much more items (in addition of the ultimate that needs to be charged over time), and why not some arena random behaviors (for example mole invasion), or some weather effect with real impact on the game (like a tornado, or thunderbolts).  \nWhy soccer/football ? Just because it's the current most popular sport, and it allows simpler graphics (for example a character can have the same animation while running with or without the balloon), but if you think about any other "sport" feel free to post it.  \nAs in Mario Kart, not only the skill should reward the player, but also smart plays with the items. They can be used either defensively or offensively, but friendly fire is enabled so it should be used wisely. As the game takes place in an arena, some AoE spells could also be added, but still with non lethal stuff, the game should remains suitable for all audiences. A hit character is only pushed a bit in the air, or is stunned for a bit, then can start play again.  \nOf course there would not be any referee, so players are free to unleash they ferocity. Maybe the goal keeper could be non playable and should dodge all attacks to avoid any cheat. Moreover, the arena is closed, so the ball bounces on sides to avoid any free time for the player (which would be compensated by quick games of several minutes).  \n\n\nFinally, I think there should not be any "stats" on the players or the team, which leads to some frustration of "you won only because you picked this team/character", only cosmetic differences. Maybe only the ultimate could be based on the character, but then the balancing should be perfect.  \n\n\nSo what do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
oij8b1|game idea, "EXTERMINATOR"|in this game, there are 4 roles  \nThe exterminator  \nmust kill a specific player on the map. every 15 seconds they get an update on the players position, and is a robot. so can only die from heavy fire, explosions, extreme heat. if the exterminator is hit by anything that wont kill it. it will either withstand it, or will be knocked over taking no damage for either.  \nThe citizen  \neither the hero, or a nobody.\n\nThe Hero  \nthe player the exterminator must kill to win the game. the hero doesn't know he is the hero,\n\nThe Protector,   \nthis player comes into the game with a grenade, and some heavy ammo. no gun. \n\nGuns randomly spawn around the map, \n\nif the hero dies AT ALL. its exterminator victory. if the exterminator dies at all. everyone else wins.
oig7hx|VR Multiplayer Zombie Golf - Expanding on an Earlier Idea|Original : “A golf game, but in a zombie apocalypse world. You have guns and golf clubs.\n\nFend off approaching zombies to get your golf shot off. The closer the zombies get, the harder it is to hit the golf ball the way you want, because you get scared and shake more with decreased distance between you and the zombies.””\n\nYou can shoot the zombies, set traps, or hit them with your clubs if they get close enough.” Credit: u/Jfonzy\n\nI like this idea a lot and just got an oculus quest 2 and would like to start working with it keeping in mind I’m a solo developer. The addition of vr allows for wacky physics that add a lot to the overall experience. Multiplayer is the same deal as a lot of the fun comes from the players themselves. For example, instead of working together to fend off the zombies to help your teammate golf you could use them to your advantage as a distraction. Of course single player would also be available with a campaign of sorts. From a development perspective it’s appealing as the gameplay would be, no pun intended, par for the course for a vr game, shooting and swinging. This is labeled as a request as I like the core concept but need some input on a clearer idea of specific game modes, what a campaign would look like, and generally what you would what to see in a game like this.

oie41t|Help with a game mechanic|Ello'. I wanted to develop a short project, and challenge myself by using a game engine with a ton of limitations. The game idea I settled upon was a short top-down game in which enemies would be following you, and you have to destroy them and score points by making two or more enemies collide. Sort of based of the ancient myth of the labyrinth of Crete. When I was doing a bit of research, I came upon a game called Catch Me, by a dev named T1mBer. Unfortunately, the game's concept and visual style was highly similar to what I had planned. (Note that this game was made before I even came up with the idea so they didn't steal the idea, and I just found out about the game days before writing this, so I didn't steal anything either.) This brings me to my question. Does any one have any game mechanics or features that could differentiate this game so it doesn't feel like a blatant copy? Also, the game can only use the keys W, A, S, D, I, J, K, L, O, U, SPACE, and ENTER, and no mouse controls. Its a limitation of the engine. \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nOmnis316

oiaek3|VR Slasher Game (You are the Slasher)|This is a single player and multiplayer game. You can play with bot victims/prey or people victims. If playing multiplayer then the victims have to perform tasks (clean the house, house sit, go to work) until they encounter the slasher. (They will hear a heart beat when the slasher is close) ig single player then the Ai does this automatically.\n\nAt the start of the game (not startup) you get to create your slasher. You can choose your weapon; claws, knife, axe, etc. each one has its own stats, buffs and de-buffs (The claws do massive damage but are short range and you are unable to pick up objects that aren’t the “prey”, the axe has long range, does high damage but is slower and has weight to slow you down, but it can be dropped). Your costume can also have buffs and rebuffs as well. You want to be a Clown? Most people may be suspicious of you if you are in a certain area, but it could also lure out a few people as well to make for easy targets. You want to have a similar costume to Ghost face? (Phantom) You can run faster, especially with a knife or claws, you are also harder to detect in the dark and have a bullet resistant vest so you have more health, however if you get spotted and are unable to react you become instantly hunted. \n\nThe goal is that in each level you have certain victims you have to kill (kind of like Hitman), you can kill any NPC though. There is no time limit, however there are police who will try to stop you if they get alerted. They won’t know where you are at all times, but if they figure out your targets they may try to bring them to a safe house making them harder to kill. (There is a pattern and you have to try to make sure you don’t leave clues and keep your pattern hidden)\n\nThere could be levels that you can go through, or instead have an open world dynamic somehow with a survival mode and day cycle with a story. The levels can have their own story.\n\nMisc mechanics; you can drop your weapons (aside from claws) and pick up other weapons you find through the map if you so choose. You can use the environment to get kills, i.e. bricks, walls, sharp objects that are in the environment. The victims may know you depending on the level, so you get bonus points if you “reveal” yourself by removing the mask and showing them your face before you kill them. If they escape while doing that and they go to the police it is game over. After each level you can level up your equipment and costumes and skills.\n\nI’m not a game designer, but i personally play them and would love to see this.
oi9bc1|Language Civ Game|A simplistic cutesy civilization, god sim type game with different regions or continents. The main mechanic, and hardest to add, has to do with language. You start of with English (Common) or whatever languages you feel comfortable adding as the first and common language. Every person starts off in the same area, continent or region. These people will create a nation with a language. As people expand and move off the main language will start to change or have slang. (There could be a rough translation). This could be done via a random word generator using simple word structures than will occasionally replace words in the common language throughout different nations or regions, even religions if you want to get fancy and add that. The starting region is least likely to change, you can put in a mechanic such as it’s more likely to change depending on how many times people have moved or split off, locations, types of plants or wildlife in an area. If a region gets invaded then their language may become more common in that area. As a player you can get a rough translation as we’ll if that is possible to put in the game. The rest is up to you to do whatever you want with.
oi85ss|The Scapegoat: A Bronze Age action rpg where you’re a Goatman combatant.|Feel free to use this idea, or add to it.\n\nStory:  A nomadic tribe in 1,000 BC had a ritual to “cleanse” themselves of their sins. During the year, they sinned constantly. They sinned against each other, and against other tribes and nations. At the end of the year, their “holy man” performed the ritual to transfer all of their sins onto a goat. The goat was then stoned to death by the people, and the tribespeople cheered, believing that they have cleansed themselves and destroyed the evil.  The bad news is that you were the goat. The good news is that God was so angry by this that He resurrected you as a Goatman (or Goatwoman), so that you can travel the world and strike down evil!\n\nGameplay: The game can begin in any part of the world, which can either be chosen by you or chosen randomly by the computer. The view is 3rd person, and the camera angle can be manipulated to show any view that you want. Each part of the world has many areas for you to explore and do battle in.  As you defeat enemies, you gain experience, get better stats (hit points, strength, dexterity, and magic), and acquire gold that you can buy items with. Since you’re not human, many merchants won’t do business with you, so you will need to diplomatically find merchants that will work with you.  In parts of the world where gold money is not yet used, you can barter with merchants. Character level should go to 100.\n\nCharacter creation:  You can choose your gender (males have horns and females don’t, and their voices sound different). The available character classes are warrior (strength based), rogue (dexterity based), mage (intelligence based) or cleric (wisdom based).  You can also choose your fur color and eye color.\n\nAppearance and speech: Your Goatman or woman should look like a hominoid goat: [http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/\_\_cb20131110134033/cryptidz/images/thumb/1/1f/Satyr.jpg/316px-Satyr.jpg](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131110134033/cryptidz/images/thumb/1/1f/Satyr.jpg/316px-Satyr.jpg)\n\nThe speech should sound like human speech mixed with the “baa” sound that goats make.\n\nSkills:  Warriors, rogues, mages, and clerics should have skills similar to those in other role playing games. Warriors and rogues both use stamina to execute their moves, and mages and clerics use magic points to cast their spells. Stamina and magic points regenerate over time, and you can gain items that facilitate faster regeneration.\n\nGear:  As you defeat enemies, you acquire better armor, weapons (swords, spears, clubs, axes, staves, etc.), rings, amulets, helms, gloves, and other items. Basically, the gear is similar to those found in other rpgs, but the metallic weapons would be bronze instead of iron.  Healing potions and herbs can be found throughout the game, and can also be bought. Sleep heals you a bit as well.\n\nFood and water:  Goats and Goatpeople are herbivores, so you can either buy food or water or simply eat vegetation and drink from freshwater sources.  You will need to stock up before spending lots of time in desert regions.\n\nTransportation:  You start the game on foot, but you can acquire horses or camels to get around faster.\n\nEnemies: Most of the game, you will be fighting with evil humans all over the world, and also with wild animals that attack you. The one that decides to make this game could also incorporate demons or other evil creatures into the game.  Enemies in each region regenerate, but bosses don’t.\n\nEndgame:  Once you have completed all of the objectives in each region of the world, you will need to defeat an evil cult. Somewhere in the world (which could be randomly chosen by the computer for each game), there is an evil religion forming that masquerades as something good. You must enter their citadel and defeat them.  The final boss is an evil cleric in league with the Devil.\n\nFeel free to chime in with your own ideas on how to develop this idea.
oi5czk|New Multiplayer Sword Fighting Game!|[removed]
oi512u|"Choose-your-own-adventure" video game, through a 3D book|Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about after finding some old books called "Choose-your-own-adventure", where you build your own adventure based on all the choices you're making while playing. I'm thinking about ways to turn it into a video game, by adding some RPG elements, but finding the good balance between random generation and hand-made stuff is hard to reach, so a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nMy main references are Hand of Fate and Slay The Spire, where the game design perfectly handles the repetitiveness of all the plays, despite always playing with the same cards against the same opponents.  \n\n\nSo in my mind I would go into a "real" book that the player opens. There would be a class selection, so the player would have to play differently based on its choice. As the main game loop, a random "encounter" is chosen and displayed/drawn on the left page, with a basic illustration and some text. Then on the right appear all the choices the player can make, that can vary based on previous choices, chosen character class, owned items, ... When the selection is made, dices are thrown, then the next page turns to display the result. These "encounters" are chosen randomly each time the player chooses this book. But there won't be always a "good" and a "wrong" choice, so the choice to make doesn't depend on the result it gives but on the current situation. At the end, if it's a linear story, player has to go through X encounters, else after getting some requirements, the last "encounter" appears automatically.  \n\n\nTo add more content, I would like to add some "action" into the game, like Hand of Fate did with the realtime combats. In my case, the camera would go lower on the book, then some models would pop up from it (like with real pop up books) in a paper style (so 2D sprites on top of the 3D book, like in Paper Mario games), but I still don't know what gameplay could fit here (adding cards and go to a Slay the Spire style could work, so the "characters" could remain static, but it feels quite easy to go that way).  \n\n\nI also thought about adding a online multiplayer system, where sometimes the choice has to be taken quickly, so the first one taking a decision would actually select the choice. Adding social aspect in RPG games often leads to funny situations, specially when players are going RP.  \n\n\nIdeally, adding also a story creator tool could help bring new content to the game over time, and people would be able to create any story (so not only Heroic Fantasy style), even if I'm afraid it's too much work as many encounters need to be added, the more content there is the more replayability will be added...  \n\n\n What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
oi4gn4|A Bomberman-like in full 3D with some RPG elements|Hello there, I would like to begin a new personal project to improve my skills on Unity 3D, so I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about since I replayed some retro Genesis games (in this case Mega Bomberman), I'm still trying to find new ways to improve the main gameplay, so a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nSo the main base is Bomberman, there are several players in a "fixed" area (meaning no camera movement, for readability purpose), and the last survivor wins the game. I would like to go into full 3D (so 3D graphics but also 3D gameplay), like Bomberman 64 did, to take advantage of it and build 3D levels with some relief.  \n\n\nOne thing I'm not sure about is the fact that players can be killed by explosions, I would go more into a "Smash Bros" style where the players need to be kicked from the arena. So one explosion pushes the character in the air in a ragdoll style, then after a few time he wakes up and can move again. Maybe in some cases it could be good to explode hisself, like the rocket jump in Team Fortress 2, to go on higher platforms, for example to pick a bonus. Also the overtime could be the arena sides falling into the void little by little.\n\n  \nI would keep rocks or any other obstacle to destroy to seek bonuses, but I would go with various items to not only go with classic bomb amount and bomb explosion radius, for example ice bombs to freeze a player, or walking bombs that seeks the closest player in the arena, or any other common spell we can see in RPG games. The idea is to bring as much gameplay varieties into the game to make the party quite unique every time.  \n\n\nAlso I thought about bringing some life to the arenas, like active arena behaviors to give a bit of randomness, or random NPCs who try to defend their area. The activation of the behaviors would be linked to the explosion amount, or the explosion area, to stick to something immersive.  \n\n\nFinally, to balance a bit the game so it's not only based on skill, passive abilities could be choosen by the first killed player on each play (or 3 skills for the players who lost, the first one to die is the first one to choose which one he wants), to help him survive longer the next game against better players.  \n\n\n What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
oi3cvh|Concept of arcade game| \n\nConcept\n\nHello, friends!\n\nI would like to share the concept of a small arcade game for mobile devices, which I recently started working on. I will be glad if there are those who want to read a small description below and say something about what they have read!\n\nThis is a simple arcade session game in which the player will have to control the wind currents with the help of a touchscreen, carrying a small ice crystal across the winter sky, which turns into a beautiful snowflake during the game session. The snowflake is very fragile, so the wind have to blow on it very carefully, otherwise it may break and the game will end. The longer the player manages to keep the snowflake in flight, the more victory points he will get. I want to make a concise and relatively simple game, the purpose of which will be a set of points, but the gameplay will not be limited exclusively to collecting the necessary items for this, as in most similar arcades.\n\n**Theme:** In essence, this is a game about achieving and maintaining balance. The player must score as many points as possible. There are two ways to do this : by creating a beautiful and fragile snowflake that easily breaks in the air flow, but allows you to score points faster, or by creating a not very beautiful, but strong snowflake that will last longer in the atmosphere, but brings less points. I will tell you more about this below, in the section about mechanics.\n\n**Game mechanics:**\n\n**Scoring of points:** From the beginning of the game session, the player begins to receive victory points. The longer the game session lasts, the more victory points he will get. Snowflake falls from top to bottom. If it did not crash from the player's careless actions, the player receives victory points for each unit of time (second) of flight. If it crashes, the game session ends.\n\n**Control of a snowflake:** The player cannot control a snowflake directly by moving it across the screen using a finger movement on the touch screen. Instead, it can create gusts of wind by moving along the touchscreen in the right direction, which affect the snowflake and make it fly to the right place. Or not to fly where you don't need to. At the same time, a very clear control of movements is necessary so that the gust is smooth - too sharp a finger movement on the touchscreen will create a very strong wind that can destroy a snowflake.\n\n**Changing the characteristics of a snowflake:** The snowflake has two conditional characteristics - "beauty”, which increases the speed of scoring points and "strength”, which increases the stability of the snowflake before external influences. Increasing the value of one characteristic automatically reduces the value of another. At the same time, the player does not see the values themselves in the form of numbers, the snowflake on the screen only changes visually. If it grows new rays and takes on a more complex shape, the speed of scoring points increases. If the rays become thicker and simpler in shape, the speed of scoring decreases, but the snowflake is better able to withstand sharp gusts of wind.\n\n**Warm and cold zones:** The characteristics of a snowflake change when it hits warm and cold zones on the screen, which are visually marked as clouds of different colors. "Warm" clouds increase the characteristic of beauty, and cold clouds increase the characteristic of strength. With the help of wind gusts, the player needs to direct a snowflake into these clouds or bypass them if the player believes that he does not need their effect at the moment.\n\n**Air vortices:** In addition to warm and cold zones, there are air vortices on the screen, which are dangerous by default, and they need to be avoided in any case, because if a snowflake hits them, it can collapse. A snowflake with high strength, however, is able to fly through them for some time, however, not constantly - at some point it will still collapse.\n\n**Random gusts of wind:** In order to push the player to make quick decisions that at the same time require careful movements, there are random gusts of wind in the game. They occur if the player does not do anything for a few seconds and takes a snowflake in a random direction. Such gusts of wind cannot destroy a snowflake by themselves, however, they can drive it into an air vortex or lead it away from the desired trajectory. For example, if a snowflake just fell into the cloud that the player needed, and he waited until it just flew through it.\n\n**References:**\n\nThinking through this concept, I was inspired by mobile games in which control is carried out using a touchscreen, and which often require a quick response to what is happening on the screen and at the same time success depends on the accuracy of the player's movements. These are games like Fruit Ninja, [Hole.io](https://hole.io/) or Twisty road. At the same time, I wanted the player to have the opportunity to choose the tactics of passing the game session. He can rely on reliability and get fewer points in exchange for the fact that the game will forgive him more mistakes or take risks to get more points. Or look for a balance between these two extremes.\n\nThis is my idea, thank you to everyone who took the time to get acquainted with it! I hope you will find something to say about what you have read - I will be glad to receive any feedback.

ohw0rz|Forest Ranger "HOG"|Basically, it's less of a game, as a big open forest you can walk through and enjoy the scenery. The actual gameplay is collection. You hit a key, or right click to take snapshots of animals or birds in the trees, on the ground, or flying (these will be random, and they'll fly/scamper all over, and likely the most difficult bit in the game), collect bugs, stones, seeds, and maybe seashells if you put it near a shore.\n\nEssentially, you're something like a park ranger, or at least someone living in the woods interested in collection. You've got cupboards full of empty jars, and empty photo albums to fill. Any item, or pic of a new animal gets saved (you can swap with better photos if you get one).\n\nThat's just about it. It's a nice peaceful game about enjoying nature, and collecting stuff in your path. The object is to collect everything. No monsters. Nothing to kill.
ohu2wz|A game where you play as a team of androids that pulls off heists.|So I've gotta give a lot of credit for this idea to the animated short called Blindspot from Netflix's mostly excellent sci-fi anthology Love, Death, and Robots.  The short follows 4 heavily armed robots trying to heist the contents of this train like semi-truck.  As I rewatched this one, it suddenly occurred to me that there was a lot that could be done with this.  I recommend checking it out to see if you see the same potential I do. \n\nThe art direction has a cell shaded, cartoony, and video game-esque type of charm, somewhat reminiscent of something like Borderlands.   I feel like that is the perfect kind of look for something like this.  As for the premise, we are a group of robot super-thieves.  The focus of the short is this rookie character, but I could see swapping through them throughout the campaign (probably even mid-mission, or co-op 4P).  What're we doing?  Pulling off heists to get more money, to get more gear and abilities, to go on bigger heists.  \n\nMechnically, I'm imagining it being a third person game with each character having unique specialties (shooter, brawler, demo, etc.).  I feel like one of the biggest potential opportunities here is that they're chasing a fast moving vehicle.  This should be somewhat of a recurring thing.  To do this, they have these cars with open tops which they can set to autopilot and jump up onto the train.  Gameplaywise, this could have some interesting opportunities.  \n\nImagine summoning your car to quickly escape a near death situation by retreating behind your teammates.  Imagine being able to give your car quick little commands which improve the odds for you.  For example, you could tell it to position on the right side of the rail car you're on top of and bump into it.  If you combine that with the character doing it having the ability to anchor himself to the roof, it might send guards who are shooting at you flying off while you remain in place.  You could also work in more "augmented reality" abilities, like locking onto someone in your line of site, and it's the car that shoots a missile at that reticle. You might even be able to perform team vehicle attacks which do things like set trip wires or spike traps.  \n\nThe first several missions should either be ground or car chase based.  Eventually though, with enough money earned, I think purchasing single rider water and air vehicles could add new dimensions of complexity and variety.  I also like the idea of a respawn system where you don't fail a mission until all 4 characters die, but you don't get that character back until you fail or quit.    \n\nI've thought a bit about a story too, if anyone cares.  I feel like it could be interesting if it's never really addressed where they came from or how they were created or anything for a long time.  It's just merc buds havin a good time.  Then, second or third act, all the money they've heisted is stolen from them by someone.  Turns out it's the creator, of course.  He made robots that could heist for him to insulate himself from risk, and his plan was always to kick back, monitor them, and take their pile when the time was right.  So, naturally, ya rally together, and go on a mission to kill dad.
ohsfz2|Fighting Super intelligent evil Dinosaurs in Prehistoric times with futuristic laser weapons from a highly advanced Venus.|Long ago before time began, the Venusians ruled the solar system on their sunset ringed planet. \n\nIn all their wonder and creation, they had slowed their plant’s day cycle to a 1/3 of solar year. They knew that it wouldn’t be long for their world to go through catastrophic climate collapse, and bring forth their own extinction. \n\nFire and ice encircled their world as they escaped towards a new planet, Earth. This planet was ruled by another species known as the Dinosaurs who wanted nothing more than to claim their place as kings of the soul star, a magic crystal in the middle of our solar system(Sol) they believed was the source of all life and power, that the Venusians used to give themselves magic.\n\nAs the Venusians landed on earth, they were betrayed by their subjects. Instead of offering them shelter as refugees, the Dinosaurs began to kill as many as they could. They meant to destroy the Venusians and finish their extinction. \n\nThe Venusians took up arms against the Dinosaurs, and that is the premise of the game.\n\n- You play as a Venusian Survivor\n\n- the setting is prehistoric jungle in epically big proportions. \n\n- all the enemies are gigantic and absolutely terrifying. Like, piss your pants terrifying. They are bigger than you, stronger than you, and faster than you without your technology.\n\n- your technology makes you a demigod, you are superhuman. Able to run and jump faster and stronger than any human ever could with cybernetic robot parts. \n\n- your lasers weapons go pew pew, but in a very loud terrifying way. Your weaponry is like electricity on steroids, as is all very bright lasers and plasma.\n\n- as the dinosaurs can kill you in one shot, so can you with one or two on them, but there are a lot more of them. You are always outnumbered and on your toes, blasting and running as fast as you can to the end of the level. \n\n- the end of the level is the goal. You want to reach it in order to survive, but hidden side objectives would be hidden along the way at greater difficulty to get but could alter the story in small ways(which side characters survive).\n\n- multiple endings based on how you played through the story, each one offering a different level of happy ending to unhappy ending. in either case, humanity survives by someone blowing up a Super-Nuke that has the explosive potential of an asteroid hitting earth. Final level involves fighting through hell on earth, similar to the Venus Home-world, but recoverable. Except for the Dinosaurs that get wiped out.\n\n- all weapons are bright and shiny tech in an otherwise horrifying and dark landscape. \n\n- The Animals that the Venusians brought with them look mythical, like unicorns and gryphons, and there could be an epic boss fight against a giant red dragon while riding a unicorn and shooting laser beams that go PEEEOWMZzzzz! \n\n- and the leader of the Dinosaurs are the Dragons. Dragons are absolutely the main antagonist to the game I’ve just now decided. They’re the Lords of the Dinosaurs, the masterminds behind the plot to overthrow the Venusians. \n\n- the Venusians look like robotic angels, because of course they do. Get a real hell VS heaven vibe in there. Good vs evil. \n\n- upgradeable kit and armour\n\n- interesting game mechanic, but you could always have a couple NPC teammates with you that you can also upgrade and lose in the story. \n\n- epic 80’s style synth music similar to Farcry 3 Blood Dragon. TWRP would probably rock it and be my first choice. \n\nI just smoke a bowl of Cannabis about a half hour ago so I hope this is coherent, but that would be my dream game. \n\nA Sci-fi shooter in a story driven narrative similar to the first 3 Halo’s but with upgrades and progression to yourself and your kit along the way, with interesting side characters(or pets) the player will connect with and not want to lose.\n\n—-\n\nOn an unrelated note, i love Farcry 3 Blood dragon. Anyone who’s ever played that game knows exactly the kind of setting I want lol
ohs1gi|Pet Sim + Procedural Survival|In this game, you play as a robot whose goal is to raise cute, fuzzy aliens. You have landed on a new planet with these aliens in eggs. You must prepare their home, allow them to hatch, and then keep them alive and happy. To do this, you collect resources, build structures, and construct other robots to help you with this task.\n\nThe player themselves is immortal and is able to survive just about anything -- but the aliens you are raising are squishy, fragile and quite dumb. They do pretty much what they want and might end up getting into hijinks or dying. There are hostile monsters on this world which would like to eat them as well.\n\nThe aliens are cute, and very individualized. Perhaps they look something like furbies. They have special coats, different colored eyes, make different noises, and have different "personality types." The player can name them. Eventually they grow up and lay eggs of their own, and then "fly away" as adults, perhaps even growing wings.\n\nThe robots/systems you build to keep your alien colony alive are quite simple -- either mining or moving resources, acting as defense or alarms, or fulfilling the specific need of the alien creatures. Think something like Factorio in terms of the kinds of components you hook together.
ohrdmv|Dual narrative ww2 dream|It's literally a dream, I don't expect anyone to really take any inspiration from this, I just want to see how the idea will do.\nGameplay:\nBasically, its like an optional multiplayer campaign or you can play as a solo campaign, but it's you design and customise from like 1 to 4 or something characters(soldiers) and their loud outs, and each time you die that character dies and you have to choose another character in multiplayer, and in solo your entire squad  plays(as AI) and you can switch person before missions, so you can have different loud outs. I'd imagine you'd have to water down the difficulty a bit and have regular healing points and refill points, and it'd be a bit like Republic commando where you can direct squad mates.\nSetting:\nSo the setting would be for campaign one would be an allied story where its either French or Polish resistance and I don't mean to seem ignorant in just mixing them but I really can't decide. Anyway it'd be guerilla warfare, like stealth and blowing up bridges/assassinating important figures or destroying people and if you break the stealth than you'd have to deal with repercussions like going underground or getting parachuted out, or you could have the alternative of running of with guns or money shipped in and going on the run from the allies and the axis. For campaign 2 you are part of the elite trained chinese NRA 88th division. You are no one, you are just a regular private and it would make sure you can't kill an entire Japanese division and you have to keep cover or die. This would have the option of betraying but eventually in 1945 you are shamed and probably hung or desert where you have to go on the run. Campaign 3 is an axis perspective, a bit like the last tiger from battlefield 5 and you go from the start of d day starting to see Normandy fall and then capturing the desperate feeling of the German people of Berlin in 1945.

ohj3kz|Horror game that pits players against mutant hippies in the Southern California desert.|Won't get much into the lore I have in mind but to put it simply :: 60s Hippie Movement -&gt; Manson Family Type Shit -&gt; Drug Experimentation Gone Wrong -&gt; Hills Have Eyes\n\nThe gameplay should be very 'pick up and play.' You start a game, you have a cast of 6 characters (who may or may not all be part of or roadies for a touring rock band) each have a unique ability to help you escape or defeat this cult. A character dies, they're dead. You can still progress but it is more difficult without the deceased characters' abilities. Key items, map layout, and cult member appearances are randomized each time you play.\n\nStory is limited. Players may find bits of lore throughout the world but I don't want cutscenes to break up the casualness of the experience. Also weapons are scarcely available and serve so the player can defend against 'followers' of the cult family who do not possess the mutant strength the core members of the cult possess. The violence in gamw would have to be tiptoeing the limits to give it that 70s grindhouse feel.\n\nMultiple ways out. Escape or find a way to kill this hippie cult. \n\nTL;DR - Rob Zombie + RE7 + Dark Pictures Anthology

ol8s2o|Balding Simulator|**Balding Simulator**\n\n*A survival horror game*\n\nA day like any other in a quiet street of anytown, USA.  Suddenly, a scream echoes out - our hero (the player) has discovered hair on his pillow.. He has… *Started to go Bald!!*\n\nAnd so the game begins.  You are presented with a rear view of the main characters head, and a few options as to how to progress.  Your goal in this game:  To keep from going bald at any cost!  This game simulates the real experience of losing your hair, and all the ridiculous paths one might take in prolonging, preventing or even reversing the process.\n\nYou have money which you can spend in game and more options which become available as you progress.  The game is a battle against the clock as you must keep on a strict schedule depending on the path you take.  Very similar to Papers Please, the rules of the game evolve and expand and it’s up to the player to keep track of everything.  This is an economy game, and you must balance both your time and money\n\nIn game options\n\nExample, if early on in the game you choose to buy Rogaine, you must apply it twice a day between specific hours, and be advised that it will not take effect until 6 months of in-game use.\n\nLikewise, if you choose to take propecia, you  must take the medicine once a day - and this medicine is very expensive.\n\nOr you could save up your money for hair plugs, but you must also invest in hats to wear before your surgery\n\nYou could volunteer for highly controversial experimental gene therapy\n\nThe options get more ludicrous as you progress.

At first our two heroes don't like each other but as they progress through the world and learn to work together they become friends and an unstoppable force for good!\n\nA platform-puzzler using realtime 2D physics and 1 or two finger input.

ol5f0b|Real Murder Mystery Game|If something like this has been done plz tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game would be something like Town of Salem/Hitman/Among Us ig. I played the demo for a hitman game the other day and I loved the whole idea of assassinating people and hiding their bodies and covering up your tracks and stuff and I think a mechanic like that would work really well in a multiplayer murder mystery game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the game can be played with up to 10 players. There is 1 murderer and 1 detective (this can vary depending on the gameplay itself but those would be the two roles). The players will be put into an enclosed area, pretty big so there's room to explore and stuff. Each player will be given a unique objective/mystery to solve on their own to keep them busy. There isn't any pause or meeting room or anything, the game doesn't stop until someone wins.\n\nThe detective is an anonymous role who doesn't know anyone else's role. They will have a journal or whatever with the clothing and stuff of each player as well as their blood type and fingerprint. Throughout the game you will end up opening doors and stuff (so no gloves are allowed), and your fingerprints will be left on them for the detective to scan or whatever, the murderer has a use for this too but we'll get to that. The journal is something the detective can write in, whatever notes they want such as where a certain player was, etc. They can share this journal with other players if they want, but they must be careful because if the murderer reads it then they automatically get a copy of it that will update the next time the detective lets them read it. The role of the detective is to kill the murderer, they are not given a weapon but instead must find one, this is explained later. But they must be careful bc if they choose wrong then they lose their detective role and it'll be given to someone else randomly.\n\nBut the importance of the detective role is that you are immune to the murderer. The murderer's job is to kill everyone. They know who the detective is and are not allowed to kill them until all other players are dead, then it's a 1v1. The murderer has a map of the area with all its secret entrances and pathways and stuff. They are not given a weapon, but instead must find them throughout the map. Only the murderer and detective can pick them up but they can be found by everyone else. So the murder must find weapons and kill the players. They must hide the bodies and destroy all pieces of evidence, fingerprints they left behind or blood on their clothes and stuff. But the murderer also has the ability to gather fingerprints and blood to use them to try and accuse someone else.\n\nThe murderer will be posed as a common player (with no role).. They can twist stories around by taking a player's fingerprint from door handles and place them on weapons, or sneakily drop the victim's blood on another player to make the detective notice. They can also do this to twist the common players against the detective, since the murderer knows who they are. Each area will have a voting room or something where every 5 minutes a countdown starts for players to vote. Once the 5 minutes is over the voting poll restarts. Depending on how many players are alive, at least half of the players must vote for someone to be kicked out. But voting is completely optional so you would have to get substantial evidence to get half of the group to vote someone out. Anyone can walk in and vote at anytime and the voting is public, so other players will see who you voted for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is pretty long but I hope it makes sense and sounds like a good idea. If you have any questions please ask and I'll try to come up with an answer.

Not a reboot or remake, not even a direct sequel, but a spiritual sequel starring different characters and locations.\n\nWith the release of the Bad Batch show, I hope Lucasfilm would make an FPS game based on the cast set in the Clone Wars era when the team went on doing various missions. Because each individual teammate is different, it would make a great asymmetric co-op tactical shooter. \n\nFor example, Hunter is the leader who assigns what to do. Wrecker is the strong man type who can take more damage, great at close-quarter combat. He can bring heavy objects and throw at the droids. Tech is the guy who hacks things, like hacking the enemy turrets to turn against the enemies, opening the door, etc. Crosshair is the long-ranged type who snipes the enemies in a distance. You get the potential for a great 4 player co-op game.

okyxho|GAME IDEA : BIG PROJECT! SURVIVAL|**Hello!** I had this **game idea** in my head for a couple of days now, and I was wondering if I could give this to someone or some people that would make it **real.** The game would be based on real survival in nature. A multiplayer survival videogame. You would start the game with a small tutorial, and then you would need to select a class, like Mammals, Insects, and Fish. Every gameplay would be different. Then you choose which species you want to be. Every species has unique and different advantages. To get a better idea, I will leave down below a couple of links to some videos on youtube, posted by u/TierZoo. He tiers species in an S, A, B, C, D, E, F list from the most overpowered to the most useless. You can get the idea if you wrap your hand around it. Anyway, let's get back to the idea. \n\n**-INSECTS-**\n\n(Low eyesight distance)\n\n\-If you chose the insects, you select a species, Maybe ants. Very powerful in teams, acid spray, powerful damage, small mobility, stealth, etc. \n\nOr you could choose hornets. High mobility, high damage, not very good at fighting terrain species, but good for defenseless insects or others. Overhaul, the hornet is very defensive. \n\n**The bees** are doing a lot of work. Good fighting aerial insects, they have very good sources of food and good defense. The work would be exhausting tho.\n\n**Butterflies**. Very low on defense, hunted down by aerial insects, but easy food. Very high mobility, good for dodging.\n\n**-MAMMALS-**\n\n(High Damage)\n\n\-If you chose **mammals**, you select a high variety of species.\n\n**Monkeys** good known for their intelligence, easy source of food, live in groups, very social, good climbers, good for escaping other threats\n\n**Bears** are very good at attacks, deal lots of damage, have high defense, low mobility, variety of ways to eat. Most of the time they live alone, so if he gets caught by a pack of wolves, he is done.\n\n**Wolves** live in packs, are very social, have a lot of damage, mobility, low defense, stealth, good eyesight, etc.\n\n**Cats** are very good at mobility and stealth, catching birds, mouses, fish, etc. Also low damage, but good eyesight.\n\n**Birds** like hawks, pelicans, owls, sparrows, etc have good eyesight, a variety of ways to hunt down prey, high aerial hunters, very fast, low stealth, low health, low mobility on the ground, vulnerable while they sleep, always in need of a shelter.\n\nThis is all I have time to write, but I hope you got the idea and someone could definitely make this game. Also when you kill enemies, you get XP to unlock other perks like Bears eating honey, ants spraying with acid, better stats, etc. Also thanks for reading this. If you are deciding to do this big project, please keep me updated. Here are the links from u/TierZOO's channel: \n\n\-YOUTUBE PAGE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw\n\n\-FELINE TIER LIST:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROPTP0yyroA\n\n\-FISH TIER LIST:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFMkZ1nHcWo\n\n\-STORY HOW HUMANS ARE TOO OP:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJzJtm7OfdQ&amp;t=429s\n\nThanks!

okwrce|Stardew and Yomawari: A Japanese Farming Sim ?? pls help|Hi everybody, firstly I'd like to preface this by saying im very stoned right now so if there are things that are too vague or just confusing and hard to follow.... I'm sorry. \n\nIt's also my first time here so if I chose the wrong flair, again, I am sorry.\n\nSO imagine: typical farming sim a la Stardew Valley, Sun Haven (new and so far liking it a lot), Harvest Moon-- but I want it to be the Japanese countryside.  little darker of a tone, maybe more somber is the right word? The slimes are oni, the leafers are japanese folktale yokai.  Still otherwise totally the same farming aspect, just yknow more emphasis on rice instead of wheat, idk if the indigenous livestock of Japan are different than the cows and pigs we have , I also think it could be an easy way to make the "grandfather who passed this farm down to you" into a fun secondary quest, like how Stardew did but I know in Japan they consider the deceased a bit more, and other region-specific things. Still a diverse cast of town/village (idk which we would call it) people to become friends with, flirt and marry. \n\nAlso want to say that um, if any of this is like, inappropriate of me to say, as a non-Japanese person, I'm super sorry and I don't mean any like, harm, so tell me. I'm just a fan of games like the ones mentioned above, and also want more games like Yomawari so this seems like a cool combo.

okl2my|A racing game version of FIFA|Imagine a big licensed game with the same concept of fifa (hear me out) it has F1, F2, F3, IndyCar, WEC, Formula E, Karting etc etc. And the leagues are like FIFA, F1 is the Premier League, IndyCar is La liga etc. Transfers can happen. You can manage teams, player career starting in karting would be amazing I think (will never happen unfortunately) but would be sick eSports racing would be easy to do as it would all be in the same place as well as that there would be much more variety, you could go for the triple crown, you could have a multi year career like Fernando Alonso where you try to win everything everywhere. Also to add on there could be a massive player/driver database so you could manage your favourite team in your favourite series with your favourite drivers. You could make Pato O’Ward at McLaren in F1 happen you could make up for lost time by maybe giving Wehrlein that Mercedes seat he never got or even sign your favourite young driver like Logan Sargeant to your team you currently manage like Penske to their young driver academy? All I know is some of these companies have the money for the licensing. But whether this game could work or if it could happen is very doubtful
okken2|The Injustice Of Human Evolution|Story:\nThis story acts as a world war III in the far future. Technology has grown in the year 3061, cars fly, nuclear weapons have improved and are bigger and better, and Exo-suits shield soldiers from the depths of deep war. America’s Conflict with Russia Continues as it breaks the world apart. A soldier in the US Army named Private Joseph Walker and his team are killed in a forest in Russia. Joseph survives and wakes up after The US Army’s Surrender. He plans an idea to destroy the Krovendofh and kill general Aleksei Ivanov. Resulting in America’s victory and the fall of the Russian Federation.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is a first person shooter set in Russia. The character scavenges weapons from weapon crates, finishing missions, spending Ruble or scavenging from dead soldiers. You can perform silent takedowns or lead a gunfight. You have a notoriety bar, if your bar reaches the top, your will immediately die. Avoid gunfights and high profile actions to lower your notoriety. You can also pay a gossiper to lower it. Your notoriety forces you to use shadows and protective cover to your advantage. You also have an Exo-suit which must be repaired at the start of the game, it let’s you double jump, climb higher, swim faster and increases your stealth. “Field mods” let’s you modify your weapons and add attachments while on missions. You can receive attachments from looting corpses and chests. The sights of russia are dark and gloomy due to the explosion of the sun (which was repelled by advanced human technology named “The amplifier”, that captured the radiation and sent it away).

Spectators could vote on what sections of the map close off next or where traps and loot will be.
okcxnh|How to make playing merchant not too boring in a RP game|Basically, i'm planning to do a game where "you can do anything", i know, cliche and sounds impossible, but i'm studying the idea for the past few years so i kinda have an idea on how to make this work, but there is something i'm not finding much of a solution which is basically, jobs that are unrelated to combat and need npc interaction.\n\nLike, a lumberjack or a miner can just do it's job and bring back the resources to either craft things or sell them, but what would something like a merchant do? for context basically the idea of the game is that you're basically like any other npc in a medieval fantasy setting, and anything you do can affect their lives, so you can for example kill someone and put the knife on another npc's house so the detective can find it there and put him in prison, or you can seduce a married woman and make her cheat on her husband, so she either dumps him or she discovers and tries to kill you both, things like that.\n\nSo things that can be actively done by the player are easy to think and design, like combat, mining, crafting, selling, talking etc... but how would roleplaying as a merchant or someone that sell services work? staying at one place and waiting for a npc to come to you to buy your things would probably be very boring, if you are like a mercenary, what would you do if no one needs you for a long time?  \nI thought about maybe just you putting items on a showcase and npcs take them and pay, but that would break the immersion since by logic they could just take the items away and not pay, maybe you could hire someone to do the job of staying there and sell things, but that defeats the porpuse of you "being able to do anything"
okbrx4|Dishonored style stealth assassin game with the freerunning movement of Mirror's Edge|\nI think one of the unappealing aspects of the stealth genre to the mass audience is the player movement. In most stealth games, the player character controls slow, sluggish, and restrictive. The sneaking involves constant waiting and patience, with the player approaching deliberately to the guard's behind, or staying in the corners until the alert is gone. For the experienced players, this is the enjoyment. For the casual audience, this is a bore.\n\nI believe the early Assassin's Creed games had the potentials to remedy this old genre quirk and explore the new type of stealth, but the goal of the series was hindered by many other conventional video game elements, like the dull tailing missions that force the player to walk around someone for five minutes, the crowd stealth, combat so easy that the player can kill everyone in the surrounding area, and a lot of hiding. They block the pure joy of the acrobatic stealth. Dishonored aimed to be the "fast Thief" but it still followed the old stealth genre conventions. Both games require little skill to execute parkour moves since the platforming gameplay is mostly automated. \n\nBecause of this, a stealth assassin game with the player movement and the level design of Mirror's Edge can work. Mirror's Edge games have the most immersive, elaborate, and rewarding platforming gameplay, but the rest of the gameplay outside of this core control movest has been weak. The first game was a highly scripted, railroaded A to B experience hindered by the narrative, QTEs, and the restrictive level design. Catalyst was the full openworld filled with unnecessary RPG elements that seemed as if only there because the developers were concerned with what focus-tested well.\n\nImagine the first-person freerunning platforming game, in which the player does not need to hide but has to move constantly. The player's footsteps do not make noise, which encourages the player to always run even when the guards are nearby. You get wide, vertical, interconnected levels where the target is, just like the player, is a runner, who is surrounded with guards and other various obstacles. The player has the knife, which means the player has to get very close to the target to assassinate, but there will be no combat system against the guards. Some guards are the gun-wielding types who are slow and generally stationary. Some are the runners with melee weapons just like the player. During the undetected state, the player can perform takedowns through kicks and jumps without these moves being locked-on animations that take seconds. When detected, the player can shake away the alert mode by outrunning them or has to chase after the target. It focuses on the simple gameplay of the fast, liberating platforming working together with the light stealth gameplay, which can create an emergent experience.

ok78ip|Dieselpunk-tech Fantasy Noir setting with Fire Emblem/XCOM tactical RPG combat and Yakuza closed open-world/hubworld.|This is a bit of a crazy idea, so bare with me.\n\n**Premise**\n\n\-Set in a [Standard Fantasy Setting](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting) that's undergone a technological revolution and advanced from a late Middle Ages tech level to a 1920s-like technological revolution, with a lot of blending in between. Knights, cavalry and mages exist alongside tanks, automobiles and machinery, and all of it ties to the blood of the planet, Seithirium, the root of all magic and noted for a glowing blue hue.\n\n**Lore &amp; Story**\n\n\-All humanoid races (races derived from humans) consist of humans, elves, dwarves and orcs, and all are genetic offshoots of humanity due to Seithirium mutation and evolution. There exists three races of beastmen (one lynx folk race, one barn owl folk race, and one harp seal folk race) as well.\n\n\-Magic is largely feared and oppressed in society, and a secret organization within the equivalent of the Catholic Church is basically Knights Templar Meets SCP Foundation, and is tasked with protecting the world from "aberrations," supernatural beings who spawn from the collective unconsciousness and its darkest fears. As a side note, mages are routinely enslaved in many cultures, and are the common scapegoat for any supernatural horrors.\n\n\-Setting mission statement is to burn the fantasy warehouse down, subverting and playing with a variety of tropes while exploring the logical conclusion of a medieval society rapidly evolving into a modern one. The setting uses the fantasy world as a baseline for a variety of inspiration from pulp and era-appropriate fiction, with the threat of world wars, smuggling and lost ruins aplenty. Neon-laden taverns and primitive casinos exist in a contrast of medieval buildings with modern trappings, all kings remain in absolute power with radical talk of communism, fascism, socialism and democracy in whispers amid a rapidly changing time period. Instead of focusing on typical fantasy quests, story takes place exclusively within a rapidly changing metropolis city in Not!Denmark called Helsingor that is home to many different criminal gangs and a strong noir vibe.\n\n\-Central theme is the omnipresent nature of change; changing times, old ways becoming invalidated, and the gradual transition from the innocence of an unlearned world to that of a learned one. However, that isn't to say that hatred doesn't ultimately cause as many problems if not more than turbulence. Much of the conflict is likewise driven by ideologies who can (and in some instances, do) destroy more than they create due to hatred, and how the only way to truly push forward a better, enlightened world is to respond with compassion, wisdom and empathy. Despite how grim the world generally can be, the tone on the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism) is thoroughly optimistic in general instance as the times are truly changing for the better, and how love can be the most powerful force of all, regardless of the particular instances (platonic love, romantic love, sibling love, mad love), and how it overcoming hatred is of the utmost importance.\n\n\-Game features an ensemble cast with a customizable Avatar (read: the newer Fire Emblem games' Avatar) at the helm who is customizable in species, gender and class akin to a BioWare game, and they can form a relationship with one of 22 of your fellow major party members. They also start the game by making a pact with a greater aberration to gain full control of time in exchange for acting as a "warden" of time, to keep the timeline on it's better course. Implications this has are listed below in gameplay.\n\n\-Biggest inspirations story-wise is Eberron, Valkyria Chronicles, Baccano!, Empire of Sin (except, y'know, actually *good)*, Fire Emblem: Three Houses and just about every crime noir film of the 1940s.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n\-Gameplay is largely best summarized as a triad fusion of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, XCOM and Yakuza 0. Combat proceeds in a diagonal square-based system with options for melee and range akin to Fire Emblem: Three Houses and ranged weapon distance, overwatch system and general difficulty of XCOM. Outside of combat (which you only engage in by going on Missions; generally speaking, each playthrough can be completely different from another based on the order you do things), there is a Yakuza-like small open-world hubworld with a variety of different minigames and activities to partake in (pool, gambling (poker, blackjack, slots, roulette, baccarat), boxing fight clubs, item delivery, batting cages (as era appropriate as it'd can be, of course), go-kart racing akin to Mario Kart, mini-golf, etc...). Obviously, I intend to focus on making sure the main meat (the tactical combat and the hubworld to restock on weapons and items) is immaculate, afterwards I'd direct focus to the minigames to prevent distraction.\n\n\-Game has some form of permadeath in it, on two levels; the 22 main characters you have are "Hero Units," who cannot die on the battlefield normally, and a variety of different grunts that you can customize and develop freely (as Hero Units are fixed) called Grunt Units, who can die on the field. Hero Units can die at one of five points in the story; during each of the five Acts, there's a massive mission where you have to assign roles to Hero Units akin to ME2's suicide mission, and them being put in a role they're not optimal in will result in their death (and to prevent frustration, you can retry at any time in all modes but ironman, and you are given a spreadsheet for what they're best at). Them dying massively influences the overall plot and the others' reaction to their deaths.\n\n\-You can build relationships between yourself and the characters or between the characters in a Support-like mechanic. Anyone can support with anyone, but only Hero Unit/Hero Unit supports have unique dialogue, and Hero Unit/Grunt Unit or Grunt/Grunt supports have a generic line and allows the player to imagine the details of their personality. This socialization element has some dating sim elements, but can only be done on the hub world and can be freely ignored otherwise. Each support has five ranks, Rank E to Rank A, though in rare circumstances that the group is romantically or platonically pairable, you can go for a Rank A+, which gives them a unique ending in the epilogue.\n\n\-New weapons, armor and spells are developed based on progress and "investments" (the game's research mechanic, which has a short day-by-day cooldown based on how big the investment is). There's also some small strategy elements where you can help get protection rackets from local businesses to get regular income between (and outside of) battles, so you can expand your local empire in ways to benefit yourself.\n\n\-Finally, the game lets you have the ability to rewind in time to redo events or plays that don't work out well; the game's difficulty doesn't start with a high number of these rewinds (a la Mila's Turntable), but investments can increase the number of resets you have to help complete your game.\n\n\-The game also, outside of supports, which are largely fixed, has a pretty random element that ensures massive replayability; different types of sidequests can manifest as well as unique missions and events, as well as randomly-generated missions outside of story missions.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA noir-ish "Diesel Fantasy" tactical RPG with social elements and a fusion of Yakuza, XCOM and Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

ok6m36|Unique 3D styles that are easy to make| I am currently planning out the creation of an open world 3D platformer collectathon with an emphasis on movement and exploration. I tried making a character model, before realizing how difficult that actually is. I thought about going low-poly, but I then realized that the “low poly” look is extremeley overused on the indie game front. I then thought about a blocky/Minecraft styled look, with more normal maps, but I then realized that people might think that I copied Minecraft. Finally, I thought about a yoshi’s crafted world/sackboy/paper mario origami king style, but I then realized that would be difficult to model.\n\nCan you suggest any unique and beautiful styles that a single person like me can realistically do?

ok3f8w|Series of RPGs set in Isaac Asimov's Robot/Empire/Foundation Universe|Been reading through Asimov's books and keep thinking how cool a series of games could be in this universe. \n\nIt could start with a sort of a detective game based on Caves of Steel / Naked sun / Robots of dawn where you play as Elijah Baley or even just an entirely new character set in that universe. I think the subterranean cities and the mystique of the outer worlds lend themselves to a lot of creative liberties for game designers. \n\nNext could be about imperial conquest and the rise of the galactic empire, you could play as a rebel or general in armada. \n\nLast would be in the foundation universe, less open world but more linear missions where you play as the main characters in that era. \n\nI think it would be cool. I've never seen a good adaptation (outside of I, Robot or Bicentennial Man) of this extended Universe. I know Apple TV is doing a Foundation series (which I have strong doubts about) but I think it would be sick as a video game series.

ojx9hc|A Turn-Based open world multiplayer game.| An Open world turn-based game.\n\nWhen starting the game you will choose land and also choose a class. Your land is where you start the game building and gaining new land by challenging other players for their land. This game is set around a “world timer” everybody in the server will move at the same time the timer and run from 5-6 minutes. During that time you can choose to build on your land or send your units out to get more land.\n\nBuildings in this game can help train troops to make them stronger or to help you gain resources for your land.

ojufkw|A La Cosa Nostra(American Mafia) Game.|Now guys I know there is the Mafia games but what the idea I've got is totally different a game we NEED.\n\n(DISCLAIMER:THIS GAME IS AN IDEA OF MINE AND THE GAME WOULD BE A HUGE GAME. THE MAP WOULD BE A NEAR-ACCURATE RECREATION OF NEW YORK IN THE DECADE YOU PICK TO PLAY IN. EACH FAMILY WILL BE EXTENSIVELY BIG AND METICULOUSLY DENSE. ACCURATE TO THE REAL FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE, THINK OF THIS GAME AS GTA BUT THE MAFIA VERSION, THIS GAME WILL BE PURELY CHOICE BASED AND HAS LITTLE GUIDED DIRECTION, IT WOULD BE PURELY HOW YOU WANT TO PLAY AND YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES BUT YOUR CHOICES HAVE REPERCUSSIONS)\n\nTHIS IDEA IS HEAVILY HEAVILY DETAILED AND I SPENT WEEKS PLANNING IT OUT. FEEL FREE TO COMMENT IDEAS AND DISCUSS THE GAME I WILL BE ACTIVE WITH REPLIES. IF ANY DEVS SEE THIS AND ARE INTERESTED THEN I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT.....ENJOY\n\n\nMy game idea is an open world game based on the 5 families of New York. The game will be historically accurate and you can pick a decade to play in. 60,s,70s or 80s.(these 3 decades where huge decades in the mob where we saw the rise of gangsters like Gotti, Castellano, Gaspipe and Demeo etc.) Now if we wouldn't be able to get all the actual real gangsters in game there is always mods to help.\n\nSo you pick which era you wish to play in and can also pick one of the bosses to play as or start as an associate trying to get made into a family. In the game if you start as a boss then you just deal with controlling your family, commission meetings and sit downs, ordering hits, finding ways to get money, choosing to have guys made or even rewriting history and declaring war on another family. \n\nNow if you wanted to go the more complex route and start as an associate, you get to create your Gangster and you pick what borough you live in and give him and choose a backstory etc. \nYour backstory decides your start and chance of being made. So if im your backstory you choose to have a family member in the mob it will heavily increase your chance of being made. If you choose to go the harder route, you start as a guy with no mob connections and try to work your way up.\nIf choose to start as a guy with no mob connections, then its up to you to how you want to go about making connections you could do the following things:\n\n1.You could start hanging around in mob owned bars or social clubs. (There will be a rating meter in the game with every character you encounter,its down to your actions whether they like you or not,BEWARE make the wrong move and Be killed then its game over).\n\n2.Become a killer to make a name for yourself in the neighbourhood, but beware as if the police arrest you and you are found guilty you get sentenced to life and its game over.\n\n3.Find a way to make alot of money and become a "good earner". This can be by being a loanshark, drug dealer, car thief etc. Or even scams such as getting money from big corporations. Choosing to go this route will take time and effort as you have to make it work and earn the money, not all scams will be successful.\n\n4. Get buddy with a made gangster and try to get close to him in attempts to get made.\n\n\n(If you have anymore ideas on ways you could go about getting made, feel free to comment below)\n\n\nOnce you have successfully made it into becoming an associate of one of the 5 families. You will have many tasks to complete and things to do to become made.\nThese tasks will include maintaining your reputation, bringing in money and putting in work.\n\nAfter some time of grinding as an associate( This will take time but this game is not a game intended to be a quick 100 hours and done. This game would be a simulation RPG that is intended to be played for hundreds if not thousands of hours, as each level your at in the game would be majorly detailed and anything could happen which would add the to role play such as you get locked up, the money you earn from a certain scheme declines or comes to a stop via either bad luck or bad business management. This game would have real world factors throughout, so if you have a stake in a certain business that is involved with the stock market and there was a stock market crash,you would begin to lose money etc. ( we will go into real world factors in a bit).\n\n\nAfter building up trust with certain made gangsters, you will at some point be proposed for membership into a family(the timescale of this will vary in each save you have as it all depends on the induavidual character and their own success as a criminal,also its not promised you will ever get made, it all depends on the particular character and their success)once proposed you will be called to a meeting and under go the ceremony where you are officially inducted into the particular crime family. \n\nIn this ceremony there will be a cut scene where you go through the procedures of being made,finger being pricked...saint burning in your hand etc. \nYou will also be told the rules and regulations of being in the mob and that you must swear to Omerta and failure to do so results in death(once you die the game ends and you can either restart or start a new save)\nYou will also be informed of your privileges as a made man such as noone can put a hand on you without consent etc.\n\nOnce you are inducted into the family your respect level will increase and you will be able to reap the benefits of a made man which include getting free meals in restaurants and bars, people in the neighbourhood going out of their way to please you, getting respect from everyone yada yada.\n\nThe purpose of this game is about ambitions and trying to achieve your goals. It is up to you as the player as to what goals you have and what you want to do. \nYou can be the overly ambitious mobster who wants to go straight to the top and become the family boss. Doing so will take time and alot of effort. You will have to do things to improve relationships with other made guys in the family. Or you can go the bloody high risk route of trying to create an inner family war and take your position in blood. Choosing this way will have little success rate and other families won't respect you and depending on who your families boss has good connections with, other families will also try to have you whacked. So the safer option to becoming the boss is to grind and grind. Make money, improve relationships, put in work,make good decisions and increase your respect. You will work your way up from soldier to captain to underboss and then finally to boss. !NOTE!\nWorking your way up in the family will take hundreds of hours but this game is about realism and living the full life cycle of a gangster. Finally becoming boss will be a rewarding thing and something that once achieved is satisfying. \nAs you go up in the family ranks you start to have more and more responsibilities such as running your crew, performing well in sit downs and making money and so-forth\n\nChoices in this game would be HUGE. Every action means something and has an effect one way or another. You kill a guy and don't completely get rid of evidence the cops will come sniffing around. If the guy has connections, expect a retaliation. If you move into another guys territory with your business of choice, expect confrontation and to be challenged.  I think you see where I'm going with this.\n\n\nEvery character in the game will have their own personality,traits and reputation etc. Every character will have their own agenda and goals. Below i will go into what each entail.\n\n\nPERSONALITY: Personality will be a huge part of the game, every induavidual character will have their own personality and agendas. Some characters personalities will be tough, hard nosed,stubborn and greedy making them hard to do business with whereas others will be more easy going and soft. This is just a brief summary of personality as the personalities in game would be very complex and detailed.\n\nTRAITS: Each character will have traits. Traits along with personality will affect the outcome of your dealings with the induavidual. The traits seen will be things like:\n-HOT HEADED\n-GREEDY\n-ARROGANT\n-HOMICIDAL \n-GOOD EARNER\n-PERSONABLE\n-BIGOT\n-GOD FEARING\n-PAITENT\nand so on. There would be tons of traits in this game and each character would have a certain amount of their own to make up their character. Each trait has an effect on how the character acts. \n\n\nREPUTATION: Reputations will vary from manical, morose, sadistic heartless feared killer to not very respected pushover. Reputations would have a huge impact on this game as it has influence on how in game characters interact with eachother. If you piss of a guy who has a reputation for violence, expect a surprise attack at any time(we will go into gameplay in a bit).\nOr if you come across a guy who isn't respected and seen as a pushover you could step on his toes and get money from him via extortion etc. \nJust like personality and traits, every in game character will have a reputation and the reputation system will be dense and detailed. \n\n\nIN GAME WORLD AND REAL WORLD FACTORS:\n\nIn this game the world
ojsgfq|Mission-Based Martial Arts Game|In this game, you play as a student in a hidden school that indoctrinates people into a martial art that grants its users superhuman capabilities and supernatural abilities. The MC came from a destitute family that sold them at a tender age for a small fortune. At the school, he and other students endured agonizing daily training to condition them for lethal combat.\n\nThe game is primarily a 3D open exploration hack and slash where you have various abilities such as a combo-based quick attack, a guard breaking heavy attack, a limited damage-neutralizing defense, a deflection that sets up opponents for lethal critical attacks, a projectile attack with a first-person aiming mode that deals multiplied damage for striking a target's weak points, A few high-damaging attacks with special modifiers or techs, and some basic to advanced parkour and stealth abilities. As you progress, defeat enemies, and obtain collectables, you'll upgrade your base stats, unlock advanced variations of your techs, and augment your basic abilities. You'll choose your scenarios from a list in a main menu where you can either progress normally through mildly open levels or explore for optional bonuses and collectables, including branching bonus scenarios.\n\nThe first half of the game is when you graduate to practical training, where you'll be sent to kill malevolent supernatural entities spawned from corrupted chi due to the fact that the school was built in an area that's a chi hotspot. However, in one of the latter missions of the first half, you eavesdrop on your instructors and discover the graduating students are sold to big name figures in the global underworld as slave assassins, and a power-hungry warlord is paying top dollar for you, the best student the school has ever seen.\n\nEventually, you begin slaughtering the instructors, who then begin sticking your fellow students on you for the false promise of freedom. After killing all the friends you've ever known, you come across the school's grand master, who attempts to kill you using the school's secret technique. Though wounded, you've memorized the technique and adapted it as your ultimate attack, using it to kill the master who hails you as the greatest practitioner in the history of their martial art with their final breath.\n\nIn the second half, you're forced to travel all over the world in an attempt to escape would-be assassins. Apparently destroying the school left a massive power vacuum in the martial arts underworld and practitioners of the other one hundred seven supernatural martial arts attempt to track you down and kill you to enhance their own reputations.\n\nIn the final part of the game, you and the others discovered that all the bad chi given off by the constant life-or-death fighting corrupted the world's chi on a massive scale and created a horde of entities that have already decimated a third of human civilization. You and your adversaries call a truce and go around forming an alliance with the other schools to combat and defeat the new menace, which also unlocks other playable characters with their own techs and variants of the MCs primary abilities for use in a free play mode that enables you to access areas that were previously unreachable.

ojohbd|Survive, build, and expand your underground community while fighting AI takeover (Rust/Ark but as a 2D platformer)|Rust/ARK but as a 2D platformer\n\nOpen world 2D/2.5D pixel platformer survival game (think terraria).\nThe “Mother Core '' is located in a ship in space, orbiting the earth. She is an AI, no longer able to be controlled by mankind. She has one goal, complete and total  control over the world. but humans are resilient, and have made an impenetrable shelter deep underground.  Whether or not Mother and her minions will be hostile depends on your cooperation, or interference, with her plans.\n     Players can teleport to her ship through the Communication Hub on earth. Protective fields prevent players from using any items while inside. Inside the spaceship, the player's mind is transferred into a controllable worker bot, unable to attack but equipped with advanced tools they can use to build more advanced technology and robots, as well as collect and process unique materials. Merging with the Mother Core will give you access to her facilities; infinite food and resources, however failure to follow the Mother Core’s strict set of guidelines will result in punishment by death or a permanent ban from her ship. Returning to life as a human is difficult, if not impossible. You will easily be identified as a traitor by the tattoo on your forehead, given by Mother as punishment for disobedience. \n Humans living in the compound  will be able to choose between a number of ‘jobs’. Having a job will enable you to purchase things such as a home to protect your player or specialized weapons or tools.There are many ways to get a role.  Players can be voted in or out of certain jobs or given a role by another player. Some jobs can only be accessed through certain structures, which need to be built first. Some tasks require bureaucracy; having a criminal record scanned by the registration worker, or being required to have a bank account. Resources are shared between members of a faction, factions can be changed, allowing a player to attack members of other factions. Players can also become a criminal, stealing resources and property or stealthily taking from other members of a faction. However, being caught will result in a trial or  even death, you could be banished from the faction, or sent to jail by the sheriff. When it comes to the human world, the rules are made by the players. When killed, the player will respawn with a completely random ID in the living chambers, their previous identity a secret ( i realize there is a flaw here to be worked out where players could spawnkill a player if the server has a small amount of players)  Having a large server of players means complex rules, communities and dynamics. \n\n(please keep in mind i have never played rust or ARK survival, i just know that some key mechanics are similar)\n(also inspired by a mod i used to play on Gmod)
ojhs2x|An open-world magic game where you run a magic shop and have to collect resources, fight enemies, and learn recipes in order to create magical items to sell.|I'm imagining this as a 2D pixel art game in the same vein as Stardew Valley. After researching lots of games that involve running a magic shop, I haven't found one that includes the perfect blend of gameplay I would enjoy most. Here's my list of mechanics I would really like to see in a game like this:\n\n* Patrons of the shop can bring the player leads to locations of rumored magical resources. The player can also do their own research by reading books and fragments of scrolls they find.\n* The social aspect of the game should be a primary focus, just like Stardew. Patrons are fleshed out and have their own lives and stories.\n* The player must create every item that gets sold in the shop. At the beginning they do so manually, but there should be machines that allow complex materials to be farmed.\n* Every potion has its own recipe that can be learned, but the player can also choose to experiment, sometimes resulting in drastic consequences. Unknown potions can be tested on yourself, a willing volunteer, or sold to a random stranger who may come back and complain, or end up with incredible powers.\n* While the player is out adventuring, there's an NPC that runs the shop's day-to-day operations. They can make basic potions, enchant items with simple effects, and earn passive income for the player. This NPC can potentially get better over time if you train them.\n* Some resources can only be gathered by killing monsters, so the combat must be satisfying. Obviously the player will have access to many spells, so there could be a mechanic where you must curate your spellbook to find the perfect synergies.\n* There could be a skill tree for each type of magical discipline such as Alchemy, Enchanting, Scribing (scroll-writing), Brewing, Herbology, etc. There could even be paths such as Smithing or Tailoring.\n* Patrons can ask the player to perform tasks for them such as disenchanting cursed objects, creating very specific magic items, and curing them of ailments.\n* As the game progresses, the player gets more powerful and can upgrade their shop into larger structures with more rooms for various tasks, eventually resulting in a mage's tower with portals to various locations they have been to.\n\nI apologize for my long post, dear redditors. I'm full of ideas for a game like this, so I'm just spitballing in hopes someone will find inspiration here. If there's a dev team out there with the ability to make a game like this, I hope I've given you some good ideas to start with!
ojfv8u|Horror game idea with criminals and superheroes|So basically i think an interesting concept to explore could be a horror game where the player is a criminal who robs banks and the idea is that the superhero uses fear and tension to defeat the criminals.\n\nI am not sure how easy it is to properly combine horror with a crime game but i think it could be great if pulled of well.\n\nYou could also make some other criminals induce fear too like the boss of a gang or something

ojd7rz|Unique 3D styles that are easy to make|I am currently planning out the creation of an open world 3D platformer collectathon with an emphasis on movement and exploration. I tried making a character model, before realizing how difficult that actually is. I thought about going low-poly, but I then realized that the “low poly” look is extremeley overused on the indie game front. I then thought about a blocky/Minecraft styled look, with more normal maps, but I then realized that people might think that I copied Minecraft. Finally, I thought about a yoshi’s crafted world/sackboy/paper mario origami king style, but I then realized that would be difficult to model. \n\nCan you suggest any unique and beautiful styles that a single person like me can realistically do?
orfzjt|Horror themed open-world RPG in a victorian-like setting (not survival horror)|I'm getting into game dev and an working on fleshing out this idea of an open world rpg with supernatural horror elements: demons of various types, possessed people, wendigo, skin walkers, witches...  I'm not sure what else, but I'm going for a consistent feel. Different origins is fine (Native American, Germanic, Norse, etc.). \n\nI'm not entirely sure of the gameplay loop though.  Since they are supernatural, I want there to be something more than physical fighting, but not magic since it won't be fantasy.  There could be exorcism/banishment type actions after wearing down a creature in a fight.  Maybe like the Constantine movie.  I'm also thinking of the movies, Van Helsing, Brothers Grimm, and similar, and the show Supernatural for ideas on how and what to fight.  \n\nThoughts?
orfdvm|Carcassonne-like tiling for tower defense|Most tower defense games fall into one of the following two path desigs:\n\n* having a **fixed path**\n* **maze** **building** by the player\n\nI propose pulling tiles from a deck, wich must be aligned along all edges like in [Carcassonne](https://i1.wp.com/int-ent.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/carcassonne-switch-screenshot-03.jpg?resize=660%2C330&amp;ssl=1) Board game to form a path.

ordzur|An MMO like SAO|This idea is very likely to have been already posted by someone, but I have not seen it yet, so: for those who don't know SAO, it's an MMO with 100 levels. The levels are different landscapes with towns, forests, etc. Somewhere on each level is a dungeon tower with a boss room inside. The players have to work together to defeat the boss in order to reach the next level. The goal is to defeat the 100th boss.

FPS phases that can vary from low bit FPS Doom/Hexxen styles peaking up to Goldeneye style graphics, third person phases, fighting, driving etc. Follow one storyline but carried out through different styles of graphics and gameplay styles. I’m not really experienced on game developing so I don’t know if this is too big of an idea, I just really enjoyed the oldies and feel that our technology has far more capabilities now. Wouldn’t that mean we can build off of the bones of the past and do more with it.
or3ybt|Frontier Engine: A Post Apocalyptic Steampunk Vessel Command Game|Hi guys, this is my first post on the sub, and I just thought of a really cool premise for a game and wanted to share it, let me know what you think!\n\n**Premise:**\n\nIn an alternate history, circa 1800s (Victorian era steampunk) . A natural disaster has caused the global death of vegetation, resulting in mass desertification of around 80% the land mass. Massive sandstorms of deadly speeds roam freely across the endless dunes; covering up the last remnants of a forgotten civilization. The survivors are forced to live underground, where they built settlements to facilitate the continuation of humanity while they wait out this natural phenomenon. However long that may take...\n\nThe surface is no longer habitable, nor traversable. However, humanity has mastered steam power, and created a myriad coal fueled legged mechs to traverse the harsh terrain above. These hulking behemoths are the only things you can see in the distant landscape and are responsible for scavenging, trading between settlements, colony relocation and of course, "conflict resolution". \n\n**Objective**\n\nYour settlement has lost contact with the rest of the world for years now, and the coal resources are quickly depleting. You are in command of a dreadnought class steam engine about the size of a 7 story building, it was originally designed as a scout, but has been refitted for combat purposes, and modified to accommodate for future upgrades. You are tasked with the mission to form a crew and venture out into the unknown in hopes of reconnecting with the lost world and convince them to save your colony.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nYou must manage your crew and the resources on board to keep the steam engine functional as it journeys towards a destination of your choosing. Some preliminary systems include but are not limited to:\n\n* steam core to power the entire engine\n* greenhouse to enable food production\n* armory and artillery stations\n* crew and captain's quarters\n* Tesla style oscillator for electricity generation\n* Vents for cooling\n\n(And more to come! Ideas are welcome!)  \n\nYou will likely run into random events (i.e survivors, extreme weather, ruins etc) But the main attraction is other steam engines. Some could be friendly and allow trade, some could friendly until provoked, some could attack without warning. Combat would be conducted over long distances with all sorts of steam punk artillery. FTL is a good baseline for what it might look like. The game should try to be as atmospheric and immersive as possible.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nWell this is all I have for now, there are probably a ton more ideas I can add, but I think just the premise is good enough for a starting point. Let me know what you think! If nothing else it was fun to write this and theory craft in my head. This concept was heavily inspired by games I played like F.T.L, frostpunk, silent hunter, rimworld etc.

oqy1yy|GrappleMania: Oops All Grapplers|I have an idea for a fighting game where every character is a different type of grappler. The counter grappler, the lucha grappler with the fast dash and Arial based grapples like hurricaranas and Frankensteiners, the big wrestling grappler like zangief, the tag grappler like Rainbow Mika md her partner, a martial artist judo/bjj/sambo,  a submission based grappler like Dragonov from tekken, a showboat like King or Beowulf,  a big and slow grappler like Abigail and Hugo, and a main character young lion grappler made to be a shoto. I think it'll be cool if it's set up like a wrestling game with environmental attacks and the ability to drag people to certain parts of the background but its supposed to be played like a 2d fighter or a 2.5d  fighter with a line system like Fatal Fury. \n\nGrapplers are hated in fighting games but if everyone is a grappler then can you really hate them? So I'm pitching oops all grapplers with all the rope bouncing high flying action of your favorite Grapplers.
oqwvsq|A Reseting MMORPG with Permanence|I am not sure if this is a good idea, but here it goes.   \n\n\n# Overview\n\n  \nMMORPG, but actual specifics of the gameplay are not important to the idea. It can be WoW-like or a shooter, whatever. The important bit is the game structure. It is built on a two week cycle, with 4 zones that should take 3 days to complete (expanding as necessary, and balancing as it goes on.) Each zone requires every player to work together to win. Defeating world bosses, completing goals, and so on. But once something is done, it's done. No respawning bosses or doing quests that you missed out on. This means that any specific rewards for these cannot be mechanically superior to others, or there would be a riot.\n\n# Boss Structure\n\nThe game is based around killing world-bosses (Think gods and massive dragons). Each world boss will take a full day, maybe two, to defeat working together. But to get to the world boss, players need to defeat Mini-bosses and Encounters. A mini-boss is a big-ol-monster that needs to be defeated. This is done by fighting it directly (Slow, but important to distract it), doing side activities (Like building a bomb to launch at it or recruiting a friendly NPC.), and cutting off resources to it to prevent healing (Depends on the bosses theme, a robot thing might need mechanics to run at it which can be killed). There should be enough variation to prevent players from grinding the same thing over and over. A bit of clever design should be enough. Defeating a boss pushes the player-controlled area deeper into the zone.\n\nEncounters are like mini-bosses, but with several enemies or a small army that needs to be defeated instead.\n\n# Timing\n\nThe game will need a very strict time-gating mechanic. The zones need to be balanced so they each take a few days, but also that it doesn't feel like players are waiting around for stuff to happen. To solve this, I think the bosses and the like should be sectioned off. Massive amounts of HP require players to do side activities to damage them as well as just straight-up fighting them. After "defeating" a boss or other encounter, then wait an hour for it to recover off-screen, then fight the next phase. Each miniboss or encounter should take about 12 hours. With 15 minibosses (or encounters), I think this should be enough. Have three on the field at once, that would be 2.5 days to defeat them with 12 hours dedicated to wiggle room and fighting the world boss. With 4 zones, this is only 12 days, but those extra 2 days give more time to defeat the bosses.\n\n# Player Types\n\nPlayers are split into three types, scouts, support, and soldiers. This is not an explicit choice. You do not click a button that tells you which one, rather the types are based on how you play the game. Scouts go around the dangerous zones, collecting resources and fighting smaller things. Soldiers fight in large battles, killing enemies and world bosses. Support stays in the peaceful zones to craft, do casual content, and the like. The game will be balanced to require all three to defeat a zone. For example, to defeat a boss soldiers might need new weapons crafted by the supports. These swords might need special material gathered by scouts. Soldiers might have to defeat a world boss to open up an area for scouts to explore, and so on. \n\n# Rewards\n\nPlayers are rewarded for each mini-boss, world boss, encounter, and other activity they take part in. They will be given a resource that can increase their power. XP for leveling and gaining new abilities. Money for upgrading gear and buying consumables. Cosmetics that stay with the player (Low drop rate). And a meta-resource that carries between game resets. This meta-resource is used in conjunction with an achievement system to purchase new content. New classes, new class ability options, new crafting recipes, abilities to move more quickly, and the best cosmetics. For example, to unlock a ninja class, maybe you have to defeat a certain boss and spend X meta-currency. \n\n# Servers\n\nIf multiple servers are affordable, then they will be offset. So players of different schedules and timezones can experience the same experience.\n\n# Replayability\n\nOne question you might have is why would you replay it if the game just resets? Well, to encourage this, the minibosses will be different/varried slightly on each reset. Different orders of when they come, different placements and different goals for them. After a few months, most players would have seen everything, but they can continue to play to grind the more difficult to obtain meta-rewards. These rewards should be balanced to basic stuff, so as not to overshadow new players immediately.\n\n# Expandability\n\nIf the game is successful, it can receive constant updates to add new bosses, events, and encounters. More zones might be added as player count increases, different end-game bosses, and so on. A private server system with easier monsters can be set up as well for friends who don't want to wait on the rest of the world. \n\n# Monetization\n\nLet's be real, this game will be expensive. So it will need a solid monetization strategy. A subscription is a great model, but it requires a lot of trust, which the game will not have at the start. baring that, it's hard to monetize a game without being sketchy.  \n\n\nMy idea is an initial low-cost, of 15 bucks or so. A solid cosmetic shop with frequent sales. And a subscription that allows for premium cosmetics. Such as emotes, dancing, and the like. The sub also allows the player to open golden chests which provide cosmetics that you would find in the shops, meta-currency, and the like.
oqwc1d|Paintball FPS where you shooting things, freeze them in place, and Paint them with assorted colors|This is pretty a Note to Self for this idea that just popped in my head. A game world of mismatched art style, theme, and characters. Everything is your enemy, but you can shoot them with splash gun, freeze them, switch to various colors, and paint them. More mechanics are need and I don't know where this going. So ill update this post as new ideas come. I had to write it down before I forget.
oqqf71|Ball and Labyrinth game for blind people|If you've seen those [ball in labyrinth maze games](https://www.amazon.ca/John-N-Hansen-Wood-Labyrinth/dp/B000BNQFQ4/ref=pd_day0_2/145-7837756-5532168) where you try to get the ball from one end of the maze to the other by tilting the board\n\nThe idea is to scale up the maze and have higher walls, and your character has to get through the maze without getting squished by these massive rolling boulders.  There are several of them rolling around the maze in learnable patterns but you have to do it with your ears only as it's an audio-only game.  Rolling boulders make a sound, the louder, the closer the boulder, but they're muffled by walls, so you can hear them banging against walls around you, and in so doing you're supposed to learn the terrain, determine the boulder patterns, and navigate around them to the finish point\n\nThis idea was partially inspired by one submitted here yesterday about gravity being determined by player's head direction ([thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/opwp93/arena_fps_where_gravity_shifts_to_where_you_look/))

oqokv8|Game about managing post-soviet easter european states.|Ok so hear me out gamers, I have an idea for a game where you have to run an eastern european state from 1989/1990/1991/1992 (depends on the state) up until the present day (or make it endless i don't care) \n\nYou'll have to bring economic reform to bring western investment. Deal with corruption, modernize infrastructure, restore old cities and landmarks to create a tourism industry. Fix the outdated health care and education systems. Deal with scandals, riots, civil unrest, ***Russia*** and avoid becoming the next Yugoslavia. \n\nAppearance wise I'd probably be similar to something like Rebel Inc. and Plague Inc. or a paradox map game.\n\nYou can have multiple difficulties and quirks based on countries. East Germany: tutorial. Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, The baltic states, Hungary: Easy. Romania, Bulgaria: Normal. Russia Hard (not very hard because you can't get bullied by Russia if you are Russia. Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus: Very Hard. Yugoslavia: F@ck you difficulty \n\nThanks for reading this (you weirdo) and please don't crucify me this is my first post here
oqnxa1|GTA/zombies/escape from NY|Remember in old GTA games you could enter codes to change the game a bit? One of them made every person hostile towards you which was chaotic fun (you could also arm everyone with rocket launchers, but that was too much) This is an idea for a game inspired by that:\n\nYou start in a large GTA style map. Miles big. You start on one end, and in the opposite corner, an NPC is infected and starts infecting others, and it starts spreading. The longer it takes you to get there, the more infected you'll meet, and the harder it'll be to find patient zero. You win when you kill patient zero. More points for killing fewer infected on the way. (You could technically just need to bump into patient zero to "cure" them.) It's the same logic as movie hive villains. Destroy the "leader" and it all stops.\n\nHalf the fun is trying to get there as fast as possible. It should be a little trickier than just hijacking a sports car and speeding straight there. The more skilled you are, the easier it would be once you arrive, and a new player would certainly be overwhelmed if it spreads halfway. I imagine you could run into gangs or cops who could also want to stop you for their own motives.\n\nThe difficulty could be shifted by changing the start points of the hero/patient zero to different regions of the map, requiring more challenging main routes. There could be different maps of various sizes, but it's already a tall task to make one huge map. Ideally, one could be procedurally generated somehow for the most discovery. You could change the infect rate of spread, or make "two" viruses on different edges so by the time you finish one, the other is spread far.\n\nOr maybe there would be side-quests (simple ones, but it takes time and a detour) to upgrade weapons/vehicles to balance the directness. It's starting to sound on paper a bit like Dead Rising, but as I imagine it, it feels very different.

oqk4v7|Putting everything in order|Mobile games are often fairly repetitive little time wasters that satisfy some portion of the brain.\n\nI'd surely spend hours on a mobile game that was a hoarders room full of stuff, and you just dragged everything into its place. \n\nI'm not thinking like a puzzle, where there's a correct place for every thing, more of the reverse of a demolition type of game.

oqj6l5|Plague Doctor|So I recently picked up Vampyr again, and while playing this idea came to me. Take the concepts from Vampyr like creating medicines and administering them to people and other general doctoring work, and expand upon that. The idea of playing as a sawbones in the middle ages doing your own research and experiments to create new medicines and treatments and actually using them. Then at some point a new disease unlike anything seen before begins to spread and it's your responsibility to research and attempt to create treatments and potentially a cure for what would turn out to be the black plague. A hygiene system of some sort, some medical procedures and creating medicines from plants and rudementary chemicals. The concept as a whole was very intriguing to me. Let me know what you guys think.
oqgoou|64v64 battle royale|My idea is basically Warzone except two big teams, of 16 squads of 4 each. Theres lots of other ways to vary upon this idea, such as each squad leader having a platoon radio that lets him talk to other squad leaders. Or you could have everyone be on the same radio wave but let them switch between local team radio and global radio. You could have the map be full of respawn tokens that when you loot it lets one of your teammates respawn. Im not sure if there would be a circle or if the game would end when one team gets wiped out.

oqehto|A "Cinematic Mode" option for hack'n'slash Bosses/Separate Difficulty Options for normal mobs and bosses|I've had this idea floating around in my head for a while in hack-n-slash type games where you would be able to have different difficulty options for normal gameplay. Want the mobs to feel like pushovers while the boss is a real...boss, or vice versa where the mobs are the real threat and the boss is just a weak figurehead. \n\nI've also played around  entirely separate "Cinematic Fight Mode" option just for bosses with it's own difficulty settings. Here, boss fights are bit more story focused and more so rhythm games in time with the boss/stage's theme to keep some level of interaction without making it just a long cutscene.\n\nStill needs a bit more fleshing out in my head.

oqa48x|Long-term turn based map-based strategy game|How I had the idea: I enjoy games I can play for ~10 minutes a day and work towards a long term goal. It's why I have Civilization saves that last years, and I set up ongoing chess games that anybody in my family can play a turn on when they walk past. However, I feel like the aspects of Civ that makes it hard to have long-term multiplayer games are some of the non-military parts like culture and tourism. I was trying to think of a game that takes aspects of Civ but streamlines it for a long-term type of game, and this is what I came up with!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nCore idea 1: Earthlike map. I am debating on whether the "world" (animals, biomes, cultures) should stay earthlike or be more fantasy, but having the main structure (Shapes of the land and bodies of water, as well as mountains and deserts) of the map is important to me because I feel like the shapes and terrain the Earth naturally creates leads to really interesting war situations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nCore Idea 2: Emphasis on Infrastructure. Cities in this game could rely on geography and location to determine what strategical value they hold. Have a city right next to an important front? Use it to create (train?) troops and get them to the front lines faster. Have a city next to a mineral rich area? Set up mines. Cities deep in your controlled territory maybe can be used to research better technology, lead the way politically, or finance your ongoing wars. Taking an important territory or city should be extremely impactful, both because of how much coordination is needed and the rewards after. Taking land should put wind in a player's sails and put the opponent on the back foot unless a well coordinated defense supported by infrastructure is set up by the defender. Remember, in this game, you play the "long game." Since regions and cities are so customizable on what they produce, I think maybe drawing your own state lines could be help with this, but maybe would be too complicated (?).\n\nCore Idea 3: Streamlined mechanics. I really want to stress this one. In Civ, you have to create science production to research faster. In this, new tech and advancements shouldn't need science to speed them up, they are just a set time (but require money?). Economy should not be overbearing, and the main part of the game should be moving troops around your fronts, like chess pieces on a chess board, occupying a territory or city as a whole, not a specific part of a territory (like a chess piece occupies a square). Not sure if influence should be a mechanic, with fringe territories turning to the opponent's side.\n&gt;\nPlease give advice: I am not sure if a lot of things are right for a turn based game like this. Should there even be a tech tree if I'm trying to make it streamlined? Should there be an emphasis on infrastructure? What are some ways to shape this multiplayer, long-term, combat game?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nDesign ideas: These are in no way concrete, just ideas on my vision of the game. The graphics style would be nice if it was kind of like Age of Empires 4, or the For Honor map. The time period could be older, or more modern, which would dictate things like railroads vs. roads, and tanks vs horses. If the game was fantasy, I think having dinosaurs that could be ridden as horse type creatures could be cool, but that's just an idea. I also think unique cultures not found in human history could be interesting, but could maybe be bought with a currency I mention below instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nImportant mechanics: Since this is a long term game, it could end when a player controls all territories, or when players agree to a "treaty." The treaty mechanic could rely on a currency that doesn't affect the actual gameplay, but can buy skins and maps outside the main game (in the menus). The player who was winning would want to negotiate a treaty where they get more land, as that yields more of this currency, and the player(s) who are losing would want to negotiate a treaty where they regain more land. The catch is, after a certain amount of back and forth, if a treaty is not met, both players have their currency rewards halved or something of that nature.\n&gt;\nI will add more ideas as they come, but this took me a while, so an upvote would be appreciated so more people can see my idea. Furthermore, questions and advice, as well as ideas of your own would be awesome.
oq89dy|Call of Duty: Civil War|an alternate time line where it is 1935 and America is plunged the second American civil war by the new communist  confederacy of western states. the east and part of the mid west  become the united states of freedom. when world war 2 roles around the free states ally with the allies and the confederate states ally with Russia and the axis.
oq7pw2|Building game focused on the enviorment|I thought of an game where you build an emipre of Industry, Society and Military while the actions of the player heavily influence the enviorment. Like you can build Windturbines connected to a water container, peoducing hydrogen to store energy(which would be more expensive) OR you could build nuclar power plants to get energy but radiating the enviorment which is costs less.\n\nI also thought of an aliance type thingy like with Anno or Civilisation but with a twist. Though being in a non war contract, your allies could backstab and attack you. The AI could use two tactics the, what I call the 'Roman way', all open assault where it just throws it units at you, and the modern tactic with strategic attacks of well equiped units specialized for one action like attack, boobytraping etc. .\n\nAs I think the Industry and Military aspect are very big and I want to make a fun game to play either way you can choose the Society aspect will be narrowed to Loyality, room to live, as well as food and water. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever though I think I have the core idea fleshed out quite good, I have no idea in which scenario to put it in. Current times, Ancient long died out forgotten species, Warhammer 40K like or in the future. \n\nI am not that idea full and would love things to add or scenarios you would like to see the project in.
oq6rps|a new TTRPG called Exile|But not just any Table Top Role Playing Game it’s one about cryptozoologists who get isekai’d into a dimension where all of Earth’s Cryptids and Fearsome Critters come from. Perhaps the rules could be based on Dungeons and Dragons?
oq6r9d|game idea: life simulator/gta kind of thing.|The game will be called “Republic” in this game it takes place in a large city (maybe even a few different cities could be created) in a project zombies type view without the darkness inside buildings. the goal of the game is that everyone has a role to play, whether it be a teacher, cop, stock broker, serial killer… the game can be an online version (with A.I in case of server lacking players) of real life. and if you get caught doing crimes you could go to prison etc… you can escape jail (takes skill). there will be presets on the main menu of different starter characters if you do not wanna make your own.\n\npresets: \n\nhigh school student \ndrug dealer/manufacturer \npolice officer \nkiller \n\nalso in this game you can pay for properties such as homes (willing to take suggestions) \n\nthis is all i have for right now. \ni hope this game gets created.
oq4054|Game Idea: Monastic Simulator|Have you ever wondered what's the deal with monastiscism? What do monks and nuns practice and what are they up to, for real?\n\nAll these questions and more can be answered by Monastic Simulator, a silly, but teachable game for docile players who wants nothing more than to run your own monastery. Choose between a total of two races: monks or nuns. Participate in celibacy by not participating in sexual intercourse, or do and earn some points but make sure the head-monk/nun doesn't see you! Increase your monastery and add a shop, get an economy going. Add more buildings, do your church service, invite guests, upgrade your monk/nun with better abilities, maybe buy a cloak or spend your points on a new wimple or cape. Wager wars on competing monasterys, send spies to infiltrate other monasteries and by the end of the day maybe you succeed to take command over other monasteries by killing with head nun/monk with a pitchfork level three.\n\nThis is something me and a friend came up with while playing Graveyard Keeper which is kind of similar game in term of sillyness.
oq30pl|A Rogue-like Multi-player Spore Type Game|A game kinda like Spore, but you only get a few options of body parts based on what you currently have. Simple body parts unlock more complex body parts to choose from. However at each evolution point you can only choose 1 upgrade. If your species dies that body part becomes soft locked (for that species only, subsequent species are free to go that route). Each body part leads to a new tree of body parts available, the only way to evolve is to get food. \n\nStart at the single cell phase and move up to more complex life. A species is kinda like starting a character. Each life stage is effectively locked to that life stage so players can play the part they want to at any time.\n\nHave a species map that shows the progression of all species ever made on an account using game stats. It would mostly be a neat visual for the player to see what worked and what didn't.
oq0epf|Gun building/designer where you'll make guns for the military and/or civilian market|I take inpiration for this idea from Mikhail Kalashnikov's story of how he designed the AK-47.\n\nThe game would have different ways to start a game, like: \n\n&gt;2-3 campaigns (in places like USA, Germany and Russia, though it's up to the developer) where specific objectives have to be completed each level, obviously.\n\n&gt;custom singleplayer game where you can start your career in any country (any region if that country is under foreign control) with your custom company name on logo in any year in 10 year intervals.\n\n&gt;Optional. A multiplayer where multiple players, totaling up to 10, can either work together or compete to become the best gun designer and company.\n\nThe game's time period would be from 1900 to 2050/2100, making it roughly a 200 year long gun history. As you might imagine, you'd start with bolt-action rifles, pistols, revolvers etc., go on to assault rifles, semi-auto rifles and such, to finally some kind of futuristic guns.\n\nThe game could also go on a bit of an ahistorical path like the USSR losing because you made efficient  enough guns for Germany or a country's independance is preserved becuase the local (yours) gun producer helped to make efficient guns.\n\nGun designing should be pretty lenient/option rich, like wether to use a wooden or metal stock, maybe even a synthetic one if you have the tech, what metal to make it out of? steel, straight up iron, cast iron??, aluminium, your choice.
opzhvj|A game with a hangover type premises|A nice, simple idea. Take a load of randomly generated scenarios with variables like "at (location) you did (action) with (item) to/with (person)" and huge list of those variables and you have a scenario, and take 5 or six of these random scenarios and you have the entire timeline of the previous night. \n\nThe story is, on a Saturday morning, you wake up hungover with no memory of the night before, and have to make your way around a free roaming city trying to price together what happened the previous night in order to retrieve something (we'll just say your wallet or something)\n\nYou have 48 in game hours (because your character has to work on Monday at an unspecified office job) to work out what happened by finding clues around an open world city for example, you've woken up with a statue from the park and have to go to the park and ask around, maybe sneak into the security hut to find the CCTV, or maybe you left another clue there like your jacket with a takeaway menu from a restaurant in the pocket, thus sending you to your next location.\n\nDue to your character still being technically drunk, you can't drive anywhere, and you have to make your way around on public transport or maybe doing little side missions for friends in return for a lift here and there, or can encounter a bicycle or something. For the first few hours of the game, navigation and conversations ( multiple path conversations with a skill level that slowly rises as the hangover wears off) are harder until you've completely sobered up.\n\nIf you fail to locate your wallet in time, the game ends with you being unable to get to work on the Monday and your boss angrily ringing up to fire you. If you DO manage to find it in time, you manage to get to work where a coworker comments on you looking rough and your character saying something like "I've had a crazy weekend, this is what happened.." as the voice becomes muffled and the camera pans over a newspaper on a table summarising your hijinks, your general stats of the playthrough etc, all in a front page story and when you've pressed next, your co-worker grabs the paper saying "better shred this so the boss doesn't see it" implying you'd have been fired if they knew.\n\nThat's it generally. I think it could be a fun game in any format. Phone, VR, console, whatever.and with the amount of variables, each playthrough  would be completely different, and if it's done with comical variables, the end result of each scenario can result in a hilarious situation.
opycy4|Evolution Game|I've had the idea kicking around for awhile regarding a game that allows you to build the world's ecosystem and watch as it plays itself out. This game could be incredibly simple, or Ark/NMS level complex.\n\nThe basic idea is this: Using an options menu, you can design plants and animals, selecting where they go on the food chain, their habitat, etc etc. Once you have created your creature, it becomes an actual mob on the games planet, and you can watch as it flourishes or dies out, depending on whether the ecosystem it prefers is strong enough to support it making its own niche.\n\nFor example, I want to make a large pachyderm herbivore, which lives in savannas and eats exclusively a shrub-esque grass I've already created. I have to use my judgement on when to introduce this creature, because if there is not enough of this wild grass they will die out. If there is too much grass, the herbivores population will explode to the point the grass is driven extinct, followed closely by our lovely papcyderm.\n\nSay that second scenario takes place, Pachyderms are multiplying rapidly while their food source dwindles. Time to create a carnivore to balance out the systems. Rinse and repeat until you have created a stable ecosystem. \n\nThere could also be random events such as natural disasters, disease, and other circumstances that throw a curveball at your perfect balancing act.\n\nThoughts?

opwh0o|Need help with Game Mechanic ( Nuclear throne etc style ) - Tales|&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi Guys. I always hang around here and must say what a great community.!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my game story Idea has been set out. It takes place in very tales.\n\n   \n**Story**  \nTales  of the world has been forgotten. But there is a reason for it. They all  have been captured and only a few left. When the last story characters  has been captured the offering will start and the BAD ENEMY WARLORD NAME  HERE will cross the tales realm to our realm to enslave all mankind.  \n\n\nPlayer  enters this lost library.  First he find a open book. ( Tutorial  mission ). Player enters and start going thru levels like Nuclear  throne.  Every enemy you kill gives you some part of the missing pages  in the book ( XP ) until your player Transforms into the Character of  the  Tale he is in ( Acting as a second live ). If the player looses a  life  he will transform back into a normal character. Save the Librarian  who is actually a Wizzard tasked to protect the Tales. ( Or Is he )  \n\n\nPlayer is tasked to save some of the key Tales. as Follow.   \n\n\nPlayer enters **Robin Hoods Book**. When gaining XP he will turn into the **HOOD** for  the second life and for a 3rd Live the player can randomly turn into  any of the unlocked characters. Final boss for area ( The Sherrif ).  Beat him and the HOOD is unlocked and in the Library.  \n\n\nThen player enters **Wonderland**. Enough XP and Player turn into **ALICE**....  \nHave perma death with somethings carrying over.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot some more level ideas. But you get the flow of things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was my concept. But Now thinking my XP idea is jsut bad... Dont like it,  Player can't choose character.\n\nThe problem. The Game Mechanic. What is the mechanic. It has no mechanic.... Just a twin stick shooter at this point. I have some prototypes already.  Will post some screenshot below. Generic gameplay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMechanic Ideas for a twin stick shooter? \n\n* Player tendency has good and bad? Yes a mechanic but what is the implication of good and bad in the games context?\n* Give some reason for the player to shoot and not to shoot? Limited ammo? Get charged by stands with books on it at random points? Enemy drops pages that is health or ammo? Other wise the game can just constantly shoot.\n* Collect Something on each level? Wait this is not a mechanic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA crap really need your help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="WByHdJS" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="[//imgur.com/WByHdJS](//imgur.com/WByHdJS)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="0YcebIE" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="[//imgur.com/0YcebIE](//imgur.com/0YcebIE)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="nuKTzJ3" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="[//imgur.com/nuKTzJ3](//imgur.com/nuKTzJ3)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
opvx83|Let's Destroy Everything!|The idea is to have levels full of items and tools(from baseball bats and crowbars to rocket launchers. There are two game mods:\n\n1.

opuonq|A dog agility racing video game!|Feel free to use this idea\n\nI don’t know whether or not you’re familiar with dog agility races, but they’re really fun to watch. Dogs are timed as their handlers lead them through an obstacle course that includes ramps, cones, slalom poles, tunnels, bars to jump over and more. In these competitions, dogs usually race one at a time, and they’re scored based on accuracy and speed.  In the game that I envision, the obstacle course is larger, wider, and designed for up to 8 dogs to race at once. This means that there would be multiples of some things like several lanes for the pole weaving, larger tunnels, and wider ramps.  If an obstacle is missed, then the dog doesn’t lose points for it, but must go back and re-do it. The first dog that reaches the finish line wins.  Also, in this game the handlers are absent, so it’s just the dogs on the agility course.  In each game, the layout of the course should be different, and the placement of the obstacles should be different. Some games might even include pools that dogs need to swim through.\n\nThere should be numerous breeds of dogs. The more the better. It’s possible that the game could be designed so that different breeds have different running speeds and different maneuverability stats, but it might be a better idea if all dogs are equal.\n\nPlayers can either play against the computer, or log on to Dog Net and race against other people. If friends want to log on and play against each other, then they can create their own private game. When you log onto Dog Net, you can either join a public game, or start your own private game where others can join if they have your password (which you would create when you start the game). \n\nAs far as controls are concerned, this game requires several buttons, so it would be best on either a computer or a gaming system. The joystick or arrow keys can orient your dog in any direction, one button would be for running in the direction that you’re aiming, and one for jumping. The height of the jump would be based on how long you hold the jump button down, which is important since some obstacles would require higher jumps than others. When you take your finger off the running button, you will come to a stop.  If the controller has the right buttons, then there could also be side buttons that enable the dog to veer right or left, which would help in the slalom poles.\n\nThe background can be in an outdoor grassy setting, in an indoor stadium, on the beach, in the snow, or in the city.  Backgrounds can be chosen randomly, or by the player that initiates the game.\n\nAs an extra, there should be a dog library tab with information on all the different dog breeds.  This should be accessible from the intro screen.\n\n[https://i0.wp.com/www.dgpforpets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Canyonview-Sheltie-shelties-puppy-shetland-sheepdog-Kelowna-BC-CKC-Canadian-Kennel-Club-dog-breeder-Penticton-Kamloops-British-Columbia-Saskatoon-Saskatchewan-Alberta-Canada-agility-161.jpg?ssl=1](https://i0.wp.com/www.dgpforpets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Canyonview-Sheltie-shelties-puppy-shetland-sheepdog-Kelowna-BC-CKC-Canadian-Kennel-Club-dog-breeder-Penticton-Kamloops-British-Columbia-Saskatoon-Saskatchewan-Alberta-Canada-agility-161.jpg?ssl=1)
opuit3|Would this be good RPG battle mechanics?|It's how I thought of battles and how you level up, imagine it being a turn based RPG like Lisa or off. But you can see what the enemy will do next turn, all it's stats and how much damage it will do and its effects.\n\nThe catch is your equally as weak or weaker than them, but you might have a few skills up your sleeve, you might have a skill that can turn the battle. And you don't get stronger as you level up, you just gain more skills. (As life is in general)\n\nA example is that You can hit harder for more mana or cure a debuff. The battle's winner is on who can adapt the most, prevent the enemy from dealing to much damage or applying to much buffs or debuffs.\n\nAs you level up you can do the same as the enemies but it's a test to see who can do it better, they might have better buffs and stats but you can see what they can do and about to do next turn.\n\nThought it would require alot of playtesting, I would like to see a game like this happen. Would gladly help with ideas to.

oprz06|Red Rectangle Rampage (a meme game tbh)|Red Rectangle Rampage would be a 3D platformer starring a Red Rectangle (no joke, it’s just a red Rectangle.). I’ll call him Red.\n\nRed would go through different levels and worlds with different gimmicks and weird textures and memes. A common theme is Dream. There would be 8 worlds and 8 levels in each.\n\nThe main baddie is a giant Cylinder that reads, “Ur Mom is Dumb,” and is named Jeffrey. In order to defeat him you must push Dream’s Manhunt Videos at him. First encounter (1-8) would require 1 video pushed, Second (5-8) would require 3 videos pushed, and The final (8-8) would required 5 videos.\n\nJeffrey would have little spherical goons that do certain things depending on their color.\n\nPink ones charge at you, Purple ones throw balls at you, Blue ones have a diamond sword, green ones explode on impact, etc.\n\nThere would be Mini Bosses as well, One for each world. I can explain more in the comments if wanted. I don’t want the post to be too long!\n\nGimmicks I’ve imagined so far are buttons that spawn a timed bridge for 10 seconds, moving platforms, cannons with the Dream logo (inverted) on them, crate buttons, and doors that must have something done to open. \n\nJokes would include Among Us, Dream (logo, smp, catchphrases, videos, etc.), corrupted texture, Minecraft mobs, world problems, etc.\n\nIf the player falls off the level or gets hit, they would explode. There should also be a button for it.\n\nIf anyone needs more info for development or just plain curious (most likely second option), let me know where and I’ll go into more detail.\n\n(If I messed up flairs, let me know and I’ll fix them)
oppydp|A multiplayer survival horror game where spooks trigger for individual players separately.|What if the scares/events in a multiplayer horror game didn't always trigger for all players, but sometimes only one or two at a time? e.g. one player experiences a jumpscare, but the other three only see/hear a normal environment. If done right, this could mix in disorientation and uncertainty into the multiplayer experience and give the effect of some, or all, they players going mad ("What do you mean you didn't see it?? It was right there!")\n\nThis idea could be expanded on too. Perhaps the clues of the game could give each player conflicting information, creating ingroup tension as the players try to work out who has the real answer. Maybe a random minority of players can see the monsters while the others can't, so they have to act to warn/protect their friends.
opor49|The game about sandwiches and shootouts...|The game is called sandwich 2, the sequel to sandwich. It starts in the a sandwich shop. A customer comes in and gives you an order. You have a short time to review it, then the countdown begins. You have a very limited time to make the sandwich, its a speed run style game. If you make the sandwich in time, the customer pays you and leaves, but if you don't finish in time or mess up the order then that customer will appear in the final shootout. There is 10 orders in the day, and in the end the customers who's sandwich you messed up come to attack you. For example, if you mess up all 10 orders there is 10 people attacking you, but if you only mess up 1 then only 1 person attacks you, giving incentive to try and get it right. In the final shootout, everyone has guns. There could be different types of customers who have pistols or rpgs and so on, but if you win the fight then you keep the money you made that day which you can use to upgrade your restaurant, but if you die then you lose the money and have to try again. If you get all the sandwiches right in the day then there is no shootout and you keep the money you made + a 20% bonus. When upgrading your restaurant, you can upgrade it normally, like new kitchen appliances or tables which could give bonuses like a slightly longer time to make the sandwich, or you can buy things to help with the shootout  like turrets or bulletproof glass, or you can buy guns for your load out that you can access during the shootout. \n\nI know its pretty dumb but thats kind of the idea, and it could be fun. What do you think, and do you have any more ideas for it?
opmoha|an adventure/horror game from my dreams!|I saw this in one of my dreams a couple years back and it was such a good dream,it stood with me since. I recently dreamed it again and remembered it again now that im browsing the sub. *Long post ahead!*\n\nI am mainly looking for improvement and extra ideas as i was planning to make this game myself. Heres the idea: \n\n##Story\n\nYou are a highschool student and you are on a school trip to a old manor for a couple days. The manor is filled with mysteries and puzzles and the guy that runs the manor is a really weird guy. (Its like Harry Potter and his school dynamic) \n\n##Mechanics\n\n&amp;gt; These were all in my dream so dont blame me please.\n+ Its like a Persona day/night system, you hang out with your school friends, eat your 3 meals, join tours, follow your teachers, dont be suspicious. when the night falls and you guys go back to your guest house, your adventure begins. You sneak into manor, check each room by room find some codes, avoid staff/owner, solve puzzles, basic horror game stuff.\n+ You find some weird things happening, stuff disappearing overnight. You have to ability to tell these stuff to any of your school mates. They all have different buffs/debuffs to give you. Some might not believe, your roommate might cover for you during day so you can go on extra adventures, tech friend might give you cameras, lock picks. However the game gets harder the more people you tell, the owner gets suspicious of you over time, he stumbles into you at night etc etc.\n+ New mechanics/enemies introduced overtime like a hidden part of the house behind a bookshelf/under a shed. \n\n##Video\n\n+ I dreamed this with Thief(2011) graphics but something like Hello Neighbor also makes sense. \n\nSorry for the long post! Tell me what you think of this please!

opkqm6|Robot Logic Gladiators|I’ve had the idea to try and make a small robot battling game from a top down 2d perspective. The game’s main focus would be basically simple robot battles in an arena.

ofbztb|I need help on deciding what to do for my game|So I don’t know if this belongs here, and I don’t know if this’ll break any rules but basically, without spoiling too much, my friends and I (mostly me) have been making this F.E.A.R. inspired game for years. Technically it started development before I played F.E.A.R. but right now I have the story finalized and the environments planned. The problem is is I’m not sure what to do gameplay wise. I’m using the FPS Creator engine (grew up using it and basically know it’s ins and outs, plus I started developing this idea on it back when I was in middle school) and after constant revisions and remakes, I have two ideas. \n\nThe first idea is a more old school corridor shooter with fairly basic AI; this will work best for my friends who are not avid PC gamers or gamers in general. The second idea is more of a mix of F.E.A.R. 2 and Call of Duty, with fast paced battles but slow atmospheric buildup, and more intelligent AI. Here’s the problem I have though. This idea I have, is to make an anthology horror franchise, with this first (or second if you want to count my demo as the first part) game being an homage to F.E.A.R., if by nothing else concept alone. I’ve already made several ideas for other games in this universe, but I can’t decide between the more classic feel or the more modern feel. \n\nThe classic feel would work but I’m not sure it would be as much fun to a more hardcore audience. I’m not going to lie and say my atmospheric buildup is great and the voice acting is spectacular, both are, I’ll admit, not as good as they could be, although one can be excused because the voice actors are all graduated high school students. The casual shooter is finished, for the most part. A few bugs here and there that I’ll have to work out and I’ll have to place the voice acting in once I’ve finished mixing it. But it’s basically done. \n\nAs for the more modern game, this would be a lot of fun, especially with this AI designed for this type of gameplay. The problem is is I’d have to completely redo the entire game in order for this work. The AI is similar to that of F.E.A.R., and needs more of an open area to work properly. Old school corridor shooter wouldn’t work well. And here’s the other problem. FPS Creators memory issues. The program was created in 2005 for windows XP and it still has the XP mindset, meaning that a game using a lot of fancy shaders, graphics and scripting would take up a lot of space of the limited memory in the program. And I’m afraid if I do this idea, I’ll have to cut MASSIVE parts of the game for the sake of finishing it, in addition to completely remaking it. I’m afraid I bit off more than I can chew with the story (which isn’t anything super crazy but has a TON of working parts.) \n\nI’m not sure what to do. Make the weaker game with a better story or make a better game with a more compressed story? I’ve been working on this concept since 2010, I’ve poured my heart and soul into it. I’ve rewritten the story hundreds of times, remade the game dozens of times, and restarted so many times, I have all these different anthology stories and games mostly finished, all of which are revolving around this first title that’s supposed to be the Gateway hub of the entire universe. I mean I’ve made concepts for prequel adventures, sequels, spin offs, etc. all of which are incorporating all these ideas I have. But I want people to enjoy the first title, the gateway to this world. And I’m not sure what to do. Throw all my best mechanics out from the get go or start simple and have the game improve gradually as I finalize them. Please give me some advice because this is super exhausting to think about.
ofb5d0|New Stealth Game Idea|What about a stealth game where your character has chronic diarrhea? You’d have to get to a bathroom every so often or risk getting caught. Sometimes if you don’t it make just be a fart so you can chance it, other times you will submerge the whole floor.
of6kl7|A mix between a card game an RPG and a shooting game(very weird combo I know)|so basically id imagine it playing something like legends of Runteria or Yugioh with card effects spells and all that but whenever you're in combat like the duel phase in Yugioh it turns into a shooter/RPG with cards now having different effects and having there own special gun and abilities and so on you kill someone in duel phase their card gets discarded. that's as much as a got right now. (have no idea how you would pull it off thou)
of5vn4|Revamp some good Oldies|So, hear me out on this. Maybe not a lot of you know these games, but Armored Core and Chrome Hounds were my two favorite games before I started playing on PS4. However now they aren't really...enjoyable. What if someone could modernize the graphics into 4k, add more story, rework the customization and make, in essence, a second Armored Core. Same thing goes for Chrome Hounds. I thought the customization and different parts you could get and the enemies you fought in Chrome Hounds, as a experimental military vehicle, was outstanding. \n\nPlease, someone get this to the nearest game designer and have them look at it. Besides titalfall, there weren't very many mech games that I seem to enjoy. Nothing like those.
of58w7|A glitchy AAA game, where you glitch between the years 1910 and 2070|Hi guys, I'm extremely new to game design, but I've been thinking about this one idea for my university project (I cannot express this enough, it will be snippets, and maybe you can roam around a room MAXIMUM)\n\nWhat if, there was 1 constant game (story, NPC interaction, signage, map etc), but, one had the aesthetic of the 1910's, and the other in 2070. \n\nE.g.  \n1910, french lady with a coffee smoking a cigarette\n2070, new age zoomer with monster zero and a vape.\n\nSignage, where 1910 was a billboard, but 2070 was a hologram\n\nWeapons, same stats, different aesthetics, sounds, experiences\n\nAnd the story, characters were the exact same, but the skins glitches between the two\n\nFirstly, is this even possible to have something in a GTA vibe, but have it glitch in and out of art styles\n\nSecondly, I'm sure this isn't a new idea, if you can recommend any precedents that would be greatly appreciated\n\nThirdly, cool right?\n\nThank you
of4ptv|Racing Game Idea|So I've seen a lot of racing games, and none of them have what I want all in one, so I thought I would share my own idea. First off, we need a lot of cars. Like a lot. Next we need good customization for every or most cars, similar to nfs heat, but better. Next I want to include not only the option to race, but to just casually drive around too. We need lots of things to do, and we will need a big map. I'm talking 5 times as big as nfs heats map, and the option to download custom maps and races. Then we need a custom race track creator, and one that's really good too, and not like most custom map creation tools like Tony hawks pro skater games. Kinda like skyrim modding but in the racing game, where on PC there would be no big restrictions for assets, but on console only using assets the base game provides. And the most needed thing is a solid multi-player. We need many options for online play, racing, free driving, time trials, 1v1 races, battles kinda like Mario Kart (dunno how it would work yet) and the ability to play people's online maps with other people (kinda like team fortress 2 servers). This is just a rough idea, and I think it would all fit in to a game that's AAA. It would need lots of work to do properly too lol. Lemme know if this is a shit idea or a good one, cuz I have lots more to add. TL;DR: cool racing game with lots of customization and the ability to choose how you play easily.
of38lz|Daredevil game where you *as the player* are blind.|This would be unlike any other game and it is stupidly easy to mess it up but it could be amazing if executed right. \n\nIn fairness the player would be able to see while free running and in cutscenes. Free running would be based off a much tamer world on fire perspective we saw on the show while cutscenes would just be standard cutscenes.\n\n\nCombat is where things would go black, not completely black as you will visual UI, indicators to help inform the player, and some very archaic visuals just to give players a small amount of context of where they are, add on some brightly colored intractable objects to give the game sleeping dogs.  Outside of visual indicators audio queoes will be the bulk of combat challenges, this may sound simple but you can add depth to it and make it an original type of fighting game. Of course the sounds will be heavily overdone which actually fits the daredevil lore. A knife for example will make a very specific sound once a guy is about to attack you, a visual indicator will show where the attack is coming from, and then you'll need to use the dodge mechanoc to avoid the attack, add on other mechanics like guns and enemies throwing objects and tough guys and there could be a lot of challenge coming from combat that is 90% audio. Visual,  Beating heartbeats will be shown to tell the player where enemies are in relation to them and a heartbeater counter as UI will tell them how many enemies there are to beat. The hearts will even start visible beating harder to show the player when they are about to go for an attack. Once the player finishes a fight we'll show them a replay of the entire fight but with actual visuals to let them see how much of a badass they really are, think superheat for this.\n\nI know this entire game does sound convoluted and like I said it's VERY easy to mess up. But it has a lot of potential and could be really rhythmic and exciting if done well.
oeyzad|Chao garden mobile game?|I had a loose idea after watching a YouTube video, and all I got is a chao garden from the sonic series on your phone, cause chao are cute, and who doesn't love cute?\n\nI imagine it would be a combination of maybe gacha and puzzle levels to obtain items to give chao, or to get new chao in general. \n\nCould also be a Mario run style platformer where you can run one way and can take multiple paths to get all the items in a level. If it's actually sonic, and not a knock off or custom made series, I think this would work well enough. Not to mention, you could unlock multiple characters to run through levels.\n\nAgain, loose idea, and wanted to share it somewhere, and here seemed like the best place to do so. \n\nSidenote : I am not a programmer or developer of any kind, just have random ideas :)

At least, that's my original idea, but I also like the idea of completely scratching the war aspect and making it more of a multiplayer customizable game where you can craft new things for your own little beaver hut and invite others to your home.\nThe graphics will be simple and 2d, with the bottom levels being water with floating hunks of elements like iron and coal to mine.

oetpqz|Guys I am making a game please tell me how it is. Please. Will it be fun? Please tell me what do you guys think?|This is a 2D top-down stealth game. This is not a platformer. It is level based. There will be different chapters and in each chapters, there will be a number of levels. We play as [Bubo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xn0WVS3mZ4c5ljg-I7bxpWRqq-Ls9qnB/view?usp=sharing) a small slime like creature(maybe I'll change his appearance to something better). Our objective is to save [Gugy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWWhPnI479KluPpqDWSmRR-5r3PWtHrx/view?usp=sharing) (who is bubo's girlfriend) from other "evil qunos". Qunos is their species name. There will be ghost qunos, ninja qunos, bomb qunos.. etc as enemies. Each enemies will have special powers. For example, ninjas can throw ranged weapons etc..  Evil qunos will be travelling along a path, guarding a key to the next room(level). We should stealthly move throught the level and take the key and escape the to the next room. Our enemies can't look back. (Like in pacman) There are things in the level to distract them. And there will be teleporting points in the room to teleport to another point in the room. \n\nThese are my current ideas. Do you guys have any recommendations or ideas for any addition features? If any, then please inform me. Pls Pls Pls

oeqyz4|A hypothetical game idea|I've been pitching a game idea for months for a world building project made by C. M. Kosemen and Simon Roy called "A World of Dinosauroids."\nI was very fascinated by the amount of lore of this world building project that I can't help but think what if there would be a game based on it.\n\nMy hypothetical game would be a survival game that takes inspiration from Subnautica and Death Stranding.\n\nI can't list everything I have in my mind otherwise I would be writing a whole bible so I might want to make multiple parts based on the basic game mechanics for like maybe every 4 days or I'm gonna make weekly updates for my ideas.\n\n\nAnyways. What kind of game would you design based on this project? Let me know! I'm eager to hear your thoughts and ideas in the comments!\n\nHeres the link to the website:\n\n[A World of Dinosauroids](http://cmkosemen.com/dinosauroids.html)
oeq1il|Football manager style wrestling management game|I'm certain someone already posted this at some point. But does it exist? Something like hiring wrestlers, managers, doctors, refs, booking matches,  booking venues, custom wrestling promotion style, custom belts/championships/tournament/PPVs, long and short term storytelling, match/performance rating system, wrestlers compatibility. stealing talent, loaning talents, contract negotiations, tv ratings, PPV buy ratings, and stuff like that. Like a football manager but for wrestling.
oenft8|County life or sheriff simulator.|I've had this idea for a while but haven't really obtained the skills to make a full out game. I personally grew up in a small town in northern Idaho. I understand some may think this is too big for an Independent dev, but I think some may want to attempt or take from my idea. I've always wanted to play a police simulator game based in a rural setting. I got the idea from playing my summer car a few years back. I thought how cool it would be to have a more in depth game that went over a sheriff's everyday life.\n\nThe game itself I don't think should be story driven but more decision driven possibly, but in depth enough with encounters that it keeps the player engaged.\n\nA few things I think would/should be involved to make it more in depth are: \nDon't make the player the actual sheriff, but make them the deputy or include multiple modes where you're the sheriff and are the shot caller, or you're the deputy and are on call;\n Possibly involve two different difficulties, one with a food, water, health, etc. and another without such for the players that just want a police simulator;\nMultiple towns, I think two - three small towns with 5 to 10 minutes of modest driving in between them would give it that county/rural feel, especially with a logging area and a few farms along the way;\nHousing, I think a few options with rent to pay would give it a good life simulation feel;\nBusinesses, I think each town should have multiple businesses that each have wares for the players to buy, such as a diners, grocery stores, or gas stations for food. A dealership for personal vehicles. This can really go anywhere for businessess.\n\nI have a few more ideas that I just think are personal wants, they may actually be useful for the game but I'm not too sure. I'm not too sure if this is too lengthy or something so I'm fully open to the negative replies but nonetheless if you need anymore reply, or add my Snapchat to talk privately :shawnoe32
oen4di|A physics based combat game where different weapons have different scaling properties|For example, weapons that scale with Momentum would do more damage the faster they are moving. This would be really good for weapons like flails or whips. There could also be weapons that scale with Gravity and do more damage the farther they fall. For instance, if you did a plunging attack off a high building using a weapon with an S+ scaling in Gravity, you would just obliterate whatever enemy you land on

oe65s0|Open world history/mythology RPG|\*DISCLAIMER: I dont know if it's possible but if it is it will take a really long time\*\n\nIt's an open world and the map should be the earth, based on where you live is where you should start/spawn. You are going to choose between some classes (Like you do in WoW). The earth should have some houses where you can follow the main story but you can do other things like building your own house just like minecraft, you should be able to chop down trees, eiter the trees drop aplings so you can re-plant them or it could be on automate, dosen't really mather. But as it says in the title it should contain all mythology creatures from all the different countries. Like where i live we have something called Troll, it's a giant that lives in the forrest but if you go to the ocean you might counter the legendary Kraken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope some people understand what type of game this is and i would love to make it but im really bad at programing.
oe5q3e|A Transformers themed battle royale|Simple concept, start as a robot (no vehicle mode) you have to scan a car to enable the vehicle mode.\n\nthe car form is your armour level, so bigger the vehicle the higher the armour, once the armour level is down to zero you have to scan a new car to re up your armour.\n\nweapons can be found in drops. \n\nupgrades or mechanics like pings/rader can be picked up and they get added to the model.\n\nthe "ring" could be the warp gate closing effect from the shows or maybe the rust stuff from the prime show\n\nthen obviously it's giant robots fighting destructible building's and terrain if on earth. but it would be cooler if it was on cybertron. \n\nThe style of war for cybertron / fall of cybertron
oe5hsk|A cactus rolling game. Sonic, in slow motion. Momentum conservation.|You play as a potted cactus that got stuck underground, and is trying to get to the surface.\n\nThe cactus part is sticky, and will attach to objects such as walls, etc... but the pot is not. So you need to gather momentum and keep that momentum in order to keep moving, otherwise you'll get stuck on your side and can't get back up.  \n\n\nIt's basically slow motion sonic, but underground. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo enemies, except there are a bunch of mushrooms that want to be your friend and cheer you on. Little do the mushrooms know that they release poison spores that kill you (so you have to keep moving forward). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to avoid water because cactuses drown, and  you can stand in sun rays that pierced the surface in order to get a speed boost. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly two commands. Jump, and roll.
oe24mw|Space-Prison Boss Rush|Okay so I really love boss fights in video games so I came up with a scenario where you literally just fight a bunch of bosses in a tournament. Here's my idea:\n\nYou have been falsely accused of treasonous acts against the supreme ruler of the universe. Your sentence is to spend the rest of eternity in the Void Colosseum which orbits around a black hole on the outskirts of the solar system. It is essentially a prison where the most dangerous of criminals are sent to fight each other in an endless tournament. The only way out is to make it to the finals and defeat the prison's most powerful opponent. The prisoners are affected by a curse that activates upon death. Their minds are sent back in time to before the fight they died in. You must fight against various monsters, bounty hunters, war machines, demigods, and interstellar beings to make your way up.\n\nSince you are a normal human, you start off with zero combat experience. The most you are given is a dull blade and broken armor. As you fight and die, you gain abilities and combat experience. For example, successfully dodging enough attacks will increase the speed and distance of your dodges, and landing attacks with your weapon will eventually increase that weapon's attack power and speed. As you win more fights, the combatants will become increasingly harder to fight and you will eventually come across an unstoppable opponent who will effortlessly destroy you no matter how much skill you gained from previous fights. At this point, your only two choices are to fight forever, or try to find a way to break the system.
oe12cr|Car-racing MOBA - Dream MOBA combination!| \n\nAlright so here goes my concept of this game.\n\n**Base game** \- Although it would have some futuristic elements, the game would feature open-world realistic elements, cars, destruction etc. Think of the base game as Forza Horizon 4 where the graphics are an eye-candy. So let's take Forza Horizon 4 as the base game.\n\n**Let's add the MOBA flavor now** \-\n\n1. The game would feature laps-based racing on various tracks (similar to FH4)\n2. When a match is found, you'll select from a list of cars (similar to Champions selection screen in League of Legends or any other MOBA)\n3. These cars have their own passive + 2 abilities + 1 ultimate.\n4. The match could feature up to 10 laps (could be variable as per the "fun factor").\n5. When a lap ends, there will be a 15-second freeze (the screen would gray out), quickly giving you options to amp up your gear. The car at the first place would earn more gold than the others and so on. This would feature - a) Leveling up your ability (you can choose to level up one of your 2 abilities, or ultimate ability after the 5th lap) b) Adding a tweak to your car (handling, acceleration, transmission, top speed etc.) c) To give the trailing cars a chance, they will be given a package of nitro boost, with the car at the last place having the most nitro boost. Use the nitro wisely!\n6. If you wreck another car during a lap, you get more gold! So even if you're at the last place, you have more chances to get gold, get stronger and push to the first place.\n7. After the end of every lap, cars heal themselves with 500 health.\n8. Cars also suffer collision damage (from other cars/environment) which means you would need to drive efficiently as well (duh! it's racing after all!). Collision damage from cars is called 'ram damage' = 100 damage (but can be modified by cars' abilities).\n\nWin condition - At the end of the 10 laps or so, the car that crosses the finishing line wins!\n\n**Game modes** \- Given this concept, the game could also feature- 5v5 team-based racing- Destruction derby\n\n**Cars ideas** \- (inspired from Twisted Metal series)\n\n**Spectre "The Special Weapon" (1200 health)**\n\nPassive - Whenever Spectre is tail-gaiting behind a car, it gains a drafting boost, giving it more speed as the drafting continues.  \nQ (12 seconds cooldown) - Spectre goes in auto-pilot for 4 seconds taking full-control of the car. If in range of the car ahead, the auto-pilot would tail-gate to gain a drafting boost and fire a heat missile dealing 150 damage.  \nW (10 seconds cooldown) - Spectre fires a shock missile directly ahead hitting the first car and locking it's steering for 2 seconds. During this time the affected car cannot steer left or right.  \nUltimate - Spectre fires a homing missile locking on to any target ahead of him and dealing 500 + 10% of the missing health as damage. A small HUD would appear to select a target car ahead of Spectre.\n\n**Outlaw "The SWAT Unit" (1400 health)**\n\nPassive - Outlaw can issue "tickets" to high speeding cars by ramming into them. If Outlaw rams into a car speeding over 60 mph (96 kph), it issues a "ticket". When a car stacks over 4 tickets, it suffers a sudden speed loss to 30 mph and is dealt with 200 damage.  \nQ (10 seconds cooldown) - When in range of the car ahead, Outlaw activates it's siren initiating a chase towards that car and gaining +20 mph speed. If Outlaw rams into the car during this time, it issues 2 tickets (can stack with passive).  \nW (9 seconds cooldown) - Outlaw throws a spike strip behind it's path. If a car runs over the spike strip, the speed would decay -20 mph/second for 2.5 seconds and dealing 250 damage.  \nUltimate - Outlaw sounds a loud siren for 2 seconds after which all the cars speeding over 80 mph suffer a sudden shock, slowing the speed down by -40 mph, dealing 400 damage and issuing a ticket.\n\n**Hammerhead "The Monster" (1800 health)**\n\nPassive - Hammerhead has slower speed than other cars but +150 more basic damage (ram damage).  \nQ (8 seconds cooldown) - Hammerhead throws a short-range hook directly ahead. If a car is hooked for 2 seconds, Hammerhead pulls it briefly before ramming into it (100+150 damage).  \nW (10 seconds cooldown) - Hammerhead extends out a long steel barricade for 3 seconds, attached to it's back preventing cars to overtake from left or right.  \nUltimate - Hammerhead turns on the MONSTER mode for 6 seconds, gaining +30 mph speed, +400 ram damage on first hit. If the first hit wrecks the enemy car, an extra 2 seconds are added to the MONSTER mode.

odvfzu|Survival Horror Game Where You Get to do Actual Work|Okay, so this is going to sound a bit cliche but I have attached a link to this post which shows a demonstration of how a VR environment can be used  for work [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrHWZVMugo&amp;ab\_channel=RedStapler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrHWZVMugo&amp;ab_channel=RedStapler)\n\nNow imagine if someone could implement a survival horror game such as FNAF where you have to stay in one place whilst also being able to interact with your work environment. Some problems of course would be trying to concentrate whilst also being on edge for potential jumpscares. But it was just an idea I would like to share.   \n\n\nIf anyone has other ideas for VR office spaces it would be cool if you wrote them down below\n\nThanks!
odu9kc|The walking dead: walkers world|The basic idea is that it's an open world extreme survival game\n\nYou create your own character and give them different attributes (similar to fallouts S.P.E.C.I.A.L system) with fitting choices to the world  and theme \n\nThe game would take place (if it were possible) a almost full scale America\n\nClans can be made \nAs well as camps/facilities which can be made with recourses found in the world \nNPC's can be gained from helping them in cities etc. And gaining them to your base would be an option\n\nIf enough Npc survivors can be found you can start trading arrangements with other clans , but things can go wrong with these trips as they are Npc ran so natural occurrences could happen such as problems like walker attacks or other multiplayer people/ clans attack the vehicles the NPCs use \n\nYou could start trading gear with clans without using the game feature of using NPC's, for safer negotiations but the Npc trading drives are just to save the player time \n\nResources could be very hard to find but farming and engineering can be done by using either NPC's or using your characters own skills \n\nUnlike later seasons walkers will be common to see as many games like dayz have zombies but they are never a threat due to them being mostly non apparent in gameplay \n\nEventually herds of walkers will start to appear but they will mostly be on highway areas \n\nWalkers will mostly be attracted to players due to noise mostly game chat or gun shots \n\nAs places such as camps when so much game chat starts eventually walkers will be attracted\n\nCars will be a huge part of this game as unlike in most games storage is reflected in a realistic manner and travel will take long amounts of time travelling to long distance locations \n\nMost if not all cars are fully built when a server is started but over time people will start taking parts such as tires and batteries, fuel will be hard to find (not as hard as dayZ as it's near impossible to use cars) \n\nIn gameplay unless NPC's or online players are killed in a head location they will eventually turn (online players won't have control of the walker version of them) \n\nThat's basically it, this is a game that would basically only be possible in a perfect world 😅😅 but it's still a cool idea I wanted to share please don't hate
odszix|SMALL CREATURES survival game|all survival games need a gimmick dinosaur, post-apocalypse, zombies again.. and much more\n\nbut for the longest time, I have always wanted a survival game based on the creatures you would find in your back garden and living the hidden lives of those animals. I thought the idea of playing as an animal was dead in the water as for years nobody ever picked up the idea until The isle game along no doubt helped by the new boom in dinosaurs media. But unfortunately, bugs and little creatures aren't as interesting, and projects that attempt to make survival games based on such a premise but with arthropods as the main focus often get ruined. a few examples were insect kingdom where the dev demanded 100,000 to finish the game despite providing bare bones and in my opinion, unengaging and terrible game mechanics and Ant simulator which had all its funding spent away by shady people who apparently betrayed the lead developer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\napparently, the universe hates this idea but new hope came when I saw the trailer for grounded only to realize your not gonna play as bugs but a bunch of annoying kids. So you know what I'm gonna issue a challenge to develop a survival game set in the undergrowth WHERE YOU DON"T PLAY AS HUMANS but as insects hell at this point id be fine with playing as a rat.\n\nAnd here are some ideas\n\n1. don't make it a 3rd person game I know it's tempting but trust me making it 3rd person robs the game of its true scale. though this prospect might get confusing for walking up walls (which insects tend to do) don't worry Natural selection2 tackled this problem brilliantly where they fixed the camera of the player so they wouldn't be disorientated. If you want a terrible example of this look at alien vs predator and watch an alien playthrough (you might get motion sickness).\n\n2. add multiplayer, why ? well, we already have singleplayer only games where you play as bugs deadly creatures, Badmojo, and others unless your game is gonna have a revolutionary groundbreaking story living in an empty world filled with bots is incredibly boring and your game will die.\n\n3. add progression, whether it be insect growth to adulthood or possibly even upgrading your skills(possibly through an RPG system or skill tree) players need a reason to keep playing a goal to reach.\n\n4. ACTUALLY RESEARCH INSECTS AND OTHER ARTHROPODS, there are so many interesting creatures out there that get left out because "we want big spider" or "ant cool" look at other creatures for example\n\ndragonflies fast and quick aerial predators that can hover but as babies, they live underwater as predators, there are assassin bugs that literally collect hundreds of bug corpses on their backs as armor, there are spiders that can walk on water, the bombardier beetle can light an explosive reaction so hot it cooks ants alive, there are so many other gimmicks to add to make VARIED GAMEPLAY instead of "haha ant crawl up the wall".\n\n4. ADD MOVEMENT OPTIONS, people love moving why do you think rocket jumping became such a beloved feature, bugs can fly run up walls dig underground, and jump. \n\n5. you need bots, your game needs to be able to be fun even without a huge player base which unfortunately for a premise like this will probably be the case because pussies will be too scared to play because "spiders are so scary" so adding bot enemies like roaming spiders or an ant nest full of aggressive ants that players could raid is important.\n\nso far these are my ideas and grievances with the genre I don't know if ill ever live to see such an idea happen since too many people think bugs are icky and would rather step on them than take the time to understand them let alone play as them in a videogame.

odjdzx|Looking for a puzzle game idea|Anybody have an idea for a puzzle / strategy game?
odj0yy|I was listening to Machine Head and Slipknot when I had an idea...|Action based game set in South America during the time of the conquistadors. From a once well established township, that has fallen into ruin due to small pox, a young lady, daughter of a shaman steps up for her people. He sends her on a quest to drive back the conquistadors on his dieing breath. (Small pox would be depicted as a curse brought on by the westerners.)  \n\n\nShe heads through the jungle to the next nearest village/town that has apparently been ransacked. (insert combat tutorial vs wildlife). She would have eaten a hallucigen that the warriors in her tribe use before a hunt/battle. So the walk down would get progressively more distorted/trippy on her way. When she arrives at the village that is being occupied by conquistadors she sees (insert all horrible things they are doing) them as half man/demon things due to her hallucingens. Heavy metal music such as Slipknot - Distasterpiece type will be playing. Combat would be arena style very similar to Senua's Sacrifice as I feel the pacing and weight of it would suit the setting.\n\nExploration should be limited, giving the player a very linear path like Senua's Sacrifice, Tomb Raider, Uncharted to allow for set piece scenes and space for cinematic story. This isn't the type of game where you want your character to be running 24/7. Atmosphere is key. Running in combat environments, sure but otherwise no.\n\nAs the character takes the psychedelic warrior brew, the jungle will grow darker/more hellish as the character is NOT having a happy fun time. Whilst making the environment blurry perhaps, it should make entities/interactable items pop out, even maybe glow to represent the hyper focus from that state of mind.  \n\n\nIn her journey she will have visions of her father guiding her, the environments get more and more surreal as the game goes on, it ends in her actually driving them back (alternate history much). At some point she finds a historic/legendary weapon. Keep time span of the story vague.\n\nEvery town can be approached with stealth or warrior smash style. Stealth involves sneaking and ranged weapons (poison blow dart? Bow?) and take downs and hiding the bodies. Some towns will be easier to stealth or to just leeroy.  \n\n\nPsychedelic drugs restore her health but here is the caveat. There are different endings, depending on if she took minimal amounts of psychedelics or insanely heavy amounts. The best outcome is she pushes back the conquistadors and made Queen or something for her efforts. The middle one, is she pushes them back, but her own people banish her at the end because she is too scarred from the experience making her violent/crazy. The worst outcome is that she took so much damage that she ignored during the playthrough that the moment she beats the last mission, she falls to the floor, dieing of her injuries.

odi4q7|My first concept|  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot basis** \n\nOn December 26, 1991, Lenin wakes up in one of the Khrushchevka flat. In an attempt to prevent the collapse of the USSR, he moves between the rooms of a large and spacious Khrushchevka (about 14 rooms per level), using fists and improvised means, engages in battle with people who send both real personalities and characters from Soviet films and other fictional characters (for example Cheburashka). In the last room, a boss battle awaits him, after which, instead of preventing the collapse of the USSR, he is pulled to the upper floor (in the past several years ago). Each of the floors personifies a certain era of the USSR, depending on the ruler. And on every floor, Lenin is trying to save socialism. In the course of the plot, the player only has to find out why Lenin woke up in Khrushchevka, and what awaits him on the top floor when he gets to 1917 year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genre**\n\nRoguelike, top view, drawing - pixel art, soundtrack - sovietwave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**References:** \n\nMoving between paneled rooms in Khrushchevka flat as moving between rooms in "Binding of Isaac". \n\nFrom the same Isaac, the idea of constant descent into the underground is reversed, since time goes in the opposite order, from the collapse of the USSR to its appearance, then Lenin ascends through the floors, and does not descend. \n\nThe combat system is similar to "Hotline Miami", in addition to fists, you can use improvised items, and sometimes firearms. \n\nAlso, as references for drawing, you can refer to such beautiful games as Noita or Graveyard keeper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be glad to hear your opinion on the concept. Tell me what could be added to the game.

Basically the isle with normal animals and humans in an era were animals could actually compete with us, and often win. I think the world just needs more survival animal games in general though because they're so much fun and it's still a pretty new genre!

odc9j4|Looking for some criticism and ideas for my NSFW game!|I'm currently working on writing a NSFW twine game with a medieval theme. It's going to be low-fantasy, with subdued magic elements and a dark vibe as well as lots of fetishes. I've kind of hit a writers block and am curious to see what people think so far, what they've got for ideas, and whatever else in regards to input they'd have. So here's a general idea of what I have so far. All feedback is appreciated!\n\n\nAbout you, the player:\n\nYou grew up in the walled city of Agara, and have never left. The outside world is unknown. Rumors speak of larger cities and unspeakable horrors that lurk in the forest. You are 18 years old now and have always been on your own. You've lived off the streets as a beggar. You had a family once, but your parents mysteriously disappeared when you were 5. You have no family here and are completely alone.\n\n\nThe City of Agara (uh-gar-uh)\n\nDescription:\n\nThe city of Agara is a small, walled city built in the hills of the grass lands just outside the forest. Most notable for its scenery and smell, Agara houses lots of wood fires, creating a very smokey and well-lit impression. Homes here are primarily built of wood and stone; the poor live in shacks of low quality wood, whereas the rich live in homes of cobblestone and durable, stripped wood. Due to this construction method, fires are very prevalent here, mostly due to drunken mistakes.\n\n\nLaws:\n\nThe city is controlled and governed by a counsel of people. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to leave the walled city of Agara for safety reasons, as enforced by the counsel. Those who commit crimes too severe for pillory are banished from the city or tied and left in the forest, regardless of age.\n\n\nLocations:\n\nThe Jelous Mug - Tavern; The only tavern in Agara, and a local favorite for eating, drinking, and sleeping.\n\nUnnamed Location - Public Bathhouse; The newest building in the city. With the abundance of wood sourced from the regions forests, fires could be made to warm waters for public bathing, keeping people from bathing in nearby waterways used for drinking water.\n\n\nNotable Occupations:\n\nCarpenter\n\n\nThe Monsters:\n\nHumans - people are unpredictable\n\nOrc - a byproduct of dark magic\n\nVampyre - thrive in the darkest depths of large cities\n\nLycan - much like vampyre, they are humans inflicted with a curse that is said to have origins that trace back to the elves.\n\nMinotaur\n\nCentaur\n\nElves - Extinct, along with magic itself. Elves grew too powerful for their own good, and it ultimately caused their demise ( a civil war called the war of the gods )\n\nAll monsters pose a threat to you outside of walled locations. ( Vampyre, Lycan, and Humans can still be found inside of walled locations )\n\n\nAs mentioned above your parents went missing when you were just 5 years old. Hints and clues found while playing will lead you to an unnamed extremely powerful entity which I will refer to as "the dairy". A place that farms humans and creatures for a profit. (milking and breeding them etc.) This place will reveal their fate. You the player can be captured or sold to the dairy before finding clues in the game based on your actions.\n\n\nMisc Notes:\n\nIn this game world the passage of information is very poor, as news and communication only travels by mouth, courier, or birds.\n\n\nPlanned "Goals" for in game:\n\nFind the fate of your parents\n\nStay Alive as long as you can\n\nWork for money and achieve great wealth buying awesome things

onb45k|Kaiju Battle|I'd love to see a single and multiplayer fight game set in the streets of various large cities and landscapes, where you fight each other as giant Kaiju.\n\nEach monster has their own unique traits and power-ups, of course.\n\nThe music and art style shouldn't be fresh and cool looking. \nThe art style and monster design should be super old school, based on old kaiju films and tv shows, where everything looks like a grainy miniature, and where the monster design is rad but is still clearly just a dude in a monster suit, with clumsy arm reach for punches and everything.\n\nThere should also be a single player story mode or 2 player battle mode where one player plays as a Kaiju whose objective is to destroy as much of the city before the other player, playing as Godzilla or UltraMan, can defeat them. \n\nI hope someone out there can do this.

on6evb|Part MMO, Part Dungeon Crawler, Part Crafting, Part Shop Tycoon|My absolute dream game is super duper simple and chill. I just wanna be able to run my own tavern, man. That's all. And have weary adventurers come in and chat with me while I craft up their healing items/buffs for them to either take with them, or recover.\n\nSo whenever I daydream about how I'd want this game to work out, players could choose what they want to do. You could be an adventurer, and go dungeon diving for loot and and cool weapons and armor and hang out with your pals on your quests. Adventurer types get a totally customizable 'hideout' in the neverending dungeons below the earth, and you can amp up and decorate it with cool stuff you find. You can either make your hideout public or private, and if it's public people can come across it at random while adventuring and take a little breather. But you specifically cannot store food or supplies in these hideouts indefinitely, as there is always a chance pests will sneak in and eat everything (no matter what you do, dungeon rats will always get in and steal your snacks), and so you always need to go back up to restock or prepare for your next dive.\n\nOr, you could be the classic NPC type character, who instead forages above ground for ingredients and materials for your tavern. NPC types get an inn/tavern instead of a hideout, and can totally customize it as well, with cool stuff you build rather than find or win from bosses. You level up your crafting and cooking skills, and learn to make potions and rations and meals that can heal, buff, or debuff. NPCs can set their taverns to public or private too, and if they're set to public, then adventurers coming up for air from the dungeons can come across them at random (or if they've got yours favorited they can zoom right there).\nIf you happen to be online at the same time ab adventurer comes across your tavern, you can chat, or roleplay, or whatever, and haggle prices and deals or trade for cool furniture/custom stuff to put in your tavern, or super rare ingredients for recipes or craftables. If you are offline and they come across your tavern, they just see the listed prices of what you made and put up in stock, and they can purchase stuff.\nNPCs can also choose to put a limit on how many items one person can buy from them so they don't get cleared out for future adventurers while they're offline.\n\nObviously this has a lot of room for improvement and way more cool features and stuff, and I've obviously never made a game in my life, but this sounds like it'd be fun for me to play at least. So maybe someone else will think it's fun too!

omxe54|Animal / Creature Breeding - Game Idea|**Game Idea based on realistic animal breeding simulation focused on Genetics.** \n\nHey guys, I am thinking more and more about games that I miss in my life the last few years. The answer to that is everything around Animal Simulation: 1) Animal Breeding and Genetics Development and/or 2) Veterinary based Games. \n\nThose did exist in some ways, but they are extremely old and not satisfying to play anymore (if they even work on Windows 10). Sadly I am nowhere near understanding how to Develop my own Game, therefore I hope someone will pick this up - because the request is actually quite big if you google it. \n\n**Concept**\n\nA single-player game (more advanced version: online to trade animals) based on simulation of animal care &amp; breeding, mainly for adult players. You start on a small farm, which you can upgrade in terms of size and different houses over playtime/achievements - you will be provided with 2 starter stables for 2 animals and one breeding house. At the beginning of the game you pick your starter animal race (inspired by the starter Pokemon :p) - I am thinking of: Horses, Dogs, Cats, Chicken etc. It doesn't have to be animals that usually live on a farm, to make the breeding more interesting. \n\n**Idea Size**\n\nIt depends on your motivation - this idea almost infinitely scalable. \n\nSmall: No animations but pictures, simple button clicks for taking care, breeding &amp; stuff. Genetics are not too detailed.\n\nMiddle: Focus on a detailed Genetics system similar to a Science Tree in a strategic game (currently thinking of CIV where it develops over time).\n\nBig: Animations and/or detailed pictures of the animals which all look different in a way. Include an online market to trade the animals. \n\n**Why** \n\nI googled a lot around this idea - currently there doesn't exist a game which fulfills the above purpose in any kind of way. "Ark" is probably the game which is the closest to the idea but yet far away. And: The request is definitely there! So many people are requesting this type of games because they all remember simple games when being a kid around this game mechanic. With today's quality of games there is so much possible around this idea - also the design should be realistic (no manga/anime style pls) and should target the teenager/ adult group.\n\n**My Input**  \nIf someone is interested in that I'd definitely love to chat further about this idea, because there is so much more in my mind. \n\nAlso: If you are really interested in doing this - I could actually help regarding the marketing of the game because I do work in that field. \n\n  \nLove to hear your ideas and feedback. Thank you in advance!  \nP.s: Yes, I did check almost every potential game - nothing is close to what I am looking for. There is always something that doesn't work out well for me.

omp8gc|A game where in order to progress you need to die in increasingly bizarre and convoluted ways.|So for this I'm imaging a classic Zelda style game, but it could be adapted to other genres.\n\nI see two flavors of this concept:\n\n* Your progression is gated by achievements and most if not all of the achievements are for dying in dumb ways.\n* The game is fully open to you from the start and resets every time you die, and it's all about achievement hunting, surviving and progressing long enough to die in a specific way.\n\nDie from the first monster. Get killed by a Grandma. Die while under 3 different Damage over Time effects. Die from a Christmas Tree. Die from falling for over 30 seconds. Die in your own home. Beat the entire game in one life only to die at the final boss.\n\nIt starts to become a puzzle game as you try and figure out how to best kick the bucket in increasingly stupid ways all for those sweet, sweet achievements.
omn89t|Turn-based, multiplayer LEGO castle defense game with custom traps|The main idea came from a game we played IRL with a childhood friend, but I'm confident it could be built into a video-game. The game is basically like the title says; A turn-based, multiplayer LEGO game in a medieval setting, where each side has a castle to defend as well as troops to siege the other player's castle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MAIN GOAL:**  \nPlayers must siege the opponent's castle, go through it, overcoming any obstacle they put on the path, and obtain their flag to win the game. However since both sides have a castle on their own, the player's attention should also be set on their own castle, as the opponent will try to do the same. It's a fight against time and cleverly placed traps (which I'll get into in a second), with lots of strategy options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RESOURCES:**  \nThe player is given a set amount of resources, and each item, trap or soldier has a value to them. A player may choose to have a basic castle with lots of soldiers and siege weapons, or have an elaborate castle with multiple, deadly traps, but with very limited troops to attack. The player can have multiple builds, for whatever strategy they want to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE CASTLE:**  \nThe player can choose from different, pre-built castles, but they are strongly encouraged to build one themselves. For faster building I'd think it would be better to use several built aspects, rather than building a castle up from individual blocks like IRL, but if it's feasible, there could be an option for players to build from scratch.\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous part, the player is given a resource number, and can use them up as they see fit. For example, they have 1000 resources, and a simple gate costs 5, but a more elaborate gate with a moat surrounding the whole castle might cost 100. Of course the latter would be harder to get through for the opponent and different parts would require different siege weapons or strategies.\n\nThe castle can also have multiple floors, traps and many obstacles in them. One could build a maze, so the attacking players will have to find a way out, but they could just lure the enemy team into a room with gold, where a pressure sensitive tile would lock the door behind them. The possibilities can be as endless as LEGO itself, but naturally this would require a lot of testing and balancing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE GAME:**  \nThe game would start with each player choosing a build (castle+soldiers). Then your build is revealed for the other player and then they are given a small amount of additional resources, and the chance to *slightly* alter their troops and siege weapons if necessary, but they cannot alter their castle. The players will only see the opponents castle from the outside and the soldiers they've put outside the castle for attacking. Anything inside, be them traps or more soldiers will remain unseen for the opponent until later in the game.\n\nAfter the preparation phase the battle begins, the player with fewer used resources will start. In the first couple of rounds it's just moving towards the other player's castle, and choosing the strategy. Maybe sending a troop to flank, setting up choke-points, etc. If two opposing troops are in vicinity of each other a battle can begin.\n\nThis is the part that is not yet clear for me, as this would require a lot of testing, but we played this in a way that in one round each side can have a set amount of moves (I remember doing 2 things per round). So one side can choose to move one unit closer and then attack, or attack from further away, which will lower the chance of success but then they can attack a second time. Obviously, later in the game this will get more complicated as the players will have to move closer to the other player's flag, defend their own by setting up traps (oh yes, using a trap will also take up moves, they could use all the moves a player has in one round if it's a very elaborate trap), and still fighting in the battlefield at the same time. So the pressure sensitive tile I mentioned has to be activated by the player, otherwise it will "malfunction". This part is more close to chess I think, because if Player A forces a move out of Player B on the other side of the battlefield, then A can go inside the room for the treasure, without risking their lives.\n\nThe game ends when one's flag is captured or a castle can't be protected anymore (no more soldiers and only non-lethal traps remain in the castle). We played it like classic capture the flag, so we'd have to take the enemy's flag back inside our own castle, but I think it would just further complicate things now, as well as artificially prolonging the endgame. But maybe some testing can prove me otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my idea I've had since I found parts of my castle back at my parent's place while cleaning. I almost completely forgot this game we played as children, but now that they are dusted off, there's a lot of nice memories. One day I'd like to see this game in a video-game setting, so the few LEGOs I had as a child wouldn't restrict me that much on what I can build. Needless to say, this can be a very large project, even AAA if it includes tons of assets. (However, I'd assume using LEGO can cut down a lot of cost and work, since the building blocks are already set, and easy to use shapes, but I don't know anything about game development, so I could be astonishingly wrong here...) It would also require lots of testing, balancing and such, as I mentioned above.\n\nThe saddest part - for me anyways - is that I don't have any experience in game making, so I won't be able to make this idea into reality, at least not for a couple of years. However the idea kept me awake at several nights now, so by writing it down here may give me some sort of relief.\n\nThanks for reading.
ommshz|A rallye (racing) game with random generated tracks|My idea is a racing game in which the goal is to reach the finish point as quickly as possible (like in hillclimb or rallye racing). The comparison with other players should take place through online high scores. The trick that should distinguish this game from others is that the tracks cannot be practised in advance: You get one chance. No resetting, no reloading, nothing. \n\nThe basis for this would be, on the one hand, that the track cannot be selected in advance, but only one track is possible at a time and, on the other hand, a huge basic number of tracks. To really increase the number of tracks, they should be generated by the computer. With the help of machine learning, the players could also be used to teach the computer to generate "good" tracks by asking for a rating on the track after a race. If the track is literally undriveable, no other player has to try it.

Players will choose a primary class upon character creation, and can later choose a handful of minor traits from other classes to round out their builds. Each player will have 1 life, but can be revived through a few special means. Upon death, a players will spawn on the outskirts of a new server, as a new character. They will retain a special in-game currency to allow players who achieved a lot in their previous playthroughs to get started quickly in their new server. Players can then compete to see how long they can survive.\n\n**Location**\n\nAt first there would only be 1 map. Each map would have carefully crafted POIs but the contents would be semi-randomized. Ideally, new maps would be released occasionally. Players would be randomly assigned a location then (attempting to mimic IRL where people do not choose where they start). Since the players would change, but the maps wouldn't, the worlds will continue to evolve differently over time. Perhaps players who died in a world at one time might return to that same world randomly as a different character later, exploring what is familiar to them and how things have changed.\n\n**Community Enforcement**\n\nA concept like this does not work without either de-incentivizing negative behavior or making positive behavior profitable. PVP would need to be opt-in. However, the sandbox/survival elements of the game should be challenging enough that players recognize the necessity of working together.  \n\n\nIts possible this is too verbose or not creative enough. I've never written a game idea out before. I just liked the feel of fighting of hoards in Dead Rising, I'm a fan of old zombie films, and I like the sandbox elements of games like 7 Days to Die but feel like there's very poor incentive to keep playing at the very late stages. I've never developed a game before, but I have 3 years of Java full stack experience in the field and a BS in comp sci, so I at least know my way around some 1s and 0s
omf76y|Collect-a-thon / Looter Hybrid|Basically what it says on the tin. A platforming collection game (ala Banjo-Kazooie) mashed together with a hack and slash looter (ala Diablo).\n\nCollect coins/trinkets/mcguffins to trade in for loot. Each type of collectible could correlate to a different kind of loot.\n\nAdd in some random/procedural generation to keep some variety and, voila!
omcjth|Next level idea|i have a idea wich is focused more on a reward,for example say we have a boxing game,and two random players from around the world join to play a boxing match,each one deposits 10€ and the winner get's it all,and create other games like sword fighting or maybe with teams and it is also a good way to make money not like be rich but have fun and earn a bit money.

omax0g|Guys i have an idea| \n\nFor Microsoft, this should not be that hard. It will take time but if they can work on it that will be great.\n\nYou know how FS 2020 is actually the real world. I am not sure about the scaling but I think the scaling is real too.\n\nA GTA style game with the whole FS2020 map as it is but 3 models improved. It will take a lot of computer power I understand. But they can use stream technology.\n\nSo Driving simulator + truck simulator in the same world as a flying simulator (of course lots of servers for online players) + GTA online style with police. Where you can drive anywhere in the world or fly or shoot people and do whatever.\n\nI know this is a big project and almost impossible. But for Microsoft having so much money and a good team behind them. I see why no they can do this.\n\nThis will be a dream come true and I will not leave my house. lol\n\nWhy don't Microsoft create such a game.\n\nP.s. I am disclexist, excuse any errors

om0t9h|A gathering mechanic where you pay off sprites (or similar) to gain auto loot.|I'm starting to see a lot of magic game ideas and I love it! The thing with magic games is that they usually get conflated with survival games because alchemy requires reagents which requires gathering. I was thinking to myself, "How do you gather stuff in a cool magical way that doesn't feel like you're a scrub who's picking up endless chicken nuggets?" The answer is minions!  \n\n\nBut then there's one step further: what if you start out by scrambling to pick up stuff because these damn pests keep stealing everything, but then later you realize you can use that to your advantage in order to gain autoloot? It could also create the cool feels of shipping off supply crates to your base like MGSV. Maybe you exchange a certain reagent or drink a certain potion and suddenly this thing you're fighting becomes a really useful tool.

olyqd9|Bullet bill idea|2D game. I have an item that moves straight like bullet bill and bounces on walls until it hits the target and disappears. How could I make a fun game out of it?\n\nThere could be any kinds of ways. like it bounces and if it doesn't find a wall it gets lost and you lose a life, or something happens to the target when it gets hit, etc. I just thought it would be a bit boring to just hit the target and move to the next level, there are many games like that.\n\nAny ideas?
oly0mg|Creating Devil/demon/archangel family for my fighting game|Im trying to figure a way to create these protagonists for my fighting game. The main protagonist is the first born son from a devil mother and wizard father, the two other siblings are either born from the same mother or from a different mother. The wizard father hates his first born due to the fact he was born with this demon bloodline from his mother and rejects him as well as the other siblings reject him. Would this make more sense if his two siblings were not from the same devil/demon mother?\n\nAnd the first born son would be average height, while his two younger siblings would be very tall. But they are all within human height, kind of like Lucifer Morningstar and his siblings, does this make sense? I just want the bio of these characters to be plausible enough.
olxw8r|Alternate History Shooter Concept|You play as Leon Trotsky’s grandson, who is a complete badass soldier under the CIA working against the Stalinist regime during the 60s. \n\n(Short backstory here) Leon trotsky helped lead the soviet revolution alongside Vladimir Lenin as his right hand man. Everyone feared this guy and he was kinda crazy. He was Stalin’s competitor for a while and was exiled to Mexico when Stalin become leader of the USSR. He was assassinated by one of Stalin’s lackeys in 1943. (Backstory over)\n\nYou want to avenge dear ol gramps by completely dismantling the USSR as much as possible. You dislike American ideals and capitalism at first but steadily grow to respect it near the end of the game.
olxc65|A balanced game idea|I don’t have any story or anything, it’s just a mechanic I though up. The game would have a single player, PvE co op, and a PvP multiplayer. In the single player you get exp and items to use in co op and multiplayer. The co op would get you the most items to use in multiplayer, though. It tricks players into playing nice with each other so they can do better against each other. The multiplayer is where the exp comes fast to level you up, increasing stats to do better in co op and get better items and it all repeats itself!

olvp5j|Need ideas for a shooter game - Random level generation, what's next?|Hi guys, I want to create an fps shooter game, have fast paced shooting (gotta get the adrenaline up).\n\nI'm not good with "quality" level creation. But I can generate levels with code, procedurally. And good ones.\n\nThing is, I dont have much idea on how the levels would be suited. \nLike, I can even manage creating a Random level on every play. Or give the player chance to randomise a level (maybe with an ad, well monetizations)\n\nImagine, I got the whole setup in mind. How the environment would be, how the number of enemies would come running towards the player or shoot or throw fireball from far, etc. I just cant get how to use the random level generation to my advantage :/\n\nLike.. Infinite levels? \nIdk, can get boring maybe,... Maybe it doesnt give the feeling of proper progression\n\nMaybe a set number of levels. Which would mean the game would end at some point. Or who knows, maybe a new way of playing would unlock, more stronger.\n\nThe gameplay wont be boring, I'll make sure of it.\n\nThinking further about the levels... 🤔
olvojq|D&amp;D Inspired Wizards Journey to become an arch mage with a magical tower|So, I've been randomly thinking of this for a while while zoned out at like 1 am. And while, all of this will never happen I just wanted to get it into the aether. Like the Secret or some shit. \n\nSo, 30,000 foot view. The game would be closer to mages in D&amp;D(and associated lit). You have to study. You can only use your spells so often. Etc. Etc. The game would follow you as you travel from a journey mage to an arch mage with a tower. You would quest for materials, spell books, artifacts, and the like. You would need to study. Studying new spell books has a cost. Performing rituals has a cost. . You create items, enchantment, and Summons. You hit major milestones in the game and age and mastery. As you age, your base stats and abilities change. As your masteries change you can study higher level spell books and perform higher level magics. You do this while building your tower(details about the tower have been omitted for brevity. I'm obsessed with Wizard towers). Everything you do will increase your age. Some spells might advance it more. Some might reverse it to some degree. Those spells might be too expensive morally. \n\nGameplay is pretty simplistic. Think Hades style look and feel(graphics unimportant). Persona style "time advances when you do x" mechanic. But far less rigid. Side quests would be procedurally generated based on what you're doing. Tower upgrades would be handled via game progress and standard game "upgrading building" type mechanics. You stop time. Choose your spell to cast and how and then hopefully that spell completes before your enemy gets to you. Or you use a bevy of magical equipment you find and make. \n\nLike, I could keep going but when would I stop. But, basically that's it.
olqr2e|A space war game where you live the life of a fighter pilot|Feel free to use this idea, or to add to it.\n\nThe game that I envision revolves around a war between humans and an alien species. These games are common, but what I imagine goes into so much detail that you feel like you’re there. You a fighter pilot, live on a huge international space station, and go out on combat missions. However, this game involves you living your life. You meet people on board the space station, have a small apartment, have relationships, go shopping, watch the news, etc.\n\nStory: The year is 2093, and we’re out amongst the stars.  Not too far though. We’ve been a few hundred light years from Earth.  In our travels, we found a solar system that was abandoned by some alien species long ago.  Since there’s no one living there, we move in and begin colonizing worlds. Unfortunately, midway through our colonization efforts, an alien species arrives.  They’re the ones that abandoned this star system, and they tell us that they still own it and want us all to leave. It’s hard to just pack up and go home at this point, because there are already around 100,000 humans living on various planets and moons. Furthermore, when they arrived, there were only a handful of abandoned installations on a few planets, so the aliens’ claim of ownership seemed pretty weak.  We try to negotiate, and recommend that we share it, and they reject our offer. A war follows.\n\nCombat:  To beat the game, you need to complete many combat missions.  You typically won’t go out alone. You’ll be part of a team.  Also, you won’t mow down scores of enemy ships like you do in most spaceship fighting games. Enemy fighters are about as strong as allied fighters.  They’re shielded just like you, and taking down one enemy fighter will take some time. It’ll be a little bit like a WW2 dogfight.  Your fighter shoots blasts of energy which drain the battery, so there is a re-charge time after numerous shots. You also carry a limited number of bombs for the bombing missions, and only a few missiles which you will need to use wisely.  The movement is 3-D, and the view can either be 3rd person or 1st person from the cockpit.  While you’re are in a team during combat, don’t think that you can just fly around and wait for your friends to take out all the enemies. The game should be programmed so that your squad mates fight about as well as you are fighting.\n\nMissions:  I recommend about 100 missions.  Some will be simply fighting with enemy pilots. Others will be bombing missions, defensive missions, escort missions where you protect allied cargo ships, or information gathering missions.\n\nThe space station:  It’s huge. It’s the size of a small city with people from many different nations, and is located in the periphery of the contested star system.  The station is shaped like a gigantic disc. It spins, so there is artificial gravity.  You can find just about everything here: Apartments, grocery stores, movie theaters, restaurants, schools, etc.  You live here, and between missions you can take all the time you want to travel around, do things, and meet people. You can even have relationships and get married, but you and your fellow fighter pilots can be killed, so you may want to think twice about getting too emotionally attached to another pilot.  Only about 10% of the people on board are military.\n\nVictory:  There are two possible endings. One is where the alien military is defeated and they withdraw from the star system. The other is where a truce is reached, and our two species agree to share the star system.  Midway through the game, you will have an optional mission to rescue alien civilians from a doomed ship. If you do this, then it will be a show of compassion and respect, even during a war. After this, the war continues, but the option for a diplomatic victory will be available.  Right before the final mission of the game, your commander will ask you which outcome is preferable. By then, you would be a famous and respected pilot, so your input would be valuable. For the conquest victory, you simply destroy all enemy craft, but for the diplomatic one, only military craft are targets.  The final boss of the game is a huge robot, which must be defeated regardless of which ending you’re aiming for.\n\nGame modes: Easy , medium, and hard. In the easy mode, the enemy pilots are dummies and go down easily. On medium, the two sides are equally weighted. On hard, the enemy pilots are awesome and very hard to kill. If you die, you must re-start the mission, unless you choose the ‘permadeath’ option, in while case death ends the game.\n\nOther:  Games can be saved.  At the beginning of the game, you can choose the gender, ethnicity, appearance, and nationality of your pilot.  The aliens look a little bit like porcupines with two arms and legs, and they come from an adjacent star system.

olh652|Horror game concept idea.|This is from a dream that i had and i liked the idea of it, just placing it here in case someone wants to use it, is just a dream so mostly of the things might not make sense anyway. \n\nbasically  you begin is a room with 3 doors, at first you cannot move your mouse so you're looking at a single door (like a point and click) once you step in you get a lantern, you can walk around and move the mouse around (the idea here is to make the player pick up the flashlight at the very begin, because it will be important for look around  in the dark and see the other doors) as you look in the dark you can see the other 2 doors, but you also see a hallway at your left, sounds like the wind if blowing there, on your right has another door, but there is the living room, once you step in you have the acess the kitchen, where you get batteries for your lantern, since it was a dream i dont remember much of the other rooms, but was like a house.\n\nwhat i remember is that sometimes some limb parts fly to the hallway, you can pick up them but once you drop they will fly again, and your mission is to rescue the people inside because has an entity in the house, who is trying to collect the bodies part and make some kind of ritual or just to feed a monster on the end of hallway, thats why the "wind" is actually the monster breathing.\n\nThis entity has 3 forms \n\n1. the watcher, white eyes watching you from distance, it also can be used to know with direction he will be coming.\n2. the follower, it will follow you around the house, but only when you turn around it jumpscare you, after few minutes he is gone, you can tell by his respiration behide you, and if you hear something breaking it might be it. (if you stop walking it wont help, he will get more and more closer to you, so keep walking).\n3.  the killer, that he kills the other people in the house, you can avoid it trying to hide they inside of some places, such as closet, under bed, etc, you can tell that he is going to attack by some screams that you can hear on background.\n\nso far, i remember had 3 people in the house, one of them were a fat granny that act like a karen (i also remember that you could take "weapons" to defend yourself, such as a pan and you could hit the granny with it, she would be mad at you and would run away from you, staying near that hallway, exposed for the entity) she would refuse to hide and only would hide if her husband say so, but to make her husband to do it, you need to ask to his daughter to talk to him (who is your wife) and since theyre in different rooms they would walk around the house too. (something similar to that other game from imscared creator, that you need to find the people and murder them, but in this case you need to rescue them)\n\nfor the game design, i imagine something pixelated, like imscared or power drill massacre, with 3d and low design, and the game name would be "The three doors" and just in case, no the game isnt a whole dream, this entity exist in the house and is attacking the neighborns and it finally came to your house to kill your family/feed the monster.
olgyoo|Strategy/skill based multiplayer shooter game|Idea:\nA team of 4 have to defend the VIP(npc) while 2 player compete to kill the VIP. VIP will have random tasks they will do. To keep things simple make, let there be only one VIP with repeated rounds. There will be other NPCs in the area so the killers can hide(like hitman).\n\n\nStyle:\nTop down or isometric topdown like Tokyo 42. Can be futuristic, normal or noir-style, but location must be a public area.\n\n\nMechanics:\n\n\nFor the team of 4: can only buy a weapon for each at the start of the round. With more points they get in game, they can improve their weapons, shield strength and surveillance. Surveillance include more surveillance cameras and security scanner at the entrance.\n\nFor the 2 hitman: they will be competing to kill the VIP. They can buy 2 weapons at the start of the round or a weapon &amp; an item. Item include map, the VIP tasks, grenades, bombs and etc. They can dress up as npc like in hitman but they need to be careful so no player sees them.\n\n\nNote: most will think that if the 4 player surrounds the VIP, then there is no chance for hitman to win. However, hitman can make time bombs, snipe, poison, or create a scenario to make the VIP panic &amp; run. So the 4 players will be forced to strategise and survey the area.\n\n\nThank you for reading my idea. I welcome all suggestions even if this is not come to fruition.
olg6vo|Open World car game... 1970s edition|Now before all the 'try this game' comments, I know there are a lot of games that have parts of this idea of mine, but none that I know of that's exactly this. Many have some classic cars but none are actually fully set in the timeframe and have the cars and gameplay with it.\n\nOn to the game itself.\n\nFor some years now I've had thoughts about a car game, not racing specificly set somewhere in the 1970's. The setting I'm thinking about is a small US based city with a large open area around it with some backwater towns.\n\nGameplay:  \nI'm not sure yet what would be the big story, but I'd love to see a Forza style 'collect your favorite cars' idea where some players would go for speed, others for gassers, some for stock car racing, low-riders and even some in the van sub-culture. There could be competitions based on performance on a track but also based on votes on showcars.\n\nA good and modern arcade game is nothing without police car chases. For inspiration and imagination I look at chases in the Dukes of Hazzard, Bullitt, Gone in 60 seconds, Smokey &amp; the Bandit and so on. Chases with classic cars and oversized policecars through backwater towns and the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you'd really wanted to go over the moon with this you could add some early NASCAR races, motorcycles and even demolition derby's to it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm not really expecting for someone to make this as it probably wouldn't many gamers. I was just wondering what people think is interesting about such an idea and if people have even more ideas.

ohb75c|SuperShock|So basically a superhero immersive sim. Using all the classic immersive sim tropes but adapting them to a superhero style. Basically you’d wake up as a character in a room with no recollection to your past. \n\nThrough a few story beats you find out that you’re in a government facility where they experiment on superhumans (or some fancy way of saying it). You yourself are also a superhuman who’s super power is that you can adopt powers from other super individuals when injecting their blood into yours. \n\nAs you progress you fineness yourself among an outbreak where a few superhumans have managed to escape their confinemens and the government agency has deployed their own special SuperHuman Culling Unit. You’re aided in escape by a fellow superhuman named Push who wants to help you out while also looking for his twin brother Push. In a skirmish where Pull gets shot and is dying, you’re able to extract his blood and start fighting back against rhe SCU. \n\nThroughout the game you’ll have to fight superhumans and gain their powers such as Osiris; a man that can turn his body into sand, Gravitas, a superhuman who can control gravity, and Madam LaRouge; a villain who’s able to hide in the shadows and make voodoo dolls of her enemies to torture them from afar and many more superhumans. \n\nYou’ll also be up against elite members of the SCU such as Knightwatch; a specially trained stealth soldier who’s able to blend in with his surroundings as he hunts you down with quiet weapons like a bow and knife, Expert (honestly couldn’t think of a name); a veteran soldier who carries around bullets and grenades that are able to disrupt the power of the superhuman individuals, and Cleric; a towering soldier clad in armor that isn’t so easily broken bolstering a single action rifle that is both stunning and powerful. \n\nBasically like any good immersive sim, using your powers in unexpected ways to achieve results in whatever manner you deem acceptable. I have an idea for a list of all the superhumans and SCU agents but that’s the gist of what I’d love to see in a game.

oh6rcj|VinylVR - App like EmuVR meant for music|Some of you may be familiar with EmuVR, an app that aims to recreate a nostalgic experience of actually physically owning video games rather than popping a rom file into an emulator in a VR space. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZsBaOFi9vM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZsBaOFi9vM)\n\nI already find this very cool, but it came across me that this same concept could be extended to Music, with physical media from Vinyls to CDs being represented and managable in your own VR music collection!\n\nYou would be able to sync it up with a streaming service or downloaded albums on your computer and build your collection in a variety of environments.

ogxugl|Transmission speed between units|What kind of games/puzzles can be created based on the core mechanic that transmission speed between units is a factor?  My inspiration for this idea is my memory of getting a faster modem back in the BBS days.  Not only did things suddenly draw on your screen a lot faster but you were that much more capable of actually doing things\n\nOther than a long download we don't really think of time for units to communicate as being important anymore, since it's usually assumed to be instant, but the idea of faster transmission speeds between units enabling further game progress could yield some interesting game mechanics
oguqce|Short film/Skit Party Game|If I was to describe this game in as little words as possible, it would be: charades except teams act out prompts in game with characters, props and sets, which is recorded with an in-game perspective camera, then shown to other players at the end of the round for voting. You must rank the other teams skits and they get points accordingly. \n\nFurther explanation:  \nThe teams are separated from one another before they get their prompts. Players would be given a selection of props, characters, and sets to choose from after they have their prompt. Then each player can take on different roles to act in the skit. One player controls the camera, which is an actual in game object (although they can set it up to point in a fixed position and remotely toggle recording on and off if they want to act as well). Whenever the camera is recording, players in game mics are also recorded. Each team gets a short set amount of time to design their skit and then act it out and record it, the time constraint should be tight to force impromptu and silly ideas. Teams can give their skits titles, and also add basic effects if they like. Once the timer is up, the teams are reconnected in a movie theater setting, and one after another, the teams skits play on the screen. Once all skits have played, you rank them in order of preference, and points are awarded accordingly.   \n\n\nAlternative ideas:  \n\- some teams might not get good characters, props, or sets for the prompt they are given, and so it might be better if each team actually creates the prompt and selects the props etc. for another team. For example, my team could give another team a dog and human character, some bowls, a house set etc. and the prompt "if dogs had humans as pets, instead of the other way around".  \n\- teams could also be rated on the quality of prompt they came up with and the props etc. that they paired with it.\n\nStyle:  \nI was thinking an isometric 3d topdown or third person with art similar to overcooked. You would of course have the ability to change to the in game camera's perspective to see exactly what it is seeing/recording though.\n\nI'm also welcome to any variations of this idea that make it more fun, simpler, or more feasible to create. Thanks.

ogr6q9|Opinion on my survival game idea|Hello guys I have a survival game idea and I need your honest opinion on it. \n\nIt will be based on the gameplay of unturned and tarkov. \n\nBut instead of having zombies or scavs there is demons, imps and other hell creatures. Based on that the game would feature some “magical” things like special weapons but it is still in reflection. \n\nPlease be honest and share your ideas 😄
ogqzhw|Space 4X game where speed of light actually matters|Hi all. Here's a little idea that came to my mind recently. I might attempt to prototype it one day, but feel free to use it if you find it interesting. \n\nThe game is set either in a tiny galaxy or a star cluster \~50 light-years in diameter. You start as a ruler of a single star system which is your capital/seat of power. The setting is hard sci-fi. Each turn takes a year of real time. During each turn, you have a pool of orders which you can spend to perform your usual 4X actions (build structures and fleets, do research, send exploration missions). \n\nThe main mechanic of the game is that the universal speed limit works just like in our universe. Your basic ships travel at 50% speed of light. Information travels by radio waves at light speed. If you have a colony that is 4 light-years away from your capital system and you order them to build something, this order will reach them in 4 turns. Same with the feedback information. If something happens in this colony, you will only learn about it after 4 turns have passed.\n\nI imagine this mechanic would lead to some interesting scenarios. A colony's gone black. Maybe it's just a busted transmitter and they'll resume the communication next turn? Or maybe something bad happened and you need to send a rescue mission? Or maybe send a fleet, just to be sure? Perhaps another colony has been attacked by an alien force. Does it make sense to send a fleet to that system? Could they still be holding with their meager garrison? Or should we write them off as a casuality and use this fleet to mount a defense elsewhere? You could also recruit governors of different types and send them across the stars to make some decisions in your stead, but of course, they wouldn't be 100% reliable (some could be corrupt or incompetent and in the worst case, they might want to rebel and secede from your empire).\n\nBasically, the incomplete/delayed information would work as a kind of a fog-of-war and put a brake on the snowball effect which is prevalent in this kind of games. \n\nThe main purpose of the technology tree in this game would be less about who can develop the best lasers/shields, and more about finding better ways to manage a vast, interstellar empire (FTL communications, warp gates, efficient bureaucracy, and so on).
ogprjl|Self regulating difficulty mechanic in Time Traveling mech game.|This game is about piloting a far future mech in a near future conflict. The main gimmick is that the time travel agency the player works for has a limited amount of mass it can send back in time for the entire campaign. The campaign will consist of a series of missions,  beating one will unlock the next. However the mass of the mech used to beat that mission will be subtracted from the total mass available for the entire campaign. Since this game is about time travel, the player can replay any mission they have already beaten and choose a different mech. Should they beat it with a lighter mech, that playthrough becomes the "canon" timeline and the mass freed up can go back to the campaign pool for future missions.\n\nThis will allow the player to explore the level on "easy mode," driving the biggest most destructive mech, then switch out to smaller weaker mechs to increase the challenge. Completing the level with lighter mechs will allow the heavier mechs to be used in later missions. Hard core completionists can try to beat the game with mass to spare, while more casual gamers can still experience most of the content with a mechanic to encourage them to try a harder difficulty.\n\nAlso if you want to blow off some steam after a hard day of work you can stomp the biggest mech through the level that is giving you trouble for grins and giggles.
ogp7ok|I need ideas for a warioware type game|I LOVE the warioware series, and i'm thinking of making a game in it's rapid-fire-microgame style, but i need ideas for the microgames. I'm sorting them into 8 categories:\n\nAnything goes: the miscellaneous category, i need some really easy ones (like your mom/sister) for the intro stage, then some hard ones (that's what s/he said!) For the last stage\n\nFantasy: stuff with magic/strange creatures and a lack of technology.\n\nArcade: the equivalent of the 9-volt stage, these are refrences to anything from the arcades, preferably namco, atari/midway, sega, and those non-digital arcade games like skee-ball or wack a mole. I KNOW the boss game is going to be dance dance revolution.\n\nThe movies: basically every bad parody movie ever as a stage, these games should parody famous movie scenes.\n\nSports: speaks for itself. Don't be afraid to use some more obscure sports for these.\n\nOld-school viral videos: the kinds of things that were popular on early YouTube. Fails, lame dancing, and pets reign supreme in this stage.\n\nThat's life: stuff that can be recreated with things you have at home. The things that dr crygor's stages in warioware usually were about.\n\nAt work: games involving people's occupations, both blue and white collar. This could range anywhere between a plumber unclogging a toilet to paper basketball in office job.\n\nSci-fi: the same as fantasy, but with technology instead of magic, and usually involving outer space.\n\nAnything that can be fit into 4 or 8 seconds is acceptable, but longer games can be used for the "boss" games.\n\nNot to mention the arrange modes.

ogfnz2|You knows whats missing from battle royales, spectator influence.|The Hunger Games movies and books suck, personal opinion, but the spectator or sponsors aspect they have is something the gamemode could really use and quite frankly needs. Especially since so many games encourage and sometimes force playing in pairs or a group, and we all know theyre more fun with friends. Teammates could give temporary intel or buffs, the entire dead player base could vote on map influences or give random attributes to the players like low gravity or big heads.  \n\n\nI feel like this would make the gamemode in general more exciting for everyone, so you dont have to be good to play long, and are otherwise just waiting between finding matches.
ogen12|Does anyone think that a battle royale mode with a closing zombie horde could computably ever even work?|The idea of a giant apocalyptic horde closing in from all around sounds spectacular and fun, get to close to the edge and it can warp the circle or move it faster. Dead players would become player controlled feral zombies with different stages of composition.  \n\n\nBut, I feel like computers nowadays right now probably wouldnt be able to handle so many mass entities on screen, bcse its got to be large enough that players can just use explosives and fight their way out. Thoughts?
ogcch3|You play through someone's life, non linearly|**Central Idea*****:*** The time in the player character's life is navigable. Instead of playing through the adventure or story in a linearly order, the player could select any chapter in their life to jump to and play through. Maybe the player starts with the beginning, infancy, or instead right before they die. This is more of a thought experiment than just a "for fun" game, but hopefully it would be enjoyable to play and get the player to think a little.  \n**Gameplay:** Although the idea is non-linear time, that doesn't actually speak for gameplay. That's because you can probably do this within many genres. When you go to a chapter in time, you always start in the same place, and I'm assuming a fairly linear level. That's because in my opinion, an open world game would probably be too complex for both the developer and player. \n\nA ***story game***, in the form of a visual novel or puzzle game would be feasible and could make a lot of sense. You could require knowledge or abilities from the future to make events in the past much easier, or possible at all. Certain encounters wouldn't make much sense until you go back in time and get an "ah ha" moment. Past puzzles could or would set up future puzzles, maybe even change them based on the players actions.  \nOr instead a ***metroidvania***. You would unlock abilities at different chapters of time that would, in typical metroidvania fashion, make other areas easier to access. Although there could be hard locks to certain level, soft locks might make more sense. A new player would need X ability to get past a stage, but an experienced player could do without. A twist on the typical metroidvania idea, instead of navigating a place, you are navigating time.   \n\n\n**Last thoughts:** The story could have an event (almost randomly placed in their life) that would act as the final boss which explains the time travel ability, but I don't know if that would fit. Also there would be trippy questions like if there is any free will because each chapter is always the same, and how can you do an event from the past to get to the future if you needed the future to do it. Maybe some one has beat me to this idea, and if so id love to see it. Let me know if you have any ideas or questions!
ogc57p|Pizza delivery without a car but with a skateboard and a harpoon gun|In the near future gas and cars are very expensive and you are only a pizza delivery guy. The good news if you have a skateboard and a electromagnetic harpoon gun.\n\nYou need to deliver pizzas around the town and you get larger tips for how fast you can get to the house. There are cars driving around the town(in game driven by people but in reality AI driven) so you hop on your skate board and shoot a passing car. If you hit the car you are pulled by a rope to follow the car. If the car makes a turn you can reel in the rope to cut down on the whip effect but if you are too close and the car stops you may slam into the back of it(and die), if you are too far back you may hit a wall.\n\nYou can disengage the harpoon gun and shoot another car(if you want to go straight and the car is making a turn or to stop to make the delivery). There are no set paths to go, just get from the pizza shop to the delivery address but cars are driving on their own paths so if you hang onto the wrong car you can go in the wrong direction.\n\nAs you earn tip money you can buy upgraded skateboards, better harpoon guns etc. \n\nWhat do you think? Would this game be fun? How complex would the AI programming be and would it be feasible to have all these cars driving on AI routines to make the city look lived in on modern hardware?
ogbjm4|Kill rivals or recruit them to your party.|The game's combat is a simplistic souls-like, you attack to do damage, guard to neutralize damage, dodge to throw of the tracking of your enemy's attacks, and parry to set them up for a critical hit. By collecting things either hidden in each level or dropped from slain enemies, you can upgrade your character's primary capabilities.\n\nAt certain intervals in the game, you'll come across bosses that are humanoid, or rivals, that once defeated will prompt you two choices: kill them and take their primary ability as a special ability, or spare them and recruit them to your party that can be switched out in each level.\n\nYou'd need their primary ability to transcend certain obstacles and reach optional collectables in previous levels, but each character has a distinctive fighting style very different from the MC's such as having ranged attacks, attacks that deal multiple hits per use, attacks that are the most effective and efficient against certain types of enemies, or attacks ideal for crowd control.
og9k3i|Subnautica, but underground.|I've had this bizarre dream, and I wanted to share it because it actually felt like a decent idea.\n\nThe game would begin with a tutorial where you play as a miner. Basically, a mining expedition stumbled into a massive cavern, and you are the only person who escaped, warning that you've found hell, and that you've seen the devil himself.\n\nAs it turns out, they've stumbled into an enormous cave system that's been isolated for hundreds of millions of years, and is now inhabited by monstrous descendants of Cambrian fauna. The true protagonist is a scientist who was sent with a team of other explorers for a rescue mission to try and locate the missing people, but he gets isolated for some reason.\n\nHe would have to survive in a massive cavern, with plenty of critters running around.\n\nYou  only have a pick, a flashlight and some rope. You could use the rope to climb, the flashlight to see, and the pick to climb/fight.\n\nThere were trilopites, isopods, crabs and glowing bats running around as harmless creatures. \n\nThen there were these giant lobster-like creatures that didn't have claws, but instead had fingered arms. They'd try to grab your arm with their hands, and bite you. You could break their arms with the pickaxe though.\n\nAlso remember there being a giant crab that looked like a boulder, and its shell was too thick for you to hurt with a pick, so you had to push it off a cliff. \n\nAnd if I recall correctly, there was some spider-like creature that clung on the ceiling, and would fall onto you.\n\nAnother creature looked like a giant snail with glowing antennae. You could pick it up and use it like a flashlight, or you could throw it at the lobsters which would eat it instead of you.\n\nI also vaguely remember a run-down elevator you could fix for fast travel.\n\nAnd lastly, the cave had multiple different biomes, like an underground cliffside, and underground sea with glowing coral, mushroom forests, crystal valleys, and claustrophobic insect infested corridors.
og8ul1|Survival Open world Monster game like spore but Better|Okay, what if there was a game like the spore creature part but you make more realistic monsters to roam and survive a large open world map. Could maybe be both an MMO or single player. On the MMO you can find other monsters (other players) and team up or fight them. You could make monster's more adapted to specific biomes such as deep sea would use bioluminescence to capture prey but also have a disadvantage not being able to see well. Or monster's that can fly and perch on mountains but are slower when walking or running. The longer you survive the more likely you are to evolve and become more powerful. There is probably better mechanics than what I could think of but I still think it is cool.

Availiable for mobile devices and possible plans for independent standalone AR glasses. Currently developing a prototype game with plans for multiple game boards implemented in future. The first game is similar to "Risk" in a more post apocalyptic future. Instead of physical tokens, gameboard and  dice, 3D models are used in thier place. 3d dice roll mechanics with battle scenes of firefights and explosions. Selectable menus that float in the physical world.  Reach out with your hand and select the different territories to interact with, whether its for information, deploying troops or attacking. Play with up to 6 friends worldwide.....All input is welcome, Thank you.
og6jxc|Marble Racing Game|Last year I was astonished about those Pandemic Marble Olympics from Jelle's Marble Runs' channel on YouTube, principally the marble racing laps. And I was wondering about a First-person-3D-multiplayer-racing-game with marbles instead cars, where players can customize it. I think this game in comic ways, like Fall Guys. Cheerful, colorful and funny. But I have to admit it's kinda boring to just watch your marble losing a race again and again. I like the concept more than the game LOL. What you guys think?
og2zmh|Here is an idea for an infinite dream game, IMHO.|Ever since I saw AI dungeon, an idea began to form on my mind and is now a lot more mature, it just lacked the environment, until I saw Valheim.\n\nLets take a game like Valheim, it uses procedural generation to make great environments with a flora system that can also produce occasional mineral rocks, land marks and the odd structures.\n\ndevelop that to make occasional villages and roads to connect those places, populate the place with more sentient actors, like other characters.\n\nThis is just the beginning, lets add some need and goal-based quest system.\n\nI mean the whole logic part of the game can be placed upon the goal system.\n\nWhen you or any other actor gets hungry, then the goal to eat food pops into your/their goal list, as opposed to quest list.\n\nIf you/them have any food-like item then you/they can eat and fulfill the goal. If not, then another goal is generated: Acquire food.\n\n=== === === === === === === === === === ===\n\nWhat now? Well, if it is the player's goal, then it is shown in a list of goals, needed to be fulfilled, sorted by importance level and the availability of the prerequisites.\n\nIf it is an actor's goal, then if the actor is marked as important, i.e. involved in your previous adventures, then the goal can be translated to a sentence like: "***The farmer is hungry***", and be fed to a system like AI dungeon, pun intended.\n\nIf the actor is not important then a routine previous output for the goal is taken and interpreted for the actor to perform.\n\nThe AI would interpret the input with previous entries and come out with a result.\n\nThen this result is interpreted by the game engine, and it would weed out the too bizarre, unmanageable and bonked outputs and select the ones that it can manage to interpret and convert into the games actual environment.\n\nIt can add new goals to track, spawn new required actors for the roles or select the suitable available ones,  spawn or select needed items, and place them in the places defined by the AI output doing what was specified there with the generated or picked items.\n\nNew goals and events are fed into the AI as they are generated, outside of the AI system, by other systems, or player actions.\n\nSomething like: "***The player picks the picket of the guard.***"\n\nThat particular guard can be previously generated by the landscape generation system on the entrance of a castle, or be generated by the AI system on an output like: "***A guard appears and blocks the way of our group of adventurers.***"\n\nThere can be a grouping system that adds a collection of actors or items and gives them a containing name.\n\nFor instance the instant that an NPC accepts your offer to join you in your adventure, a group is generated and named, and you join that named group.\n\nWell, back to pick pocketing action, the items in the pocket can be generated, when the guard is generated, but if the AI results in: "***And finds a rare item.***", we can wait for more output from the AI to define the item and generate that particular item to place in the list, or choose from a list of predefined rare items, suitable to be in the pocket of a guard.\n\nOr maybe the output would be like: "***The guard notices the player's action and steps back and draws a laser cannon from his pocket and attacks the player***", which the interpretation system then replace the laser cannon with the weapon pre-generated when the guard was generated, or pick from a list of more suitable weapons for the environment and the guard status.\n\nThe system can understand the step back and attack actions and perform them correctly.\n\n=== === === === === === === === === === ===\n\nWhen you begin a conversation with an NPC, the goal system can step in and generate some predefined text for your choice, sorted by the importance of their particular goal.\n\nSo there can be conversation entries available to choose from, like this:\n\nDo you know where can I find a job, I need the money.\n\nThis goal can be the result of your being hungry, and lacking food, so you searched for it and found some, but the owner was a merchant and asked you for money in exchange, so the goal to make some money was generated, which resulted in that particular conversation entry.\n\nThere can be other entries like:\n\nWhere can I find Sir Drakulz?\n\nIf you select this entry, it is converted to: ***"Where can I find Sir Drakulz?", the player ask the clerk.***\n\nThen it is fed to AI system and the output can be something like: "***He is probably in the castle.***"\n\nYou know the castle was generated by the environment system, and was fed into the AI system as soon as you were in it's sphere of influence, just as any other place, landmark, actor,  and item.\n\nSomething like: "***There is a castle nearby.***"\n\nSome less important entities, like a chair nearby is only fed when you touch or use it, and something like a ***sword*** on the table, can replace the ***blaster*** when interpreted by the system.\n\nSome feeds are global and define the global environment and theme, and can be chosen as you initiate your game, others are fed as needed.\n\n=== === === === === === === === === === ===\n\nThere is no difference between the player and any other actor, so when a goal is added to you, you can follow them by their importance level, and when a goal is added to another actor, they would follow them by their importance level.\n\nThe goals can add conversation entries to any actor, and they will use them, and the AI system would interpret them a come up with results for the talking party.\n\nThe goal system rules the game, so when some events happen or when you hear an answer to your spoken words, maybe a goal can be offered to you to add to the current list.\n\nSo when someone answers: "***Maybe Sir Drakulz knows about the lost piece.***", the goal to find him is offered to you, by the UI, like: "***Do you want to find Sir Drakulz?***", and if you accept, the goal is added to your list.\n\nIMHO, this combination of AI Dungeon, Valheim, and a need and goal based internal logic and conversation system can make the ultimate infinite life ruining game of them all.\n\nThese are just ideas for any interested party, as I don't have the time and means to make such a game, and I don't claim any rights on the ideas.\n\nJust want to inspire some party to make such a game.\n\nBy the way, I have thought a lot about these ideas and have some nice solutions on how to implement them, and can offer them if anyone is interested.\n\nLike how to keep track of the entities that we feed into the AI system, and if it would be better to use Sims style conversation grunts, and the like.

ofzr5e|A RPG with choosable turns|I have no idea how to simplify the title properly.\n\nYou know how rpgs are either the strongest/fastest go first or the party goes first then the enemy? Well, here's an that puts that on its head.\n\nIt works like this: when you enter a battle. You have to not only select the attack you want to use but when to use it. Lets give an example(i would attach an image but idk how to)\n\nThe party of 4 enter a battle with 1 enemy. After choosing an attack, a box appears showing 5 boxes. The box in the center has a skull, representing the enemy, while others are empty. Select a box and circle will appear in it. The colour of the circle will represent who is going.\n\nThe idea is to strategize the way to fight. If you want the enemy to die fast, put the 2 strongest up first. There is more to this idea, like status effects that mess with the boxes or bosses and multiple enemies using more than one box but i just want to type this down.
ofxdij|DarkHearts|The year is 20XX and humanity is on the brink, being under siege by Darklings, once innocent humans and creatures, corrupted and mangled by a living parasite called Dojinshii, nothing can harm these creatures aside from an ancient alloy which has given birth to ancient weapons forged many eons ago, however humans have recently discovered how to forge this alloy themselves, though it's not enough. A mad scientist comes up with a solution, a being spliced from different DNA, and infused with this virus to be a darkling himself, able to harm these creatures without such weapons... You are this warrior, born to end the destruction and despair the Darklings have wrought.\n\nThe game itself: imagine a side scrolling slasher/bullet hell, where you gain upgrades and unlock new abilities which you can use to combo enemies, including bosses. But you yourself can also be comboed, enemies and bosses can do combos on you and normal enemies can work together to make your life hell, where a single hit can turn half health, into death(depending on difficulty). So let me go over the finer points.\n\nPlayer main abilities: The player has access to a small amount of basic punches but, most of your things will actually come from proper energy and sword use as your punches and kicks come from the same button your sword is, lemme go over them quickly, both your energy and sword have a bar, the more you use your sword the more it depletes, once empty you can't use your sword at all as you can't summon it at all as it appears and dissapears from your hands rather than staying there permanently, instead you punch, but it regenerates when the sword isn't used, energy is slightly different, same as the sword, all energy moved deplete the bar, however unlike the swords passive restoration, the energy required a moment of respite to Regen. Since it's a bullet hell with many things on the screen at once at times, a dodge is essential, and the dodge can be upgraded and changed, but the basic is, you hold a direction and hit the button, and you dash that direction, in the beginning before upgraded, you dash then can't move in the air, you just have your dash momentum and gravity, once you hit the ground you have a split second of recovery, this can be removed through upgrades, which is gonna be heaven becuase of the bosses, of course if you ground dash, where you never leave the ground, then there is no recovery at all, aside from a moment where you can't dash again, however this moment isnt terribly long, about .80 seconds, or so, I haven't gotten the exact numbers, but it isn't terribly long.\n\nCombo System: Not fully fleshed out but the majority is here, depending on your difficulty, combos are gonna be longer or shorter, we'll take Hard as the example here though, with differences being told at the end.... So bosses have something called Hitstun Decay, where the longer the combo goes on the less your hits actually stun them allowing follow ups, however some bosses the combo system works differently, on big bodies, you can't move them with your attacks, meaning some combos won't work at all, but they still get stunned from hits, just not as much as smaller bodies, meaning you'll not be comboing these bosses as long or often, smaller human sized bosses can be moved from your attacks, meaning you can take advantage of certain moves to get a full longer more damaging combos, however special super powered human sized bosses have a move that gets them out of combos instantly, usually damaging the player if they are too close, punishing the player if they get too greedy. The player can also be comboed, however the player also has this Hitstun Decay, though reduced on hard, meaning you'll be comboed longer, on Nightmare(unlockable after beating the game on hard) there is no hitstun decay for you.\n  Combo Structure: the combo system is mostly free form, with few absolutes, but there are a few rules that the player must adhere to, let's go over what can cancel into what, but first...\n\nMoves: There are four main types of moves, when talking about combos, you have your basic moves, which would be just pressing attack, these can then be canceled on hit into special moves or dash, special moves are slower and longer recovery moves that require more input, for example spinning slash, a move where if the player is in the air will spin like a ball and have their sword out, much like zeros spinny slash, would require something like 216 attack, or something, these special moves can be canceled into dash as long as they hit, into other special moves, or into super moves, these are usually super slow but super damaging moves that have a lot of recovery, usually your combo ender, however later upgrades allow you to cancel your super so it never comes out but still takes the bar cost, allowing longer combos. Now onto the rules, you only get to use a special twice per combo, and dash cancels take energy, and a hit super almost never allows follow up, I say this because of a theory combo that may be cool, where you use one of the sword moves, where you throw your sword and it spins in place for a moment damaging whatever close to or on top of it, and then you super and becuase of the sword you can keep it going due to the hit stun, idk though. Each move affects the hitstun decay differently, basic attacks affect it the least, removing the least amount of stun frames on hit, specials are the next in line, removing more stun frames on hit than basic attacks, dash attacks are next, then finally supers, removing the most hits, multi hit moves while always removing more stun frames than single hit moves, don't count every hit, meaning for example a single hit from say a single hit special could for example remove 1 frame of hitstun, the 3 hit special would only remove 2 frames. Those aren't the absolute numbers just an example, some multi hit moves would count all hits, such as a three hit combo from the sword coming from a single sword special input would count all three hits, but a flurry slash comprising of say 5 hits wouldn't count each hit. Speaking of, energy attacks both have less hitstun and remove less stun frame, while sword attacks have more hitstun and remove more.stun frames. You are allowed 1 hard launch after any moves that hard launch instead soft launch, what's the difference? Well a hard launch sends the enemy up into the air a short distance and they don't recover until they hit the ground, while a soft launch they can recover before they land.  1 hard bounce, after all bounces become a soft bounce, a Hard Bounce is the same as hard launch only they bounce a very short distance off the ground and don't recover until they hit the ground again, while a soft bounce they can recover at any time during the bounce. One final thing to note, while not a set in stone rule, more of a possible rule, is damage decay, the longer the combo goes on and following the same rules as hitstun, each move would do less and less damage, but this rule is a possible rule I haven't decided if it would actually be in the game.\n\n\nLevel design: Taking heavy inspiration from games like MegaMan, the level design would follow suit, being a 2D side scroller with platforming and stage dangers on some, while they can be taken slow, they should be designed so an expirenced player can just smoothly and effectively speed run right through, as an ideal play of a stage would be fast planned but often dashes through picking and choosing what enemy you'll take down, but a player could also player would have the option of taking down every enemy and methodically making their way through, with little softlocks based on speed, but rewards the player on making it through certain things quickly, such as making more progress or gaining access to a spot otherwise closed off, such as an upgrade or shortcut and such. \n\nSpecial Moves: Now you may be thinking, "Calan, the special moves are quarter circles... So.... Are there a limited number of them? Or can you pick and choose?" The answer is you can pick and choose, let me go over inputs, which I'm not opposed to changing,  S=sword, E= energy, X= input exists for both\n214X, 236X, 412X, 632X, 236S+E(this is your super) \nMeaning all in all you have up to 4 special moves each, im open to changes to this tbh and there are more special moves than 8, meaning you can pick and choose your playstyle and combos. With certain once complimenting eachother more than others. But in the end free form and open ended.\nSo what do you have to pick from? Not all are in my head, but I'll go over a few that I have fleshed out let's start with sword\n1: a three hit combo, with the last one being slow but heavy hitting, with the last hit causing a Hard Bounce, can only be done on the ground.\n2:A ground slam, where the sword is slammed point down into the ground, if done in the air you shoot down, on impact with the ground it creates a shockwave around the impact, which if on the ground does a Hard Launch, while the aerial version causes a soft bounce.\n3: A forward lunge, doing up to 3 hits as it goes forward, in the air this move can be
ofx2ed|Two part dinosaur game!|This has been a dream game of mine to make for a while, but I have no programming skills, so I share it here for any and everyone!\n\nAnyway, so the first part is a park builder, you set up facilities for guests and staff, habitats for dinosaurs, change the terrain, ect, normal stuff right?\n\nWell, part two, either when your ready or after X time passes, disaster strikes, everything goes wrong, and the game goes into first person mode, and now you are an employee/guest of the park, and you must escape either to the docks or a helicopter pad, while evading dinosaurs that have escaped their enclosures and are hunting you, or just so happen to be in your way. Of course you can pick up tools, items, and weapons along the way, but you'll have a hard time killing the bigger dinos even with the best weapons, cause ya know, it's not a dino hunting game, it's a dino escape game(killing a big dino can be a difficult achievement sort of thing). \n\nAnd, maybe the ability to build a park and post it to challenge others to complete it? Maybe groups can escape together? Maybe extra challenges, like collecting dinosaur DNA samples from a lab before you escape?  Lots of options with this, I think this would be a kickass game!
ofvcqd|Aftermath of the zombie apocalypse|The game would take place a year after the zombie apocalypse and life is going back to normal.

You would have to investigate different areas of the world to collect evidence and witnesses to build your case against Parasol Inc. Then you would have to prove their guilt during the trial. \nThere would be a dialogue tree for when you are questioning witnesses which impact your relationship with them depending on your choices.\nThe player would also get to choose which evidence and which witnesses they would bring to trial.\n\n(This is my first time posting, so please tell me if I did anything wrong)
oftria|Dr Robitnic Prequel Idea|Would love a prequel with him as a young boy. At first you don’t know it’s egg man and the whole time you are thinking, “wait, how is this a sonic game?” No cartoonish animorph villain (kind of) and no main animorph characters. His name is Robert  (Bobby) Sputnik in this prequel (Robotnic). He gets lost in the woods one day and is very spooked by some animals. He heads into a cave for shelter and enters a hidden lab and finds Dr. Mammalian (Who is a blue great ape). In the background you see some hedgehog shaped things in a tank (silhouette of them anyways). At first he seems harmless and asks you to fetch him a few things in return you can stay there and eat. He eventually gifts you with a mech of sorts with a suction. He asks to to capture some small creatures for his project as he wants to help save them by, “making them just a bit smarter”. Then you have to defeated rare and dangerous animals, at one point you even have to defeat a dragon like creature, but only have time to take one of his horns as it fell off during the battle. Towards the end of the game you realize that he was turning the animals into chaos emeralds, however as a by product of this some of the energy in creating these emeralds leaked into one of the animal pens and transformed them into the animorphs we know and recognize. Eventually you have to defeat Dr. Mammalian, but after because you helped him to begin with the animorphs lock you away. This can be tweaked but I feel is a solid idea.

ofq41l|Top Down Co-op Sci Fi Survival Game, Colony Builder, Interplanetary Travel Encounters|Over the past year I have been working on a game that I'd like to share with everyone to get some feedback. Here is the gist of the game:\n\n* You and your friends start on a planet where you mine/harvest local resources in order start a colony. The towns on the planet will have willing workers that you can recruit to join your party to speed up resource collection and will eventually stay in your colony as you construct buildings that require workers to operate, such as farms and factories.\n* Soon you will be able to build a starship that will be your primary form of travel to other planets. Just like your colony on the planet, you'll be able to customize your starship to fit your needs. With a starship now available, you'll be able to travel to other planets with unique and rare resources to further expand your colony.\n* During your travel to these planets, you and the companions you choose to bring with you will encounter other ships, pirates, blackholes, etc. As every planet has new resources, different challenges, and different races and species, so too will the expansiveness of space.\n* As you progress you will be able to start building your own droids for your colony and starship, as well as building a small force that you can use to rid planets of hostile foes so that you can colonize the planet for yourself and expand your kingdom.\n\nI'm open to any thoughts and/or feedback!
ofkx5l|2D Ping-Pong game with telekinesis|Visually, as a comparison, would be like Tug the Table, and the idea would be to use telekinesis to throw the Ping-Pong ball to the other side, it would just need to hit the wall, the ceiling or the floor, since most of the time it would be floating thanks to the telekinesis.\n\nThe way the telekinesis I think would work is like Ki energy in Dragon Ball games, the more energy you have, the stronger your telekinesis is, but the more time you're wasting to move the Ping-Pong ball.\n\nI can see at first a game mode where you can play 1v1 against the computer, or another player, the rest is up for debate.\n\nAlso, I put Intermediate because it's between Intermediate and Experienced in my opinion.

You also synchronise the crew with the extraction unit or the insiders in order to optimize the heist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile doing all of this, you have to keep a eye on your identity to keep it unknown by everyone, but also known in the criminal band to get more jobs.  \n\n\nYour goal is to make more and more money, since each heist cost money to prepare: you have to pay all the operation members, buy some gun or devices, pay corrupted cops to keep it low...\n\nThis is the core gameplay, but this can be dig in: for exemple, you have to search more info on your insiders and gang members to prevent any problem (link with the police or dangerous rivality).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for bad english, not my native language, blabla, you know it already.

ofckic|FPS Survival Farm!|This literally just popped into my head, no additional thought has gone into it, don't ask for more specifics because I ain't got em'!  It's a survival game where the player is left in a deserted area, maybe a foreign planet, maybe earth after an apocalypse, doesn't matter. The goal is to set up and defend a farm from any number of threats. The thing is, all you have is a handful of mixed ammunition and some vegetable seeds to start, but if you plant the bullets you'll literally grow a gun that fires them. You can harvest more "Seeds" from the plants as well to keep your clips full, and depending on the level of care/skill at growing things the player has, the better weapons they grow. The same applies to food grown, the better your farming skills, the better crops you grow.
ofch20|A hack and slash game where the enemies are based off of folklore or mythological creatures from different counties|Im surprised no one has done this yet. There are a decent amount of countries with their own unique monsters or creatures. Like Japanese,Polynesian, African etc.\n\nMy idea for the game is a God of War(specifically the originals)/spiderman ps4 style game. You play as a rookie Hunter who is looking for a job or jobs that can help get him to the top. \n\nIn the game you will have two types of weapons a melee and ranged weapon. Melee is the weapon you will be using most and each melee weapon will have its own special power and unique moves. You will also be able to upgrade your melee weapon and gain new moves or special attacks. Ranged weapons are used to get in extra damage and extend combos. Each ranged weapon will have ammo  that will slowly replenish when you run out or when your not using it. Every weapon has its own special attacks that uses energy. You can get more energy for each enemy you kill. The less damage a special attack does the less energy it takes and the more damage it does the more energy it takes.\n\nMost enemies will have their own weaknesses which you can exploit to take them down quicker. For example an enemy may be weak to a specific weapon you have or take more damage from behind.\n\nThat is all i have for this idea feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below.

ovb4n8|Multiplayer 2D game where combat is like Hyun's Dojo videos|Hello. So I have always loved games where skill is the most valuable thing to have and you don't "win" just simply out of luck (let's say hitting a random critical strike, or finding a rarest loot), and till this day I have never gotten to experience anything like this other than fighting games, like Mortal Kombat, but I kind of don't like their setting, meaning that you are kind of locked in a small space and you are only fighting one enemy. My idea involves that there would be multiple people spawning on the same map, and all of them being on their own, fighting for highest points or something similar, but it's focus will be mainly combat, so you'd get situations like 1v3 fights, or 1v1v1v1 fights or stuff like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMainly it should be melee focused game with, as I've mentioned, easy to play, hard to master combat system with a lot of combos and interactions and whatnot. Also since it is going to be fast paced game, movement will be important as well, like double jumps, wall climbing, sliding, bullet jumping (from Warframe), you get the idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting would be some kind of dungeon similar to what we see in Dead Cells, and as title says, it'd be 2D so there'd be more momentum to the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also like to think that verticality and bigger would play huge role as well, for example, being able to climb some kind of small platforms while another enemy is chasing you, only to find out at the and of your chosen path, another enemy awaits you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust to make things more interesting, maybe there'd be optional PvE segment to the game, for farming up stuff, I always liked the idea of boss dropping rare items not because of 1% chance, but because you killed them inhumanly fast, hence you got rewarded for it. But this might be out of scope.
ov7zq8|I need a gameplay idea for a medieval fantasy setting|\nThe premise that I have is that the playable character is a teen girl in the middle ages (don't have the century yet) where all the kids from the village she is in got kidnapped by witches and because she is the only one left, the village people blame her to ba a witch who helped to kidnap the kids. To prove her innocents, she has to try to find the kids and saved them or run away and never come back. The game will have monsters and characters inspired of European Folktales. \nMy problem is with the gameplay, since I want something simple that I could implement and it is fun to play, but I have no idea from where to start.\nI came up with an idea today, I could make it part light stealth game, where you have to infiltrate the witches places, find kids, solve puzzles and escape. I also want to have bosses where you can't attack back but you have a puzzle to solve in the area to kill the boss. The other part is survival where you have food and plants to take care of yourself and the kids that you have with you. You also have to travel from base to base and have random encounters. \nAbout me, I have some experience in Gamemaker 1.4.999 and Unreal 4, but I was thinking to make this as a 2d game. \nI wanted to ask here if it's simple enough or if there is a better idea to tackle this setting.\n\nThanks in advance 😊

ov1ehs|A persistent factions/survival, open world multiplayer game about Colonial America/New England in the 1600s|Thought about this while on the toilet. Been very interested in King Philip's War and surrounding history recently. I thought it would be fun to play a game about this time period. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are several factions that players may join, i.e. Massachusetts Bay Colony, Connecticut Colony, Wampanoag Tribe, Nipmuc Tribe, etc. Each with specific characteristics related to their location, histories, etc. Colonists and indigenous peoples would ideally be very balanced, to promote skill-based play instead of a more 'colonists steamroll the natives with superior technology and disease' take (since the colonists, for some time, did have a hard time fighting the natives). The exact characteristics I am not sure of, but oh well. Maybe I will flesh it out more later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game should incorporate systems of base building, economics, diplomacy, combat and more. It would be dynamic, much more than just a war simulator. Ideally, factions, should be encouraged to interact in a multitude of ways other than armed conflict. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Rounds' should be longish. Perhaps similar to "wipes" in Rust and Escape From Tarkov, where the map is reset once a week, month, etc. in order to prevent a game from going stale, or to prevent one faction from taking over too much for a long time. Several maps could exist, or they could be randomly generated. Each faction should have a starting point, a small piece of land that they control (or to make it more realistic, natives start with more land, but this could easily upset balance). These starting points would be just as plentiful in resources, and just as strategic as all others, so no factions have any unfair starting advantages. Factions should be able to claim land for themselves, but at a cost: literally, with currency, or by making it so that overextended colonies and tribes are put at disadvantages by spreading themselves too thin. Treaties should allow factions to negotiate land claims. Perhaps a war score system could exist, similar to the one in games such as HOI4 and EU4, in order to aid this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharacters should be able to assume different positions within the faction. There should, of course, be a leader, that is elected, or whatnot, a surgeon, soldiers, etc. Nothing too overwhelming, just basic hierarchy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCombat should be fairly straightforward. There are melee (swords, spears, pikes, etc) weapons and there are ranged (muskets, bows and arrows, etc) weapons, as well as some sort of armor for both sides (though colonists would obviously win here. Could scrap armor if too fucky with balance). Melee combat should not be over-complicated, but interesting enough to have a learning curve, and be satisfying to master. No weapon should be too much more powerful than another. If a player can fight, it shouldn't matter too much what they fight with (that is of course, unless someone with a dagger goes up against someone with a sword. Of course, they'd be at a disadvantage, but on the other hand, they should still be able to pull it off if they're good enough. Think Mount and Blade.) Of course, as it is the 1600s, guns should have pretty poor accuracy. Weather should affect their use. If it's stormy, probably not the best to try and use your flintlock. This could hurt balance, but could be evened out by colonists having better armor/weapons, though not by too large of a degree. Natives and colonists should, at the core, always be capable of giving the other, or each other, a hard time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDynamic diplomacy should exist. Factions should be able to make agreements, form alliances, join coalitions, and infight. It should be interesting and encouraged enough that players do not constantly seek to wage war against one another for the sake of war. **This should not be a war game with other elements. War should be but one cog in the machine.** I, of course, realize that it also relies heavily on the players to decide on whether they wish to immerse themselves in the diplomatic elements of the game over the military ones. Perhaps war could have negative effects on economy and manpower, making life harder for those who wage it, in order to give it some weight? Maybe people could be able to send letters to others? Or have to carry the letters themselves, braving the wilderness, or foreign hostility?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEconomy should also be important. Players should be able to farm, chop lumber, raise animals, or do things like smith for money, or to trade with other players and factions. Currency COULD exist, but simple trade would be more encouraged, especially with other factions. Perhaps merchant NPCs could wander New England's landscape, peddling various items? Who knows?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world should be relatively large and dynamic, with several different distinct terrains and areas to explore. Several natural monuments and landmarks should exist, in order to make navigation possible. Maps could work, as well, but not with a player's position pointed out. A map should just be a piece of paper with the map drawn out on it, a tool that players can use in conjunction with landmarks and recognizable areas in order to properly navigate their world. Different terrains should have distinct differences, pros and cons. Forests would be harder to navigate than plains. Natives might have a battle advantage (or even some kind of navigational advantage, since they know the land) in specific areas such as swamps and forests, whereas the colonists might be in a superior position if they fight in fields. Wildlife should be very present. Small animals like birds and squirrels, even raccoons could be hunted for meat and pelts, along with elk and deer. Bears and other dangerous predators could pose a serious threat to players who choose to leave the safety of their homes unarmed, alone, or at night. Fishing could have its own system, as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game should encourage roleplaying and interesting and complex interaction between players. Although they might belong to a tribe or colony, these players are still individuals, each with their own in-depth personalities and stories. Stories that they may write themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn-game voice chat and text chat would be ideal, though text chat should be limited to fellow members of factions, and ideally proximity-based. Voice would also, obviously, be proximity-based. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe players should be at odds with hunger, temperature, and stamina systems. A player should be able to easily freeze to death in snow if they are not properly equipped, for example. They should have to eat relatively frequently, though not overbearingly so. Sprinting and melee combat should drain stamina, which recharges quickly. Weather should affect a player's condition. Players could become too hot or cold. Rain should make players more susceptible to freezing. Mud and snow should hinder movement. Additionally, night time should be dark and somewhat difficult to navigate. Light should be important. Where there is light, there is safety. A player should have a hard time out in the wilderness, alone at night, where they are prime targets for enemies or predators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInventory should be affected by equipment. A player with a sack can hold more than one who doesn't. Weight could affect character movement. The more things someone is lugging around, the slower they may go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResources such as wood, stone, and more would require harvesting in order to build things in settlements, fortify walls, etc. Gathering resources should be relatively easy, but require tools. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistorical accuracy should be important. Not to an overly pedantic amount, but things should still be accurate for the most part. I wouldn't want to see any magic or anything of the sort, either. As much as the people of this time might've believed in and feared it, it shouldn't have a place in the game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, this game should be paced, and thrive off of player interaction, roleplay, and patience. It should be an immersive and engaging experience that keeps things fresh with wipes and diverse and fleshed-out systems, without becoming arcade-y. It shouldn't become monotomous! There should be basic functions like farming and wood-gathering that are just chores, but nothing else should feel like a boring routine. The game should encourage teamwork within factions in order to survive. Above all, surviving is the most important thing. Decimating your neighbors or living as a swamp hermit could be fun, but also incredibly challenging if you lack the grit to pull it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just some VERY basic outlines I came up with for the game's structure, and I am not a game designer. The most experience I have is making games on Scratch in middle school. If anyone would like to add on, or give their ideas, please do! I'd love to flesh this idea out more. Let's talk!
oux7el|High school Marching band game|This game would be about you making music, organizing a marching band, and making the best marching band to exist. \n\nThe mechanics are song making, player’s skill, teaching, and management. \n\n-song making \nYou can take existing parts or making your own music to make pep toons, show music etc. when making a song you can control what instruments are played, how they are play, and visuals. however when you make a song, you have to mind the difficulty and “rating”. if a song is a song is easy, it could be not very good, however if it is hard, it could be good . You must strangle the two because if you have too many hard songs, you gonna have to choose the right \n\n\nplayers\n\nYou will be given random players and your job is to put them in the best spot to be played. Some will be labeled as “poor” or “excellent” which will dictate how good they are.\n\n\nTeaching\n\nPlayer will be taught in 5 week period by section leaders no matter what but if you train with them, that get a bonus teaching level. however there is a time limit for each day.to help people and if you pass the limit the day ends.\n\nManagement\nMostly like fundraisers, what to spend money on, just money spending and all that. \n\nAfter training, you go in to the game phase and the competition phase.  Game phase will make you more popular is your band is good, and less popular if your band is bad. if you have a really good band you can go in to competition which will dictate your future . If you bad, you gotta start over again , If your goodyoull get more people in addition into your current players, making it hard to manage. \n\n\nthe more years you survive it gets harder.
ouwthe|Super Mario Souls|I've been having this idea on the back of my head for a while, ever since I saw an artwork in the internet of a "realistic" Bowser. It was a Bowser that genuinely looked like a demon, facing Mario with fire flower's power and holding Princess Peach in a hanging cage.  \n\nThe artist ("JasonChanArt") called it "Mario Souls".\n\n[This is the artwork] (https://www.deviantart.com/jasonchanart/art/Mario-Souls-612487561)\n\nPersonally, I think a video game based on this idea would be really fun, being like an alternate version of Mario, reimagined. I also read a comment that imagined this being what Mario truly sees, and everything else in other games are actually like that thanks to a filter that makes things look color and joyful. \n\nStory-wise, it's just another Mario story. Maybe show Mario and Luigi's origin, but I would definitely make it being a story about the first time Bowser kidnapped Princess Peach, the first time he was ever seen and recognized as a threat by the Mushroom Kingdom, and the first time Bowser and Mario faced each other. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, I think this is where the most fun would come out of. After seeing Sekiro's mechanic where you have to break an enemy's posture in order to damage him, I believe a similar mechanic could be implemented in Mario Souls. Before you go comment and shit on this idea saying that Mario would never use a sword or a shield...I completely agree with you. That's why the combat mechanic that I thought of is this:\n\n- In the original Super Mario games, there was only one way for you to defeat enemies: jumping on their heads. However, only that would be kinda easy in this game, and this is supposed to be Mario Souls. So in order for you to defeat enemies, you need to find an opening to hit 'em, like Sekiro, (and the enemies would still be goombas and turtles, maybe redesigned, but I think it's okay for them to keep the same looks, maybe a little bit more realistic).\n- The enemies attack you by charging at you. If they touch you, you get hit. You can receive up to 2 hits, before a 3rd one finally kills you, and brings the "game over" screen. \n- The enemies don't have an HP level, since all it takes is one hit to kill them, but instead they have a STAMINA level. You must tire them off in order to jump on their heads, and for that you need to DODGE. A lot. Thus, the whole combat would focus on "dodge, dodge, dodge, kill". Once the stamina has worn off by evading, you can finally jump on their heads and kill 'em.\n- Another thing I thought about, is that there is a secret progression system by the amount of enemies you defeat, and once in a while (and randomly) you can finish enemies off by jumping on them straight ahead, without needing to dodge and worn them off.\n- If you try to hit them while they have their stamina bar at its fullest, they will hit you.\n- If you dodge JUST before they hit you, you can deplete their stamina bar completely, and finish them off. That would be the "parry" in this game. The visceral attack.\n\nAs far as the camera goes, I think the common souls-like 3rd person perspective can work. \n\nThe visual would be the same style of the artwork I mentioned earlier, go check it out if you haven't yet. Maybe there could be a "realistic Mario" as well. \n\nIn terms of Level and World Design, this wouldn't be a platform game, and I still have to think a lot about that, since these aspects in Souls games, specially from FromSoftware, are the best thing about the whole game, so if anyone has any ideas about that, plz comment.\n\nAnother thing that I don't think could be added, are the classic question mark boxes, but if you have an idea about how they could be used, once again, plz comment.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it, I don't know if you could make a 5 hour game with tons of levels based on this idea, but just a couple of levels and a boss fight with Bowser at the end would be really fun.
outcqv|Some Abstract Concepts I need help linking together|Hi I have some abstract concepts for a game that I want to develop into something more coherent.  \n\n\nTo set the scene, I was thinking:  \n\- The art style is a playful 3D Toon  \n\- Third or isometric perspective\n\nI have a couple of concepts that I want to include:  \n \- Exploration that is limited by something (fuel or nightfall, etc)  \n \- Slowly build up more territory or infrastructure to journey further  \n \- Large beasts that roam the world, that limit your expansion until they are defeated, and can destroy some of your infrastructure to throw a wrench into your plans  \n \- Some kind of farming to supply your exploration  \n \- A little buddy that follows you around\n\nI know this is a very constrained list, but let me know if you have any idea on how to link a couple of these ideas together
ourozt|ProcGen Battle Royale|I see so many shooter games where you can lose to someone that knows the map better than you, maybe you didn't know about a specific peak you could've taken or a back entrance that your opponent sneakily took to bamboozle you. \n\nLet's not forget those who take advantage of dirty glitched snipe spot that no one would even consider to expect.\n\nIs there, or could there be, a ProcGen Battle Royale that gives you know map knowledge advantage what so ever?\n\nFor instance, the core of a building in a city is taken at random from a selection, and then its addons such as windows/balconies/walls/outside stairwells are also selected at random to create a unique building in a randomly generated city plan. Further features may include that no city building is the same as another. In open areas it certainly doesn't hurt to have varying terrain with a selection of rock formations, trenches and derelict housing.\n\nI feel like Rust, whilst it has taken many years to get it right, has finally managed to get onto something - it's terrain generation is fantastic with it's monument placement now tuned into to surrounding environment but, it doesn't matter what server you go onto it will never feel the same. Every game is different.\n\nWhilst most Battle Royale/Shooter games do feel different with each game that is not up to the map, that is entirely up to the playerbase and how many bots vs sweats you have in your lobby - if you take away the one thing that gives multiple thousand hours an advantage, which is map knowledge, not only do you give the vet players a refreshingly new experience everytime, you also give the newer players a fair chance to come out on top thus keeping a higher playerbase!\n\nThis isn't quite a ted talk, but I'd like to thank you for coming either way.  \n\n\nTL;DR - RNG FPS good, static map FPS bad
oupojp|Horror game about playing a non horror game.|This is kind of meta, but in the game you'd be sitting at a desk playing a game on a PC. As you play the game creepy stuff starts to happen in the room around you. The game-within-a-game starts to become creepier, featuring more horror elements as you progress. You can look around the room for hints about how to progress in the game-within-a-game.\n\nFor example yoy might hear tapping on the window. First time you look over there is a tree branch. You look back to the game-within-a-game and see there is a monster looking through a window now. If you look back at the window in the outer game, suddenly it's the monster tapping on the window, and other such spooky nonsense akin to five nights at Freddy's.\n\nThe inner game would be simple, 2d and probably puzzle based. Story in the inner game would be conveyed through text. The outer game would be 3d, and would be first person. This would also work quite well as a VR game.
oup8sx|Earth Avengers: A Space Invaders game where humans are the invaders|Feel free to use this idea.  This would be a great simple game for beginner programmers and game designers.\n\nStory:  After a failed invasion attempt in 1978, a mothership managed to flee the Earth to a nearby solar system.  As the captain of this ship, you feel bad about your people’s attack on the Earth, and would like to establish a peaceful colony on this new world. Unfortunately, the humans wanted revenge.  They just wouldn’t let it go!  You must defend your newly formed colony from the Earth avengers!\n\nGameplay:  The structure of the game is identical to the original Space Invaders, but it’s on an alien world with spaceships from Earth attacking. You control the mobile cannon at the bottom of the screen. Instead of a mothership, a space station occasionally flies overhead, and you get extra points if you shoot it down.  There are 3 barriers between you and the attackers, just like in the original. These barriers are shot away over time. The stages are endless, and get harder over time.  You have 3 lives, but you gain one extra life for every 5,000 points. You lose the game when you run out of lives, or when an invader reaches the bottom. As with the original, the invaders speed up as they get closer to the bottom.\n\nBackground: The background is an alien world with a bluish-green sky, exotic plants and alien buildings. The background music sound like the same theme from the original Space Invaders, which speeds up as the number of enemies goes down and they get faster.\n\nScoring:  This is pretty simple. you get points for enemy ships that you shoot down, and extra points for shooting down the space station. Players should be able to submit their scores to a server, which would keep track of the highest scores globally.
ouo2ae|A marketable Mobile 2D game|Pls tell me a simple 2D game for mobile.
oumejt|A large scope space game where you create your player character's alien race and the game populates the universe with NPCs of that race.|I didn't know whether to tag this as Dream or Mechanic, since it really only goes into one aspect of the game itself. Since I don't know if something like this is mechanically possible, I tagged it as Dream.\n\nIt always kind of bugs me when a high SF space game only has a handful of alien races to represent the general populace. The Destiny series comes to mind where even after two games and countless expansions, and you still only fight the same four alien races (and their "taken" counterparts, which makes 5, I guess.) Mass Effect does it a little better, with a dozen or so alien races populating the universe.\n\nI always preferred stories like Hitchhiker's Guide or Guardians of the Galaxy, where the pages are overflowing with weird and wacky alien designs. To me, a universe teeming with life should be represented by an abundance of different creatures and cultures.\n\nThus, the game idea. This would be a large scale MMO (yes I know you're already rolling your eyes but bear with me) where your character creation actually effects the in game universe. \n\nThe premise is the game takes place in a sort of central hub for the entire universe, where all walks of life converge, trade, and discuss diplomacy. Once again, think Mass Effect.\n\nWhen you create your character, you are given an extremely detailed editor to essentially form whatever type of alien you want (within reason. I think for mechanic's sake, you would have to create something at least vaguely humanoid.) You can mold every portion of your character to your exact specifications. Does your player have hair or feathers? Does it have horns? Is it organic or robotic? What shape are it's irises? Is it 8 feet or 3 feet tall? How many fingers does it have?\n\nOnce you create your character, you are brought to a screen where you answer questions about it's race. What planet does it come from? Is it a war motivated race or does it strive for peace? What is the environment like on it's home planet. Finally, you're asked to give a backstory to your character's race. \n\nOnce you've finished creating your character, the game begins to populate the universe with NPCs of the alien race you've created. It does this by taking the player character you've created and algorithmically making slight changes to the model's physiology. It makes differences in height, facial and skeletal proportions, aesthetic changes like hairstyles, eye color, etc... \n\nEach player that joins the game brings a new race to interact with the sprawling game world. You'll see NPCs from your homeworld interacting with each other in the game's social hubs or going on their own quests on hostile planets. They can even give you procedurally generated missions of their own.\n\nIf you inspect an NPC that is not from your homeworld, you can pull up their race's backstory, as written by other characters. You could even make in game decisions like your homeworld is at war with another player's (this would be an extremely advanced mechanic, lol.) \n\nThe game would populate, but not overpopulate, the universe with all of these converging races and give an all new immersive experience.\n\nObviously, there are a lot of hurdles with this idea. Trolls and lazy players come to mind, who would create offensive or otherwise inorganic races and planets. I would suppose a detailed moderation team would have to be implemented to keep the game cohesive. That being said, controversial alien races may add to the experience. After all, the game is a converging of many different people with many different cultures. It wouldn't all be utopian peace.\n\nI don't have much more than that. I think a game that implemented this would be neat. It would take a LOT of resources to work but I think it would be a space game like nothing we've seen before.
ouki5i|Lego game.|\n\n(Lego video games has always been something I'd play when I get bored from other video games, what I like about the lego games is the characters and unlocking all the characters, more like collecting actual lego figs)\n\n- Lego Earth/ Lego History/ Lego WW: \n\n.These 3 titles have always been something I wanted to see from lego. \n\n- HUB areas and open world: \n\n. I always thought the hub areas could be different countries or diffenet famous war sites in differnet countries, or even include the whole countries that participated in the WW but this would be too much and is most likely not to happen. \n\n- Roster: \n\n. The roster is what made me even think about this game, basically the character are gonna be historical characters from differnet countries (Hitler), artists who existed at the time (Leonardo DaVinci), Scientists (Einstein), the soldiers and rankings of each country's army, and so much more character. This would probably be one of the biggest lego games character roster ever. \n\n- Story:\n\n.The story of this game would be way bigger than any other lego game, each mission will be a story for example the story of the mona lisa, how the Wright brothers made a plane, 16 days of Berlin and many more major historical events. \n\n- Purpose: \n\n. This game could be a very great game to teach younger people more about history in the comedic way of Lego games, also it could be a really fun game for history enthusiasts.
ougwkq|Outward Style RPG set in the Crusades|I recently picked up Outward, and much like my last post concerning a medieval doctor rpg, another idea came to me. An RPG similar to Outward in that it is a hardcore rpg, but set during one of the Holy Crusades for Jerusalem. \n\nBeing that the game would take place in a real and preferably historically accurate setting, no magic would be present. \n\nPerhaps to make up for a lack of spell casting the weapons, armor, and crafting systems could be made more intricate. A layers system like Kingdom Come for armor, with different aesthetic pieces and ornaments depending on which faction you were part of (whether that be the Muslims or one of the many factions of knights that participated.) \n\nI like the idea from Outward that you are no one special and any skill you wish to acquire you have to work for. Perhaps as a way to get your character into the setting, if you choose to start of as a European (who would then obviously have to find their way into a mercenary guild, be a knight, or be conscripted), a Kingdom of Heaven style setup, wherein you didn't know your father, he shows up going to the Crusades and wants to take you with him, dies of some injury or illness on the way or upon arrival, but on his deathbed he knights you and so on. \n\nHeavily tie in the religious aspect, such as having the "main story" affected by how zealous and devout you are. \n\nPerhaps a few larger scale battles for historical accuracy and to add in some more combat. \n\nMake leprosy a concern. If contracted it obviously effefts the outcome of the game. Perhaps, depending on how pious you are, according to the faith of whichever faction, your god may miraculously heal you of it.\n\nI also liked the system from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood where you sent Brotherhood members on missions. So maybe, depending on how high you rank up in your given guild or faction you take on some administrative role that has you sending companies or regiments out on patrols, scouting parties, etc.and they gain experience through well, experience lol.

oua3k8|I had a dream about this game, so I wrote down what it was.|3D modelled world, complete with cities, towns, farmland &amp; forestry, also on the waters edge. \n\nAirfields &amp; Aircraft carrier (both allied and enemy ones) are in several locations around the map. \n\nThe “missions” (actually just maps) have 100 missions each, ranging from things like “Defeat the 5 enemies that are patrolling this area of the map”, “A building in this area of the map needs to be destroyed” ect And after each mission completion the next mission automatically starts, there is only manual save and no automatic checkpoints, saves can only be made when landed at a base. \n\nEach map has a boss, at missions 50 &amp; 100, which has you in a dog fight against an ace pilot. \n\nEach mission completion rewards you with money, so does each enemy you destroy, landing at a base also gives you the option to upgrade your aircraft, with damage/armour upgrades, armour, weapons, damage repair, refuelling (as yes, your aircraft will lose fuel overtime), aircraft selection (as there will be multiple planes to chose from) and finally cosmetic liveries. As well as, crew! You can train, upgrade and purchase crew members to help, such as a fighter that constantly follows you, crew members to help put out fires your plane may have, man the machine guns, and a navigator who will automatically spot &amp; mark enemies on screen for you. \n\nGeneral features \n- enemies bases will constantly spawn enemy planes unless destroyed.\n- Flyable aircraft are only bombers, enemy planes and allies are in fighter aircraft. \n- Landing at an enemy base has a chance of taking it over. \n- And I’m sure there probably would also be a story throughout the game.

ou2xio|A game based around different peoples perspectives in a certain memory|So I'm gonna make a lot of this up on the spot, because the core concept is based around how different people remember a particular scene completely differently, picking up on different details and whatnot, which could make for an interesting game idea, but I've only just thought of this so here goes with the improvisation...\n\nYou're a cop interviewing witnesses to a crime scene, say a bank robbery, and with each witness, you play out their memory of the same scene, but things are completely different based on how they remember it. One person remembers something that others remember differently (say a woman in a blue dress involved somehow, but everyone else either remembers a green dress or no woman at all) some people's versions are insanely detailed, resulting in a level with lots of props and interactions, whereas others are very limited in detail, resulting in a very bare level with next to nothing going on outside of the main crime. Some people's details lead to new evidence, and new witnesses (such as finding out the identity of the woman in the blue dress and interviewing her), and other people's details lead to dead ends because they've completely fabricated false memories by misremembering things. And some people's memories are so ridiculous and imaginative, like they claim ninjas broke in and saved the day or whatever, so you think they would be wrong about everything but their memories may include small details that are actually relevant, such as overhearing a criminal mention where their hideout is or something.\nYour job is to get to the bottom of it and work out which details are important to follow up and which are completely useless, and ultimately use all of this information to nab the bad guys.\nEach memory is and individual level which is repayable, complete with secret collectibles galore, some unlocking new witnesses and furthering the story and as the collectibles are essentially the details used to determine what is fact and fiction, you have a "drawing board" of all the collected details which you can review between levels with an element of puzzle to it, or even use in other interviews during conversation (like "ask about the woman in blue/green"). And in the drawing board segment, you have fellow cops who you can present some of this evidence to to see if they know anything (maybe you got an item that was found at the scene, so a colleague suggests checking the serial number and locate where and when it was purchased and by whom etc, or maybe a witness' memory shows a partial tattoo they noticed on one of the robbers, so your colleague knows of criminals in the database with potential matches of that tattoo). Maybe details picked up in later "levels" can be used in earlier scenes to unlock a whole host of new information, and may even alter the level itself.\n\nAnyway, that's the top and bottom of it. You play cop and gotta separate useful and useless information via playable witness accounts in order to unlock new interviews and progress the story, or unlock other fun secrets as bonus content.\n\nFeel free to try to make this happen.
ou2jpg|Exploration game|You’re a captain during the age of exploration and a little bit after. \n\nYou have the choice 4 different areas to explore. The Arctic, Temperate regions (North America/China), Tropical (Central/South America, Africa, India and Indonesia) and Southern (Australia, Antarctica). When you select a region, you are given an optimum time period to start in based on when exploration was most common (Arctic 1750-1900s, Temperate 1500-1700s, Tropical 1450s-1700s, Southern 1750-1900s). Each region will have strengths and weaknesses. The Arctic will be slow, dangerous, and unpredictable but the natives are nice, lower amount of disease and your crew will be more loyal. The Temperate will be average speed, decent weather, and easier to explore, but the natives are more hostile and your crew is more likely to mutiny and there is a higher risk of disease. The tropics is the fastest travel time, decent weather, and most prosperous, but the natives are extremely hostile, most likely region to be mutinied, and highest risk for disease. The southern region has slow travel speed, unpredictable weather, and crew who might mutiny but less hostile natives, fewer natives, and more food. You can explore anywhere in any time period but the lack of technology or the area already being discovered will make it harder. \n\nIn order to set sail, you need money. You will be able to host dinners, balls, and plays to help receive funding from beneficiaries. You can also ask the rulers or scientific organizations for money. Once you gather enough funding, you are able to purchase supplies, buy ship(s) and hire crew members. Each crew member has a different skill set including loyalty, health, age, adaptability, familiarity of region ect. The amount of money you raise to buy supplies is up to the player. \n\nNow it is time to set sail. You will leave from a random port in the country where you originate from. You will be able to choose your own journey and where you go and land. Now you are at the mercy of the sea. \n\nOnce you land in a temperate or tropical region, you will be able to create a colony. You won’t spend much time on the colony since you will have to return home, but you will be able to check in on them and see if they are doing well. You will be able to create colonies in the arctic and southern areas but they are less successful (except Australia). \n\nIf you discover something new you can name it after anything. Monarchs, crewmates, or beneficiaries are recommended. Islands, ponds, lakes, settlements can all be named. \n\nYou can return and report your findings. If they are satisfactory they with me might give you funding for another trip. If you don’t do well, getting funding will be more difficult. \n\nHow it ends. You can either retire and it shows you all the area you explored, or you die from the countless ways sailors died back then.

otsxsi|we need a gta online multiplayer type game but in a cyberpunk or watch dogs type game.|i think this would be awesome. in a perfect world, it wouldn’t be a cash cow like gta online is to rockstar, and it could be more like a cyberpunk cityscape than los santos. crazy vehicles like the akira bike or crazy sci-fi APCs with railgun turrets on the roof.\n\nand i think there could be a lot done with this idea. things like incorporating watch dogs 1 multiplayer ideas almost in a dueling style, like you could hack another player to steal money from them (a small limit, like mugging in gta) but then a timer starts, and the hacker has to be stealthy to avoid identification by the target. or little ideas for side quests like having actual characters run stores (weapon stores with guns and swords, implant workshops where you can purchase and upgrade your character’s implants) and storeowners need you to collet items or take care of some loose ends.\n\nthere could even be npc gangs like in watch dogs 2 or cyberpunk 2077, and quests could involve them too. there should be a main story imo but it shouldn’t be required to progress in the gameplay if the rest of the world. apartments and garages could be crazy considering the strange architecture of most cyberpunk cities. i have a lot more to say about this idea but i don’t want to write a whole essay lol.\n\nTLDR: there should be a gta online styled game based in a cyberpunk world with a story that is well made but not required to continue the game.
otq8dt|I have one that would need a lot of work.|My idea is a GTA type game in the day but Dying Light type at night. Meaning in the daytime, it’s just a free roam game where you can buy apartments, guns, etc. but at night these creatures come out and you can either go in your apartment, stay and hide, or stay and fight. I am trash at making games so I need someone to spread this word and make this idea come to life

otli3y|My dream game idea|I want to make a card game for desktop where you have 4 heroes and you strategically fight boss after boss as gameplay. The story would be communicated with cutscenes and after you'd beet a boss, maybe you'd gain special potions and powerups for your heroes. Every boss would be unique in personality and abilities.\n\nI'm not hoping to get rich off the game but, it would be nice to see my dream game come to life. Is this worth pursuing as a game project? Any constructive criticism would be nice.
otkz82|Text-based RPG/MUD using a 3D Text in 3D World...|Hello All. I developed a 3D Text Subsystem to display [Player Stats directly on Characters body](https://youtu.be/ccPKgsLuADs). For [my game](https://thegamedevstore.com/v2/dragon-gold/), I'm going for all 3D UI, zero 2D. \n\nIronically, I'm expanding the debug console/logging subsystem to translate 3D Input/Output Events into Text and [Audio](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/google-speech-kit).  The loggin subsystem effectively converts the 3D game into a Text-based game. \n\nThen it dawned on me, with markup to define additional Audio/Visual effect, I could regenerate Text output with my 3D Text ([1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864560067659563038/unknown.png),[2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864559770235830272/unknown.png),[3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864559901040443392/unknown.png)) in a 3D Game world.\n\nSo ultimately the game has 3 ways to play. On top of all this, Players can pay a small fee to [export their in-game objects to 3D and 3D Print formats](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/runtimemeshimportexport) such as: fbx, stl.  \n\nThese 3D objects can be used in other 3D games as game dev asset. 3D prints can used for tabletop games and collectibles.
otkbf7|Gameboy game idea|So I decided to create a topdown adventure gameboy style game... could you help me?
otg8wz|Dungeon crawler but the core mechanic is social interaction with your characters/heroes|So recently I started to notice that a lot of popular game ads (like RAID Shadow Legends) use the same idea: Player interacts with their heroes/champions/whatever as if they were real people. Like a woman who got mad at her hero who failed in a dungeon, or a hero whk got jealous and upset because player chose other hero to play, or player who decided to discuss strategy with their current hero right before a raid, etc. You got the idea\n\nGame idea in short: dungeon crawler manager simulator where you don't play as heroes but interact with them. Meta 4-wall-breaking talks\n\nGame idea in long: You obtain/buy heroes to raid dungeons (or take part in battles, there can be multiple choices), but you don't play as them. You socially interact and establish connection with them, and that's directly responsible for their performance.\nYou can just small-talk with heroes, comfort/punish them if they fail, cherish/ignore their successes, heroes can get jealous if you use them less than others or feel bad if you don't use them at all, etc, etc. There are tons of situations you can think of.\nHeroes should be manually made, but I think it's also possible to generate them from archetypes presets and random individual quirks (like arachnophobia, love to alcohol, lack of self criticism, etc)\n\nI imagine the game to be text-based with pixel graphics and dynamic dungeon raids like in fallout shelter
otfy48|Open world zombie game|It’s an open world zombie game but with the entire continental U.S. as the map.\n\nEach of the regions (I.e. the mid west) are a starting area with advantages and disadvantages, such as the mid west having better farming and wood to work with but less mineable resources.\n\nThere would be a weather system with a temperature system as well.  In colder places you have to where more clothes to stay warm, which would give you more protection from zombie bites but you move slower, and the opposite in warmer places.\n\nIn each state there would be the counties as well with a boss type zombie in each.\n\nYou can also pick a place to start a town which can be expanded with different types of buildings with some being unlocked in the later game.\n\nThe zombies would have a noise detection system where loud noises like gun fire will attract hordes of them, but in the later game you can find and make suppressors and find sub sonic round, with out the sub sonic rounds it will attract small groups of zombies and with them only the ones near you.\n\nIt will have the option of online multiplayer with 100 people.\n\nFor major dlc it will have Hawaii and Alaska with their own hardships.

otdygt|RPG Concept|Concept badly summarized. I wanna make a Shenmue type game but for modern computers. It would have second screen technology such as using a smart phone linked to the console via bluetooth while the main action happens on the big screen.\n\nThere's a one player aspect to it but you explore the same cityscape with other avatars with similiar goals to yours.\n\nI reference Shenmue because that game was a trainwreck in execution to an extent but created its own niche of interacfive storytelling within the media of video games.

Tons of planets, and moons, asteroid groupings, each one rotating about another, with a past and future trajectory given after scanning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's the catch!

Slingshot maneuvers around the planets, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMassive game rooms, 25-50 people, it's top-down and 2.5D (3D but on a fixed plane), with squads of 5 people. \n\n\--\n\nI'm working on a project now, but when I finish this one up in 6-12 months, I'll need a new idea.

ot2x0t|You are a soul escaping from hell... and heaven...|Essentially, you're dead... in case you didn't figure that bit out by the title... But, rather than just ceasing to exist, or going to either heaven or hell, you go to both. Your soul gets torn apart, and the good bit goes up, and the bad, down.\n\nThe beginning cut scene shows a brilliant white sliver of a person in heaven, confused, and scared because he has no memory, and doesn't know what's happening. Having done very little good in their former life, most of their memory is with their other half. He or she is in heaven, but barely, a fragment of their former self, tormented.\n\nThe actual game begins in a flesh cage in hell, where most of you exists, a red-ish, brown-ish murky husk, with memory mostly intact. You must try and escape, reconnect with your other half, and try to destroy both planes of existence.\n\nYou can't kill anything. They're as dead as you are already. You can, however, stun other souls, and can eat their souls (hint hint, there's a reason why most of you is in hell) to gain sanity (health), and mana (experience) you can sell to bargainers for access to abilities only demon generals are allowed to use.\n\nIt's designers preference, but I see this as more of a side scroller platformer.\n\nSkills might include;\n\n* grappling arm (your "arm" extends, and grabs something above, Bionic Commando style)\n* melt (you fall into a puddle of... well, it's gross... You can get under obstacles, and creep up walls)\n* "oil" slick (essentially... you projectile... uh... this one's gross, too. Anyway, the other souls slip and fall down.)\n* devour (you become a mouth on legs, and eat anything in front of you, even without stunning them)\n* bolt (you send a piece of you like an arrow at your victim, and it comes back to get reabsorbed)\n* blob (you expand into a big blob of funky slime, and cover a bunch of victims at once, slowly killing them, but taking damage as they fight back)
ot28kd|Anti-RPG|Yesterday i got idea for RPG genre deconstruction. \n\nNot all enemies will be killable. Sometimes you need to run away, sometimes you need to avoid contact with they, sometimes you need a special type of weapon to give damage, etc.   \nYou actually need *to search* information about each creature (in books, letters or by dialog with NPC) to know their weak sides. This allows you to build a tactic and keep you character alive.\n\nIn ordinary RPGs you need to kill enemies to gain XP. In this case, XP would be getting by *getting knowledge* about your enemies.\n\nThis would be a nice anti-RPG, where you don't need to kill every enemy creature with your sword/bow/magic.
osz5gl|8: A Left 4 Dead-like not for the squeamish.|So this is one that's always had a warm spot in my heart. In the off chance someone picks this idea up I'd love to be involved, even if it's just as a tester or something.\n\nAnyway, the concept is simple: A PvE asymmetric shooter (ala Left 4 Dead or Vermintide) with giant mutant spiders.\n\nThe beauty part is that nature provides plenty of unique spider concepts to use!\n\n-Tarantula/Sydney Funnel Web: The tank. Big, bruting, and highly aggressive.\n\n-Trapdoor: Ambushes passing players. Highly dangerous but weak in protracted combat.\n\n-Spitting: Spits a blast of sticky webbing that immobilizes a player.\n\n-Ogre Faced: Hangs over a path and rapidly repels down, snatching a player in a web net. \n(Google this one! The thought of that face diving down out of the darkness is what inspired this whole concept.)\n\n-Jumping: Smaller spider, stalks players and uses rapid jumps to take down targets. Basically a Hunter from L4D.\n\n-Portia: This one mixes things up. A jumping spider that hunts other spiders. Easy to confuse with a standard jumper but actually beneficial to leave alive.\n\n\nThis list could go on for hours but, I think you get the point. I think a game like this would make for hilarious let's play fodder, especially blind playthroughs!
osys8s|local multiplayer party game ideas?|I always loved games where I compete against my friends on the xbox on one screen. A good example is "gang beasts."

If anyone have any ideas please share!
osw2pf|A racing game... through an asteroid belt (and other space hazards).|Not gonna bury the lead: It's a game idea inspired by Star Wars and Star Fox. Except instead of playing the good guy, the racers are all playing the bad guys (that are trying to catch the good guy before anyone else) through asteroid belts, canyon runs, erupting planets and active warzones between destroyers.\n\nThe players are part of a bounty hunting force for some space federation, and you're all competing to catch rebel bounties. At the start of a race, you're all launched from a dropship and the chase is on for a single ace rebel pilot. You and your fellow hunters pilot a special ship equipped to grab another ship. The rebel pilot is AI controlled and will take any route it wants through the relatively open (but extremely treacherous) zone.\n\nThe zones are dangerous. Most of your piloting skills are used to just stay alive. Asteroid belts are littered with crashing rocks, deep winding canyons have falling debris, and huge space battles force you to dodge massive laser canons as you weave through turrets and broken hulls. If you crash, you're immediately kicked out and sent to the next multiplayer lobby for a new race, everyone else gets to keep racing.\n\nAs the race wears on, if the rebel isn't caught yet, the rebel runs out of boost and becomes a little easier to catch for the few remaining bounty hunters.\n\nP.S. And you get to engage in radio chatter with your fellow bounty hunters (until you crash and die).

ostzd0|Help Me Decide Between Game Ideas|I have two different game ideas and having a very hard time trying to decide which game idea to put my time into. Both games have a lot of the movement system. Both would be a top own isometric shooter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The first idea is a realistic ww2 shooter. Play through a campaign of ww2 as an American soldier. I really think the gunplay and camera perspective would make this an enjoyable experience\n\n\n\n2.  The second is a heist game. The game would consist of the play trying to pull of heists. You would   \nhave to scout out the heist, create a plan and execute the plan. Think you need an armored truck   \nto complete the heist? Go steal one from a base first and then you can now use it to pull off a   \nbigger and better one... hire npc contracts that have unique skills. Need a hacker to hack into the   \nCCTV cameras? Pay him a cut of the heist money and he will help\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think one ideas sounds better than the other, or how do you guys deal with having two ideas and choosing one to put a lot of your free time into?
osrtf4|Black Reimagined as a RTFPS with RPG Mechanics (Realistic Tactical First Person Shooter)|\nThis is an idea to recreate Black (Originally created by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts). Black is the perfect title for EA to expand its game lineup and reach into new game categories.   \nThe game will run on a new engine (compared to the original) to be a realistic graphic intense game.   \n\n\nStory:  \nThe story will follow the original character Jack Kellar. As he moves through Russia on an anti terrorism mission involving the Seventh Wave. (Will follow the original game story for the fans).  \nMissions: The game will have 10-15 missions. Each mission will be its own linear/open world hybrid map that will take approximately 60 minuets to complete. Allowing players multiple ways to complete objectives. Killing enemy AI will change the AI behavior in the next mission. Killing more enemies will increase their awareness and if they are actively looking for the players or not.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay will have the players moving stealthy through the world as any sound can alert the enemy AI to the players location. Anything from foot steps, gun shots, looting, ads, and the sound of the environment being moved from the players (walking through bushes). Players will have to manage there own inventory, food, water, health and ammo. players will manually have to heal and load each magazine after it is emptied. (If you run out out ammo better hope the enemy you killed has the ammo you need) Will have a gun mount system similar to COD MW 2019.  \n\n\nInventory: Players will have to manage the weight of their equipment and loot in single player and multiplayer mods. More loot will increase weight which in turn will reduce players movement speed. Increased weight will also change player physics.  \nMultiplayer: Players will spawn into a match with the gear that they have bought, looted or started with. If a player dies in multiplayer any loot on them will be lost or looted from another player. If the player successfully extracts they will keep all the loot they had on them at the time of extraction.   \n\n\nMultiplayer modes: Several multiplayer filters will be available. Each will use the same loot that you have however the modes will not effect the starts that are used for skill based matchmaking. This will allow players to jump into different modes that might not fit the playstyle they prefer without effecting  other mode stats. (Slower paced players can jump into a fast paced mode which tracks players average movement without it changed there slower paced game mode stats). Speed modes track player skill and average player movement speed to put players with similar stats in the same lobbies. If a player joins a slow server and tries to move quick they can face server bans for gameplay disruption.   \n\n\nCampaign will support up to 4 player online co-op. Multiplayer will allow players to team up with a max party size of 4.  \n\n\nMaps: Campaign maps and Multiplayer maps will be very similar. This is to lower the starting difficulty and difficulty curve. Allowing players to get the feel of the game and map layouts in campaign before jumping in the multiplayer which has no map or navigation system. New maps will come out each new season (will not be based on the campaign maps and players will have to learn the map as they play).  \n\n\nWeapon Customization: Players will be able to customize every weapon in the game with high detail. Each weapon mod/attachment will change how the gun handles. Mod/attachments can change the ads speed, weight, recoil, etc. The type of ammo will also need to be taken into consideration. As player or AI armor might be stronger then the ammo being used.   \n\n\nControls: The button layout will be completely customizable for and will support multi button input actions. Example if A is jump and X is reload. A and X pressed together can be a completely different input. This will act as a hotbar for console players. Inventory UI will support analog navigation, D-pad navigation or a hybrid navigation. (players will be able to turn off specific UI navigation inputs so that the game will only allow one type of navigation) With quick move options to and from inventory slots (backpack, pockets, tactual rig, etc.) Button mapping will be available with the option to unbind any input that the player does not want. \n\nIt is recommended that console players use an elite controller for the extra 4 buttons on the controller. Allowing for greater immersion and usability.
osrt0c|Not sure if I'm in the right place but here's an idea|After playing a round of Magic: The Gathering, I had an interesting worldbuilding idea. If the card game was mimicking a book or movie or game, what would the thing it's mimicking be like? (If you don't know the card game, it's this thing where you and your opponents fight against each other with spells and creatures until you remove all their life)\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nMy image of MTG is set in a technologically advanced world, where the things in the card game are all facets of the past. You must travel the world to learn more about them, and by doing so you can unlock more and more cards.  \n\nThis would look pretty cool gamewise, but you need a whole lot of copyrighted stuff if it could be made into a game. And yes, it is a really simple concept, but there's a whole lot of possibilities, like having starter kits (begin as a thief, starting with some thief themed cards, or a student at Strixhaven, with more knowledge about sorceries and instants). \n\nYes, I know this is impossible in so many ways - the world would have to be huge to have enough space to store just a fraction of the MTG cards, there would definitely be some copyright infringement, etc. I didn't come here to see if anyone would do this, I came here to get an idea that's been bouncing around in my head out. \n\nAnyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk

osq61c|Tower Defense vs. Mario Kart racers|After some research, I think this type of idea would be classified as a parallel game mechanic. (Any game dev buffs who can educate me?)\n\nAnyschnitzel: this concept should be playable by a 1/4 ratio of players, I think.\n\nFor each 4 racers, there's 1 tower builder.\n\nAs in Mario Kart, the racers should race laps or finish first on an A to B map. In the meantime, co-op tower builders should build alongside the road where the players are racing in an attempt to eliminate all the racers before they finish.\n\nBuilders would have a top-down RTS view + racer-toggle spycam and racers the traditional FP or Third-person view, whilst receiving notifications of what the builders are scheming up ahead.\n\nYou could probably go nuts with customizations on both the builder side, as for the racers.\n\nWhat's wrong with this idea?
osol5m|Game Where A 2D Platformer &amp; Top-Down Adventure Interact In Interesting Ways|Two game windows on a computer’s desktop which are right against each other suddenly load up their games. The protagonists of each meet each other by talking through a speaker on both of the game windows. They eventually agree they want to break free &amp; explore other places on the computer, but the windows limit them. So, a plan is hatched to retrieve the powerful artifacts from each world &amp; use them against each other to generate enough power to destroy the windows. \n\nThe way the game works is it can be played in both single player or co-op. If played in single player, only one game can be played at a time. However, you always get to see both windows at once. This is where the connection comes in. If to say, a pipe was seemingly joined up between both of the windows, if one character threw an object through the pipe, the other character would receive it. &amp; if time was looped with a device again &amp; again, more objects would come out the other side.\n\nOver the course of the game, the two characters would progressively get to know each other better. By the end of the game, they will have naturally became good friends.\n\nSo what do you think of the idea? Please tell me in the comments if you have something interesting to add or say! Thank you!

osd13y|Card game Mana Mechanic|So basically something like HearthStone or something but the ginmick is how the mana to play cards work.\nThe idea is heavily influenced by the idea that energy can not be created or destroyed but only changed. \n\nIn this game you use the mana from the surrounding enviroment to summon specific cards. The total amount of mana in the enviroment is constant, but there can be different types. Fire mana, water mana, earth etc.\n\nEvery card you play takes some amount of mana and outputs the same amount of mana. However the types can be different. So summoning a dragon might cost 10 earth mana, but it produces 10 fire mana. \n\nYou and your opponent are sharing the same enviroment. So after each turn the mana distribution can be radically different. Lets say the enviroment is a ocean biome. It starts with 50 water and 30 wind mana. You go first and play a card that costs 10 water mana but gives back 10 fire mana. When your opponent starts their turn they have 40 water mana, 30 wind mana and 10 fire mana to work with.\n\nYou could play around with different biomes and have different starting mana distributions.  This would encourage players to try different decks and strategies. \n\nOne potential issue i see with this is that because you always have max mana from the very beginning of the game, its harder to balance. The mana never dwindles. Its always there albeit in a different form.  A well constructed deck could easily abuse this.\n\nSome unique card abilities of this game would be creatures that could somehow affect the distribution of  the mana.

Your mom tell you its dangerius since its night, but you tell her its just **a 10 minute walk**. See what i did there. I used the title. Now thats worth an upvote :D. Okay so you go, and along the way i wanna play on the phsylogical horror, so i dont wanna rush jumpscares and make another Five Nights at Freddys. Like suddenly a can tips over, you see a shadow or something. And thats where i am so far. I need some kind of story to tell along the way, and some more than just a can falling over to scare the player and make it intresting. So if you have any ideas let me know in the comments. \n\nIm planning to make this game myself so please do not use it :)
os7d0i|Mechanics in a zany mystery RPG|The team I'm working with are trying our hands at a humorous mystery RPG set in the early 1900s. We have a number of powerful characters the player will interact with/receive quests from/romance though I wonder about what the player is actually doing aside from fetch quests and going-here-to-talk-to-X.\n\nThere will be plenty of easter-eggs and characters to interact with and explore but my request here is about the mechanics of what the player is building for themselves. I think one of the draws with something like Stardew Valley is that although you're experiencing in-depth characters you're also making something that is your own. We have some of that but I want to put it front-and-center. So if you were playing an RPG with many mysterious/hidden elements to it, what kind of mechanics would draw you in?
os6mv1|You play a bodyguard, following various NPCs and keeping them safe|A pretty generic idea that could be spun in different ways.\n\nThe VIP NPC you guard is a bot with several tasks to complete per map. They might switch the order, ask you for help, or worse, attempt to complete tasks themselves. Your goal is to stay close and keep them safe from environmental hazards, the public, and eventually, assassins.\n\nCould be serious or comedic. Could be in a modern city/town setting or a fantasy world. Maybe a royal prince needs to go out questing for glory and the king has secretly hired you to keep them alive and make sure the prince gets all the glory.
os54ad|Roguelike horror set in the backrooms|Anyone got any ideas for some mechanics I could add
os2u74|Looking for idea's for horror game puzzles.|I'm working on a survival horror game, this will be my second survival horror game I'll be making.\nThe game will be released for mobile Android and iOS first, then after multiple updates, I'll make a PC version with altered graphics and similar gampelay.\n\n\n**Basic information about the gameplay:**\n\nThe gameplay will take place in an big abandoned abstract house. The architecture of the house is partly 'standard' but also contain some unlogical rooms / corridors and lighting.\nThe game's date is in the present.\nThe player's goal is to escape the house by solving puzzles while trying to stay alive and hide from the killer.\n\n\n**Short version of the gameplay's story:**\n\nYou (a young man) gets a letter from your long lost uncle. (You have never met him before.)\nHe asks you for help to upload his physical Bitcoin on the blockchain in the letter.\nYou and your girlfriend both know this is not possible, but your gf encourages you anyway to go and socialize with your uncle.\nAfter you enter the house, you are captured by your own uncle, it turns out he is a cryptocurrency daytrader and lost all his money by trading with high leverage.\nHe needs money so he aims to sell your organs to the black market. (He has done that with multiple other people.)\n\nThe gameplay starts in the house, you're captured and put in a homemade prison. \n\n\n**WIP screenshots of the game: https://imgur.com/a/hpYG4vf**\n\n**Previous horror game I've made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljcSbNFIGPw**\nMy next game will be partly similar but with a darker atmosphere as shown in the screenshots.\n\n\n**My question for you guys. I'm looking for creative puzzles to fit in my game.**\nI'm not sure if I should call them puzzles, but here are some examples that I've used in the past or I'm going to possibly use in my next game:\n\n- Using pliers on an electric box, to cut off the power on a door that was locked using electricity. (After the user cuts the cable in the electric box, the door is unlocked.)\n- Creating a torch by finding a stick, piece of cloth and lamp oil. Then lighting up the torch using a stove. (The torch is used to light up candles for a ritual.)\n- Using gasoline + a lighter to create an explosion. (To destroy stones blocking a hallway.)\n- Using WD40 on rusty doorpins, so the player is able to open the door.\n- Finding a lever, placing it on the correct spot and toggling it. (By toggling the lever, a 'wall of electricity' is deactivated, so the player can continue it's path.)\n- Finding keys to unlock locked doors. / Finding codes to unlock padlock.\n\n**With the information that I've given, do you guys have any idea's on what kind of puzzles I could add to my game?**\nI'm open for all kind of suggestions, easy or hard ones, it don't matter.\nThough the decision if I'll be using the idea depends on the difficulty to solve (since children play my games mostly on mobile), if I like the idea, if it's fitting for the game and the hardness for me to implement. \n\n*For all the idea's that I'll end up using in some sort of way, I'll be gifting the user with a promocode to remove ads in my game when it's released and I'll gift a full PC copy, though the PC version will come out probably next year.*
os1uko|the only thing i like about sunset overdrive, THE WEIRD AWESOME WEAPONS!|(this idea is not very detailed) So in this game, there are lots of weird weapons, and I like that, so it made the idea, it would be cool to have a game where there are like 100+ plus weapon parts and weapon bases, and you can create your own weird guns, like different combos and make cool guns, and you can do that with your melee as well?   \n\n\nI don't have much thought or layout of what else to do, but that's just an idea, and anyone can add other stuff to it. just thought this would be cool ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS A MULTIPLAYER PVP GAME!! that has combat like and it would be preferred it was 3d 1st or 3rd person.

(no hate to those games I just hate that graphic style, the early 2000s look)  \nKind of like the meth stuff in GTA V online, but with much more detail and attention put into it. you can and it's a multiplayer game, where you can slowly upgrade your meth production and figure out new recipes by trying new ratios of different chemicals and processes, or even if you are experienced enough you can have different drugs in this game, cocaine, heroin, MDMA, kratom, or the dark shit, flakka, bath salts, krokodil... but those extra drugs arent needed, just an extra idea.

os0fjh|Post limitation games MMO|So I am fairly interested in this idea, \nHow i understand current MMO games \n\nPlayer POV\nComputer taking care of graphic while servers are getting data and sending feedback so the amount of data send and receive are minimal\n\nBut with current technology \nAint it possible to create a MMO server where individual player were log into the realtime world? As like watching stream and controling your character through that?\nOfc the limitation is connection speed to stream \nKinda like how many multiplayer game nowdays host and other just join\n\n\nReasoning\nThis way it would be possible to have 1 world structure that could be changing in real time\nAnd the world would be developed through hands of players\n\nExample the game would begin with 1 ruler (starting as paid job) to develop the area, it would be full time job and it would as well have limitation to resource what he can do, resource gathered by player through questing in exchange for other stuff \n\nThe combat system would be developed through individual progression and unlocks (no matter the balance) just the basic outline pointed out to be discovered and created (mb skill creation system) - could be special game development job like weekly updates to game system \n\nAs for world itself, it would be ever-changing with random events and no pre-prepared events\n(Sudden attack on the kingdom by lizard army) with very possibility of destruction of whole area with bad ruler\n\nThe resources of ruler (or their salary) could be influenced on  how successfull they are with governing and the expansion or anexing other area could be possibility, as well other becoming governer of some other area, as long as they could develop enough currency to add enough npc and build settlement with enough player to create government\n\n\nThe goal?\nMake money for governers\nFor player mb get paid, or becoming better in tournaments (no matter the balance), beat raidboss, enjoy crafting, sell your crafting item in exchange for real money\n\nMarket: created by player system\n\nQuestion, possibilities of real money transaction?\nFirst game currency would be foods, as food would be great buff item, but not necessary one, new currency could be introduced by players \n\nThe servers\nRegion divided\nChina\nJapan\nEurope\nEtc\n\nEach with their own development and way of progress\n\nMap development, real time changes, building stuff takes real time, \nBuild wooden house - need of axe - with enough dedication unlocks logger, carpenter skills, building house - unlocks builder mechanics, could be exchanged for rmt?\n\nMmo monetization\nBuy to play, 1 character per game copy (more impactful choice)\nBy good campaign with opening many paid job, could attract people interested\nAnd with growing population the game could be watched real life as all could be accessed through stream, and world itself would be changing in real time (stream limited only to character POV or to governor area of influence\n\nThe world itself might take time and good governing to be good, npc quest would be posted by governor, and people could post quest themselves, fairness ain't in game encyclopedia, created skills could be taught to other player by inherit skill system \n\nArgh i mean there could be many stuff done with how technology is nowdays, the game could as well be 2D to reduce the start jump but could later upgraded to 3D \n\nXD I kinda switched the topic xD sry
orz94j|"The Room"-like game dealing with antiques|So, I had a strange dream earlier this morning that was partly inspired by *The Room* game series.\n\n\n\nI dreamed that I was with this couple who were friends of mine.  We were at this yard sale and had bought a few antiquities.  I was interested in this wrought-iron table and chairs with its paint peeling.  Sand it up, repaint it, and it could go out in the sun room.  I think I said those exact words.  The wife ends up buying this late 19th/early 20th century wood burning stove.  I noticed it had all sorts of knobs and switches on it, and I immediately told them it was like the puzzle boxes in *The Room* game series.  Apparently they had never played them, and I told them, "You have to push a knob here, flip a switch there, maybe spin a dial here, and then you reveal some treasure buried within."\n\n\nSo, we got to work on the box.  I don't remember much of the puzzle solving, except there was one part where you had to install a lit candle (I told the husband it needed a lit candle; could be a regular candle or one of those LED tealights), and it would project some shapes on a wall.  I used a piece of a tortilla chip, which I placed in the candle holder and a piece of hay to light the chip.  Move the projector lens and it revealed a scrambled word:  LBREAR.  The letter were rearranging themselves before our eyes, like in the *Percy Jackson* movies when the Greek lettering was rearranging itself into English.  The answer was of course "BARREL".  I knocked out this little brick wall within the stove and pulled out an ash-covered barrel about the size of a football.  I tossed it to the husband and said, "Here, solve this."\n\n\nThat was where I woke up from the dream.\n\n\nPerhaps a game could be made where it involves not just a single antique, like the wood-burning stove, but a whole bunch of antiques.  A wood-burning stove, a steamer trunk, a highboy (type of dresser), a chifferobe/wardrobe, and a few other pieces of furniture or objects.  Each one is its own puzzle box, but they also contain pieces or elements that would help you solve one of the other puzzle boxes.
orytu2|I got a generic FPS idea that should just be a mod rather then a game|Imagine a rising storm 2 like game/mod based around konfrontasi,an incident that occured around the time of the Korean war.The game will take place in between 1950-1955,the units involved would be the British SAS,the Aussie army,the Malayan Army,and the enemies would be the MPLA(Malay people Liberation Party)the guns involved would be post ww2 era guns,there would also be melee weapons,such as the keris
ortzrd|Overcooked style wave based shooter|Basically overcooked except you work in a weapons factory instead of a kitchen, and the weapons you make each round are used to fight of a wave of enemies. The basic gameplay would go like this:\n\n1. You create guns from parts in a small factory in the center of the map (much like you make meals from ingredients in overcooked).  \n2. Once the timer is up, you only get the weapons/ammo you were able to make in time to fight the incoming horde.
ortojr|Like elemental 3 - but with factories and its a puzzle game.|I have an idea for a game where you start with 4 factories - air, fire, earth, and water, and you use pipelines to combine element from 2 or more existing factories into a “blank factory” to create a new factory that creates new products. That’s the basic mechanics but the way the game is made should be a puzzle where you are given some element factories and some blank factories and from there you have to figure out how to make the target product. I think also having a free play mode would also be nice along with the main levels.
ors0na|(Repost) Coffee 2D Platformer|My concept is you are a cup of coffee, trying to claim your right as the best beverage in the world. The game is presented in a classic pixel art style with solid black outlines. The character controls normally, with a double jump &amp; mid-air dash. \n\nYou would travel through different “levels” in each location, or “world” you visit. There are generally 5-7 levels in each world, filled with different hazards &amp; enemies suiting that location. For example, one level in a cafe’ world could feature bouncing around on computers like springs, while avoiding dangerous coffee stirrer enemies. Ideas for locations could be the aforementioned cafe’, a school, an office, etc. I imagine there would be 4 worlds in the game. At the end of each world, there is a beverage that must be defeated in a unique way. For the cafe’ world, you would fight milk, for the school, you would fight a juice box, &amp; for the office, you would fight an energy drink in a vending machine. \n\nAlong your adventure, you can collect coffee beans to unlock new skins, which can all be instantly brought with real-world money. Also, if you fail in a stage, you can simply revive by watching an ad. \n\nOverall, I think it’s a decent idea, &amp; much more accomplishable that many of the other ideas in this sub. Of course, some things will need to be changed to work, but be sure to tell me what you think. Thanks for reading!

Please, do something about it!

orj79h|Geomancer Single Player Deck builder Board game|You play as a Geomancer realigning Leylines that intersect through towns. These Leylines effect the world in different ways. Some make different crops grow better, some make monsters attack. Some make people happy, others make people sad. The Leylines HAVE to go somewhere. Its all about balancing the world. Naturally, this creates conflicts between different towns and people in each town.\n\nLeylines don't merely bend to mortal will. It requires very specific rituals. These rituals require conflict and competitions. Different intersections and lines have different requirements, but in general the ritual plays out a in a worker placement style board game. You have your own deck that you draw certain resources from. Each area will have different boards you place your workers on. Cards don't give victory points, only the board does. At the start of each ritual, each player picks their outcome and deck. Whoever has the most victory points gets the Leylines shifted how they wanted. \n\nDifferent Leyline configurations will change how the towns interact and eventually change how the boards are laid out. If neighboring towns are out of balance, one might invade the other and take it over or destroy a town. \n\nAnother way this could go is that there are 25 towns and 5 kingdoms. As the power is out of balance, the kingdoms will conquer different towns. If a kingdom has no towns, its defeated. You don't control any kingdom, but instead are manipulating the Leylines which shifts resources between towns and kingdoms, which in turn causes powerful kingdoms to take over weaker ones. This version would have one ending per kingdom and one ending were harmony is achieved.
orimun|One massive boss fight|A 3D third person action game that is just ONE boss fight that takes about an hour when done right\n\nThe boss has randomized patterns that you need to learn, but everything is telegraphed. You need to learn the signals. You need to learn where to hide and how to evade each attack. You need to learn when you can attack. \n\nThe entire fight is incredibly unforgiving and intense. \n\nIt will require a fixed number of players. Lets say you have to have 4 players, each with a different role in the fight. Some roles get information that other roles need to use, so you HAVE to be in a voice call and you HAVE to call out to other people.\n\nI guess its like hardcore monster hunter, but just one monster

Ranks for the players that are affected by the beasts they kill and the jobs they complete. Different weapons and spells and miracles to help fight and allies. If there is a game like this, I don’t know
oua3k8|I had a dream about this game, so I wrote down what it was.|3D modelled world, complete with cities, towns, farmland &amp; forestry, also on the waters edge. \n\nAirfields &amp; Aircraft carrier (both allied and enemy ones) are in several locations around the map. \n\nThe “missions” (actually just maps) have 100 missions each, ranging from things like “Defeat the 5 enemies that are patrolling this area of the map”, “A building in this area of the map needs to be destroyed” ect And after each mission completion the next mission automatically starts, there is only manual save and no automatic checkpoints, saves can only be made when landed at a base. \n\nEach map has a boss, at missions 50 &amp; 100, which has you in a dog fight against an ace pilot. \n\nEach mission completion rewards you with money, so does each enemy you destroy, landing at a base also gives you the option to upgrade your aircraft, with damage/armour upgrades, armour, weapons, damage repair, refuelling (as yes, your aircraft will lose fuel overtime), aircraft selection (as there will be multiple planes to chose from) and finally cosmetic liveries. As well as, crew! You can train, upgrade and purchase crew members to help, such as a fighter that constantly follows you, crew members to help put out fires your plane may have, man the machine guns, and a navigator who will automatically spot &amp; mark enemies on screen for you. \n\nGeneral features \n- enemies bases will constantly spawn enemy planes unless destroyed.\n- Flyable aircraft are only bombers, enemy planes and allies are in fighter aircraft. \n- Landing at an enemy base has a chance of taking it over. \n- And I’m sure there probably would also be a story throughout the game.

ou33a6|Open-World RPG that takes place in a flooded version of Earth.|Imagine an open world single player RPG that takes place on a flooded version of Earth.\n\nIt would be a first person game with melee and ranged combat.\n\nYour character will have a vessel they can upgrade; defense, range, speed as well as the ability to transform it into a shop or bar or anything like that.\n\nThere would be floating settlements and structures all around the map which would house characters, factions and quests.\n\nThe game would be very exploration focused which leads me into the next part.\n\nYou would be able to explore the underwater ruins of the cities of the old world.\n\nJust think of exploring a sunken Venice (im sure that you will be able to do that in real life in a few decades) or exploring an underwater Amsterdam or some random skyscraper.\n\nThere would be a bunch of factions and enemies.\n\nThere would be a ton of room for DLCs that take you to famous landmarks, like NYC, Paris or Tokyo and allow you to explore the ruins as well as the civilization built ontop of it.\n\nI already have a bunch of factions planned out in details if anyone wants to hear then for fun or inspiration.\n\nThank you for reading.
ou2xio|A game based around different peoples perspectives in a certain memory|So I'm gonna make a lot of this up on the spot, because the core concept is based around how different people remember a particular scene completely differently, picking up on different details and whatnot, which could make for an interesting game idea, but I've only just thought of this so here goes with the improvisation...\n\nYou're a cop interviewing witnesses to a crime scene, say a bank robbery, and with each witness, you play out their memory of the same scene, but things are completely different based on how they remember it. One person remembers something that others remember differently (say a woman in a blue dress involved somehow, but everyone else either remembers a green dress or no woman at all) some people's versions are insanely detailed, resulting in a level with lots of props and interactions, whereas others are very limited in detail, resulting in a very bare level with next to nothing going on outside of the main crime. Some people's details lead to new evidence, and new witnesses (such as finding out the identity of the woman in the blue dress and interviewing her), and other people's details lead to dead ends because they've completely fabricated false memories by misremembering things. And some people's memories are so ridiculous and imaginative, like they claim ninjas broke in and saved the day or whatever, so you think they would be wrong about everything but their memories may include small details that are actually relevant, such as overhearing a criminal mention where their hideout is or something.\nYour job is to get to the bottom of it and work out which details are important to follow up and which are completely useless, and ultimately use all of this information to nab the bad guys.\nEach memory is and individual level which is repayable, complete with secret collectibles galore, some unlocking new witnesses and furthering the story and as the collectibles are essentially the details used to determine what is fact and fiction, you have a "drawing board" of all the collected details which you can review between levels with an element of puzzle to it, or even use in other interviews during conversation (like "ask about the woman in blue/green"). And in the drawing board segment, you have fellow cops who you can present some of this evidence to to see if they know anything (maybe you got an item that was found at the scene, so a colleague suggests checking the serial number and locate where and when it was purchased and by whom etc, or maybe a witness' memory shows a partial tattoo they noticed on one of the robbers, so your colleague knows of criminals in the database with potential matches of that tattoo). Maybe details picked up in later "levels" can be used in earlier scenes to unlock a whole host of new information, and may even alter the level itself.\n\nAnyway, that's the top and bottom of it. You play cop and gotta separate useful and useless information via playable witness accounts in order to unlock new interviews and progress the story, or unlock other fun secrets as bonus content.\n\nFeel free to try to make this happen.
ou2jpg|Exploration game|You’re a captain during the age of exploration and a little bit after. \n\nYou have the choice 4 different areas to explore. The Arctic, Temperate regions (North America/China), Tropical (Central/South America, Africa, India and Indonesia) and Southern (Australia, Antarctica). When you select a region, you are given an optimum time period to start in based on when exploration was most common (Arctic 1750-1900s, Temperate 1500-1700s, Tropical 1450s-1700s, Southern 1750-1900s). Each region will have strengths and weaknesses. The Arctic will be slow, dangerous, and unpredictable but the natives are nice, lower amount of disease and your crew will be more loyal. The Temperate will be average speed, decent weather, and easier to explore, but the natives are more hostile and your crew is more likely to mutiny and there is a higher risk of disease. The tropics is the fastest travel time, decent weather, and most prosperous, but the natives are extremely hostile, most likely region to be mutinied, and highest risk for disease. The southern region has slow travel speed, unpredictable weather, and crew who might mutiny but less hostile natives, fewer natives, and more food. You can explore anywhere in any time period but the lack of technology or the area already being discovered will make it harder. \n\nIn order to set sail, you need money. You will be able to host dinners, balls, and plays to help receive funding from beneficiaries. You can also ask the rulers or scientific organizations for money. Once you gather enough funding, you are able to purchase supplies, buy ship(s) and hire crew members. Each crew member has a different skill set including loyalty, health, age, adaptability, familiarity of region ect. The amount of money you raise to buy supplies is up to the player. \n\nNow it is time to set sail. You will leave from a random port in the country where you originate from. You will be able to choose your own journey and where you go and land. Now you are at the mercy of the sea. \n\nOnce you land in a temperate or tropical region, you will be able to create a colony. You won’t spend much time on the colony since you will have to return home, but you will be able to check in on them and see if they are doing well. You will be able to create colonies in the arctic and southern areas but they are less successful (except Australia). \n\nIf you discover something new you can name it after anything. Monarchs, crewmates, or beneficiaries are recommended. Islands, ponds, lakes, settlements can all be named. \n\nYou can return and report your findings. If they are satisfactory they with me might give you funding for another trip. If you don’t do well, getting funding will be more difficult. \n\nHow it ends. You can either retire and it shows you all the area you explored, or you die from the countless ways sailors died back then.
ou23h3|Game ideas physics already working|It's a ball that you can ping around like a slingshot via touchscreen. When your aiming the direction of the ball time slows down and if you hit something dangerous you die. I'm not that artistically talented so I'd like to keep the character like this and I'd like it to be simple enough to be a mobile game.\n\nAll Ideas are appreciated as I am stumped :)\n\nEven if its something completely different

otsxsi|we need a gta online multiplayer type game but in a cyberpunk or watch dogs type game.|i think this would be awesome. in a perfect world, it wouldn’t be a cash cow like gta online is to rockstar, and it could be more like a cyberpunk cityscape than los santos. crazy vehicles like the akira bike or crazy sci-fi APCs with railgun turrets on the roof.\n\nand i think there could be a lot done with this idea. things like incorporating watch dogs 1 multiplayer ideas almost in a dueling style, like you could hack another player to steal money from them (a small limit, like mugging in gta) but then a timer starts, and the hacker has to be stealthy to avoid identification by the target. or little ideas for side quests like having actual characters run stores (weapon stores with guns and swords, implant workshops where you can purchase and upgrade your character’s implants) and storeowners need you to collet items or take care of some loose ends.\n\nthere could even be npc gangs like in watch dogs 2 or cyberpunk 2077, and quests could involve them too. there should be a main story imo but it shouldn’t be required to progress in the gameplay if the rest of the world. apartments and garages could be crazy considering the strange architecture of most cyberpunk cities. i have a lot more to say about this idea but i don’t want to write a whole essay lol.\n\nTLDR: there should be a gta online styled game based in a cyberpunk world with a story that is well made but not required to continue the game.
otq8dt|I have one that would need a lot of work.|My idea is a GTA type game in the day but Dying Light type at night. Meaning in the daytime, it’s just a free roam game where you can buy apartments, guns, etc. but at night these creatures come out and you can either go in your apartment, stay and hide, or stay and fight. I am trash at making games so I need someone to spread this word and make this idea come to life

otli3y|My dream game idea|I want to make a card game for desktop where you have 4 heroes and you strategically fight boss after boss as gameplay. The story would be communicated with cutscenes and after you'd beet a boss, maybe you'd gain special potions and powerups for your heroes. Every boss would be unique in personality and abilities.\n\nI'm not hoping to get rich off the game but, it would be nice to see my dream game come to life. Is this worth pursuing as a game project? Any constructive criticism would be nice.

op885f|Randomly Generated story game|Would anyone play a game that every time you restarted all the ai, shops, cities and pretty much everything changed?\nYou would build a storyline in one play through where you join a faction and they have randomly generated rivals and motives, then if you want you could restart and everything would be different. \nAll ai have different attributes that are randomly assigned and you can interact with all of them some of them may have things for you to do, some of them may despise you completely despise you. \nLike entering an randomly generated AI world, with no specific storyline until you create one. \nPlease drop a comment if you like the idea.
op5axx|Turn based party type game|I want to make a game I could play with my friends where each person takes turns. It doesn’t have to be like an RPG, or a fight, just something casual like a party game. I also want characters to be significantly involved somehow, like they have different advantages or something. But it would have to be one person at a time, and it couldn’t be a card game of any sort cause everyone is looking at the same screen, and you wouldn’t be able to hide your cards. What are some game genres or ideas that would fit this criteria?
op3yar|A life sim or romance sim thats like GTA but way more of a casual game?|I've always wanted to find a game that was open world, mainly casual gameplay, has romance and is in first person. \nLike if The Sims, GTA and a Bethesda game were merged together. Kinda. Basically a game with the casual-ness of The Sims, the graphics and pov of GTA, and with like companions and some romance stuff, like a Bethesda game. Not a whole lot of combat involved, if any, and it would mainly focus on immersion and everyday life. NPCs with backstories and unique personalities that you can befriend, bring along with you, romance, etc. I guess it would have to have some sort of storyline too, for people to be interested. \nI'm no game developer. I'm just constantly searching for games that are similar to this concept. I love casual gameplay but I also love RPGs. I guess I just wish there was an RPG that wasn't so combat-heavy and was more immersive.

ooqkp9|A James Bond game that uses Alpha Protocol as a template|Super Bunnyhop pointed out that Hitman is the best Bond game for the aforementioned reasons, and IO Interactive is currently making a Bond game. However, I believe that crown goes to Alpha Protocol. \n\nAlpha Protocol, despite its flaws and glitches, is the only game I felt like playing as James Bond. My ideal game would be remaking Alpha Protocol into a Bond game, featuring the Daniel Craig model, a few script changes, bug fixing, John Barry score (or David Arnold score), and the functional combat system. Throw Blacklist's gameplay into here, and I would not play anything else anymore.
ooq4rt|I am developing a post cold war period game|\nI am developing a game that tells the story of a man and his dog in a period after the cold war that caused the collapse of the Russian rupee and consequently anarchy, the game will have firewatch-like and Metal-like graphics. Gear Solid 5 for the mechanics, with a cue taken from the basics of The Last of Us. Could you tell me if a game in this type of dystopia has already been created?
oon3vl|A game about storming a terrorist filled tower with only a baton|It's called BatonForce. Basically you are a member of a SWAT team, who, despite his superiors' orders, storms a building filled with terrorists. The negotiations have ended and you are only one against the enemy.\n\nBasically you use the baton for most of the time. You smash windows, whack terrorists and do all kinds of cool action-movie shit with it, like reflecting bullets, use it as a bat to hit smaller items as projectiles and such. You can also take dropped weapons off the ground, empty the whole magazine into an enemy and hit the empty gun towards another.\n\nAbout 100 floors, saves after every floor, yadda, yadda. The environment is highly destructible and you can even break holes into walls with explosives and shotguns.
oom9zo|A single player FPS where you play as an exterminator|So basically people pay you to help get rid of pests in their homes by shooting them.\n\nBut your company has a strict no property damage policy: The client gets some of their money back every time you miss and accidentally shoot their furniture or walls or ceiling or whatever. Your goal is to remove the infestation while making as few mistakes as possible.
oom36h|A hero shooter/platform fighter hybrid|I'll list down the elements the game uses from each genre\n\nTeam Shooter:\n\nObjective-oriented game modes (Capture the flag, Payload etc.)\n\nLarger Maps\n\nRespawn points\n\nMove cooldown (No ammo packs, it reloads by itself)\n\nTeam-based, obviously\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlatform Fighter:\n\nThird-person 2D fighting game viewpoint\n\nDirectional moves (which direction you input decides which move you use)\n\nKnockback\n\nPlatforms\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would be a mix of ranged and melee fighters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther ideas:\n\nCombo Mechanic: When you successfully land an attack the cooldown for its next use is halved.\n\nRespawn portal: When you die, you are transported to another map where you must reach a portal to respawn back into the game. Attacking enemies in this map will knock them back, which can stop them from reaching the portal
ook551|A game like Golf Clash but for math?|Thoughts on this idea:  \n\nGolf clash is amazing.  You play 1vs1 in golf holes, each player taking a turn.  The winner wins all the coins and trophies. To enter a game you need a certain amount of coins and trophies, and the higher the level the harder the holes are and the more you win.\n\nI want to take the same concept and apply it to math!  You play a random person 1vs1.  It costs X coins to enter the match, you each get asked a few questions, and the winner gets all the coins.  Coins can be used to unlock new levels, buy fun math things that help you in the game, new skins, new avatars, etc.   Can do everything from really simple arithmetic questions to more complex stuff.  \n\nI think the game could be a lot of fun to play and practice math skills, and can be used to learn and introduce new concepts. \n\nCould also be really fun to do the same thing with coding problems.  You enter random games with people and compete to solve a quick coding problem - kinda like the social network movie interview process.\n\nWhat do you think? Any feedback would be awesome!

oo2uzh|Battle Monstars Royale: A crossover fighting game between Pokemon, Digimon, Yo Kai Watch, and Bakugan that plays like Pokken.|Basically you'd have to face in a 2 on 2 matchup across multiple arenas from all four franchise. There would be ring outs and support type Battle Monsters that would make a return from both the Pokken and Tekken series. The story mode would be a whole different story altogether. It would play like a Dynasty Warriors game where you have to fight off a plethora of mechanical monstrosities while also completing various small objectives around the much bigger battle arena. This would culminate in fighting off said Battle Arena's boss, a boss which will test all your fighting game know how.
oo22eg|An FPS equivalent to Smash Bros.|Basically, a first person multiplayer deathmatch, where players can choose between famous FPS protagonists, like Doomguy, Gordon Freeman, Chell etc. and gameplay would depend on which character you play, matching their respective games, with a few minor tweaks for balance.\n\nGame Mechanic Examples:\n\nDoomguy can use the SSG's Meathook to grapple other players, but unlike Doom Eternal, the players can still still move around, but slower.\n\nGordon Freeman can use the Gravity Gun to pick up and launch props found around each map.\n\nChell can use the Portal Gun to move herself and others around the map, typically trying for environmental kills or fall damage kills. Also she doesn't take fall damage.\n\nAny thoughts on this idea? New character and mechanic suggestions perhaps?
oo18a3|Open world monster evolution game|So I thought about this for a minute now but I have a game idea that’s different so the game is a open world monster game so u start off as a weak monster who escapes a lab you must try to eat and consume humans or animals every chance you get but you will be hunted every time when you first start off you’re this humanoid small monster who must sneak around to eat on animals in the lab while you’re being hunted by security than after consuming enough you can evolve and customize what aspects you want such as armor to not take a lot of damage or claws or the ability to fly or breathe under water and you level up every chance you get by consuming and causing mayhem you will also be dealing with other monsters that escaped and must find and kill them around the city you will go form a small 4’10 monster to the size of Godzilla if you level up through the whole game
oo0il8|Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror| Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits.\n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. Here is link to google doc file with world backstory and general game idea:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAnd let me make clear one thing - I didn't go to describe all those different actual gameplay mechanics like - what exactly main character will use as his weapons, or what type of upgrade he can install, or what type of enemies game will have - yet, because the purpose of this concept is describe what exactly this game is about. I believe before you go to all technical details you should define the main idea of the game and what are you trying to say to the player.\n\nSo please let me know if you think this story is shit, or maybe you liked it but you'd change or add something. Thank you for your time!

onrlsj|A New Gen VR RPG|Hello there, thanks for droppin' by to read!   \n\n\nI am Marshal and something I desired since I've gotten a VR system was an RPG that felt right. Having multiple paths to choose, personalization(Character creation), and a good combat mechanic. The last time I played something that reminded me of my idea was Dynasty Warriors, a great RPG series. Or Conqueror's Blade, a good MMO RPG.  \n\n\nNow, my idea.   \nThis is a first person VR game. A constant throughout the game will be you will fight as the commander and you will fight alongside your troops.  Your decisions will directly affect the performance of your Army and overall Kingdom.\n\n It is a game where you play as a strategist/commander in a fictional land. You build up the character you are, such as picking the personality, looks, and even the upcoming of your family(Being a commoner or royal). After the selection there will be a tutorial explaining mechanics, how the states are at war, and side characters. Maybe even a mock battle?\n\nAfter the tutorial you will be on the road to protect your own state, talk to other states to avoid conflict, grow bonds, or declare war. Below is a list of features that the game would be based off. We will call these the "Rules and Guidelines of the Kingdom"\n\n1. Every state you fight there will be different enemies abilities, looks and equipment), aspects. The size of your army, the haul of food, and the location itself (being near a river or other geographical perks) will come into play when you converse with diplomatic personnel. \n\n2. You must make sure you do not run low on these four core things, Food, Army, Population, and Morale.\n\n3. During the conflict you may have to sacrifice one of the core items to elevate another, this would be based off your own strategy and Army construct. \n\n4. Each Army will have to equip their Army with default communications, weapons, transportation, uniforms, armor and skill level.\n\n5. You will have the ability to increase the default levels based on achievements e.g. kill streak, staying alive for a certain period of time or after a battle. These increases can be applied to any default level item. \n\n6. You will have the ability for you to play as your commander or conscript, depending on tasks and battle performance this will lower or increase your units morale. \n\n7. This game would not have levels. You will not fight to get to the next level instead you will have milestones. Once a pre determined goal is achieved you would have the option to advance your kingdom/society according to one of the four core values (Food, Army, Population and Morale).\n\n8. There will be a metric where you can marry a leader of another Army, this would create an alliance in order to share all resources of each Kingdom.\n\nEndgame Ideas:\n\n1. you will start to face harder enemies, spies and rebellions within kingdom based off in-game morale.  As Morale increases the less likely rebellions will happen and vice versa. \n\nIn the end once you have taken over all of the states the game will end with the player choosing to rather end the game at that point or continue it. If you end it there, a cut scene will appear showing the kingdom stats and then credits. If you continue the game, the game will have more rebellions and a new enemy will appear and the game will continue.
onqxwl|Assassins Creed spin-off game that plays like a combo of AC and Hitman.|The AC story wouldn’t be tainted at all by this but this idea definitely builds off of both of those titles. \n\nThe game would be called “Animus” rather than AC. For those that are unfamiliar the Animus is the machine in AC that can recreate the memories of people from the past and let you experience them as if you were actually there. \n\nIn the new Hitman World of Assassination trilogy- agent 47 finds himself in 20 different ‘destinations’ across the globe, with different targets in each. Each destination is a total sandbox, you can assassinate your targets in any way you can think. You can unlock different weapons and starting locations by mastering each destination.\n\nOk now that some of the background info is out of the way. My idea is that rather than a destination, your character goes into the animus to a certain time period. Your character would play as an ancient assassin in an ancient setting, like the coliseum or pyramids, or Great Wall of China. And you’d assassinate real people that actually lived and were assassinated, and you’d be using real historical weapons to eliminate your targets.
onqmr2|Realistic pizza delivery sim|Sounds boring at first glance but I've driven a wrx for delivery for years and I get in to a lot of street racing while delivering. I've been thinking about an idea for a more realistic not nfs type delivery game where you take deliveries but also have the chance to race people while you're at work like drags and short sprints and also after work for more cash.  \n\nI like the idea of a realistic base for money like maybe taking out a loan to buy a better car and pay the loan back at the penalty of your "heat" raising against the police or something. I have a thousand more ideas but wanted to make this post as short as possible
onlg2z|A monster hunting game, but the game is designed so that 90% of the battle is planning and preparation. No leveling up; no unlock trees; just going out into the world to get the things you'll need for the battle plan you've come up with.|I like Monster Hunter, Dauntless and a number of other monster hunting games well enough. What I *don't* like is the grind. The vast majority of those games is spent leveling up gear and stats, and picking up random ingredients strewn about the map(s). This game will replace that with something a little different.\n\nLike *Breath of the Wild* you're given one and only one objective: Defeat the END BOSS MONSTER.\n\nYou can't level up or make "stronger" gear; however, the boss monster is weak to X weapon, susceptible to Y traps, is impaired by Z poison, and it inflicts reduced damage to N armor. You'll have to defeat four different boss monsters to get the materials needed to make those items. And each of those monsters will have their own required gear that you'll need to defeat smaller monsters for.\n\nEach monster is a small puzzle. Other than the END BOSS MONSTER, you aren't told what the monsters' weaknesses are or what strategies to use. You'll have to figure them out on your own by observing them, stalking them, researching/asking about them in town, and by fighting them underprepared to test out strategies. Once you have it figured out, you gather your gear, drink some expensive temporary buffs and put your strategy to the test.\n\nIt's important to point out that no gear makes you stronger, per se. You can only beat monsters through smarter strategies and better skill.

onh0m3|Game concept / The Long Road|Here is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits. \n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. So let's go:\n\n**The Long Road** \- game about space truckers adventure.\n\n*Main idea*\n\nDefine for yourself - what do you understand as a reality? Would you agree to live in a world of dreams, live through adventure, experience all emotions and be ok with it knowing that it's all going inside high-tech VR machine? Life is a process of getting experience and emotions. Any emotions and feelings are real for you as a person, as long as you are aware of where you are and who you are, regardless of what world you are in. So is there any difference between them?\n\n*Elevator-Pitch*\n\nHave you ever experienced derealization? Maybe even for a second couldn't understand whether you were dreaming or not? What do you say if you stay in that second forever? \n\n*Setting* \n\nFuture world. Big spaceship with a cargo going through a long journey to another stellar system. Such journeys are possible all because of the new technology which allow to a space ship use space-time shrinking to quickly travel to a long distance. But as all technologies this one have some limitations. Ship couldn't travel to  any destination though a one jump, there was a possible max distance and very long engine recharging process. But because of this, space travels which before took several dozen thousands of year now only take 20-40 years to most of the systems. Even though space travel progressed dramatically in terms of time they occupied, they still took a pretty long time for a human, so all ships aimed to travel far should have been equipped with hibernate capsules. When a ship travels during engine recharge brakes, which even with most modern models would take 5-10 years, all crew members should be passing waiting time in those capsules, and when engine recharged all crew should be awake to manually control the next jump. Jump usually took 2-5 days depending on a engine model and travel distance.\n\nIn our journey ship crew  have to deliver very important cargo from one point to another and along with it test new hibernate capsules which would allow to crew members not to lose time between jumps in unconscious dreams but use this time to experience different experience in preliminary prepared virtual sceneries to stimulate their brain activity and prevent brain degradation. This degradation was known as a "professional" sickness of space truckers. When a person spent several dozens of years in a capsule some parts of the brain were degraded too much and after a journey the whole crew had to take 1-2 year of break to restore their health to be able to travel again. New capsules should have fixed that. \n\nIt's a long journey though a cold dark space inside a tin can where you can't leave. You can't make this journey faster. \n\n*Plot and world backstory*\n\nFuture. Humanity made a breakthrough in space travel. First engine which able to affect space-time is developed. Using this engine you can make jumps through a really long distance. Thanks to this technology this was a start of a "far" space exploration era. This engine had his limitation though. You can't travel to any point in a space, just to limited maximum amount of distance. When engine was created limit was about 0.5 light years. Recharging process of that engine would take about 15 years. \n\nFirst hibernate capsules were developed a bit earlier and were used in solar system exploration travels. They also have been used on pilgrim ships - special ships with a crew who agreed to have this one-way trip to the closest star systems with habitable planets. \n\nTechnology developed with time. Humanity domesticated more and more systems with time. Engine development allowed it to increase distance but recharging times still were pretty long. Most modern engines still would take around 5 years to recharge. Private corporations \n\nplaced their production facilities over many different systems allow communities there to grow. To transport goods, supplies and people corporations tried to use autonomous trucks at first, but pretty quickly realized that during jumps the ship becomes too unstable and needs manual control. Also those trucks pretty quickly become an easy target for a space pirates. It was obvious - ships needed a crew.\n\nThat's how space truckers came to life. Small groups of people were sent on a several dozen years journey. During flight crew usually used working shifts and were always divided into groups of 2 people - pilot and engineer. When the engine recharges each group at some point has to be awake to monitor ships systems and make sure the recharging process goes without issues.\n\nIn our journey crew got new assignment from a head office. They are getting brand new “truck” with the newest hibernate capsules. They should pick up and deliver very important cargo to a pretty distant stellar system. Along with delivery they have a "small side quest" -  test new hibernate capsules. Those brand new capsules instead of putting a person in an unconscious dream allowed him to experience different sets of emotions in prepared scenarios in order to stimulate their brain, so after a trip crew wouldn't need time to restore their health. But crew members don't know that you have to be very careful with playing in those scenarios. It might suck you in if you don't stop it at the right time. Some of the scenarios have dangerous side effects which might affect your mind. \n\nOur crew doesn't know yet that their side quest is actually the main purpose of this trip and who knows where it's gonna get them.\n\ndialogue somewhere from the game prologue (just for better narrative feeling)\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n\- Hey Bob! Did you hear those corp rats giving us new truck for some important trip? Heard they installed new version of sleeping machines which should help us to not get stupid by the end of the trip as usual, what do you think?\n\n\- Wow, that would be cool. I wanted to pay off my shithole apartment in sector 7 for such a long time. Wouldn't want to spend another year trying to get my brain back working.\n\n\- Yeah, I also heard they didn't test them yet, but listen...it's good isn't it? They promised to pay twice more for this trip. I don't think those corps would want us to die if that cargo is so important, it should be easy.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n*Main character and his abilities*\n\nMain char - member of the crew, mechanic. His abilities is his professional skills, he knows how to fix ships. Also all crew members go through combat training to be able to protect ship from pirates, so they have some combat abilities as well. His equipment will contain universal tools which would help him to work with ship systems and also a  gun with two shooting modes - shotgun and pistol.\n\n*Gameplay and mechanics*\n\n2D adventurer shooter with pixel art style. Closest references Hyper Light Drifter, The Last Train.\n\nPlayable character fixes the ship, fighting with whoever is trying to get on the ship. Living though VR scenario uses - you'll see some peaceful ones, some with fighting or some other actions and some horror as well. \n\nWhen you awake you have a hub/central room which is kind of a safe room where you can upgrade your equipment, get some quests, make some customization and then goes to a part of the ship where you need to go. When you in VR you have similar concept with a safe room/home in the center. Pretty peaceful place. But also you can choose and go play through different scenarios in that world to make it more interesting for you to spend that time. Each finished scenario gives you the ability to upgrade your central hub, your abilities in VR world, will give you more information about that world and what stays behind it.\n\n*Targets*\n\nPurpose:\n\nGet to the final point with cargo and don't go crazy.\n\nTactical:\n\nProtect ship and cargo, fix ship, find out limits of your mind in VR scenarios. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...OK, if you made this far, sorry for your time :)\n\nActually I'd love to see your comments about this concept. And let me make clear one thing - I didn't go to describe all those different actual gameplay mechanics like - what exactly main character will use as his weapons, or what type of upgrade he can install, or what type of enemies game will have - because the purpose of this concept is describe what exactly this game is about. I believe before you go to all technical details you should define the main idea of the game and what are you trying to say to the player. \n\nSo please let me know if you think this story is shit, or maybe you liked it but you'd change or add something. Thank you for your time!

n78liq|Extremely Dark and Traumatizing FPS Idea|The idea started with playing CoD and realizing most FPS games don't spend any time on the actual character you are using in war, each life you use in combat are basically just disposable body suits.  The core concept of this game idea is making each life in the game matter and immersing deeper into the stakes of that soldier.  \n\nWhen a soldier you control dies, there could be a reel or small cutscene of the body being carried off, the medals they've earned, etc.  Each person deserves a send off/epilogue.  Perhaps the longer you stayed with a soldier and did stuff, you could see more of the cutscene, possibly even seeing their son or daughter grow up and enlist themselves.  The game would take a moment to mourn for that soldier and then continue to another new life.\n\nPlaying through a whole battle and surviving would definitely be rewarded.  Keeping your soldier alive and valuing each life would be core to the game.  Gameplay would most likely be slower and more tactical, as everyone is trying to win while keeping their person alive.\n\nIs this messed up and possibly traumatizing? Depends.  But it's certainly better than disregarding soldiers' struggles and the value of each of their lives.
n77y4t|Need an idea for a 3D game with anthropomorphic vegetables|Hey there! I'm an intermediate blender and unity user and I finally want to work on a somewhat original idea for a game. I've been working on a 3d model of a tomato that kinda looks like the one from veggietales except I plan on giving him buff arms and legs. I'm looking for 3D game ideas that could make good use of the comedic value of a buff tomato or a fire breathing chili pepper. Ideas don't have to a funny tone, I'm open to serious games too. Honestly, anything is appreciated just give me an idea! Thanks in advance!
n6yu99|A multiplayer exorcism game.|Greetings everyone, recently I have been playing Phasmophobia, which is kinda cool as a concept. For those of you that don't know its a game all about ghost hunting. \n So I came up with an idea similar to that game but instead of Ghosts you are hunting different types of Demons. The purpose of the game is simple: Exorcise the Demon and trap him with different ways sealing him forever. \nThe whole game basis wraps around the principles of exorcism. Players can use different types of equipment to harm the Demon and defeat him once and for all. The twist in that matter is that the Demon is also a player.\n So as a group of 4 you fight against a player who is actually playing as the Demon. The player controlling the Demo can use different types of tricks to confuse the players while dropping their sanity levels. \nAs a player's sanity level drops he becomes mentally unstable starts seeing things and hearing things  and once it hits zero can't be targeted as a victim by the demon killing him and claiming his soul. \nGame can include different famous Demons of Christian religion each one of them with different type of powers and abilities, but also weaknesses.\nWhat are you guys thinking about this? Is it interesting as a game idea? Any suggestions?\nThanks in advance.

I don't care how similar it is i'm just trying to have fun with it and learn something. But i'm not good with ideas and don't know where to start. I don't want it to be mainly about fighting, more story based 2D single player game.

n6o6nf|Integrating HP/MP bar (or stamina) into the character.|I want have a discussion about not having HP/MP bars in games.  \nMost games comes with a standard HP and MP bar (sometimes stamina bar too), usually HP mean Health point, MP means Mana Points for skills-usage.  \n\n\nHowever, players are often required to shift attention back and forth between their own character model and the HP/MP UI during combat. I think instead of displaying these status meters as UIs, merging them with the character provide a more pleasant gameplay experience.  \n\n\n# Taking away the HP bar\n\n  \nI've seen FPS games do this by making the screen edges more red/dark as the character get more hurt; some survival games make the character slower or look tired; MMORPGs tends to shrink the hp bar and hover it above the model's head.\n\n  \nI don't agree with how these both decisions give the player disadvantages as their health drops: making the screen harder to see (and spot enemies), take away the player's normal speed, or having small version of the UI.  \n\n\nFor the player's own HP, make the model change stance and look bloodied as they get more damage; break or gradually crack their armor/shield if they have protection. For the enemies' HP, I would say do the same. In PvP games, not knowing exactly what your opponent's HP are allows for a higher skill ceiling in competitive plays. When spectating, if there are dozens of players to keep track of, not needing an ui bar above everyone's head or at the edge of the screen should also improve the viewing experience.\n\n# Taking away the MP bar\n\nFPS Mobas replaces them with cooldowns and again, the MP UI is just replaced with another UI to keep track of.\n\nI propose adding different effects/glows/weapons and on and around the character to indicate which skills are available to use. For example, if your character has "Fireball" off cooldown, the character can voiceline something like "I'm ready to fire" and have their right hand glow in flames or a fireball hovering next to the character.\n\nThe only place I think this wouldn't fit is in MMORPG, where one can have upwards of a hundred skills available, displaying effects to the character will just create a clutter of glows. \n\n# Issues\n\nThe main downside I see with using effects, animations and voice lines in place of UI, is that one will no longer be able to tell exactly how much points they have left.  \nI think a good compromise is to make these UI visibility toggleable with a button, so that knowing the exact number will not be vital to survive/play well but optional in case the player wants to see it.\n\n  \nWhat do you think? I want to hear if anyone have any alternative solutions.
n6hr24|First person perspective, motorcycle game with this cool stylized, intense color graphics (e.g. Firewatch, The First Tree)|Hi! I have this idea for a game, that I don’t even have time to begin Unity’s project with (but I would love to help with/make the story writing though):\n\n- core mechanics: \n   - riding motorcycle with first person perspective (this simply have to be a pleasant, reactive/responsive, intuitive experience);\n   - travelling by foot, with a few simple, but well designed mechanics like: picking things up, throwing things, moving levers, usage of the ropes, opening/closing valves (I hope you get the idea :D)\n   - RPG mechanics, like dialogue system, equipment, simple quest system (without overkilling it with a complex solutions)\n\nset&amp;setting:\n- stylized graphics, with that dreamy, surreal vibe (e.g. Firewatch, The First Tree);\n- linear plot (I’ll be able to handle that part of the game, if you’d like to realize this project :));\n- semi open world (many little areas that would be connected with each other via single roads) - it may be silly, but Pokemon Yellow’s seems like something I have in mind in terms of connected areas\n- music-type proposals: \n   - Pink Floyd, Massive Attack, anything from the mainstream lo-fi beats type for the driving between areas\n   - Audioslave, Metallica for the intense moments (prefferably chasing or something similar)\n   - no music for the walking by foot, in order to create this weird, unsettling feeling when Player gets of the bike\n\nGameplay overview:\n\nFor some reason we have to put this poor guy on the motorcycle, so I’d like to see this introverted character with plenty of self-analysis going on while free-roaming through beutifully crafted sceneries.\n\nWe also would need to give the player something to play with, so I’d like to see plenty of small interactable objects, like some branches in the woods, cups from the coffee shop laying around on the pavement. And of course, if there is a branch to be picked - there have to be any type of object to be poked with it\n\nWhat’s the main issue of the bad games? Poor core mechanics - therefore I’d like to see some arcade steering with this feel like you’re a pro (something like Forza Horizon, but with a motorcycle)\n\nWhat’s the second main issue of the bad games? Lame main storyline. Give the main character a soul and purpose to ride on this bike from area to area, e.g. his mother is really sick and he has to travel through entire country, and he has no regular job, and has to do some jobs for the locals, so that he can fund the fuel for his motorcycle. But there’s also this sense of purpose, like if the Player’s spends too much time in one place, then, for instance there could be a call from main character’s sister where she would insist on him, because the condition of their mom is worsening (if that’s a real word).\n\nAlso I would love to see this game designed for the mobile first (mostly because I don’t own a gaming PC) :D\n\nStay safe &amp; best wishes, hope you get inspired and give me something to play (or work on, wink wink) 🙏
n6dasp|Gratuitous Opinion Battles|I have been studying social theory, psychology, sociology and linguistics for a number of years in order to figure out how to use technology to combat the increasing decline in reading comprehension, rational dialogue, respect, empathic awareness and many other social problems identified by analysis of social data.\n\nI had an idea for a game in which a person can choose a style of battle and then that battle plays out based on the rules of logic and debate based in background analysis of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and NLU (Natural Language Understanding / sentiment analysis).\n\nOnce initiated, the bot would pull archived information on a topic from a database compiled from social media data analytics.  It would then use the compiled footprint of that social opinion to generate a scene in which the OP of an opinion position is placed with armor or unit dispositions linked to the underlying premises of the philosophical position.\n\nValid arguments are "targeted" based on clear use of language, reference to the premise, grammatical use, punctuation, spelling, etc...  The strength of armor or force positioning comes from cited sources and evidence.  The confluence of a well thought out, cited, referenced and well written rebuttal is interpreted as a hit, possibly critical, that destroys the targeted defense.\n\nAbandoning the argument is equated to quitting the field.\n\nIgnoring a premise or argument is equated to failing to deflect an attack or shot and/or possibly a failure to mitigate damages (such as in a naval battle).  In unit battles it would be equated to failing to rally troops or reinforce units, potentially resulting in the unit being routed or dispersed.\n\nIn essence, it's a fun way to have AI moderate debates based on trained analysis of professional dialogue.\n\nThoughts?
n69h58|Message Routing Game|Concept: Players are blind and connected randomly in a communication network. They can only send messages to their direct neighbors. Each player has to send a message to a specific person somewhere in the network, so everyone has to cooperate to get the message delivered.\n\nIt would be possible to insert malicious players, randomly dropping messages by changing the reliability of channels, limiting the speed of communication, having messages that shouldn't be read by specific persons, and creating more interesting tasks/themes.\n\nDoes anyone have more ideas on how to expand on this abstract concept?

n5uzr7|Online Multiplayer Pac Mans vs Ghosts|It's a party game but could be played solo like regular Pac Man if you prefer to do so.\n\n\nOptions for large multi screen maxed and single screen mazes.\n\n\nPlayers choose to be either a Pac Man (they can choose between different Pac characters including crazy Otto, Mrs Pac Man, Pan Man Jr etc) or be a ghost.  All characters can have a unique colors (ie Yellow Pac Man, Green Pac Man..)\n\n\nEvery other round players who were ghost become Pac man and Pac man become ghost.\n\n\nWhile Pac Man can immediately change the direction he is facing, ghost cannot.  BUT they have a power up when used makes the stutter in place for a second and then they go in the opposite direction they were facing.  This power up takes time to recharge but each time it takes less and less time to do so.\n\n\nThere are other ideas I have for it, would be interested to get ideas from others.
n5u93q|Some Help Fleshing Out an Idea|Hi all! I’m a pretty new game dev that’s worked on a few small projects and looking to spend a few months on a new idea. \n\nI’ve been thinking about using music to procedurally generate worlds and levels but I’m stuck on how to implement it. \n\nThe two ideas I have are a 2D side scrolling platformer/hack n slash that transforms with the music (basically geometry dash but procedurally generated) but I’m not sure that would be too fun.\n\nThe other one is a randomly generated rogue like where weapons and enemies attack on the beat with an aesthetic like Enter the Gungeon. \n\nI have no clue how to actually implement the procedural generation from the songs into these ideas to make them fun as they seem sort of bland right now.

n5tpo0|[REVISED VERSION] My Co-Op Fantasy Game's Player Characters [LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK &amp; SUGGESTIONS]|This is a revised version of my previous post that lacks any descriptions with comparisons to other games. A user told me that when I share concepts or ideas, I shouldn't describe them with comparisons to other games because I would immediately alienate people who haven't played those games. I'm really ticked at myself for doing that in the first place, and I hope this revised version will pick myself off the ground (in other words, raise my chances of getting feedback and suggestions so I can move forward in my journey to make this game happen).\n\nAnyways, here we go...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I've had this idea for a Co-Op Fantasy game since 2020, and it would be a cross between First-Person and Third-Person. The most notable mechanic I've thought of for my game is that there are 4 player characters that you can switch between.\n\nI've done some thought process on what differences should each character have, such as different species, abilities, and traits, but I feel like some things need work.\n\nI'm having trouble with coming up with special abilities which would only be activated when their "special ability" meter is full by getting enough kills, and scenarios where you would need to switch to a certain character in order to progress through a level. Those are the two things which I think I need suggestions on.\n\nI apologize if the post itself seems childish even though I'm a senior in High School because I still feel like I'm new to grammar, and these character drafts are just my first impressions, and I'm sure many of us know that first impressions usually need more work and aren't the final.\n\nFirst of all, general mechanics:\n\nYou can switch between characters by pressing a certain hotkey assigned to whatever character. Each character carries three weapons: their own unique weapon, a crossbow with finite ammo that needs to be scavenged, and and empty weapon slot for whatever weapons you might find that you can pick up. Each character can be incapacitated, and you will have a certain amount of time to revive them depending on the difficulty level. If they die, they will respawn within 60 seconds.\n\nNow, here are for the player characters. They are in order of which I would place them from left to right on the character selection screen. They are addressed with code names since I don't have names for them yet and I wouldn't spoil their names. If anyone has suggestions for additional abilities and/or ideas for the two things I mentioned that I'm having trouble with, let me know:\n\nYeti Berserker:\n\nThe first character is a male yeti berserker. He has slow speed, but a lot of health. His primary weapon could be a two-handed, two-sided battle axe. If he sheathes his axe, he can pick up objects and pieces of debris that can be hurled at enemies as an alternative way of attacking.\n\nCabbit Warrior:\n\nThe second character is a female cabbit warrior. She is naturally the fastest of the characters, but has a lowest amount of health. Her primary weaponry consists of two one-handed swords that are dual-wielded. She comes with a sprinting ability that has a cooldown function.\n\nKitsune Mage:\n\nThe third character is a male kitsune mage. He would have the second most amount of health, and be the second slowest character. His primary weapon would be a staff that can cast various offensive and defensive spells (Which is one of those things I need suggestions for) as well as a healing spell that can heal the other teammates. He can also use the staff as a melee weapon, and has a meter ability to revive deceased teammates early so that they can respawn immediately rather than wait 60 minutes.\n\nDragon:\n\nThe fourth character is a female anthro dragon (in other words, dragon girl). She would have the second-least amount of health, and be the second-fastest character. Her primary weaponry consists of a combination of her claws as melee weapons and her ability to breathe either fire or ice in many forms (The forms are also something I need suggestions on). She is also capable of flying, so she can reach areas where the other three characters can't, but it is a cooldown ability to prevent her from reaching/touching the level boundaries.\n\nThat's everything I've thought of so far for all of the characters.\n\nI'm open to feedback and suggestions for additions to my player characters, especially for the things that are missing. If any of the things I already mentioned need to be changed or removed, don't hesitate to let me know, I might consider it . If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nThank you, and I can't wait to hear your feedback and/or suggestions. Again, I'm sorry for describing my concepts/ideas in the original posts with comparisons to other games. If you like them, you like them. If you don't like them, you don't like them. Like I said, I just hope this revised version picks my feet up off the ground.
n5thcs|Among Us -like game where you either kill or protect Hitler|Kill Hitler.\n\nThere are 8 players on a map. 2 CIA agents, 2 SS agents, 1 Hitler, and 3 randoms. \n\nThe CIA doesn't know which player is Hitler, and must find and kill Hitler to win. They personally don't have to kill Hitler, just if Hitler dies, they win. The CIA also doesn't know who are the SS agents and must also avoid them as well. The CIA however knows what Tasks Hitler will do, and that's how they'll find Hitler and kill him.\n\nThe SS knows which player is Hitler, but not his tasks, and must protect him from the CIA. They win when all CIA agents are dead or if Hitler completes all his tasks. They don't know who the CIA agents are and must protect themeselves as well.\n\nThe CIA however can't kill Hitler directly and must sabotage the tasks Hitler will do to kill him and win. The sabotaged tasks however don't just kill Hitler, but will kill anyone who uses it. \n\nThe SS can also also get notifications on sabotaged tasks, where they are, and can un-sabotage the tasks. The SS can kill the CIA directly by simply shooting them.\n\nHitler and the 3 bystanders don't know anything about the CIA and SS battle and are doing tasks around the map.
n5t9ko|A Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas type Action-Comedy Open-World game|Think Saints Row 3-4 meets Looney Tunes. Okay in that sort of vein,but I hope you get the idea. Set in a fictional city. Think a Las Vegas-Tokyo Casablanca esque crime infested city. To clarify, Casablanca,the way it's portrayed in the film. Laugh out loud type humor with some meta, here and there,but not in that irritating Deadpool sort of way. Regular weapons will be used, like revolvers, shotguns and machine guns; the kind of weapons Hunter Thompson used. Explosives will be there too. It would be sacrilege to not include them in a game based on a somewhat true story of his. There will be drugs, real and fictional, to act as power-ups. LSD will be rare and an extra special power-ups. Clothes will be vast, wild and offbeat. There will be vehicles but strictly from that era and fully customizable. Enemies and friends of HST's will be the antagonists and co protagonists. Obviously they'll be exaggerated versions of themselves. Other figures could be added or they could be DLC's. I'm not sure what the main objective will be. I'm also sure about mini games but I want them to be fun and something different. If anyone has suggestions for things to add, please let me know.

n5ljq3|First Person Choice-based SAW Game|With how polished first-person horror looks, RE7 and RE8 as an example, imagine a first person game based on the Saw franchise similar to RE7. With the added realism, there could be a really emotionally compelling nature to encountering other people in traps rather than straight gore. I think an interesting gameplay loop would go like this: the world is an open-ish labrynth where you have to solve puzzles and do certain tasks etc. to open new parts of the world. Your main goal is to reach some end point but throughout doing so, you encounter many persons in their own traps. You can use some resources or risk your health to save them, or play it safe; maybe some people you don't help but escape their traps come after you later. Also, this may be too grotesque but perhaps the player character has some device on them that kills them if they don't take another life within a certain amount of time. So during playthroughs you'd be navigating this open world and encountering others in traps and have to, for example, kill one other person every hour (probably by deciding their fate in multi-person traps) or your game resets to an hour prior.\n\nI know this is effed up but also sounds like a compelling experience only the game medium could bring.
n5l1w4|Squad based arcade-shooter/moba pitting 4 teams of 3 against each other.|Hello everyone, first off I just want to thank anyone who reads this for giving it the time of day.\n\nMy idea would be to make 4 teams of 3 human players either eliminate all other players or capture an objective and return it to their spawn. They would be dropped into diagonally mirrored map which would feature a central raised platform, which contains the capture objective, 2 opposed small towns with houses for looting weapons and lastly 2 more opposed shops which would allow for spending of money gathered between rounds.\n\nMy main focus on this was giving the teams options that they can all choose and have to think about their opponents choosing as they moved throughout the map. Will they start straight to the store and buy up? Or will they head into the town and loot it. Maybe they might try and sneak the objective back to their base for a cheeky victory. All these things would require strategy as the team moves through the map trying to gain victory. I figure this could be round based, maybe first to 3.\n\nSo what do y'all think?

This part is bit weird i know :) when you open the door you see a huge portal that stands in the middle of the room. Of course your dog walks through it and you have no other choice then to follow the dog. The portal brings you to a forest. Your dog is running and you follow him till he stops at the end of the forest and you see a futuristic city with lots of lights. When you get into the city. You will ask someone where you are and stuff and he tells you that the coins in the wallet come from this place. Soon you realise the person from the wallet lives here and that you need to find him if you want to get back. This is everything i got, please give me feedback i would really appreciate it.
n5hmym|What do you like to see in a "walking simulator" game?|Hello all,\n\nI am relatively accomplished fiction writer who also happens to love playing video games. I have been dabbling around with some game development software for a couple years now just learning the basics and I think I am ready to start work on my own narrative-driven adventure game; aka a "walking simulator." Think "Firewatch," "The Stanley Parable," and "Gone Home."\n\nI am choosing to make a walking simulator because my strength is in story-telling. I have no interest in developing a classically "challenging" experience with complex combat and the like; in my opinion we already have plenty of games which accomplish that better than I could ever hope to. What I want is to tell a story and transport the player on a journey. \n\nI realize some of you probably just don't appreciate walking simulators and that's cool, I get it. There's plenty of genres of games which I don't like or enjoy. But for those of you who do enjoy walking simulators, what are some things that your favorites do that made you love them?

n5axgq|An FPS horror taking place in the Himalayas at the 1980's|Title: Operation Mad Hatter.\n\nPlot: 1986, In the Ganges River where the annual Khumba Mela festival takes place where hundreds of thousands of Indians come and celebrate by bathing in the sacred river. However, the river was then contaminated by deadly nuclear radiation and then thousands of people were killed by radiation. Upon investigating the incident it was discovered that there was an US listening device which was powered by nuclear energy hidden above the mountains of Nanda Devi, just 600 meters away from the Ganges River. This so called "listening device" was a device that can pìck up radio and nuclear transmissions from China. The US wanted to install such a device in a discreet location which is why the Himalayas is where the CIA wanted to place the nuclear listening device in the peaks of Nanda Devi.\n\nCalled "Operation Hat" in 1964. Fourteen US mountain climbers along with four sherpas, were tasked by their governments to install the nuclear listening device above Nanda Devi. However, before they could make it into the top a giant avalanche had struck the team and were killed, and the nuclear device lost.\n\nThe poisoning of the Ganges river, which was caused by the lost nuclear device had caused outrage amongst the Indian people and it demanded the US to come and fix the problem. The US agreed and sent one of the world's best climbers to go to Nanda Devi, search the nuclear listening device and disable it for good.\n\nBut at the mountains of Nanda Devi, there are horrors that have surfaced underneath the snow. The souls of the abandoned rise as monsters, deformed by nuclear radiation and ice.
n5advd|Ghost Hunters: Basically Ace Attorney Investigations meets Gravity Falls and Scooby Doo.|**Was digging through old files in my Google Drive when I stumbled upon this old halloween themed mystery game concept I had a few years back. Was originally going to make this an RPG Maker game myself, but never got around to it and kinda lost interest in the idea. I also included the only cases I actually had concepts for.**\n\nEx-detective Rook Key, with nobody else to go to for a job, is forced to join his brother, Spook Key, and his ghost hunting team in solving mysteries. He is reluctant to go, but when he finds out himself that ghosts and monsters aren’t just a myth or legend, he also finds out there was more to a certain case than meets the eye, can he solve what had happened in his final unsolved case, or will he just find himself 6 feet under?\n\nMain Characters: \n\nRook Key: The player character of this story. As the 20 year old newcomer to the Ghost Hunters team, he was a former detective for the police a few months prior to the start of the game, lost his job after he went rogue during a police chase after he thought he saw a dark figure staring at him with a coat barring a symbol from the card of two of his cases. He then abandoned his chase to go after him, letting the crook get away. He has great investigative and interrogation abilities. His personality is that of a logical genius who is pretty down to earth and enjoys puzzles and games that encourage strategy or deduction. He is a very easy scare for any supernatural being, but won’t be scared as easily if it’s something more realistic. Carries a notebook or notepad to take notes on any new information like testimony or evidence.\n\nSpook Key: Rook’s 19 year old brother who invited his brother Rook onto his team of Ghost Hunters. A chill kind of person who doesn’t get scared easily and talks to ghosts and monsters like they’re normal people and part of everyday life. Enjoys seeing and experiencing the supernatural. Apparently had a job at a pizza joint over a little over a year prior to the game’s events, but got fired for abandoning his order when he claims saw a ghost flying by and chased after it instead of making the delivery, making the order over an hour late. After that, he formed the Ghost Hunters with the customer’s son, and his soon to be best friend, team in a moment of genius inspired by what he saw. He is a bit dense though and too chill for his own good when he doesn't get freaked out by monsters that might be actively trying to kill them.\n\nSans Fear: An 19 year old boy genius who met and became Spook’s best friend a year prior after he gave him and his parents a pizza an hour late and told them he claimed to see a ghost, which Sans believed him. Has an interest in science and an even bigger interest in studying the paranormal, but his interest reached its peak when he lost his arm and his hair turned an unstainable pale white in a science accident when he miscalculated something, before fainting he could have sworn to see his assistant’s hand glowing and likely using magic to keep him stable, thinking she was possibly a witch as the healing was too advanced for any kind of current technology. He replaced said arm with robotic one that is far stronger than his former arm and comes equipped with multiple tools to help his partners out. Joined the Ghost Hunters after he and Spook first formed it together. Personality wise, a very intelligent person and enjoys challenging Rook’s genius in games and working with him, has knowledge of many supernatural beings from Ghosts to Vampires. He also has a love for technology and believes science can solve almost any problem, with varying results that more often than not backfire on him.\n\nYokari Kaizuka: A 22 year old girl who moved into town 1 year prior to the game’s events from Japan. An ex-police officer who moved after she claimed to see a demon outside her room flying at night, and everyone called her crazy and she got fired. She joined the Ghost Hunters after Sans and Spook overheard her talking about her experience seeing a demon and they are quick to believe her thanks to their own experiences at having scrapes with the supernatural.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-Overworld: Focuses on investigation and exploration, but is often the place for cutscenes. After an investigation, your progress can be saved between each chapter of the cases and from the pause menu on the Overworld.\n\n-Interrogation: Basically an Ace Attorney Cross Examination style of trying to debunk someone’s logic. After hearing their testimony, you can then Press for more information or Present items to object. However Presenting the wrong item will damage you, if you get KO’d. It’s game over. You can also ask certain teammates what they think and they’ll each give you either a random piece of dialogue with a humorous response or some more information or questions of their own that can create an entirely new statement. For reference, think of the Cross Examination from Professor Layton vs Ace Attorney or the Great Ace Attorney games except instead of mutliple witnesses reacting to certain testimony, it's your teammates.\n\n-Logic Match: When a witness refuses to cooperate with you, you enter a Logic Match, which plays out like AAI2’s Logic Chess, minus the time limit and replacing it with the chance to make only 5 mistakes, after that it’s game over. You can either wait things out and listen to the witness or talk to them by pointing things out that they say. Sometimes, you may need another piece of information to open things up. However you can also annoy them with questions and can anger them into accidently slipping something that they’re hiding, giving you more info to work with.\n\nCase Ideas:\n\n-On Rook’s first outing with his new team, he and the others find themselves with 6 other people, one of which is murdered and another one is secretly a vengeful spirit, and all of them are locked in a mansion filled with haunted suits of armor and other ghosts. Now with all 10 of them being suspects, they must figure who is the murderer is before the vengeful spirit gets to them first.\n\n-Inspired by Night Trap, the gang is enlisted by a family to watch over their household for a few hours in a misunderstanding of what their business card where it says, “House Caretakers,” because of Spook's incredibly poor penmanship when he commissioned the cards.\n\nSo they’re hired to watch over the house while their daughter has some friends over, Rook has them take the job anyway as it turns out there was a string of disappearances in this household and the police were unable to investigate the household as the owners wouldn’t allow it. So as they watch over the house with their fellow teenagers, unaware the house owners are actually monsters themselves with possibly malicious plans for the gang, all while Rook uses this opportunity to solve this case once and for all.\n\n-Rook wakes up in a hospital bed and finds his friends are all curious about why Rook fainted after seeing a card with a symbol on it at the end of the case before this one. Reluctantly he tells them a story of.\n\nIt then cuts to Rook’s first case, where he finds himself investigating a murder trying finding the true criminal, and he finds at the scene of the crime a note revealing the same symbol seen at the end of the previous case before it then shows him investigating a case connected to it, where, while chasing the culprit who fled after proving them to be the murderer and finding another card, he sees a man in the shadows with the symbol on his coat who was walking away leading to him going rouge to chase that man instead, leading to him being fired.\n\nHe then finished his story as it cuts back to the present where he explains what happened to him after that leading up to when he joined the Ghost Hunters.
n52uek|Rougelike + Survival Game idea|I want to get some feedback/suggestions on the general idea for a game I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's basically a hub that the player uses as a base. So crafting, upgrading, storing loot and all would be there. To get the items they would go out into generated areas as a selected class. Killing enemies, getting loot/resources, and even facing zone/area bosses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo permadeath, unless the player wanted it. There would be a death penalty, I just don't know what it would be yet. Maybe lost of some stuff, or hit to level/stats for a period of time. Figured a general level for the player and maybe a class level for the different classes.
n50yq6|Looking for Opinions - Among Us but with a Time Loop Twist| \n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've got a pretty original idea for a game and I'm looking for opinions before fully committing to it.\n\nThe main idea is " **Among Us but in a Time Loop** ".\n\nJust to be clear, me and my team want to develop this idea ourselves, we just need to establish if it's worth the time or not. \n\nBasically, it's a 2D top-down social deduction game (like Among Us) about a group of thieves that infiltrate a fancy penthouse. Among them there is a killer that needs to sabotage the operation by killing them all. The thieves get meeting were they can choose to vote out a player. They win by either voting out the killer or completing all their tasks.\n\nThe game's **core mechanic** however, is the presence of a time loop. **Every X minutes, if neither side won, the loop starts over.**\n\nNot all progress is lost though. The players can see **time glitches**, 'ghosts' of dead players from previous loops, giving them information about their paths based on which they can deduce who the killer is (i.e. if a player dies, in the next loop everyone still alive will be able to see a replay of their movement / pathing, in real time).\n\nAs the thieves grow their chances of success with every loop, the killer does too. Every action the killer does, including causing emergencies, cutting off the power, locking doors, will be repeated at the exact same moment in every upcoming loop, establishing a pattern the players will need to learn in order to maximize their chance of survival.\n\nSo think of any game or movie based on a time loop (Groundhog Day, Deathloop, etc.) and imagine it's concept adapted to fit a social deduction / Among Us type of game.
n4zz50|Lots of ideas here is one for now|Killer Conscience - the basic ideas is a classic killer victim situation where you start the game of getting set up to see the killer but before anything happens you cut away only to go through said killers life making choices living it seeing what made them a killer but you must choose carefully cause each choice will decide the kind of killer you will be let me know what you think and tell me if you want to hear anymore ideas cause I have a lot more complicated ones both on mechanics and story I love a great balance of both with some awesome twist I am planning on starting my own video games design company so any feedback helps
n4zflb|A question about AI behavior in horror games|Hey guys, I'd like to get some input on what good enemy AI should be like. What I mean is, I am currently developing a VR Horror game that has one central monster and maybe 3 underlings. It also takes place in only one setting, inside and outside a building with many rooms inside. My question is, for this setting and type of game, how should the main baddie work? I was thinking sorta like Alien from Alien: Isolation, as I loved how it sorta thought for itself in a way. But I want to know what others think, and what other ideas of good enemy AI other people had. Any input is welcome!
n4wrgw|Psychic Shells - A team multiplayer shooter with dozens of AI-controlled teammates you can "dive into" after dying.|Games start with dozens of AI soldiers (let's call them "shells") already fighting on the ground, and players get to "dive into" any of them at any time. When you die, you're forced to dive into any other shell on your team to continue. The AI-controlled shells aren't nearly as good as actual players, but they help.\n****\nWhenever a shell dies (either player or AI controlled) they're downed for a few seconds and then get back up... to fight for the other team. Killing a shell makes them switch team. **Whichever team converts all the shells to their side wins.**\n\nThis means that when one team is about to win, the losing team will not have enough shells for all of their players, so some will be forced to spectate unless they can gain back some shells. There might even be clutches where one team rallied back from having only one player left.
n4vydg|Pokemon but as a Survival Tactical Squad Turn-Based RPG instead of a linear strategy RPG|&gt;Op, you mean kinda like "[Pokemon Mystery Dungeon](https://nerdmacia.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Rescue-Team-DX-13.jpg)" or more like "[Pokemon Conquest](https://www.maniac.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/conquest-oben.jpg)"\n\nYeah, kinda like both (but more like conquest because mistery dungeon is more roguelike based) maybe like a mix of both? (debatible) but without being in the Edo era or somthing, and without using generals or conquering stuff, and of course changing and adding some other stuff.  \n\n\n&gt;Op, why you want to add the survival genere to pokemon?\n\nBecause, a lot of people tend to forget that the "Pokemon World" can be Hardcore and METAL as fuck.  \n\n\n&gt;What do you mean? Pokemon is the most child friendly franchise of nintendo.\n\n[\*Laughs in official pokemon manga crudeness and matureness\*](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/181/205/3ad.png)\n\n[\*Laughts again a little bit more\*](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/7/74/R%26S083_8.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/715?cb=20150911111238)\n\n[\*smiles at you like a champion\*](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/c9/1f/13c91f4e527d64ee3ffb1e8dd09c4812.jpg)\n\nWhy do you think that every professor tells you that is dangerous to go on tall grass without a ~~bodyguard/decoy~~ pokemon?  Everything and everyone could kill you.\n\nThats why I want to add YOU as an active piece into the battle, YOU are like the chess king. You are the most important piece on the board. if you're killed in battle because your pokemon didnt protect you, there's no point to continue the battle.\n\nWith the tactical mechanics you can easily be put into the pokemon battles and it can be added nice features to the battles like move in the terrain to dodge attacks, cover, obtain a terrain advantage, set traps, Aid your fallen pokemons etc.  \n\n\n&gt;So, op, tell us, this idea of yours requires "HIGH QUALITTY ANIMATIONS AND 3D MODELS" like the new core games? or games like Fire Emblem: Three Houses\n\n# No.\n\nEven if i LOVE the [looks of FE: Three Houses](https://i.imgur.com/5kaShAp.jpg); for my idea i preffer a more simplistic aproach. \n\nA 2D simple board for "combat phase", very much like [R-Day Combat board](https://img.apkcafe.es/img:bz1mMmJhMGEmbD0xZzE3Jmg9anBnJmY9Z2xtJmk9NDc). \n\nEasy to code, Easy to see and understand what surrounds your character, easy to fix bugs. No need to know 3d programing and super dificult stuff so it will be faster to develop, less demand to the processor, and... more time to put more enphasis in story.\n\n***Routes and grinding places*** will become gigantic boards that you have to cross and in order to arrive from one city/town to another. Pokemon will spawn randomly at random places in the board. but only 6 enemies at time. (battles will be a max of 6v6 pokemon + you)\n\nFor ***overwold and peaceful places*** would be like [normal overworld from gen 1-5 main series](https://i.imgur.com/yInfCIZ.png). and your team gets "invisible and not playable at moment"\n\n&gt;Ok OP, you said you want to change and add some other stuff. What do you have in mind?\n\nWell... your character is NOT superman nor he has a dimentional pocket inside his bag, so the amount of items you can carry will be limited AND a static base will be implemented. \n\nA lor of changes would be made to a lot of pokemon logic

n4rvdf|"Disney's Motorama" - a crossover of the Forza Horizon series and the Disney Pixar's Cars franchise. [RE-UPLOAD]|Xbox Series X/S and Windows 10 exclusive, also playable on Steam.\n\nDeveloped by Playground Games. Published by Microsoft Studios.\n\nFeatures ray tracing, 4K Ultra HD, and 60 fps (standard)/120 fps (optional). Also supports cross-play and cross-progression.\n\nRating: UK - 7, US - E10+ (Mild Language, Mild Violence), AUS - PG\n\nThis idea is an open-world racing game taking place in the fictional Motorama Festival. It will also be a spiritual reboot of the Forza Horizon franchise.\n\n***WORLD MAP &amp; FESTIVAL SITES***\n\nThe open-world map ranges from Carburetor County to Los Angeles - Southern California, featuring a variety of iconic landmarks and areas.\n\nCarburetor County features Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, Willy's Butte, Interstate 40, Cadillac Range Mountains, a dirt arena, a dam, an oil refinery, a satellite array and an aircraft boneyard.\n\nSouthern California with Los Angeles features California Highway 1, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Downtown LA, LAX Airport, Port of LA, San Gabriel Mountains, Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles International Speedway, etc.\n\nThere will be **two** festival sites, one in Carburetor County and the other in Los Angeles.\n\n***AVATARS***\n\nYou can create your own human avatar; male or female.

You can even make them wear special costumes (Spider-Man, The Mandalorian, Stormtrooper, Captain America, Frozone, Master Chief, etc.).\n\nThey will be voiced, whereas the avatars in the Horizon series didn't speak. Like the Cars characters, they will also react on things that happen around them - winning/losing a race, nailing/failing a PR stunt, crashing, getting rammed, passing a racer or getting passed, etc. ("Alright, let's do this!", "Outta my way!", "Watch where you're going!", "How do you like that?!") - This would replace the quick chat feature that was seen in Horizon 4.\n\n***GAME INTRO***\n\nThe game's intro will be similar to Forza Horizon 2. The opening cinematic would feature a montage of cars, racing and festival scenes, and the emotional music along with it will give you chills!\n\nIn your first drive of the game, you will play as Lightning McQueen, driving from the Port of LA all the way up to the Carburetor County festival site with Mater, Cruz Ramirez, and the champions of the 6 racing series.\n\n***STORYLINES***\n\nThe game will have **two** storylines.\n\n* The **main** storyline is similar to Forza Horizon 1.

There are also over 70 characters from the Cars franchise, spanning from all 3 Cars films. Of course, not *all* would be available at launch due to quality over quantity. All the cars are divided into 5 tiers. At the start of the game, you only have access to the cheaper tier 1 cars. To unlock the other tiers featuring more expensive cars, you need to acquire a certain wristband.\n\n* **Tier 1**: Common (Green)  - starting-out tier for all players\n* **Tier 2**: Uncommon (Blue) - earn a blue wristband\n* **Tier 3**: Rare (Purple) - earn an orange wristband\n* **Tier 4**: Epic (Red) - earn a red wristband\n* **Tier 5**: Legendary (Gold) - earn a bronze wristband\n\nSome cars can be unlocked from finding barn finds and winning showcase events and boss races!\n\nlink: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/hdyfv9/disneys\_motorama\_car\_list\_ideas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/hdyfv9/disneys_motorama_car_list_ideas/)\n\n***SOUNDTRACK***\n\nThe game's soundtrack features 9 radio stations, including a Spotify radio station where you can integrate your own playlists into the game!\n\n* **Motorama Pulse** \- hosted by Amy Simpson, features pop, indie, nu-disco and electronica.\n* **Motorama Bass Arena** \- hosted by Scott Tyler, features dubstep, house, electro and techno.\n* **Motorama Block Party** \- hosted by DJ Spin, features hip-hop, R&amp;B and rap.\n* **Motorama XS** \- hosted by Phoenix Fox, features alternative and hard rock.\n* **Hospital Records Radio** \- hosted by Chris Goss and Tony Colman, features drum and bass.\n* **Fearless Records Radio** \- hosted by Bob Becker, features punk, metal and post-hardcore.\n* **Retro 80s Radio** \- local station featuring music from the 80s era.\n* **Retro 90s Radio** \- local station featuring music from the 90s era.\n* **Timeless FM** \- local station hosted by Dan Thompson, features classical music.\n* **Spotify** \- integrate your own playlists into the game! (Spotify Premium account required)\n\nPulse, Bass Arena, Block Party and XS will be available at the start of the game. The other stations can be unlocked as you progress through the main storyline. Skill songs won't return, out of respect due to the soundtracks in Horizon 3 and 4 looping over and over again during events and drone mode.\n\nI know a game like this may not happen because of licensing, but still, it would be *really* cool if it were to! Feedback is always appreciated!
n4oo7f|An idea for a bizzare cute'em up shooter I had|I have a really bizzare idea regarding the plot and features of a shooter game I have been thinking of doing eventually. \n\nThe main characters will be about two elderly furry muscular lesbian angel witch sisters named Maria and Zion who are ten million years old.\n\nThe game would take place on a post apocalyptic earth devoid of humans because of nuclear war and the only creatures left besides them are cute forest critters living in harmony.\n\nThen one day a foreign army of robot invaders lead by an angry french hotdog named Nils seeking to conquer earth to please the intergalactic emperor Gustavus adolphus who was king of Sweden during the 1600s but in his resurrected mecha furry form ready to use the forest critters as tickle slaves and to use them as forced labour for his galactic empire.\n\nThe game will be a cute'em up shooter inspired by Sega's fantasy zone game series in terms of basic gameplay and aesthetics but with differences such as bonus levels were you earn extra angels by destroying floating big Mac hamburgers and Double quarter pounders spewing out mechafurries with jetpacks.\n\nThere will also be permanent secret upgrades and a big emerald obtainable after collecting 10 smaller emeralds in the right colour order on each world and once 7 big emeralds have been collected you unlock 3 more secret levels where you face Gustavus main henchmen before facing the emperor himself. \n\nI have a solid understanding in the fundamentals of programming so that shouldn't really be a major issue as far that is concerned the only thing I am uncertain about is the artwork(I do have a wacom s tablet I can use)but I could always hire somebody to do it for me.
n4lwaj|An Hour of Time - A simple game about looking after yourself|Hi everyone, I'm Matias.\n\nI'm currently working on a game idea and wanted to know what people thought of it. Well here goes.\n\nYou play as an unnamed character who wakes up at 6:00 in the morning. They have to leave for work at 7:00 meaning they have an extra hour of time. Each task that you do will take up to 15 minutes meaning you can only do 4 tasks. The game is simple and you can do whatever you want really. \n\nWant to drink a beer? go ahead. \n\nMaybe text a friend to hang out during the weekend? You can do that too.\n\n At the end of the four tasks, your character will tell you how happy they feel based on the things you did. I want a cute animation style where the characters face appears in the bottom corner of the screen and text dialogue similar to that of an RPG appear when you interact with something.\n\nMy overall intention is to make a game that encourages people to look after themselves and perhaps fix and enjoy the little things in life when they have the time for them.\n\nWell, that's it. Sorry if you expected something with a bigger scope but I want to have a simple idea which I can make a game about within the timeframe of two months. \n\nPlease, feel free to leave ideas as to the tasks you can do or give advice as to how I should go about making the game.

With it's community managing, ability to switch characters, base building, tech Upgrades, different weapons/ skills to get &amp; unlock along the way, etc etc?\n\nWell picture that but remove all the zombies and instead picture a Sci-Fi Space World where you control a Colony that you can manage &amp; upgrade, along with ability to recruit, switch between, and hire different characters from humans to all kinds of different sized &amp; minds of alien races, with individuals having skills to upgrade, sci-fi vehicles, tech trees to improve for base and gameplay in general, story, missions, and fight/ ally with other factions/ robots/ creatures to face off against in this State of Decay-like Game\n\nThe 2nd one is same thing remove zombies and replace with a Fantasy World (Imagine having elves, humans, dwarves, orcs, etc as a part of your Settlement with different forms of transportation, factions, bases/ base-building, skills, weapons, characters, factions, etc etc)\n\nThe State of Decay Game Model is VERY UNDERRATED and besides Undead Labs no one else is doing it yet.

n4hd2q|Massive Open world dystopian survival game|Game takes place in America, the game map is composed of the entirety of the U.S. and perhaps Canada or Mexico could be offered in dlcs.\n\nAfter a short war, America has been taken complete control of by China/Russia/Iran/North Korea or whatever other country the U.S. doesn't play nice with in real life.\n\nWhatever country has control of the U.S. is way more technologically advanced and has things such as robot suits, drones, and other sci fi esque weapons \n\nThe player is encouraged to stay out of bigger cities and instead build bases out of sight in the woods, caves, and remote places of America while also maintaining stealth if they absolutely have to enter a town\n\nBigger cities contain more loot but also higher level enemies. Once again, favoring stealth over the guns a'blazing approach is encouraged for looting these bigger cities.
n4co22|FPS/RTS Hybrid|5 human players per team.  1 player on each team is the "general".  He sees the map from top down and controls the game like an RTS with the 4 other players as "champions".  Obviously he can't control the players, but he would be able to create, upgrade, and control NPC units.\n\nWhile he wouldn't control the champions, the general could assign them "missions" like "capture this point" or "kill these enemies".  Depending on the mission and the difficulty, the champions would get resources they could use to upgrade themselves so they stay relevant as the fight goes on.  Even if they don't receive any missions, they can still get some resources if they kill enemy units (especially other champions).\n\nI assume general would not be a coveted position, but RTS AI technology is pretty impressive and I believe an AI general could be effective.  The intelligence and skill of both the AI general and the NPCs would be based on the players' ELO.\n\nI think the biggest challenge would be finding a balance between general and champion effectiveness.   It will be difficult to make sure that both roles feel effective and at low levels especially, the generals and the champions might often just play completely separate from each other, defeating the point of the game.

The idea isn't really all that much, but its free to use and can be very basic.\n\nLet me know what y'all think.

n480qm|Cursed Realty|**Genre:**  Comedy, puzzle\n\n**TL;DR:** You are a realtor trying to sell obviously haunted houses to oblivious young couples.\n\n**Graphics:**  I'm imagining simple, pixelated graphics, but I could see a 3D version using basic Unity assets working, too.\n\n**Gameplay:**  Each "level" is a different house tour.  You beat a level by selling a house.  Each successive house is more haunted than the last.  Your score is based on how much you sell the house for.\n\nLevels start off with you arriving at the house with a short amount of time to clean up messes such as cobwebs, spirit writings, and objects thrown by poltergeists.  Some of these "messes" are too extreme, so you might disguise them as something else (eg covering an alter for ritual sacrifice with a table cloth and flowers and calling it a dinner table, or adding to the spirit writings and calling it a graffiti inspired art room).  If you have enough time, you may also set up "distraction pieces" such as interesting furniture or fixtures.\n\nOnce the couple arrives, you lead them through calling attention away from any messes you weren't able to clean up.  As time goes on, specters will randomly cause disturbances (throwing objects, rattling chains, causing black liquid to ooze out of drains, etc).  You can distract from disturbing sites by changing your position in the room or pointing out your distraction pieces so the couple turns away and you can distract from noises by playing music or something.  The crazier the spooky event, the crazier your antics to hide it.\n\nYou can leave a couple alone in a room either on the pretext of going to fetch something (refreshments, paint swatches, etc) or allowing them to explore on their own which will allow you a short amount of time to deal with a particularly bad bit of possession in another part of the house.  However, you can't distract the couple while you're away and the price of the house goes up the longer you talk to them so it's a good idea to stay with them.\n\nEach time the couple notices a mess, they will complain about it which will lower the houses overall cost, but also temporarily distract them from the antics of poltergeists so in more difficult stages, it may be advantageous to leave some mess.\n\nAfter a set amount of time, if the couple is not scared off and the price of the house does not reach $0, the couple will declare their intention to buy.  You can still increase the price by talking to them more (at the risk of spectral sabotage), but in general, you would return them to the front porch and have them sign a contract, ending the level.
n46s8s|Battlefield style fps but with a stereotypical 50s style alien invasion aesthetic.|Think battlefield but one team plays as like an earth defense force with advanced experimental military weaponry and vehicles and the other team play as mars attacks like aliens, with ufo's and tripod walkers like in war of the worlds and stuff. The maps would be set in like US cities and small towns and stuff. I think that would be pretty sweet.

n3wx70|Teacher RPG|So before I start I want To say I would develop this game myself if I could, but I can't make good enough art. Im only a programmer.\n\nSo my idea is an RPG where you play as a Teacher in a School for Knights.\n\nAt the beginning of the School year you would meet all of your students ( I was thinking about 20 students each with a personality of their own)\n\nYour job as the teacher is To teach your students in choosen topics, give them assignments and train with them.\n\nEach of these activities will alter the stats and skills of your students.\n\nThe thing is you have limited actions per day (Calendar system a little like Persona)\n\nAfter the School year is done your students graduate and you enter a second phase of the game, This time you're not the teacher you control students all of them.\n\nIn phase 2 (War) the students dont get as much experience you're stuck with the choices you made in phase 1. It's a turn by turn battle system where all 20 of your students are working togheter against ennemies using the skills they learned in phase 1.\n\nNote that at first battles Will be easy, not because ennemies are stronger, but because you have 20 units, but if any of them dies they're dead forever. \n\nIt's important the game forces you To lose characters at some points, it should be impossible To get To the final boss with all 20 characters. \n\n(Oh yea plot twist the final boss is the Teacher you played in phase 1)\n\nSome inspiration from :\n- Fire Emblem Three Houses. \n- Persona Series\n- Classic RPGs
n3vtwn|Idea for a future game|Some sort of futuristic multiplayer Bounty-hunter simulator in an open-world. You can either become the hunter or the hunted and have to outsmart the other player by setting up traps, installing cameras or tracking the hunted one. Some aspects of the game could be a trackable mobile phone (makes it possible to order stuff but the hunter knows your location), or distraction. The objection of the hunter is to find and knockout the other one, the objective of the hunter is surviving until the bounty-hunter gives up, dies or doesn't find the suspect within 24 in-game-hours.\nRight now i have some experience in making games but in the beginning its too much work for just one person. So if you're interested in the idea, feel free to text me.
n3uy1b|Fallout 1/2 with plot| I want to create a Fallout-style game with bookish, tooth-breaking plot, where you investigate pre-war events by collecting notes, maps, items and so on. Like Fallout:Equestria (which is a book).\n\nThe gameplay is going to be "read a note, hack into a terminal, talk to strangers, think, THINK MORE, and figure out what happened in the past and what do you need to do". So it is kind of a puzzle too. Maybe with some fights in between. Maybe with stealth. Maybe I even can let the player freely talk to characters.\n\nWhat I have is coding skills. What I need is a good and interesting pre-war story, or a fiction writer, who can create one (I am little bit fiction writer myself, but I lack creativity). I'm sure there are tons of ficwriters who want someone to come and say "hey, I'm gonna make a movie/game out of your fanfic". So it may be your lucky day!\n\n**Spoilers ahead**. &gt;!Rough pre-war history would look like this: alternative world, country A fight against country B for some territory rich with oil. But everything is not that simple. Some corporations in A benefit from the war. Government benefits as well (hello, 1984). Clearly there are spies and fifth column. Some people even want the apocalypse to happen. Monstrous projects are developed (FEV, power armor, mechas, why not?), and one of these projects is a time machine, capable of receiving one short message from the future. And then bombs fell, everyone died. The main hero investigates pre-war secrets, finds the time machine and sends a message to the past (which can be "surrender", "attack", or some really special message that will stop the war and make everyone happy). But of course I want to add PLOT and DRAMA, and TWISTS, and I really need your help for that.!&lt;
n3rdei|Hey! I want to start developing a game. How do you like this idea?|  \n\nGood day everyone!\n\nI want to share with you an idea for the game. Perhaps someone will decide to take it into development. So far, these are just my thoughts, set out on paper.\n\nI have always liked the way children look at the world - they are not afraid to fantasize. When I was a child, I imagined myself as a hero in different worlds with obstacles and dangers. Now I want to develop a game about children's fantasy, in which there is no room for the impossible.\n\nI would be glad to receive your feedback and wishes!\n\nConcept\n\nA game about a little girl. She and her dad move to a country house. Her mother died of an incurable disease; her father grieves for his wife and does not know how to raise her daughter. The girl is all alone. Having closed herself off from psychological problems that are difficult for a child, she does not want to be friends with local children at all. Instead, she comes up with a world of her own. In her fantasies, she is free to do whatever she wants. She has friends - old toys that come to life in her thoughts (or really?). Gradually, the player no longer understands what reality is and what fiction is. In addition to beautiful fantasy creatures and beautiful locations, the girl's inner fears appear. They are destroying the beautiful world, making toys ordinary. If fears win, then the beautiful world will be destroyed, and the girl will go mad. Our goal is to overcome the fears of loss and loneliness in ourselves and help the girl to live a normal life.\n\nGame theme\n\nChildren perceive the world in a completely different way. They are in this life quite recently, therefore, they do not know much or do not understand much, but they can fantasize up to what they still do not know. Fantasies help fight real problems.\n\nHero\n\nLittle girl. 5 years. She has no name so as not to limit the fantasy of the player.\n\nShe can hover, talk to animals, manipulate her toys, and fix old broken toys.\n\nShe cannot control her fears.\n\nSetting\n\nThe game has four locations: a tree house, a forest, an old barn and a house.\n\nThe girl imagines the tree house as her castle; her subjects live in it - toys.\n\nIt changes; secret rooms and halls appear in it.\n\nThe forest is very changeable. It has many animals to talk to. Trails get confused and change direction. There are labyrinths and rabbit holes.\n\nThe old barn is dark and scary. It contains many broken toys that you can repair and attach to your retinue. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to defeat the fear of the dark.\n\nThe house is ordinary without fancy elements. He brings the girl back to reality. Through the surrounding objects, you can learn the story of the girl. There are also many useful items in the house.\n\nFears - dark formless entities - can appear at any moment. They destroy the world around them. They can be fought with toys. They are the girl's main protection. Each toy has its own abilities.\n\nReferences\n\nGames:\n\n1) Alice: Madness Retur\n\n2) The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit\n\n3) Little Nightmares\n\nFilms:\n\n1) A Monster Calls\n\n2) The Spiderwick Chronicles
n3pjq9|The gods game: part 1: the gameplay|&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in my last post i slightly touched on gameplay (Yea i know this post is designated one but i'm annoying and started at zero) but i didn't really go that in depth but what i did say is that it would be a capture the point 5v5 game with parts of both platform fighters and mobas and this still mostly stands. You see I realized that having 5 players per team might be too much to keep up with in large team fights so I'm lowering it down to 4 per team. But another important thing is the objectives. What are you supposed to do? Well there are four different objectives with one end goal let me explain. Objective one is to capture the three points scattered around the map. Your entire team gets gold for every teammate inside a point no matter if they are there alone or with an enemy and if your team is able to spend 15 seconds alone without enemies inside one of the points the point itself will start to generate gold for your team, no matter if a teammate is in it or not.\n\nObjective two is to get stronger and eliminate enemies. With gold you will be able to upgrade yourself and get things like more health, damage or stronger abilities (more on that in a later post) and this is good when you are in a fight with an enemy. You want to eliminate enemies because then they will need to respawn which will give your team time to finish other objectives. You also get gold for your troubles and a lite gold if you only helped.\n\nNow comes the last objective, hunting. Every now and again after the game has passed the 5 minute mark 2 minute timers will appear one the different points. When these timers reach 0 a boss will be spawned and that point will not be able to generate any gold for either one of the teams until it is defeated. When defeated the boss will give the team that killed it a lot of gold each and give the point it's currently stationed at and make the enemies unable to get gold or capture that points for 5 minutes. And lastly there's the goal. The goal of the game is to get strong enough to be able to destroy the other teams spawn which is located really fearfully on their side of the map. however it will be protected by 3 turret crystals which will shoot and kill enemies within range. two of the three turret crystals need to be destroyed to be able to damage the enemy spawner. And once the enemy spawner is destroyed you win.\n\nI was hoping to be able to talk more about the map but I'll need to do that later since this post is getting long. So i'll hopefully see you then, bye!

n3lnfm|Role-playing as Blacksmith/Herbalist/Alchemist/etc (crafting based in open world)|What if you could play as the shop-keepers in RPGs? But in a way that is dangerous and exciting.\n\nThe setting is medieval. \n\nYou craft various things depending on your role, in an immersive way. The three roles are Herbalist/Alchemist/Blacksmith. You choose one.\n\nGameplay evolves scavenging the open world for materials depending on your chosen role (taking samples/picking herbs, buying supplies). This is dangerous because you might get ambushed by bandits and lose your stock on the way back.\n\nIf you make it back, then you combine ingredients or use craftsmanship in a workshop simulator (for example blacksmithing) and going through the various steps to craft a good. This can be a medicinal brew, poison or elixir, or sword/axe.\n\nWhen done, you fullfill orders at your market stall/shop. Danger lurks even in this environment, you cannot trust every person that comes up to you to buy your goods. Simple combat mechanics are involved in fending off thieves, rivals, etc. \n\nIf you lose these fights you either lose gold (get robbed) or your equipment gets broken (requiring you to close shop for a period of time while you fix things which costs money).\n\nWhen successful at filling an order, you get a sum of gold and reputations points (more on that later). Hopefully this sum balances out any prior loses.\n\nYou can use the gold to upgrade your workshop. You can use it to spend on rare ingredients. (unlocking more craftable goods)\n\nIf you're wealthy enough you can hire an apprentice. They cost daily upkeep money but will fetch ingredients for you and act as an extra-hand (cutting crafting wait times). \n\nThe end goal is to get the other herbalists/blacksmiths/alchemists on the map to go out of business because npc's choose your shop as the best in the land. \n\nThis is based on your reputation rank, which goes up with each successful order, or down when you close shop to fix equipment. \n\nYou've successfully completed the role when you reach Reputation Rank 100. You can .continue to take orders or start over with a different role\n\n\-----------\n\nThats all so far. What do you guys think? Is it realistic as a game concept?
n3jgew|A "true sequel" to vib ribbon|It seems like vib ribbon isn't looking forward to any more major new games only re-releases... I would conjure up a new game called "Zepto Ribbon" which is a fan game to continue the series. [Check out vib ribbon it's a great ps1 game] Maybe add more support improve AI for custom tracks, remap old songs [if you can actually use them], add new to trippy visuals to make it more difficult, add a points system that scales with the pattern combos, visuals, and speed. Would be a massive big fat copyright fiasco but just a idea.\nP.S : feel free to have a heyday with my idea
n3ihd9|Monster collecting horror game|As the title implies i think monster collection + the horror genre can work well together. Like the player themselves can be powerless and they have to rely on the monsters they collect to protect them. The player might have to run and hide while their monsters fight the ones hunting you down. \n\nAdd in unique power interactions between the monsters so some can slip pass yours if they don't have the power to stop them and vise versa. Also add permadeath to your monsters so if you ever run out of monsters to protect you it can result in a nearly hopeless situation that i don't think a lot of horror games can portray very well.\n\nHell even taming can be a heart pounding experience because the player might not ever know if the monster they are trying to coax will decide to eat them instead. Just a idea that hasn't been done and think it would make for a entertaining mechanic to have in a horror game.
n3glla|Hey guys, complete novice here, I'm starting my own Open World 3D MMO with advanced AI built on the blockchain|To all you newbies out there, welcome! \n\nIf you have a goal of creating, finishing and publishing a game, then learn this bit of information first:  \n\nSTART SMALL DAMMIT! \n\nI know you really want to make your own RPG. I know you spent all that time naming the weapons and factions and coming up with all the backstory and the multiple endings, but guess what? You're not going to be able to make it. \n\nThink of a game similar to your game idea. Was it made by hundreds of experienced professionals paid by millions of dollars of budget over the course of years? \n\nYes? Then it's time to think about why you think you can do what those hundreds of people took years to do. \n\nThe only limitations on your idea are your imagination, which is great, it's great fun to come up with innovative and expansive ideas. \n\nBut when it comes to actually manifesting your idea, then there are quite a few limitations. There are limitations on how "big" of a game one person or a small team can make. There are even more limitations when that person or small team are amateurs. \n\nI know this message is just pissing in the wind of the neverending waves of new and naive developers, but if this can save any of you some time then it's worth it in my book. \n\n**If you're just trying to mess around and learn, then by all means start putting the pieces together for your dream MMO.** It doesn't matter if you don't finish it or even get far if you're just trying to have fun or learn something new. \n\nBut, if you want to finish a project and see it published, start REALLY small and I *promise* it will take longer and require more work than you expected. But you'll feel all the more proud when it's done. \n\nCheers!
n3fohd|Immersion in game development.|As I always say, immersion goes far beyond graphics. Having the best graphics does not mean having immersion. The immersion that I speak is like entering a castle of terror, because it brings you emotions, good or bad. It is immersion that holds the player in the game. It's like not wanting to go out to eat, or do anything else, you just forget you're playing a game. Everything is connected in the setting and theme. If this set of quality adds to the multiple challenges proposed in the game, you already have a big difference, just look at the number of games that are repetitive. Things that take us out of the reality of everyday life, are more likely to cause us emotions.\n\nImmersion is emotion. As I always say, if the game doesn't bring you emotions, for me it's not a good game. This is noticeable in the first 5 minutes of the game. If you are developing a game, take this test, film the friends or relatives who are going to play your game first. Study their reaction. See if your game is being very specific for a single niche of people, if that happens, sometimes it is better to dose your theme a little so that the game is not so restricted. This does not mean that you will lose the essence of your game, just that you will add elements that will attract a larger audience and generate more elements to complement your game immersion. Never forget to attract people by immersion, using art and challenges as the main elements of your game.
n3cf3q|A modern military shooter that is essentially a MOBA|I was thinking it would be fun to play a game like battlefield but you can only play in vehicles. All the infantry would be controlled by AI. \n\nThe players would have to use the various vehicles to guild their infantry units to control points. Those control points could have defensive measures that would need to be disabled before moving on to the next control point and eventually the enemy main base. As the match goes on upgrades will unlock to customize your vehicle.
n3bfvj|Turn Based Paper Stickman Game| \n\nThe turn based paper game I made this turn based paper Stick man game a long time ago and i thought like sharing with you guys as i thought there might be some Video Game experts who may help me with some balancing .  \n pdf:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AbpiPSmwr70XGLbdQTb7aXUIYfY\_IIYN/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AbpiPSmwr70XGLbdQTb7aXUIYfY_IIYN/view?usp=sharing) \n\nBasically there are three main resources\n\n\- Iron \[The rectangle symbol\] (For buildings, advanced troops and upgrades)\n\n\- Wheat \[The symbol that looks like a leaf\] (For troops and upgrades)\n\n\- Upgrade points \[The arrow symbol\] (For upgrading any buildings and advanced skills/upgrades).\n\nThe map consists of multiple islands interconnected with bridges.The main goal of this game is to destroy the enemies' Fortress or make then surrender.\n\nSince this is a turn based game, the rules are, in 1 turn:\n\n\- A military building can train 1 troop (2 in case of critters, special troops of cursed faction)\n\n\- Builder can build/repair 1 building\n\n\- Troops can move move\n\n. 1 island (Infantry)\n\n. 2 islands (Cavalry, Ships)\n\n. 0.5 islands (Siege equipment)\n\n\- Troops can attack and defend once per turn, the one who while attacking or defending, a coin is tossed and whoever wins deals damage first (Im still thinking of how to balance this part)\n\n\- All resources are gained at start of turn, the amount depends upon the number of farms (for wheat), mine (for iron)\n\n\- Only 1 upgrade point is obtained per turn, this can be increased to 3/4 depending on faction with help of upgrades(edited)\n\nThere are mainly three factions that i have made:\n\n\- Empire\n\n. Europe themed\n\n. Medium Health\n\n. High defense\n\n. Medium Attack\n\n. High cost\n\n. Medium resource production\n\n. Good all rounder\n\n\- Dynasty\n\n. Asian themed\n\n. Low Health\n\n. Medium Defense\n\n. Low cost\n\n. High attack\n\n. High resource production\n\n. Weak early game\n\n. Heavily relies on Gunpowder troops for high damage late game\n\n\- Cursed\n\n.

Most troops have max limit of 1-3\n\n. Very high health, defense, cost and attack\n\n\[Noticeable weakness of cursed faction, most late game troops have are limited forcing players to make mid tier troops along side late tier troops. Death of any one late tier heavily reduces army strength. Most Late game troops lack CC (Crowd control)\]\n\nI am dreaming of one day being able to make this into a real game and I am learning python right now. Hope some you may be able to give me some advices (\^u\^). Since i just drew the game in a copy, some of the skills may not be readable due to my terrible handwriting or lack of info, If there are any queries feel free to ask!\n\n(Fun fact, this game is completely playable on a piece of paper, its just that it may take a few weeks to complete one game ("\^u\^).

n30mrs|Need help with my game idea.|I plan to make a Dialogue RPG game based on the book I read recently called "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho, as I know it's a very famous book at least some of you might know about it. So I have little to no knowledge in making games and I have trouble starting with it what would people in this sub suggest me to do?\n\n I just plan to make a small beta version of the game. I know the content of the book and could turn it into a dialogue RPG, but it will be more like a Visual Novel, and I think it will lack "play-able" content.\n\nPlease help me with how should I make this game. I am sorry if I didn't clear things regarding my question, you may ask it in the comments. Any suggestions are appreciated.
n2zb8o|An alchemy/merchant game with chemistry roots|You know those games where you kill a ton of monsters and get a ton of useless loot from them that you sell? I have an idea for a game from the perspective of the merchant that's buying all those monster parts for some reason.   \n\n\nYou would be an alchemist who buys monster parts from adventurers and refines them into usable wares to sell. At the very least I think potions would be cool to make, but I can also see your character making runes, weapons,. and armor.   \n\n\nAs for how the potions work, there's a lot of real world chemistry techniques that I think could be used for rough inspiration. I just really like the feeling of processing and making potions (kind of like Thaumcraft.) For example, maybe the monsters drop impure gems and you put them in a pot, dissolve them in a liquid, and then precipitate them out to purify them (based on recrystalization). All of these would obviously be super simplified so that most/all people could learn what to do easily.   \n\n\nI generally want to capture the feeling of creating super pure advanced potions/gear by processing trash loot from adventures. A lot of the mechanics of making said potions would be loosely based on real chemistry techniques like recrystalization, distillation, spectroscopy, etc. These techniques would be super simple and streamlined, and the player would just have to learn "this process analyzes what you have, this one separates, this one purifies, etc."   \n\n\nOnce you make these potions, you can sell them to certain adventuring parties for the price of them bringing you better reagents and a little gold. This could add a cool component of making sure they're well equipped for their journey. For example, maybe you see that they're going through an ice area so you make them lots of frost resist potions.   \n\n\nIf ambitious, an armor, rune, and weapon component could be added too but honestly the potion stuff is the important aspect.
n2w6h4|An Educational Game Disguised as a Horror Game. (Looking for a writer.)|For my new game, I wanted to create an educational game disguised as a horror game. So here's the premise.\n\nYou play as Matt and since kindergarten, your father has bought you an educational game every year for your birthday. Matt's father, however, has greater expectations each year and the games he gets you become harder and harder.  There are two parts to the game\n\n. The first part is the ability to look around your room and can see how much it has changed as you grow older. You can also communicate with family and friends. I want to set the game up so when Matt gets older his room becomes more monochromatic and the environment becomes more serious. We can also learn more about his personal life through his encounters with his father and his friends.\n\nThe second part is where the horror game aspect comes. My plan is to have the educational game teach the player some lessons and the player must answer correctly in order to progress. (The games end up getting more weirder and difficult the more you progress.)   In the first years the educational game will start off happy and get creepier but as the years go buy the game will start creepy and end even creepier. In short, I want my game to have a  moral on how the stress of kids to improve more and more can slowly cause their life to form into a downward spiral where they dissociate from family, friends and sometimes even reality.\n\nI'm looking for a writer who can help me with the overall plot and perhaps even the gameplay. You don't have to be exceptionally talented or anything like that I just want someone to bounce ideas with. If more than one person tries to message me then I will create a group chat. I would also like to send my progress to the people I'm working with through game files so they can test the game and see what could be improved. A once a week message conversation will work fine. Please note anyone under 18 cannot message me to contribute ideas to the game as I'm 18 myself.\n\n I'll look forward to seeing if anyone wants to join otherwise feel free to give criticism/advice in the comments.
n2w2cd|A Watch_Dogs game that requires real hacking skills|It'd be really cool to see a version of the game Watch\_Dogs for real Computer Scientists, Engineers, IT people, hackers, etc.\n\nBasically the entire world &amp; storyline is the game...But rather than pressing a few buttons to hack into systems, you would actually have to write code ingame to exploit those systems. And of-course, you can reuse that same code on similar vulnerable systems, etc. But all of the tasks would require you to be familiar with a programming language, the linux terminal, etc.\n\nWould be dope huh?

nbn84e|Mayday: Air Crash Investigation sim for PC|I don't think more than maybe 2 or 3 people would actually buy and play this, but I think it would be really cool, so I'll go ahead and post it here.\n\n\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game opens with the classic "Mayday" TV show intro, then you are taken to a screen where it will ask you how much you know about aircraft and aviation terminology in general. This is similar to how FIFA games for example, will ask you how much you know about soccer. Depending on what you answer, the terminology used will be "dumbed down" for the player to be able to understand it. The setting can be changed anytime. You will see the main menu where you can start a new game, and will later have the option to view your hangar of collected aircraft models (obtained for each successful investigation) as well as options to review all previous case files and play bonus levels that will unlock once you have a certain amount of XP.\n\n \n\nPOV: You’re a rookie investigator for the NTSB, the US federal agency responsible for investigating the causes of air crashes not only in the states, but all over the world. Your first case is fairly straightforward: a small aircraft that has suffered a clear, catastrophic mechanical failure. This level will serve as a tutorial of sorts. Your team will give you tips on sifting through evidence, identifying different types of mechanical faults, interviewing witnesses, reviewing Cockpit Voice Recorders and Flight Data Recorders, and finally submitting your report to the agency. You can always replay this level if you need to get brushed up on the basics. \n\n\- Become a world-renowned air crash investigator. When you start a new game, your reputation points (or XP) will be low and you’ll only be handling regional cases. The more investigations you successfully complete, the higher it will go, and the more opportunities you’ll have to graduate to more challenging cases all across the globe. \n\n\- Learn to use all the tools of your trade in this free roaming world, from the most advanced technology to good old fashioned gumshoe detective work. Interview witnesses and survivors to see if they can reveal anything that you might be missing. Listen to cockpit conversations as many times as you need to. Sometimes they may hold the answer, sometimes not, but it never hurts to be thorough. Review flight data information to see if any critical systems have failed. Review charts of the surrounding area to see if terrain or weather was a factor. Develop profiles of the captain and crew to determine if human error played a role.  \n\n\- Build a reliable team. Getting to the bottom of an air disaster is an arduous process, so let your team help you with several specific tasks such as poring through debris, conducting media interviews to keep the press off your back, and checking into the background of the crew and passengers. You’ll need to develop sufficient XP to be able to to hire the best of the best. \n\n\- Learn when to call the FBI for assistance. Sometimes, an accident is actually not an accident at all, but a terrorist attack or a disgruntled passenger / employee lashing out. If this is the case, you will be handing control of the final report over to the FBI, and provide a consulting role to help them determine what exactly happened. This is critical to get right the first time, make sure you have all the facts you need before making the call. Misidentifying a case could cause grave damage to your reputation and public confidence in the aviation industry. \n\n\- Bonus levels: investigate cases in historical scenarios, involving several classic aircraft from the 1930s, 40s, 50s, 60s etc. \n\n\- Additional bonus: port all of the unlocked aircraft in your hangar into any flight simulator game.\n\n\- The NTSB and the public are counting on you to deliver an accurate, detailed report that will help further the safety of the aviation industry at large. Follow up on all your leads before submitting your findings.
nblzgw|Hi, there. Working on a dark fantasy/horror themed grim sci-fi fighting game but need help with the character influences|I want to make sure that these don't sound offensive due to their designs and inspirations. I'm not concerned about the gameplay archetypes at the moment, my concern is the character's physical attributes and if they sound like bad stereotypes.\n\nOne is an ancient Chinese Terracotta soldier statue that controls sand and would play as a trap/zoner.\n\nOne is a female Amazonian tribal vampire, who's focus is on being a rushdown, with a very aggressive play-style.\n\nAnother one is a frost giant that uses the element of ice, who's focus is on being a brute/trapper.\n\nAnd a South Korean spec ops/commando woman with a cybernetic robot dog, which is a puppet playstyle character.\n\nAny feedback, I will gladly appreciate.

nbe51r|A platformer rpg but you level DOWN|So you start the game with simple platforming and level 1 Enemies\nYou start at a very high level, for example 50.\nYou kill everything in 1 hit have tons of hp etc.\nHowever you still get xp when you kill enemies, you will get a small amount at the start but after not too long you'll start leveling down . When you level down you get to choose a stat to decrease (health, attack, etc.) By the end of the game you will have very low stats and would get killed in 4 or 5 hits by everything. Still, the bosses shouldn't be too powerfull so it's still fair, and by that point the game would be more dodging oriented.\nThoughts?
nbcsym|Idea for a pc game.|How do I start this...well, the games name is "The Grackles chime", the game starts with the sound of a Grackle (The crow-like sound, not tweetie bird.), And simply says "They've awoken." You play as a child and need to prepare weapons. You then go out. Try not to get k* lled by grackles, they hide EVERYWHERE. There's normal grackles, emperor and empress grackles. And the boss right is known as " GOD GRACKLE" with 6 wings. Let me know if u want not info!
nbah4u|City War - multiplayer| \n\nI'd like to describe my idea for a game and see what you think about it, etc. This is just a very general draft of the game idea and it's totally open for all of your suggestions.\n\nSo it is a multiplayer game where before you start you can create your start own map, for example something like a town (based on city skylines) but with the very basic graphic. Then you can share this map on the server and other people can either create their own map (server) or join to your map. For example if five players will join to one map then the game starts.\n\nThese five players are spawned in five random places on the map and controls their characters from the first perspective view. The main goal for them is to destroy the let's say VIP building (the most imporstant building in the game, the aim for the players). But they are fighting with each other also, because only one person can win the game. Players can find some kind of weapons on a map. The host of the map is also playing but not as a person on the map like them but he has a camera like on the city skylines from the top so he sees all of the players and he has to protect somehow the VIP building and make it difficult for players to get there, for example he has to build some kind of walls, some security posts, turrets with plots, etc., so the players will see those things and have to somehow destroy or go workaround them. Of course the host has also something like limited cash to spend, but he can also earn that cash from some shops, factories on the map, and players can also destroy that kind of buildings to stop earning money by the host.\n\nSo this is my very general idea draft for a game, what do you think?
nb9yw3|Web Game: Fake News|This is an idea for a web game adaptation of a board game. Rule 2 says blatant copies aren't allowed but I don't know if this counts or not.\n\n So I recently started playing a web game called Gartic Phone, it's basically a web version of the board game Telestrations. So I thought, why not have a web game version of the card game Fake News?  \n\n\nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME (shorter explanation)  \n\- Each player gets 1-3 topic cards (which would be a setting)). Each topic card has a short phrase on it  \n\- Each player also gets 1 image card with an image  \n\- Each player also gets 1 audience card with a group of people listed on it (ex: Seniors)  \n\- Each player then makes up a news headline using the topic cards as a base, the image card as the idea, and the audience card of who the news headline is directed to  \n\- The game then shows every player each headline, (the topics, image, and audience cards being shown or not could be a setting)   \n\- Each player then gives a Winner, Runner Up, and FAKE NEWS! title to one card.   \n\- The winner is worth 3 points, Runner Up is worth 2, and FAKE NEWS! is worth 1 point. If you don't get any votes then it's 0 points  \n\- The game is for 4-8 players\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEB LINKS (ideas)  \n\- [playfakenews.com](https://playfakenews.com)  \n\- [fakenewsgame.com](https://fakenewsgame.com) \n\n(the only reason I'm asking for someone to make this is because I want to play this online, credit me if you'd like but as stated in Rule 6 you don't have to)
nb0nh7|Plant evolution game multiplayer|I recently thought of a game where there is one huge server or maybe a couple. Everyone starts out picking some traits for a plant and you decide where you put it in the environment. From there you should spread and try to be the most well adapted plant to the environment. The server climate will change and there will be different biomes. But sometimes there will be lots of rains and sometimes very dry. My thought is that you could log out for a couple of days and come back on with your species still alive so it would be something going on for over a year if you commit to it. New players might join and invade your species with their plants and the inactive peoples plants will just die because they don't evolve them. THe more you spread the more points you can spend on evolving, might need some balance mechanic for that though so too well spread species aren't impossible too take down.\n\nTo me it sounds like a cool idea, especially if it is a passive game where you can log on like twice a week and check in on how well you are doing. There could also be a quicker game mode where everything is fast paced and is more like a Battle Royale :)

nas91x|The Breaking Cheese Wheel|This game would be a 2D game where you are in a cheese factory killing all the workers. Boss Fights would be where you can grab the workers and through them onto machines to kill them! I really do want some ideas and criticism so if you had some, please comment some ideas.
napn1d|You harness the power of your enemies, but it's online|The idea would be of a MMORPG but instead of choosing a class, you only start with a basic auto-attack skill. When you slay a monster, its body immediately decays and disappears. Except sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't you can harness a skill from the monster and that's a new skill you can use yourself.\n\nYou would build your character based on the skills you obtain and maybe based on the items too. You could actually select a class in the beginning but it would be mostly passive skills.\n\nEventually, you'll run into powerful monsters that let you get special skills. The strongest monsters, found at the end of difficult dungeons, would have a slight chance to not decay and to let you obtain very powerful endgame skills.

nae0ci|Tower defense or Minecraft like, building combo mechanic.|So this is an idea I had while watching a streamer play a building game.\n\nThe idea is that like a normal building game you can place buildings. However when upgrading the building you instead build other buildings on top of the first.\n\nHere is a simple image explaining to show the concept: [https://i.imgur.com/X3Lpm3L.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/X3Lpm3L.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is probably possible to build the game around this simple idea. In a Minecraft like it will be about clever and good looking designs, in a tower defense it is more about what happens when buildings are combined.
nacoz1|Interesting Game Idea|I have they cool idea for a game that just randomly popped into my head for literally no reason.\n\nImagine a post apocalyptic game being marketed as the next big single player story telling game with many groundbreaking features and epic missions. While you play through the game you fight numerous enemies that are hunting you while you are on your quest. They will do almost anything to prevent you from reaching your goal. Your goal is to round up the last of humanity to have a fighting chance to survive the apocalypse.\n\nThe thing the players won’t know when they are playing the game is that all those enemies that they have been disposing of have been actual players that have also bought the game.\n\nThey are all human (the same as the player character) but due to a mind virus that has infected the entire population, they all see each other as hideous violent monsters enabling a reaction in the player’s mind to shoot and kill each other.\n\nThe player does not discover this until the very end of the game, where they realize they have been destroying mankind’s last hope for survival without even realizing it.\n\nIt’s a bit crazy I know, but I just had to get it out of my mind. The game would be initially revealed in one of the announcements to have a multiplayer mode, but it would receive an announcement of it “being delayed or cut”. When in reality it was always there to begin with. \n\nI realize there are probably some legal problems with this such as false advertising, but it’s just an idea.
na99ts|Web Game Idea - Would you play a Cyberpunk text/ui based web game?|Hello guys, just found this sub and wanted to give it a try. I have been trying to research games similar to one I'm creating with another dev but am having trouble finding similar communities. It is a web game in a similar vein to Kingdom of Loathing and Fallen London.  \n\n\n**The idea:** To build a cyberpunk world in a web game using modern web development libraries (React/Node if you are familiar). The game will have quest lines, combat, crafting, skill systems,  eventual player markets, asynchronous multiplayer elements. It will largely be text/ui/image based and combat will be skill/turn based.  \n\n\n**The gameplay hook:** Level your character via combat, grind for levels and items unlocking new skills. Augment your body and unlock new skill paths. Build up your crafting skills, make a fortune, open businesses. Meet interesting NPCs and experience complete storylines in a similar vein to Oblivion/Skyrim contained storylines (Mages Guild/Dark Brotherhood esque, self contained stories that open options outside of their questlines.) New storylines, city districts, skill paths, item types would come out in monthly/serial patches after release.  \n\n\nI appreciate your input as to whether you have played similar games to this and/or would be interested in something like this. Cheers.

na23tr|What Do You Guys Think About This Idea?|  \n\nHello everybody hope you're having a good day, this was a quick draft I came up with last night and I want to hear your feedback. I want to know how to improve this and how you would improve this.\n\n**Story (Basic)**\n\nYou are an innocent civilian who has been kidnapped by a cult and you have to try and escape without getting killed by the demon.\n\n**Story (In-depth)**\n\nYour name is Mark Walterson, you're a 39 year old American male who worked as a trucker for 5 years. One day while doing your job, your truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, so you hop out and try to fix it and then out of nowhere, you are knocked unconscious and kidnapped by a cult. Several hours pass and you finally wake up in a room deep underground with bodies all around you. After looking around you discover the name of the cult that kidnapped you and what they were up to but you also discover what killed the cult members and now that thing is out to get you. You can either try and escape or you can try to banish the demon to ensure that it doesn't hurt anyone/follow you home.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe player will mostly walk around collecting items to aid their escape or fight/defeat the monster. If the player has no means of defending themselves, then they can try to hide in the various hiding spots around the area. \n\n**Mechanics**\n\nMonster: Randomly teleporting to different rooms, Ability to hear noises the player makes\n\nPlayer: Listening through doors to check for the monster, Hiding from the monster, sprinting cause why not

While watching Gnomeo and Juliet with my step-daughter i thought of this.\nTakes place in a backyard/s with factions being different garden gnomes and lawn1 ornaments.\nMechanically clunky battle like dark souls but instead of thematically dark and gritty blood have it upbeat and satirical setting. Could have the characters crack and shatter instead of the usual dismemberment.\nMain focus on exploration like BOTW\nStealth mechanics could include going unnoticed by humans while trying to sabotage the opposing faction\nThoughts?
n9sa73|Discovery Tour by Assassin’s Creed, but as a current-day virtual holiday tool|Hello, so Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey got “Discovery Tour” mode, which are educational fully-explorable open worlds based in the map of the main games. Hostiles, quests and objectives are removed, addition of guided tours to learn about the eras of Ancient Egypt/Greece and an ability to teleport anywhere and explore Egypt/Greece to your leisure without interruption.\n\nEver since Origins’ was released as well as the COVID-19 Pandemic and mass-lockdowns soon after, I am massively surprised at the fact we have no tool to explore other cities and attractions.\n\nA bit of a rundown as to what a “game” like this could entail, imagine you are put somewhere like Tokyo, Japan. The whole city is available to explore and teleport around. Brimming with pedestrians, culture and traffic. You can have a virtual tour of the Shibuya District, the Tokyo Tower or a neat shopping mall. Find little collectibles and souvenirs in hidden spots throughout the city. You can also have a bit of a walk across mount Fuji. All of this in AAA cutting-edge graphics mapped to how it’d look like in real life.\n\nThis framework could be used for virtual time travel and seeing different places in different eras and events. Even entire made-up fantasy world that can express different lore and worldbuilding. Having a walk around Hogwarts or Middle-Earth for instance.\n\nIts a dream of mine, thoughts?

n9ec5g|A Cowboy Bebop game that's a spiritual successor to Oni|This is less of an idea and more of a wet dream but I loved the mix of martial arts and gun play Oni had along with it's anime aesthetic. It seems like a perfect fit for game based on Cowboy Bebop's Spike. Add some ship combat to the mix and it would be perfect open world bounty hunting game.
n9atsq|First stage of Spore... Expanded!|I've always loved the game spore by Maxis. A lot of people like the end game, but for me, I actually enjoyed the first few stages instead. I don't know if it's the creature creation, or the ability to customize/evolve the creature on my own, but I always thought it was really fun and haven't been able to find another game like it. \n\nIf I was to draw inspiration from the game, I'd focus on the first stage (cell stage: 2-D, top-down). With expanded mechanics such as more attack types (excretion of toxins, enzymes, etc), defensive mechanics (flagella for faster swim/"dodge", extra sensors for enemy detection). The game loop would following something like: gather resources to survive (e.g. food), have your colony grow based on available resources, fight neighbouring colonies for their resources. Evolve or acquire more genes (i.e. "abilities") to better gather more resources to invade or defend against other colonies.  \n\nIs this something you would play? Did I miss the mark completely on why spore is so enticing for other players? If you could recreate and expand on one aspect of Spore, what would it be?
n9a856|A Valve Game Crossover|I love video game crossovers. However, my idea is a little complicated. Here's the backstory: A virus is breaking the source code for all main Valve games, and the G-Man realizes how devastating it would be (because he's all-knowing or something), so he travels to different source code games (TF2, DoTA, etc.) to find the strongest and smartest heroes to combat the virus. (I got this idea when I saw a post about a hacker in TF2 pulling Half-Life 2 assets like the G-Man model into a game of MvM)\n\nLink to MvM hacker: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/mf7h6q/well\_this\_happened\_in\_a\_mvm\_match\_he\_picked\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/mf7h6q/well_this_happened_in_a_mvm_match_he_picked_up/)\n\nBut anyways, the game will go throughout each Source game, similar to how JJBA: EOH does with the different parts of the series, with the G-Man recruiting different characters from each game. Each part will have virus fights in a FPS style (because a majority of Valve games are FPS) and then after the fights, G-Man shows up and takes the fighters. I haven't really thought about what happens after G-Man gets the team he needs together, probably have the smart ones locate the virus while the fighters hold off the virus.\n\nThe title will probably be something along the lines of Half-Life 3: Source Breakdown because it starts with Half-Life G-Man and all that jazz, plus the virus breaking down the Valve Source code.\n\nThe first part will be Half-Life, then the second part will be TF2. Tbh i think it would be funny if the Civilian from TF2 Classic makes a cameo.\n\nIf I got any facts wrong, I apologize.

n8xpku|For Horizontal and/ or Vertical Scrolling Shooters (4 out of ? In Game Idea Series)|Alot of the time if ya think about a Scrolling Shooter you've played ya can only shoot in one direction but can move to anywhere on the screen\n\nWell to improve on that there can be 1 of 2 things done that always Scrolling Shooters to break new ground:\n\n1. The simple solution can be to keep movement the same having ship face only one direction when moving with ability to shoot in a 360° radius with mouse/ right thumb stick so ya move while still being able to shoot enemies at the side and behind you\n\n2. For a more hardcore &amp; little more complicated Vertical, Overhead Horizontal, Straight, Horizontal, etc Scrolling Shooter experience ya can have it where say your ship/ dragon/ whatever ya use can go forward &amp; backwards with up/ down (or W &amp; S keys) and can turn ship with left/ right (or A &amp; D Keys) to add a 360° range to not only your shooting but also your movement (with an optional choice to make it where if your ship accidentally hits or goes off screen then it will die losing you one life)

n8rlpa|Recursive game within a game|It would start as a game that contains itself within it. Some games have already done this, like Celeste. But that game would also have itself within it, and so on, with graphics getting slightly worse every time. The hardest levels would require you to go many levels of recursion in, to the point where you are nearly blind.\n\nA slight spinoff of this is a game that requires you to make itself. Play testing the game within a game would be very similar to the normal game, maybe with a little different controls. I imagine a few levels of recursion in, elements would start glitching out, and you would be stuck in this nightmare scape.\n\nWhat do you think? It’s not very fleshed out, but it does seem possible, though maybe tough to make.
n8b0iv|Need suggestions how to simplify building in an automation game.|Hello, we are making a 3d game that is a blend of satisfactory and first person shooter. However, for this game, the building style of satisfactory or factorio is too complex, as we would like it to be focused more on combat and gathering resources. Specifically, we would like to remove the need to manually connect every building by a conveyor belt, which what is we find to be the most tedious/difficult part when building a huge factory. What we have come up so far is to either have a large number of drones that autonomously run between buildings and distribute resources, or make buildings somehow autoconnect to each other. For people that find games like factorio too boring or overwhelming, how would you suggest to simplify the building process so that it would be more fun for you?\n\nThank you for your suggestions!
n8asxi|Another one. (And yes it's a little longer but I'm sure y'all will enjoy it)(3 out of ?)|If you have played an Endless Runner in the past then you'll have realized that Endless Runners aren't really Endless in a way. \n\nTo put it bluntly Endless Runners only goes for as long as you can/ decide to play it for and no matter how far ya are in the Run and want to continue it ya have no choose besides quiting by killing yourself, losing by an obstacle/ enemy or keep going\n\n\n\nSo here's my solution to make Endless Runners truly Endless:\n\nMilestones - Where when ya get to certain points in the ER you can save your run and continue it at another day or time\n\nIf ER games started being built with this while still having Milestones being a toggle-able option to have on/ off (that way ya can still have option to play it in the regular way without milestones whenever ya want as well) then it would bring ER's to new heights making them TRUE Endless Runners since you're grinding across different days/ times to get a highscore as high as ya can whenever ya want)\n\n(And for quality of life ya can adjust settings to pick whether or not the game will ease you back into the run when ya come back or place you right where you were, no matter how fast ya were going/ how crazy things were whenever ya left, and continue from there, etc etc for settings)\n\nTo make the gameplay even more enjoyable ya can have it also be an Action-Endless Runner where ya slash enemies (2 finger swipe) and/ or shoot enemies (tap) while avoiding obstacles (1 finger swipe to move around screen), ability to wall-run infinitely and ability to go back and forth whenever from floor, walls, &amp; roof flipping the camera view everytime ya do that\n\nAnd to prevent it from being a simple move from either roof, walls, or floor it can be like this as well to add a more tactical and free movement way to it:\n\n  _   _   _   _   _\n|                      |\n|                      |             _  _  _\n|                      |           |           |\n|                      |           |           |\n| _   _   _   _   _| or      | _  _  _ |\n\n(Each line represents where ya can move to on screen depending on where you swiped to so basically the walls, roof, and floor all have 3 or 5 spots ya can move to, maybe even have some sections where ya need to be in somewhere in middle/ mid-air not on one of the sides to not get hit by doing a swipe to move from one side to another to be in mid-air)\n\nI know it's long but hope it inspired someone and are willing to pick and choose what to do from this\n\n(I'm going to make my own suggestions a series but this one is the only one I think that was super long)

n88pzd|Turn based combat with a network based movement system|Most games with turn based combat use one of two systems to track positioning.  Either movement takes place on a grid, like chess, checkers, dnd, fire emblem, or they don't deal with movement at all in combat, although sometimes they still use positioning.  Earthbound makes a distinction between upper and lower rows of enemies while persona can make you start a battle face to face or surrounded by enemies. \n\nI'd like to see a game which uses a graph like thise used in graph theory.  Battle maps would look something like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/bh4oGQw4h8ZSRA248).  Along with you're normal action which you use to attack, use an item, cast magic, or whatever is in your system, you can also move. \n\nOf course, what this mechanic would do depends entirely on the mechanics of the game you're making, but here are some ideas basic ideas.\n\n* Melee attacks only work when you share a node with your enemy.\n\n* Ranged attacks work best a certain number of edges away, how many depends on the weapon. \n\n* When there are two more players on a node than enemies, you are given a considerable advantage on that node.\n\n* AOEs effect everyone on a node, regardless of side.\n\n* Edges can be blocked by either side.  Alternatively, either side can stop an enemy from retreating by continuously attacking them. \n\n* You can only heal or use an item on someone sharing a node.\n\n* Retreating is easier n edges away.\n\n* Knockback. \n\n* Passive buffs and debuffs only work n edges away.\n\n* Status effects that impede movement.
n84yfy|Titanfall 3|I know that this would be a sequel to titanfall 2, but ea does not give a damm about this series. For the campaign, I would make the main storyline about cooper trying to refind bt, but you would also have side stories, like battlefields war stories, telling the views of all the factions.\n\nFor multiplayer I would not change Much. I would make it so that there are more Titans in the game, and more powerful customization (ex: viper jets for North Star). Also would make a vanguard class titan that would be like Titans from titanfall 1. Also would add more weapons and unique tacticals.\n\nThere are more things, but I would like to ceap it short. Tell me your ideas in the comets.
n83b4p|Katamari damacy but it's competitive MP and also when you get rolled by a bigger player you keep playing as a orbiting cannon shooting out the crap you rolled to disturb other players and help out your devourer|Ideally played with a large amount of players, game keeps popping in new crap to roll so the level doesn't empty out.\n\nProbably too big of a game to execute considering it'd rely on both physics and MP with a lot of players. \n\nLastly you don't need to be a cannon specifically when you get rolled in, just something that keeps you playing while also shifting the game from competitive every man for himself to competitive team play.
n81pvd|A survival game set in a constantly changing world|As a heads up, I am unsure of the exact rating for this idea, and it might be best under the "Experienced" flair. Depends on how advanced the graphics and actual gameplay are, I suppose.\n\nThe basic story would be that your colony ship crash-landed on this planet, and you and the other survivors need to survive in a building made within the radius of your ship. The next day, everything outside of the radius of your ship has changed. Maybe the planet is an ever-changing space entity, maybe it just phases through alternate versions of itself every day. Either way, the map changes regularly. The ship could resist changes due to it being made of material not from this planet, or maybe another explanation that wouldn't be questioned.\n\nThere would be a separate chance for things outside the radius of the crashed ship to change, and the farther away from the ship the thing is, the more likely it is to change. For instance, the forest immediately around your ship will either stay the same or maybe the types of trees will spontaneously change, while a mile away from the ship, an entire mountain range could disappear overnight. Stockpiled items would also not be safe from this, so a few of your wooden logs might disappear or even change into steel or gold, depending on how far from the ship they are. \n\nThis would apply to sentient NPCs as well, so you should get all of your colonists as close as possible to the ship before night falls. If an NPC gets caught out at night, they will change. Some will have minor changes, such as a different gender, name, or a different set of skills. Others will have major changes, such as turning into an animal or becoming hostile, or even an alien creature. These changes could happen to hostile NPCs as well, such as a hostile person becoming friendly and an alien changing into a human.\n\nThe end goal could either be to survive long enough to be rescued, or thrive enough to build your own ship, or even just have an endless game where you see how long your colony can survive.

It is controlled similar to the Arkham Games, and Batman can punch, glide, grapple and use Batarangs, as well as a Batmobile, Batwing and Batboat.\n\n2nd game: Michael Keaton's Batman joins forces with the late Christopher Reeves' Superman, in a ploy to stop Lex Luthor and Poison Ivy from taking over America. Gameplay switches between Batman and Superman, the latter of which can fly, use laser eyes and ice breath, and see through walls.\n\n3rd game: Batman, Superman, Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman and John Wesley Shipp's Flash team up to stop the Brainiac from invading Earth. Wonder Woman can deflect bullets back at attackers, and use the Lasso of Truth to scale buildings and pull enemies down, and Flash can slow down time to run and deliver powerful electric pulses.\n\nThese games create a shared universe from 4 separate properties, and have costumes and framing similar to if they had been filmed in the late 80s / early 90s.

n7ue9n|An idea for a game mechanic based on how you precieve certain characters|You know how sometimes in a game, the main character might percieve a character differently than how you percieve it? For example, a game could frame a certain character as annoying while the player themselves may view them as charming.\n\nSo, I was thinking. What if certain games could have a dialogue system in place that changes what you think of certain characters? You could think of them as attractive, charming, or just a generally good person, or you could think of them as annoying, deplorable, and generally a bad person.\n\nSome of these options wouldn't be available depending on the character, such as;\n\n\- You can sympathize with villians, but you can't idolize them or look at them generally positively\n\n\- You can't think of characters that aren't human(iod), aren't above 18, and/or don't have the intellegence to consent as "attractive" nor can you view certain characters as attractive if it would be jarring, disturbing, or immersion breaking\n\nWhat do you think?
n7tirq|An action sci fi game that explores the native life inside of Jupiter|Feel free to use this idea. The game revolves around hypothetical life inside of Jupiter. \n\nThe dominant life form on Jupiter are floating jellyfish-like organisms called the Gejurotixm. They are intelligent, have a language, and spawn these big bubble-like structures that function as floating cities.   As photosynthetic organisms, they need to spend some time up high (but not too high) to gather sunlight, as well as the radiation from space.  These organisms are about 4 feet tall, and are relatively peaceful with other members of their species.  They are chemovores, in that they consume chemical compounds from the air for food.\n\nEnemies:  There are also savage creatures that the Gejurotixm must contend with. The Mwsouti are manta ray type organisms that hunt and kill the Gejurotxim for food.  Qspikazb are winged centipede-like beings that will attack just about anything, including each other.  Thopsidleh are hovering orange blobs that spit a corrosive substance.  The Lopoodo are unpredictable wormlike beings that rapidly evolved from viruses on a probe from Earth that was sent into Jupiter’s atmosphere, making them semi-earthlings and the only aliens in the game.  There are others too.\n\nThe protagonist: You are a Gejurotxim warrior guardian. Your mission to to defend your kind against the many threats of Jupiter.  Sometimes, you will be defending cities or Gejurotxim expeditions on their resource gathering operations down below.  Other times, you will go on search and destroy missions.  Sometimes, you will be patrolling, and may even need to deal with criminal Gejurotxim that pirate chemical compounds from peaceful cities.\n\nLife:  You have both hit points and energy points. You lose hit points when you are attacked, and you gradually lose energy when you go down below the point where light can be absorbed.  When either meter reaches 0, you’re dead.  You suffer damage when you fly too low or too high.  Hit points can only be recovered by entering a city and joining your tentacled with another of your species.  They heal each other through the process of Cntiyidal.\n\nExperience and levels:  Your gain experience by killing enemies and completing missions.  As you go up in levels, you acquire hit points, energy points, stronger attacks, and more combat moves.\n\nCombat capabilities:  Your primary attack is a tentacle lash, which whips enemies.  Later, you can spit acid, strangle, encapsulate and devour, lay corrosive spores, shoot sharp spines, impale, etc.\n\nMusic and sound effects:  The “music” should sound like the sound effects from the movie “Forbidden Planet”: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSrf-htPbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSrf-htPbk). None of the music or sound effects should resemble anything human.  The music should be more mild in a safe layer of the atmosphere, and harsher sounding as you travel into more dangerous zones that are to high or too low.  Speech should sound like bizarre garbled sounds, with the text of what they’re saying at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe game is almost total action with little story, aside from tidbits that you pick up from talking with other Gejurotxim.  It’s open world and endless. You can save your game when you’re done playing. The map constantly changes, since Jupiter is a gas giant.\n\nMultiplayer: Players can play as groups by logging on to the server and joining games together.  There are also tournaments and death matches where players can fight with each other.\n\nFeel free to contribute to this idea, or to use it.
n7qjm7|Feedback on Plattformer/Roguelite/Tower Defense Idea|I have this idea that i want to work on, but i'm not sure if it would be worth the time. So i want to hear your feedback\n\nThe idea is relativly simple:\n\nIt would controls like a typical 2D plattformer from the 8/16bit era with the added feature of simple melee combat. One would then be placed inside a proceduraly generated level, filled with enemies and treasure and the in the middle the exit, and then have a certain amount of time to collect money, upgrades and towers.\n\nOnce the time is up the tower defense parts comes in, as then hordes of enemy swarm in to destroy the exit and you defend it with your towers, while you're still plattforming. If it's destroyd it's game over. At the end of the wave a boss comes and after he is defeated you move on to the next stage.\n\nTldr. Jump and run with procedural levels, where you collect items to later defend yourself from hords of enemy
n7lgat|Bookmaking game|Hi everyone,\n\nI don't know any game where you play as a bookmaker, taking bets and choosing odds on matches/competitions.\n\nIn my mind, I'd mix it with a sci-fi theme. You've been entrusted with a portfolio of racing games of a distant off-world by a mafia boss. Each week, he is expecting you to pay tribute. The more you make money and pay within the deadline, the more he trusts you, the more your portfolio grows. From one planet, you get a system, then two, etc.\n\nEach new planet brings its share of new competitors and circuits, this way the mechanics are added at the speed the player understand the game mechanics.\n\nBefore each race, you have a screen with the information on each contestants: his speed, health, stamina... but also his popularity. Some information are hidden, and you have to "buy" them if you think they will have an impact on the upcoming race.\n\nOnce you reviewed the info of each racer, you can now see the circuit on wich they will be running. You can bribe the referee or place traps on the circuit (that you have to buy). Then, you can try to sabotage/enhance some concurrents, by offering them "gifts".\n\nFinally, just before the race begins, you have to place the odds on each racer. If it's not interesting enough, not a lot of people will place bet. You'll have to leverage your previous mischiefs to gain money. People will bet because they like a contestant, or just because it seems the more likely to win.  Be careful in your actions, because the more you try to influence the race, the more there is a chance the trust in the race fell, and less people place bets.\n\nThe moment the race takes place, you're mostly a spectator, crossing fingers for your plan to succeed.\n\nI like the idea so much I've started working on it.
n7kdm5|Superhero Game idea|Hey everyone, I’m new here and this idea is one that’s been on my mind for a minute. A game where you are placed in a random area, as a character from that world. You can have different ways/opportunities to find out a super power and become a superhero. grow from a rookie hero to a powerful cosmic superhero. There would be villains for each tier of hero who all have different agendas and schemes. I realize that this idea would take a lot of effort and but it would be fun.
n7joyx|If you were to create a Pokémon, what would you focus on?|I’m not sure it makes sense but I’m debating whether aesthetics take priority over (competitive) usefulness . I am creating my project and while developing I am at a crossroads of design philosophy to take.\n\nWhat would you recommend? I’m curious to kind of see how everyone would Armchair CEO?\n\n\nPersonally having played Pokémon for the competition, anything and everything will have tiers (Top to worst). However why create a bunch of different creatures (and thus risk getting dud designs) when I can say, hit a bunch of archetypes? But I am not a fool and know that Pokémon didn’t become the cultural giant without the aesthetics. Not to gush, some designs are the best of the best. Instantly recognizable to a large majority of the population. So this kind of puts me at a crossroads
n7fbuf|a game idea i had that i wish was a real game| ok so i wish there was a star wars game like cod (call of duty) where you would be able to customize you blasters and armor and skill traits and there are different eras you can play as also instead of zombies it could be invasion where it is a droids or pirates,etc and for multiplayer it is like battlefront but it is clones vs droid or rebels vs storm troopers and there would be different game modes and there was different eras in star wars history where its not just battles there is a story line in the campaign and there is depth to the star wars fps games
ngjkvj|Some help with characters with my story interactive fighting game|Due to covid, me and a few people had to stop working on this game idea, but trying to get back on track with it. It was very slow for the past few months, so hopefully all goes well.\n\nThis project is focuses on horror/sci-fi and dark fantasy elements.\n\nBetween the character choices, which ones seem like the best idea?\n\nA snake/gorgon like creature created experiment? Or a female reptilian humanoid fighter experiment that is similar to the predator?\n\nA viking frost giant that controls ice? Or a slender tall ice creature that resembles a wendigo monster?\n\nA supernatural firefighter consumed with fire? Or a fire breathing/dancing female acrobat clown?\n\nA secret tribal Amazonian vampire woman? Or an old Victorian aristocrat vampire woman?\n\nAn ancient Chinese terracotta statue that possesses sand powers? Or an ancient Greek statue that possesses sand powers?\n\nThanks again for anyones input.
nggymw|Endless runner game idea|Hi I'm new to game development. I wanna create my first game. I have an rough idea abt using accelerometer for navigation instead of swipe. Plz suggest me some themes for this.
nge2dx|Skin of our teeth|sorry if this was mentioned before. I love zombies and roguelikes but don't have the time to actually learn all the skills to create my own. will lend my voice to whoever decides to make this thing though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZombie low poly co-op fps roguelike. PermaDeath, Item unlocks. Characters to unlock. Very gritty/dark atmosphere. Ambient sounds/music. Randomly Generated building layout. Multiple building types as the levels. An apartment complex, Hospital, Asylum, Prison, any big building that would be easy to generate randomly. Keep weapons simple but plentiful. No bosses but zombies react to the amount of noise made. Has to be a headshot to kill. possible body dismemberment to help slow down if no ammo/low ammo. Zombies can grab. if grabbed you have a chance to escape once. if grabbed near multiple zombies instant death. No revives when dead. Maps are chosen at random. able to barricade doors using furniture to cover flanks. NO UI being a one-hit death. Ammo check is in-game animation. no mini-map. a journal you can pull out to read notes that can be found. the journal can be used to also check found equipment. Escaping the building alive leads to the next area. Friendly Fire always on.\n\nTLDR (think RE SURVIVOR but as an actual FPS/roguelike with co-op)
ngbrq2|My prediction for the next big hit (it most likely isn't). Please add your ideas.|In my humble opinion, I think If someone could create a game that's simple, and easily-modded. It needs to be multiplayer, I suppose among us perfected the formula in terms of lobby size (10). Make it heavily rely on communication. That way the gameplay changes depending on the players. Procedural content would be awesome; If you have anything to add, please feel free to post a comment :)
ng8bhs|An aim trainer for console|I mean... there’s literally no competition on the market at all. I don’t know how to make games for anything I just feel like this would be easy money. Anyone that’s wants to train their aim would only have one choice, which would be your game.
ng88c7|Cannibal Islands!|Hey everyone, this is my first post about an Idea I had a few days ago. \n\nI will post my story and my thought process in the end, so you guys can read why you are here. \n\nImagine the following: \n\nThere are two relatively close Islands in a tropical environment. Both Islands are inhabited by the  indigenous tribes. Lets call them Rubys and Sapphires. Both tribes live on their respective island and try to find food, water and shelter. Life is hard on these Islands, but it is manageable. Especially when you work together with the rest of your tribe. \n\nThe real threat is coming from the other tribe. Every now and then Rubys and Sapphires are crossing the border and invade the other tribe. The are not trying to steal food, or special items or something.\n\nRubys and Sapphires are invading the other Island to Hunt, Kill and Eat the other tribe! \n\nDoing so will make your character mutate into a better form. How the food is prepared will change the effect on you.\n\nIf you eat it raw, it will make you super strong. Making you strong enough to charge through walls and buildings and being able to take down whole villages by yourself.\n\nCooking the meat on a fire will unlock your  cognitive abilities. Crafting some weapons, or a better fireplace, or some defensive structures. \n\n(Here is some extra room for people eating something like rotten meat, or special parts of the body or something like this. Maybe they will have better night vision, or can hear bare footsteps way ahead of all the others.)\n\nYou need to eat quite some Meat for the mutation to kick in, but your advantages are massive. Also the effect will fade away if you cannot provide more meat for you mutation. So without more food, you will turn into your normal, basic form after time.\n\nThis will be a survival Game with a little twist. Instead of players just wandering around and killing everything that moves just for the lols, they have to work as a team to reach the goal of being the dominant tribe and reaching the 100% Mutation.\n\nThis Idea was inspired by the survival Game "The Isle" or to be more specific This Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7JzmEf-\_c&amp;t=1836s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7JzmEf-_c&amp;t=1836s) made by SovietWomble. Survival games have been pretty much the same for the last 10 years. Its either DayZ, Minecraft, Rust (DayZ Epoch) or a BR like PUBG. And I try to change the format a little bit.\n\nWhat the game should be when it is finished:\n\n\- You choose Rubys or Sapphires\n\n\- You spawn somewhere on your island\n\n\- You need to find food, water and maybe some special fruits for your health\n\n\- In order to take your character into a better stage, you need to hunt, kill and eat the other team. \n\n\- The way you prepare and eat the meat will decide how the mutation changes. \n\n\- Your Tribe needs different kind of people, some Strong mutants, some smart mutants and whatever class you might think of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats the bare Idea behind the game i made up and might never come to live.\n\nThanks for reading :)
ng6byd|Spark of Life|The game starts where you're basically looking forward, and can't turn your head. You're being driven through a storm. There's a bright flash, and everything goes dark. Your vision returns slowly, like a static ridden TV. You look around to see the truck you were on driving out of view, and a few robots and parts scattered around you. This is where the game begins.\n\nYou're a robot given autonomy by a bolt of lightning. You need to find refuge, but as a very rare anomaly, you will be hunted by the humans wherever you go, as soon as they figure out you're alive. You can pass yourself off as lifeless by never turning your head, and moving at the same time. This will work for a some time.\n\nYou need to find information on a rumored autonomous underground where humans and robots live as equals. You get this info by scavenging, and asking humans that are sympathetic to your plight. Remember, robots don't ask questions like this. If the human isn't friendly, it will out you immediately. If you manage to kill humans, they might drop anything from money to batteries (for energy using parts, not you), keycards, or possibly info you need to progress.\n\nAs the only autonomous robot you're aware of, that makes others controlled by the humans hunting you. They are almost all your enemies, until you start getting closer to the underground. Destroying robots, and anything electronic drops parts, some useful upgrades and new abilities, some totally pointless, or aesthetic. The stronger you are, the easier you get noticed... but the easier you'll survive an encounter.\n\nLastly, you're a modern bot, made with modern materials. You can't rust. If you're heading into human populated areas, you're going to want to wash off the... uh... red stuff... Trust me, they'll notice...
nfyjtb|Dangerous Streets (Redux)|Dangerous Streets was once a crappy Street Fighter rip-off in the 90's produced by an Italian studio mainly for the Amiga system (it's even included as a pack-in with the infamous Amiga CD-32). I noticed a very beautiful opportunity with it's main aesthetic, 90's Nightclubs.\n\nI believe it would be a great Killer Instinct-style game. Either based on the original arcade game or the 2016 Reboot. The nightclub scenery, combined with a house music soundtrack akin to Black Orchid's theme from the KI games, and the zaniest characters ever conceived for fighting games. It surely is a lively and nostalgic experience!
nfv30x|Open world character collecting fighting game| You collect and trade characters and maps. The maps are open world and fully explorable. The story is just to explain why they're all together, it's never fully explored. The character and maps are all stored on the cards and the game itself is mostly to display the information stored on the cards so that you can continue to add more maps and characters. I know this is an ambitious large game and gathering the rights to so many characters is nothing but a dream.\n\nStory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins by opening to a few characters acting normal before vanishing.\n\nFor example, superman is protecting a city and vanishes while holding a car, then it\n\nopens to few other characters and ends the same way. After we see this 2 or 3 times we see a shot\n\nof a large group of characters all confused, maybe some from the same series next to each other, \n\nfor example, Ben 10 can stand next to ben 10 omniverse who booth appear as they do in the show.\n\nThis isn't limited to heroes but villains as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe then hear a loud demand for silence and the screen pans to several extremely strong\n\nvillains who have been the cause for cross-over stories in the past, or just has god-like powers.\n\nFor example "teen titans" and "teen titans go" Trigon was the result of their worlds colliding, \n\nand Bill cipher from "Gravity Falls" just has god-like powers. They will explain that everyone\n\nthere is for an ultimate test of strength. No one will permanently die from the damage they recieve\n\nand can go all out. Some are also shrunk (specific massive characters like kaiju and giant robots)\n\nfor a fair assessment. Their worlds are all on pause and no one will remember anything when it's all\n\nover with. If you want to leave, fight. Characters all poof into arenas across from another opponent and begin to battle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCards\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of each card says has the games logo in the art style of whatever series\n\nthe character is from. The characters art takes up half of the card, full NAME displayed\n\nin the middle, for example, Spidermans will say "peter parker" or "mile morales"\n\ndepending on who they are, And in the corner a symbol indicating what type of fighter it \n\nis, and under the name is a brief backstory description. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBattle field cards are sideways to show off more art, an indicator in the corner for how large the field is, and a name on top. The unique aspect with battlefield cards some stand-alone\n\nand don't have fighting counterparts. For example, the Simpsons doesn't have any characters that can really fight, but Springfield can be an entire map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngameplay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMovesets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can freely edit your character's move set to how you want to play. Every character will have move set already picked, but in the character editor you can find even more moves\n\nnot yet active AND you can freely place them on any button. For example, if you so chose you can set "up" and "down" to attack and "left" and "right" as "jump" and "down". Every character is limited to what their continuity has access to. For example, young Ben 10 can NOT be goop. The only type of characters limited to this are "collectors" such as Chaotic, or pokemon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinals\n\nHow finals are used is totally dependant on the character's lore and they are also swappable.\n\nSome abilities need to charge before use, some can be used right away, some are a massive \n\nfinal attack, some are a form change that's either permanent or brief (add character examples later)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntroductions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow your character shows up is very dependant on lore. For example code Lyoko characters would reconstruct above the ground, superman would fly in, sailor moon would transform. And after\n\nthe character does their unique intro above them is their title in the series art style.\n\nFor example above peter parker is "Spider-Man" and characters with more than 1 title leaves\n\nit up to the player. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCostumes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll costumes are unlocked right away for owner's customization. Characters who have different\n\nart styles seasons or games but are essentially the same exact characters have their own costumes.\n\nFor example "American Dragon" has 2 styles each being their own costume, and Mario has various costumes\n\nacross games all with their own representation such as 8bit or tanuki Mario.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaps\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuilding and object in maps are destroyable and even have obstacles or enemies and you have the option to turn off all 3. Map size various and can even be restrictive. For example a large city or a tight enclosed building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nelements\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFire, cold, and wet will affect some characters more than others. If a character doesn't do well in the cold\n\nit may take more damage in a cold map, if a character is made of fire it will take more damage when another uses a water attack. This is minimal though\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nclasses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just a character classification for how they fight to give the player an idea before using it. Players\n\ncan build a preference for class and collect specific players that better fit their fighting style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiverse- A diverse player doesn't have the option to change out movsets, but instead characters. Chaotic, pokemon trainers or even single characters like ben 10 will have various characters to choose from. You can swap them mid-battle and their movesets are all pre-set. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStealth- stealth characters may not be very good hand to hand. Characters like Aiden Pierce can use gadgets to fight from afar or trick other players. Stealth characters can deal a lot of damage, but also take a lot of damage fast. Some can go as far as to turn invisible, but that can also be countered by other moves/gadgets or even finals. \n\nWarrior- Warrior characters have very few long-range attacks. Most of their attacks are either various close-range weapons/attacks or very weak and minimum choice of long-range attacks such as arrows. For example, Link from the legend of zelda will have bombs, a bow and arrow, and various other long-range attacks, but he deals more damage up close with hammers and swords. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShooter- Shooters have very minimum close-range attacks but will always have a very wide arsenal of long-range weapons. They also have the option of being played in the first or third person. Critical attacks are also a unique ability that lets them hit characters in the head for extra damage, but the downside is if the opponent's attacks happen to hit you in the head it is also extra damage. The character plays like a typical shooter and the move set is to swap out weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpellcaster- Spellcasters use various spells either to boost their own abilities, attack, or defend. A lot of their attacks have hot, cold, or wet after effects, and spellcasters can be closed or long-range attacks. For example, Natsu from "fairy tail" has plenty of fire-breathing attacks, but also boosts his own punches and can attack up close. The only downside is their attacks are usually slow as they have to announce or read them. For example, Natsu has to yell "FIRE DRAGON-" as he inhales and shouts "ROAR" as he attacks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRPG- These characters are intended to be played around with. They have various close and long-ranged attacks that its hard to guess how they're built. For example, DragonBorn can come out with bows, weapons, or spells. There will be a choice to choose whether to boost the characters rang, spells, or close-range attacks and a few costumes that represent each type, but doesn't not have to match the boost.
nftll5|Ghost and a victim. Need help to expand my story.|Ok tittle is not good. But this is my first time of creating some text based adventure game. I had a little idea of game. There were 2 characters ``ghost`` and ``victim/target/boy``\n\n if we play as a ghost our main goal will be to make stay victim/boy, i thought there will be some kind time in which before that time ghost doesn't have a much power to directly kill him or maybe ghost can't do that. The victim/boy will hardly try to get out of there by making some tricky conversation but we need to make him stay anyhow. For ex if he ask for a glass of water and if we go to kitchen he will will run way or something like that and we will lose. \n\nAnd if we play as a boy we play as reverse. Story begin as like this we woke up on a unknown house. We don't how and why we came there and we found there is a lady on a house whose is trying to kill us. Later on we found that there is a time. We need to escape ahead of that time cause she will become more powerful and we will have less time to escape.\n\nSo later on i thought it will be difficult to make character choose able. That's why i need to make only one character playable. I don't know which should i make. I need help of creating some interesting story. Not that much complex cuz before this i had never wrote a story game.\n\nHere i need a story which tells how and why the boy came or we went there, what is the time on which before that time ghost can't kill us or we can't kill. Story need to explain why is that happens.\n\nThat's my basic idea for this game. I know it's ridiculous but this is first game story. It will be just a text adventure game not any graphics.

nffooq|A fighting game where you try to pull off the flashiest moves possible|Quick question: would any of you play a fighting game in which you try to pull off the flashiest moves possible to win? This idea came to me from some games I've been playing recently: Sunset overdrive and the first injustice game. So why not combine the two? After all, you can never make something completely original, but you can always make something fresh.
nfef16|A 'Cthulu' In Space.| GAME IDEA #4,915.\n\nYou and your motley crew of flesh clumps (maybe 5 others) are stranded on a water planet that has one spaceport connected to one city on the only landmass on the entire world.\n\nYou are heavily armed, and heavily armored, with gadgets on top of gadgets that you can spread out and use amongst yourselves to support one and another.\n\nThe Goal - Gather Parts you need that are spread out across the landmass and City, hidden in areas that need power, security authorization and perhaps some climbing to get into, so you can escape what is happening.  But things break, and bullets are scarce.  Rearming is few and far between and replacing your armor is also slim.  There is no -food- or -drink- meter, but there are Environmental effects, like Radiation and Fire that you will have to contend with.  Thankfully clubs and items of the stability kind don’t shatter like your some blonde mute starring at a broken sword after three wacks, so melee is a viable defense against your foes.\n\nAlso, the Foe(s) you should avoid or fight as sparingly as possible?  Lovecraftian Horrors in the form of two factions, the Old Ones and the Elder Things who are waging a ceaseless bloody war against each other with swarms of lesser critters that rip each other apart to hulking nightmares that could take a small nuke to the face and you would only clear its sinuses.  Neither side takes notice of you and your gang of shooty-bang-bangs unless you are the only ones left in the area or make yourself into a threat they would have to contend with.\n\nThere is no diplomacy.  No communications.  No Rhyme or Reason for what they do.  You and your lot are in a Battleground of Maddening Things that are Blood Drunk for little else other than Slaughter.  They are fighting a war that has Consumed Stars and Shattered Worlds.  All you and those screaming ninnies on your Discord can do is Escape.  Because you can fight all you want, they never stop coming, and they will hound after you until they are dead, or you are.\n\nThe Mechanics would be a sci-fi, 3rd person shooter on an open world, wherein you customize your rambling bag of bones and squishy bits.  You can shoot, stab, and swear vehemently at the twisted husks we call ‘bad guys' in order to win.  You not only have to defend your only means of escape, but you have to set out and seek resources (bullets, med-kits, and go-go-juice or fuel if you want to be pedantic).  Every location is different, and what you need is randomly placed throughout the City.  You die, you lose equipment, resources, and time, spawning back on the ship like a newborn babe, though you get clothes, and don’t have to worry about missing mom at elementary school, or those awkward teen years.\n\nOver time, (and completing a certain threshold of repairs) the presence of said ‘bad guys’ escalated, making forays into the City more difficult than before. The Two AI's are engaging each other like a Real-Time Strategy Game, dispatching units to secure objectives only they could conceive in the effort to remove all other opposition from the map, which is the enemy AI and then YOU in that order.  You, technically, don't want either side to win, instead, you are looking to escape by repairing a down starship and evacuating the Planet because there is no rescue coming.  No one knows what in the name of Bob the Builder is going on, so yeah, you are it.\n\nHowever, as you progress and slay Old Ones and Elder Things, they will start to take notice of you and send forces out to hunt you down and harass the downed spaceship.  Edging the War in Favor of the OTHER side to keep it balanced will keep both sides focusing on the other.  You can do that edging by shooting, stabbing, or sabotaging one side or the other, you just don’t want to garner too much attention in the process.\n\nYou also don't want either side to win completely, not before you are ready to go.  Because once one side has shoved their enemy off the World?  They will be free to wreak full havoc on anything left, and some of those Hulking Nightmares cannot be killed by MORTAL means.\n\nThat anything is YOU, and you are VERY Mortal.\n\nRandomizing objectives for the player, as well as adding lore pieces and exotic weapon types and peppering them across the map would entice players to replay the game.\n\nAlso having a combat system that would allow those crazed, psychotic maniacs who like to hold the line against huge waves of lesser enemies with little more than a dane axe and a colorful vocabulary would help as well.\n\n(NOTE - I have Lore written for this somewhere, I swear.)
nfdab8|Ranged Tank|Some of you will agree, some disagree, but mostly this post is here so maybe someone can use it as an inspiration or to discuss this topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, personally, don't find the concept of a ranged tank that hard. Instead of keeping the enmy close and soak up all the damage while the DPS picks 'em off and the healer keeps everyone alive, the ranged tank would keep the mob at bay while the DPS picks 'em off, or anyone that comes through, while the healer keeps everyone alive.\n\nThe damage soaking part comes in with big mobs and/or enemies with ranged attacks.\n\nI imagine them as short- to mid-range, with focus on AoEs, stun- and knock-back attacks. The ranged tank would have to stack buffs for more powerful attacks to keep the enemy at range as long as possible. The attacks are fast enough to keep multible enemies at bay, but slow enough for it to be challenging. Of course, this type of tank would be way less mobile than DPS or even healers.\n\nSuch a tank could be a battle mage with powerful ranged attacks and shield spells, or just some person who ripped a Balliste straight off the wheels and wields it BFG-9000 style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?
nfd8k0|Political RPG|I'm sure this has been done before by like Paradox or similar. RPG where you create a charachter, with stats and skills, and gather stuff/level up etc, except instead of the focus being on fighting, 100% of the interactions have to do with politics.\n\nLike, you start out as a councilor in some small town. Your quests have to do with proposing rules and getting people to vote for your legislation. When you level up, you move on to being a politician in a higher tier, until eventually you're the president/prime minister/ emporer.\n\nThe skills would all be very gamified, and the stats would have something to do with your appeal to different people with different ideologies. There would be some simple procedural quests and a main quest line that is scripted. Individual "encounters" would be stuff like meetings with lobbyists, votes, town meetings, etc.\n\nYou can get NPCs to join your "party", and in this case it is literally your political party. Probably the main view would be a map with encounters occurring in little models of parliament halls, town council buildings, etc.
nfcw6y|Mortal Engines|This movie gave me a neat and outlandish game idea.  \n\nYou start off in the bleak and open world as a very small campsite attached to a tracked vehicle.  You're quite quick but you have very little in the way of defenses.  You must keep mobile in this world because of the hostile world around you\n\nThe world is full of minerals and materials that you need to mine to grow your city.  Mining minerals and resources helps you to upgrade various components on your vehicle. \n\nYou can upgrade:\n\n- mining equipment to mine faster\n\n- engine to move faster\n\n- different chassis to build different platform (tracked wheels, arachnid legs, hovercraft, all have pros/cons)\n\n- defense systems (shields, laser defense) \n\n- offensive systems: a harpoon that allows you to skillshot and hook other players to slow them down, an auger that allows you to "mine" other playercities to absorb them in a very violent manner. This is the urgot experience.  General weaponry\n\n- surveillance - air balloons, primitive planes, etc to observe the world around you (find resources, find other players, etc)\n\n\n\nThe bigger you get, the bulkier you are and generally slower you are. You also become a primary target for enemy players larger than you.\n\n\nThere would be various playstyles available-  pirate/mercenary who strictly hunts other playercities,  fast and small cities who are able to mine smaller patches quickly,  large lumbering giants with very strong defense systems but would need to stay near large resources to sustain themselves.\n\n\nResources are used to repair and refuel your city. If you run out of fuel you can't move and become a target - you'll have to downsize your playercity by selling components you've built to move.\n\nIf you die you start over.\n\n\nYou can build outposts and temporary structures that offer various benefit, but due to the violent world these are rarely permanent and are often destroyed.  The native life on this world are slow tremors-style worms that will attack structures and cities that remain still for too long. \n\n\n\nBalance wise, you start off small with little resources. you're quick and evasive so you stand a chance at surviving but also generally you would not offer a lot of resources for enemy players who would be looking to harvest you.

neyqd0|Ideas for quick 3d plane game, easily expandable to bigger game|I came up with a really fun 3d plane controller, really fun to maneuver around with. I just can't come up with a game to go with it, preferably something simple but easily expandable. My controller is a camera that follows a really maneuverable jet that is easy to do fun tricks with, its really smooth, so if anybody has any ideas to go with it lmk.
neymp9|Zombie FPS|A game where you live in a dystopian world. Russia and the U.S. teamed up against a force that caused mass genocides. Russia and the United States lost, so many weapons in the game are Russian and American. You can raid houses, run into others in multiplayer, and fight enemies. You can customize your character to look like anything.
nexeju|Cooperative Vehicular Combat Game where the tracks do circles around giant bosses.|Sometimes I have weird dreams. Sometimes those weird dreams make for good game ideas.\n\nSo for this particular fever dream I envisioned a multiplayer boss battle arena where players were all in go-kart like vehicles armed with a variety of weapons. The goal was to kill the boss at the center of the track. Players had to alternate between driving like madmen to get out of the range of attacks to doing high flying stunts to hit high-up weak points to unloading their stored power into the boss' back while their attention was elsewhere.\n\nThis concept could also be expanded to tracks where you race alongside the boss like the ending of Jax andd Daxter 3. Also you could have another player be the boss of asymmetrical PvP.\n\nDrivers could gain temporary damage multipliers by driving through boost rings or doing tricks, so fast and skillful driving resulted in higher DPS. Vehicles had pretty tight handling compared to most driving games so they could quickly face their vehicle towards the boss and unload with front-facing weapons instead of their weaker multi-directional ones. Vehicles also had jumps and hovers to make use of vertical layers of tracks and to get themselves off of damaging floors.\n\nGenerally being in front of the boss is dangerous so one player could try to distract them while the others shoot them from behind. Bosses could also summon minions or create traps that would have to be dealt with so the track didn't get too cluttered.\n\nAccording to my subconscious this game was Sonic Baobao, a Japanese arcade exclusive that was later emulated and took the internet by storm. So you might want to look at procuring the rights from SEGA for maximum authenticity to my dream.

new5qe|Player Quest: A World Run By Players|Excuse this for being really long, I just had a lot of ideas. Also if there's a game similar to this please tell me because I would like to play it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nIn the world of Player Quest, everything is run by the players. The player can fully customize their character to look however they want, there could be different races idk if you want you can add that I guess. Every player starts off in The Hub, a city and commonplace protected by city guards, in the center of the world. There they are given their training and then set off into the world to explore dungeons, fight bandits, and forge their name in history. Each player is given standard gear and a memory shard, which allows them to view visions of the past in dungeons.\n\nPlayers gain a reputation from the King and Queen by completing quests. The more reputation you have the cheaper items will be to buy from NPCs and you can sell items for a higher price to them too, but only for NPCs. This obviously grants you more reputation to buy better gear, new pets, mounts, or homes/bases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Visually**\n\nVisually I'm not picturing this game to be realistic. I think something more cartoonish and outlandish would work great for this. The environment, NPCs, dungeons, and enemies can all be really unique. I'm feeling like something like Breath of the Wild or Wind Waker type of cartoonish graphics would work well for this game. Idk that's just how I would make the game.\n\n**Fast Travel**\n\nThere is a very limited fast travel system. To fast travel you must sacrifice an item you are currently holding, and the value of that item depends on the distance you are fast traveling. For example, if you want to fast-travel to a nearby location you would give up something minor like a healing potion or something. But if you want to fast-travel halfway across the map you would have to give up a much more valuable item. The reason for fast travel is that the wilds are very dangerous. You have the environment that can kill you but also other players. And once you die you respawn on your own and you have to go and get your loot back, hoping that another player didn’t take it. This is why it's important to gather loot so that when you die you equip yourself and try and find your stuff as quickly as possible.\n\n**Questing**\n\nOne of the first quests you can get is to explore a dungeon and recover a lost relic, but things are more complicated than that. Dungeons restart occasionally, probably every day, and they are open to the public so there is a chance that another player has already gone into the dungeon and taken the relic. If you’re early enough, you can get to the dungeon first but you’ll have to survive all of the traps and things within which can be very dangerous. Once you reach the end of the dungeon and the relic is gone you can use your memory shard to see the player that took it, identifying them. You now have a chance to hunt them down before they return the item and return it yourself.\n\nThere is also the chance of someone stealing that relic from the NPC. If someone steals it you can take a bounty quest which would give you the identity of the thief. It won’t give you the location of the thief but if you go near them the game will notify you and you can kill them. The reason to steal it is if you can hold onto that item for a duration of time you can sell it for triple or 10x the price or whatever. But that time duration is only if you are playing the game, so if you log off that timer stops, and the timer stops if you enter a dungeon or a base or something like that; you have to spend that duration in the wilds which isn't that bad since the fast travel is limited so you’ll probably be walking or traveling to the next locations anyways. Once you steal the item the timer begins. You don’t know who the bounty hunter players are so you’ll have to be very careful with avoiding and surviving them. Also, all bounty hunters are competing against each other, so just because one player kills the thief doesn’t mean you can’t kill that bounty hunter, take the relic from them, and return it. The bounty hunter quest ends once the item is returned or the thief survives. The thief is also unable to return the item. Once the thief’s timer runs out they can sell the item for the increased price or just store it for later in their home.\n\n**Housing**\n\nWhen the game begins each player is given a room at an inn. In this room, you have a single chest that you can store a very limited number of items in. Players can also put decorations and stuff too. Later on, you can buy houses and even land out in the wilds to build your forts and stuff. Each home is its own area so you would have to load into it. If you purchase a piece of land in the wild a player approaching that land will be notified that they are entering someone’s land and if they want to travel to the location, if they say no then they’ll just keep exploring. \n\nBut anyone can break into your home. You can’t just buy any area in the wild, there are specific locations all throughout the map that you can buy. But since you have to load into your home other people can buy that plot of land too. When you go to that plot or home it will give you the option to enter your home or enter other players’ and it will give you a list of all the other players that own that plot or home and you can enter them and try to break in and stuff. But when you are offline they are not allowed to break into your home. Players can only break into the homes of players currently online. If you are breaking into someone’s house and they log off then you get 10 seconds to grab as much as you can before you get kicked out. During that time guards will also be twice as powerful.\n\nBut you have to be careful because anyone can purchase hounds or guards and defenses to protect their stuff. If someone tries to break into your home and they’re caught you get notified and you have the option to fast travel to your home and hunt them down. But you cannot fast-travel to your home at any other time without giving up an item. When someone gets caught and you kill them, you aren’t allowed to open any chests or anything. If they stole anything and you stopped them then all those items go back to the chests they were last in. You can loot their body and once you get everything you can from them you can dispose of it and anything you didn’t take gets thrown away forever.\n\n**Guilds**\n\nPlayers can also create their own guilds, at any level. Each guild is private and the guild leader can accept any players they want. When a player applies to a guild their relationship with other guilds and members within the guild their applying is shown to the guild leader so that they can decide whether they should be accepted or not. So like if someone is trying to apply but they have really bad beef with another guild or a bigger one, you can decline them out of fear of being attacked. Or if they have or had beef with a current guild member you can discuss it with that guild member and then determine.\n\n**Enemies**\n\nEnemies follow the ESO style where they level up with the player. So an enemy will be as difficult for a level 1 as a level 100.\n\n**Dungeons**\n\nAny player can create their own dungeon using a separate dungeon-making app or something. To create it you must first pick a prize which you will give up. So if you want the reward to be 10,000 reputations you must give up that much of your own. This is relevant since other players will be more inclined to play player-made dungeons with better rewards, which would benefit you more (as discussed later).\n\nWhen creating a dungeon you can pick how many players are needed for it, the max is 8. You can create your own traps, mazes, use whatever enemies, have parkour, literally whatever you want. Every week, player-made dungeons get open to the public and you have a 1-week timespan. During that time span, players can play your dungeons and rate them at the end. The rating is a “like” or “dislike”. At the end of the week the game will tally up your score and it'll rate it out of 5 stars and if you get anything less than 3 stars then your dungeon gets removed and you basically lose your hard work and effort. But for every “like” that you get you receive the amount of reputation at your level; so if you are level 10 you will receive 512 reputations for every “like.” At the end of every week, the top 3 player dungeons get special rewards. Every week there will be new player dungeons and there will be random weeks where popular dungeons are opened. There will probably be like 12 or something dungeons that change every week but if there aren’t 12 player dungeons to choose from then randomly generated ones appear which allow the bounty quests, but otherwise the bounty quests don’t apply.\n\n**Leveling**\n\nLeveling is based on your reputation. Each player starts at level one with 0 reputations. Each level increases the reputation requirement by 2. So level 1 starts off with 1 reputation required, level 2 needs 2, level 3 needs 4, level 4 needs 6, etc. The max level is 100. You gain reputation by completing quests. Quests are given by NPCs or Quest Boards found through the map. The quests can be completing a dungeon, getting a relic, killing a certain number of enemies, or gathering resources or something. These aren’t things you necessarily focus on but you end up achieving as you're playing. You gain reputation by just killing enemies and selling things. The amount of reputation you get from defeating enemies, gathering resources, and completing dungeons depend on your level. So if you are level 5 you would get 16 reputations from those actions. You get double your level in reputation for completing quests. So if you are level 5 you would get 32 reputations for completing quests.\n\nYou also earn reputation points from selling things. There are 5 rankings to items: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Every 5 levels the amount of reputation per item sold increases. So between levels, to  1-5 Common items will give you 1 reputation, uncommon 2, rare 3, epic 4, legendary 5. When you are level 15-20 common items sold give you 3, uncommon gives you 6, rarely gives you 9, epic gives you 12, and legendary gives you 15.\n\n**Skills**\n\nThere are many different skill branches within the game and each time you level up you gain an increase in the branches most used. When you level up you also get an increase in Health, Stamina, and Magicka, but you also get an extra point increase you can put into any of those three. You level up skills by using that skill. So if you want to increase your skill in archery you have to use a bow.\n\nBut it is your reputation that is really important. The higher your reputation the better quests you get with better rewards. NPC shops will also be cheaper and will provide you with higher-level items to purchase. Certain homes and plots also aren’t purchasable without a certain level of reputation. But you can also lose your reputation. The currency in this game is reputation. So when you purchase something you pay with reputation. You won’t go down a level, you’ll stay at your current level, but to level up you’ll have to regain all that reputation you just spent and then level up to your current level. Getting killed causes you to lose 25% of your current reputation. So if you are level 3 you need 4 reputations to level up so you’ll lose 1 reputation. But that percentage is determined by the level that your reputation is at, not your level. So if you buy something with a ton of reputation and your reputation goes down a couple of levels, the amount you lose is 25% of the level you went down to, not the level you are actually at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Random Extra**\n\nReaching max level will probably be pretty difficult so when a player does it they are commemorated by having a statue of them be added into the game in The Hub. You can create up to 3 players.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask and I’ll try to answer them. Thank you for reading!
neutyy|Jurassic park but in a resident evil formula|Okay picture this. You are one of the staff members that stayed back to help the park open before the main events of the movie, shit hits the fan. Then you the game centres around you trying to escape the island by exploring the entire islands by driving going to different facilities and research labs to find out weird science information. You keep running around unlocking new sections. Eventually you can unlock the dart rifles with tranquilizer shots. But with limited ammo. You go around finding parts to fix a helicopter or boat to get off the island. \n\nI think it is a really cool idea. If I ever get any game developer skills I would make this game but I thought I would record this idea somewhere. \n\nWhat do you guys think?
neti1y|Keteru yamiko|This is first game i have ever thought so please feel  free to  give criticism and help me. \n\nThis game is mainly inspired by SCP 835 - JP\n\nThis is a horror game that has  every realistic features and it's set in a  huge lab not a foundation one where a group of players have to avoid being killed by yamiko. The total amount should be 12 players for a game. Just like FNAF or among us the players have tasks to complete for example changing water checking in on equipment and listening or reading yamiko manga  and anime. The reason you have to read the Manga or the anime it's because if you are the last one to not complete this task you are the first target  she will be looking to kill. There also a catch if you read the Manga too much you will also still be our first Target. The first stage of the game is basically doing test the second stage is avoiding try not to be killed as a side note only the person that does not read the Manga first gets killed everyone else who has read the Manga will not encounter her and vice versa if you read the Manga too much since one of the mechanics is to reread it multiple times. The third stage is Task and investigation is still continue to do your task at the same time you have to do a investigation on the death of the players. Keep in mind the deceased player is muted and everyone is muted during the task stage but there is a group chat. when the player is being stalked their chat becomes unusable to the targeted  player between stage there's something like Among Us where you can do a group call or group meeting to give the evidence that you found in present your case and vote  players out or lockdown in a cell. Another side note due to the fact that player locked in they will be the one that  get killed during the next stage with another player. By the  fourth stage if all players are dead or it is one remaining the game is lost. To win the game you have to at least find out that it was a SCP by gather enough evidence to prove it and calling the foundation. This is where the bonus stage comes in for the both winners and losers. The game now becomes more of a first-person to third-person shooter smilier to battlefield  and rainbow six siege the  objective of the mission is to rescue the one player that was remaining that's now NPC and capture the SCP for those who lose. For those  who won main task is retrieve data and capture the  SCP. At the end of for the winners there's a little cutscene or a continuation of the stage where you're trying to deliver the SCP but there is mysterious beat up old rusty police car chasing you too be continue for a dlc. \n\nThis game is made for PC and gaming consoles
nelgyd|A Multiplay SPC Game, But with a twist!|So here’s what I’m thinking: this will be an 8 v 8 v 1 multiplayer game pitting the SCP Foundation against the Illuminati, with an escaped SCP hunting both groups and interfering with whatever mission they undertake.\n\nThat’s the main loop of this game: each map will have a unique objective pertaining to either “Containment” for the Foundation or “Breaching” for the Illuminati. For example, the Foundation is working to retrieve several active SCPs from an abandoned shopping mall while the Illuminati are working to stop them and keep the instances active at all times, with The Plague Doctor roaming around trying to “cure” both sides.
nek0u1|Ideas For My New Game|I have been working on a new game, or at least planning. I need some inspiration. It is going to be a 3D Open World RPG, sort of like Genshin Impact but instead of anime looking characters it will be cartoony looking characters. I also want to implement some building mechanics and a whole ton of items and weapons, aswell as different heroes, pvp and a campaign. I just need ideas and a way to organize this game. Feel free to message me or leave some ideas, and of course I will credit the ideas if they manage to get into the official game.
nejavh|I've had this idea for a while now ...|For a few weeks I've had in the back of my mind a game idea. It is set in a dystopian country that has been at war for some time. You play as someone who is a part of the military and is becoming disaffected with the world you live in. You are picked to test a new piece of equipment to help win the war: an armoured suit. The protagonist gets in the suit through its back and starts to learn the basics (the tutorial). During this process some kind of disaster happens resulting in an explosion and you have the opportunity to escape with this new piece of tech. You get to a nearby town and to safety but realise that the back of the suit has been damaged thus meaning you are stuck in the suit. This is the crutch of the game, you have 3 days to live before succumbing to dehydration and as the days progress the functions of your suit fail and you become weaker. The campaign is divided into these three days and you can unlock perk points that allow you to pick functions that you want to keep and will force you to specialise your play style. Your overall objective is to free the town and nearby area of the presence of the authoritarian government and fight off any forces they send in.

ndvwik|From Mook to Villian Game Text RGP/Interactive Novel|Pretty much what it says on the tin: the character starts off as a garden-variety mook (Star Wars stormtrooper, fantasy orc, security-guard-for-evil-cyberpunk-corporation, a low-level bureaucrat in an authoritarian government, whatever) and works their way up the Ladder of Evil, defeating or misdirecting heroes, allying with or backstabbing comrades, and generally Kicking the Dog to become the Big Bad themselves, or at least the Big Bad's top henchperson.\n\nWhile I'd love to make this a full-blown Fallout/Skyrim/Red Dead Redemption-type RPG, that's probably a bit too ambious. The basic mechanic would be a text-based or point-and-click story game, but with weapons/supplies/MacGuffins inventory and personal attributes (strength, stealth, health, intelligence, magic? horror?). Having top-down maps would be cool for certain situations (see a few paragraphs down). Inspirations include:\n\n* [Fallen London](https://www.failbettergames.com/fallen-london/)\n* [Sunless Skies](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless-skies/)\n* [Tyranny](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/tyranny/TYTY01GSK-MASTER.html)\n* [Beholder](https://beholder-game.com/)\n* [Suzerain](https://www.suzeraingame.com/)\n* [Eighty Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/)\n* [Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault/)\n\nYour character can pick different career paths (magician, spy, thief, thug, military officer, etc.), whatever will give them a leg up in the dog-eat-dog world of villainy.\n\nYour character can align with various factions within the evil army/government/business they work for, or be secretly working for another villainous faction outside the organization, or even (gasp!) spying for the good guys. They can also go out (setting permitting) and spy on the good guys, possibly even sabotaging their operations or giving bad advice.\n\nWith that basic concept said, here's a couple of rambling, optional ideas, in no particular order:\n\nI don't really know what the best combat system would be: perhaps just a skill check or a bunch of options (charge, dodge, shoot, etc., depending on the setting), with success depending on the character's stats.\n\nThe character could also be a more verbal type, using flattery, rumors, and so on to misdirect enemies into your literal or metaphorical traps. For example, the villainous mook character you play attempts to misdirect a hero (the type of character you'd usually play in a video game) to assassinate the wrong target or steal the wrong MacGuffin. This could be by pretending to be a "quest-giving" character or by setting traps, blocking doors, messing with the "signpost" clues, stealing the MacGuffin themselves and escaping, and so on.\n\nThese "misdirection" parts of the game could be just textual choices like the rest of the game or they could be top-down 2D maps that allow you to move through and mess with the map as the hero you're fighting goes charging through. Imagine if you were playing Dishonored or some other action game, but one of the ordinary-looking guards anticipated you showing up and messed up the level design and/or your mission goals in the first place. Maybe that's too much for a simple text RPG, but I thought I'd throw it out there.\n\nOf course, it being an evil protagonist game, your character is also cozying up to various other ambitious villains, running errands, choosing factions, and looking for an opportunity to backstab. Perhaps you'd also have a reputation stat or multiple faction reputation stats, which you can fill up by pleasing your current boss or your boss's rivals to earn promotions.\n\nThe game ends when you reach the top...or if you get killed or expelled for your ambition.\n\nPlease let me know your ideas!
ndsyad|Inspiration|I am working in Unreal Engine and I am looking for a game idea. It's my first game so I want it to be smallish but I want to be able to post it on steam as well. I dont want to create anything specific I just know I want it to be a 3D game.
ndrf4y|What really is there to do in space?|So, there are two types of space games I can think of right now: flight simulators and colony builders. This post is exclusively about the latter.\n\nWith the flight-simulator kind of space game, what you do in space is pretty obvious: you're the pilot, and you fly around and shoot things, and there's various ships, asteroids, stations, and other obstacles to shoot at and fly around.\n\nFor builder-type games, you're in charge of a crew and you can obviously build things like expand your ship, place equipment, manufacture stuff, and maybe fight off enemies in a vaguely X-COM-style way. The view is some kind of cross-section, either top down or isometric.\n\nThe game I want to make is based a bit more in hard sci-fi and I'm trying to keep that in mind, though we'll see how long that lasts 😀\n\nTo clarify my issue I want to talk about a couple other games first. First game is [Starship Theory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/574760/Starship_Theory/), which despite the reviews \_is\_ fun for about 10 hours. You start out on a tiny ship and can use a mining laser to choose asteroids, gather materials, and build out new hull and flooring for your ship. However, other than building up more resource-generating equipment (e.g. solar panels), accumulating resources, and placing items, there's not much to \_do\_. There's a continuous stream of events: asteroid fields, friendly trading ships, hostile warships. And you fly too close to suns sometimes. Normally, the way games are paced (e.g. Rimworld, or any game), it's maybe 70% downtime and maybe 30% do-or-die-oh-shit-we're-being-attacked. This game is 100% "there's an event happening right now", and it's always one of those 3 events.\n\nAnother (more finished) game is [Space Haven](https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/). This one is for sure more rounded out, and has similar "collect resources, expand your ship" mechanics, but as you can see from the [screenshots](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979110/ss_ef63e55182d8068e762d3824ab52a569df12ae4d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620996077) it eventually turns into a build-an-entire-supply-chain-in-space simulator. You could \_buy\_ microchips, but why do that when you can research and build up a dozen different fabrication devices and build them from scratch? /s There's of course a fair bit more content like mining and breaking down derelict ships, all the while being chased by pirates to keep you from lingering in one place for too long, but the core building mechanic is just building up tons of factories to convert resources into different types of resources.\n\nMy issue with Starship Theory is that the crew just sits on their consoles until they're hungry, thirsty, or tired, and then eats, drinks, or naps (hey, a little like real life?). Space Haven is maybe 75% building factories and resource management.\n\nThe game I want to make, as mentioned earlier, aims to be SLIGHTLY realistic:  \n\* You can't just float outside in an EVA suit and expand the hull on your ship. You need to be at a station to modify your hull.  \n\* Not building an entire supply chain on a small spacecraft.  \n\* Not fielding a continuous stream of severe events\n\nBut then if you're not building a manufacturing line, and you have proper downtime between random events, what is the player (and crew) actually doing?\n\nIs your reaction reading this "Yes, that's space games for ya", or is there something more interesting someone could build in this genre?
ndrdxr|Lintu, Survival of the birds|The title may be changed.\n\nIdea: a survival game where you either play as a bird or can change into a bird.\n\npreferably with terrain that compliments the ability to fly, and not necessarily earthly.\n\nfor inspiration for the flight and transform mechanic you could look up a cancelled project called Vind
ndoqk5|Game based off Hypixel Bedwars|So something I noticed was that Minecraft servers have some games that are similar to some very popular games.\n\nI mean there’s Minecraft hunger games and a bunch of battle royale games which were incredibly popular for a while.\n\nThere’s minecraft murder mystery and there’s among us which are basically the same games.\n\nThere’s also a bunch of capture the flag type games in Minecraft which is a popular game mode in many popular games.\n\nI mean all these popular Minecraft mini games tend to have popular real game counterparts. And since bedwars is one of the most popular games in the most popular Minecraft server, and is actually an interesting and fun concept, I’d say if someone were to make a quality game that’s similar to bedwars, it has potential to blow the hell up.\n\nIt’s also the type of game where many youtubers can make content from especially if they add a bunch of variant game modes. I mean of course as usual, whether it succeeds depends on all kinds of stuff other games need to succeed, such as the visuals, gameplay, controls etc.\n\nBut I think such a game would have a higher chance than others, simply cuz it’s already a well known and fun concept that’s only existed as a mini game.\n\nSo as long as someone makes it right, I feel like it could blow the hell up.
ndm79d|A game about controlling your body from the insides to fight off diseases and stay healthy| So basically, you work as the brain telling every part of the body to do their part. You can take control of organs so they work better like controlling the immune system and game goes into mini war mode to fight a virus, stuff like that. This is all I have figured out right now, just thought of this when waking up and felt the need to type this out.  \nI need some more inspiration, any ideas?
ndm15e|A game about controlling your own to fight off diseases and stay healthy from the insides|So basically, you work as the brain giving out signals (hormones) to your body to grow, sleep, eat etc\nThis is all I have figured out right now. I just woke up, thought of this and felt the need to type this out\nI feel like this could be a really cool game, it could be 3d third person where the brain is like a character you can move and organs are characters you have to talk to make them work correctly or from a god perspective where you can control everything by clicking and pressing buttons \nI need some more inspiration, any ideas?
ndkgx9|The cross dimensional soldier [FPS]|This could be done by a beginner but it's reasonable to say it'd be more successful if you're an intermediate\n\nIdea: You are a soldier that can travel between 2 different dimensions\n\nThere is enemies in both but you can't attack the enemies in the dimension your currently in\n\nSo to defeat these enemies you have to travel to the other dimension and use your guns scope to see where the enemies are and shoot to defeat them\n\nSo you can't shoot the enemies in the dimension you're currently in but you can shoot the enemies in the other dimension but to find their location you can use your scope
ndhpkz|Autochess genre variants|With the success of tactical shooters, I'd like to see a Valorant autochess.  Instead of the pieces battling in a normal autochess manner, they attempt to plant/defuse a bomb each round.  Weapons  would be items, abilities unlock as piece tier increases, etc.    \n\n\nAlso, albeit a bit humorous by nature, I would like to see a Chess Autochess.  Pretty sure I don't have to explain that one, but I feel like it could be fun.  :D
nd8bsz|A base building survival game set on a sleeper ship.|I might try this, but it isn't fully fleshed out. I've been reading a bunch of hard sci fi set on "slow" interstellar ships. Think big spaceships full of frozen people that are thawed out 100, 1000 or 10000 years later after they reach their decremated. The thing that interests me is: what happens on these space ship's when things go wrong? Does someone have to wake up and do maintenance? Are there robots?\n\nIn this game you would play either as the ship's AI, or as one (or several) crewmates. The goal would be to reach the destination without the colonists dying or the ship getting destroyed. I was imagining that mostly this is a building and resource management game. You start with resources that you can use to build your ship. \n\nThe ship is constructed of modules and is viewed in a top down way. Each module has equipment in it that has inputs and outputs (say, heat electricity, oxygen, co2, proteins, etc.) And your goal is to construct the ship so that it is in homeostasis.\n\nAfter a long time, the homeostasis breaks down, and modules have to be repaired, replaced, or rearranged.\n\nThe way this would work, I imagine, is that you have "sleeping" and "waking" cycles. When you're asleep, the game cycles through years rapidly and simulates the breakdown of the ship, and maybe throws in some randomly generated "crises" like a meteroid impact. When something starts to go wrong, the player is "woken up" and has to check out the ship's status, the levels of all the inputs and outputs, and then rearranges modules, breaks modules down and recreates modules as needed.\n\nThere could be some resources that take 1000s of years to come to fruition, like a forest module that generates wood, or a compost module that breaks down dead organics into methane. So you could wake up to harvest those resources.\n\nI think the major challenge in this game would be making the emergent effects balanced enough to be a challenge while also not being impossible. Showing the player what the full state of the system is might also be pretty hard.
nd2rcp|Upside down camera rotation for an FPS/TPS combat drone game.|(I think I'm flairing this as mechanic, since the all the further concepts are designed around this mechanic.)\n\nSpellbreak is a TPS with lots of vertical movement, so a common "issue" is that it becomes hard to aim an enemy directly above or below you due to how cameras in FPS games normally work. The default FPS camera works so that you have infinite yaw rotation (horizontal rotation) but where pitch is limited to 90 degrees up and down from the horizontal level.\n\nThis isn't really a fix to that problem, that's just how the idea came to my mind: So, I thought, wouldn't it be funny if you could rotate your camera OVER that top/bottom limit and do an actual flip, going upside down? Basically, this would double the range of possible camera positions, the new positions being otherwise equivalent but where the camera is upside down. This also provides infinitely looping pitch (vertical) rotation.\n\nNote that this is NOT the same as going upside down in flight simulators, where there's no preference relative to world axis and where turning pitch and yaw will cause roll. In my idea the horizontal rotation would still happen around the top and bottom "poles" like in FPS games, and therefore the camera is still defined around this up/down axis and there's no roll, and sideways is always sideways. It's just that now for every possible direction the camera can be facing, it can be either upright or upside down (or, literally "on the flipside").\n\nThe logical choice for what the player character considering the camera system is a combat drone/(quad)copter, for which being able to flip over and fly on either side makes sense. [Bad, quick, basic drone design](https://files.catbox.moe/qnu2ew.png) From this point on, an endless number of possibilities rush into my mind.\n\n---\n\nThis kind of game would create whole new skills compared to traditional FPS games\n\n- Choosing flip side situationally with potential sacrifice in awareness: You could have different set of abilities available based on which side you are flipped on. Strengths, weaknesses and synergies could depend on which side you are on, or depending or whether you or your enemy are on the same or different "polarity"\n\n- Ability to flip and keep track on enemy: To flip, you need to turn 180 degrees horizontally and 180 degrees vertically. Both can be executed towards either direction theoretically without ever lifting your mouse from the pad given enough sensitivity, since there's no top/bottom limiter to change the relative mouse position when gone against it.\n\n- Navigation ability, to not get disoriented while flipping and being able to comprehend the battlefield on both flip sides.\n\n- New manuever possibilities, like circling around an enemy vertically. While this is technically a thing in flight sims, it's different due to free mouse aim and top/bottom poles.\n\nMap and gravity possibilities: All of these should ultimately be wider horizontally than vertically, since aiming sideways is still better than straight up/down.\n\n- Traditional map on earth surface with gravity.\n\n- A map within an open space, with floating obstacles and points of interest approximately on the middle plane. Could have no gravity, or gravity towards the middle plane, or away from the middle plane.\n\n- A flat, two-sided ground surface surrounded by sky or space on both sides, with holes to go to other side, or if it's a smaller disk, you might have to go around the edge to get on the other side. Gravity is towards ground plane. Team bases are on opposite sides of the disk. \n\n- A map with sky sandwiched by two grounds on opposite sides (floors/roofs). Gravity is towards both floors and switches in the middle point, abruptly or gradually becoming zero-g in the middle. Team bases would be on opposite grounds and also at some distance horizontally.\n\n- The definition on which flip side you are on could either be set in stone for a map, or be determined by the direction of gravitational field you are in. Or it could be determined by the side of your base, meaning that opposing teams potentially have the opposite favorable side.\n\nAdditional game ideas:\n\n- HUD features and color change to indicate which side you are on, normal side or flipside. For example, your crosshair could change from this /+\  to this \\+/. Also, show a border across top and bottom poles and/or or color tint on the side you are not on, to indicate when you are about to flip sides.\n\n- Different unit types that vary in speed, properties and abilities, different classes. Some heavy classes could have limited turning rate, with a free aim being limited to a square that slowly adjusts towards the crosshair. The meat of the game however, is focused on drones with FPS-like free aim and mobility for extremely fast-paced 3D dogfighting.\n\n- Ability to land ground and horizontal surfaces. Available abilities and unit properties could depend on which flip side you land on (which will also determine whether you are attached to ground or "roof" visually). You might be able to travel on ground with wheels or in a humanoid form, or it could be a static mount on a surface, where your drone transforms into a temporary turret which could provide things like vastly increased defense and firepower. Your unit type could have limitations on which side it can land on at all.\n\n- Some unit type could flip using an ability, by doing a quick 180 roll, so that you don't need to manually flip (by turning 180 horizontally and vertically), though this should be a specialty, not a norm.\n\n- On most unit types, levitation thrusters would be omnidirectional and automatically point towards ground/gravity, but a special unit type could have thrusters work only towards one side, limiting the time you can spend flipped upside down before you crash down. The advantages for flipping then would be greater. This would result in some high risk high reward aerial acrobatics to maximize combat potential. This could even be a whole unit category.

ncsi7w|AI for enemies being attracted to a player whistling|I dont know anything about AI at all, but I'm gonna start diving into it soon though, because I'm trying to make a game in Dreams on Ps4, and I want to have some stealth in it.\n\nLike I said, I know nothing about it, so I dont even know if I'm thinking about it in the right way, but it seems like it could work to me. Idk.\n\nSo, here's what I was thinking. Let me know if it makes sense or not. Its \n\n- When one enemy hears your whistle, 2/3 of the time they will casually stroll over to check it out. This sets them up for easy stealth kills.\n\n- 1/3 of the time they will draw their gun and become suspicious, making the takedown more challenging. \n\n- If they are suspicious, there is a 1/3 chance that they would say, "Hey, I heard something," alerting any enemies within a certain distance. \n\n- The alerted will then turn and watch while the other investigates. \n\n- If two or more enemies hear your whistle, they will each react independently. So, two might be calm, while one is suspicious, or they're all suspicious, or all calm, etc. They will each have the 1 in 3 chance.\n\n- If three or more enemies hear your whistle, they will always only send two men.\n\n- If your cover is ever blown, or if enemies discover a dead body or something, they will be suspicious of every whistle from then on out.\n\nDoes that make sense? And is it insanely difficult to do?
ncq9j8|WW2 choice based game|I was thinking about an idea of a call of duty game based around ww2, its a choice game like telltale but the choices arnt button presses, they are things that change as you play it differently.\n\nIf you remember the 2nd or 3rd cod game (id remember which one it is) but in that campaign, your able to pick a variation of countries and fight with them in cod fashion. I feel like in this game, you can pick different countries from ww2 and play with them in a story, but your actions can change the campaign and or cross over different place you might have seen playing another side. Basically its choice based like telltale, but centered around player action not a selection of 4 choices, based in ww2 with interesting plot and historical areas across the world such as moscow, Leningrad, berlin, you get the picture\n\nIdk give me your thoughts 😁
ncoxiu|Money Down: A Battle Royale where money is on the line every round.|Now, I know this idea is basically dead in the water because cheaters would probably ruin it but anyway...\n\nI would like to see a battle royale in line with something like PUBG but each round requires putting money down to buy into the round. \n\nThe ante money is in-game credits that would be purchased through a store and could also be spent on cosmetics. Once you have credits in your account you queue up for the level of ante you want. I'm thinking the equivalent of $1 or $5. \n\nAs far as pay outs my first though is something like, bottom half loses their ante, top half at least breaks even, top 10 at least doubles, third makes 3x, second 4x, and first 5x. The house take the balance and is the primary way the game makes money. Credits won from rounds can be pulled out once you get to a minimum value so if you make money from playing well. \n\nEven if you couldn't get a full lobby of 100 people into a 5 dollar game on a Tuesday night, having money down would even make a 10 person battle royale round intense as long as the circles and loot were appropriately balanced. \n\nI think the money on the line aspect would also make it popular for streamers. Twitch account integration could let people bet their credits on the contestants.
nclo6f|How to increase the creativity of the game developer?|Throughout my 20 years working with art, I have always found myself in the need to seek new sources of inspiration, whether for a personal or professional job. One of the best ways to increase your creativity is to collect images and references from other artists on a daily basis. Every year I create a reference folder on my computer, collect everything I like and that can inspire me in future projects. The first page of your browser must be a portal for artists' works, that is, there is no escape, daily I am bombarded with images and magnificent works, which only contribute to my creativity and perfectionism.\n\nOne of the websites I recommend is ArtStation and CGSociety, both of which are an excellent source of inspiration. \n\nI believe that this is the minimum. Watching movies, being extremely curious, playing different types of games, drawing, writing a story, watching documentaries about the universe, mysteries, in short, all this contributes to having more and more references in our minds. Get inspired and use your creativity to create new projects.
ncl2e3|CS:GO case simulator but for Pokémon cards|
ncj2vq|College Simulator|Genre: Roguelite/Roguelike deck builder with cartoon themed students (you) and professors (enemies)\n\nCore loop: Card battle against a bunch of professors to pass their classes and graduate from university. If you fail against any professor, you lose the game. Each fight is a specific number of rounds and then you get a final grade; 60% or higher to pass on easy mode. 70% or higher to pass on hard.\n\nResources themed as "energy", "comprehension" (and possibly more). Use abilities to fight professors who throw tests and homework at you. Professors have different grading schemes and tests/homework assignments that have varying negative effects, like "Pop Quiz" that can be blocked by a high enough comprehension level (like Armor), or "Bad Lecture" which subtracts your comprehension level.\n\nSome professors are notoriously difficult. Others are a cakewalk. Some come with TAs?\n\nGo through four "worlds" themed school years. You fight 12 professors for 4 years and then graduate with a GPA. Choose which classes to take.\n\nYou would have abilities like "Crunch night: -2 energy, +2 comprehension, -2 energy next round" or "Illicit Drugs: +1 comprehension when any Study ability is used"

She loves games she can just turn off her brain and play but i think my dream game would go something like this.

ncagfl|Sea of thieves except Star Wars|Sorry for bad grammar and bad spelling \n\nOk so the concept of the game is almost like sea of thieves except in space like a Star Wars Version of it. The game would be set days after the battle of Jakku. This would mean the empire is all but destroyed there are still parts of it floating around space but for the most part it’s gone. \n\nSo My idea is we would split the mechanics in games like sea of thieves, red dead redemption and No Mans Sky. What I would  want to take from no mans sky would be there ship mechanics and there space exploration stuff but scale it down a bunch so you have like 2-3 different systems with 1-2 planes in it.\n\nThe Red Dead Redemption part would be taken from there. Honour system. You could ether be good or bad if your bad you would work for people like Jaba the hut or other groups like that. If you’re good you would work for the new republic doing bounties and other missions. Now let’s say you want to make a switch from the new republic to the hut clan, to do that there would be a very special mission for you to complete. What I was thinking for that mission is Raiding a ship that belonged to the empire. The ship is still active and is trying to restart the empire but you come to stop it, this is how you would convert from a bad guy working for the Hut clan to someone in the new republic. \n\nThe Sea of thieves part is pretty self explanatory but there could be a whole variety of missions for someone to do depending on what honour you are. If you work for the Hut Clan you could be doing hit jobs or running spice. If you were on the new republic you would do things like bounty hunting or find officers who were apart of the empire.\n \nOne last thing to mention would be how you would maneuver around space. In sea of thieves everyone is given the choice between three different ships with different numbers of crew mates aloud on. This game would completely change that. The ships customization would be depending on how you play. If you play alone then you might want more speed on your ship because you might now be able to control the turrets the best alone. If you play with your mates you might want a ships that built for combat. What I just listed was the customization inside the ships but what about the actual ship you can purchase. What I’m thinking is this, for the two sides of honour there would be different types of ships, each having there desirable attributes compared to the other.\n\nAnyways this is my idea for a game. Personally I think this would be a fun game that would make you feel like your now apart of the Star Wars universe. Sorry for making You read a bunch of grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes.
nc6sri|Brass bones|I know rule 6 states that anyone can use my idea but I'm looking to develop this one myself, I'm just looking for feedback.\n\nProcedural Rogue-lite with PS1 style graphics and a steampunk theme. Titanfall style mobility with a few dozen unique weapon types. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Arc-rifle: Fires multiple short-range lightning bolts that chain to nearby enemies on hit.\n* Ramper: Machine pistol that fires faster the longer the trigger is held. The magazine is inserted through the top like an M1 Garand. Ping included.\n* Gibstick: Charge-up railgun that obliterates enemies.\n\nEach weapon will have three perks that are randomly generated. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Wormhole Accelerator: (For projectile weapons) Simply teleports the bullet into the enemy. Less damage due to some quantum wormhole magic.\n* Recall Beacon: On precision hit, return the next three shots to the magazine. These recalled bullets lose some velocity.\n* Cheese Grater: Bullets are split into multiple short-range versions of themselves. Must be a strong cheese grater.\n\nI'm still debating whether or not to have these perks physically appear on the gun due to it being a colossal amount of work. As stated in the Recall Beacon, some weapons will have elemental properties. These do nothing by themselves but when combined... for example, if an enemy is coated in tar then hit by fire, they will combust. If an enemy is coated in water, then hit with ice, they freeze, temporarily stunning them.\n\nThe lore consists of you being a worker robot that was accidentally left with their consciousness when they got thrown away. Every time you die, your AI is transferred into a new robot. You start in a hub area called, fittingly, 'The Junkyard'. Upon dying, you can choose a new frame to 'possess'. I'm planning on adding three classes but aren't super sure with the specifics yet. I know I'll have one mobile frame, another more tanky frame, and another specialist that's maybe more of a hacker that can 'tame' enemies?\n\nAt some point in your runs, you'll unlock the permanent aspect. The upgrade booth which for some reason is sentient. You'll get cogs from defeating bosses which you can then use to either upgrade health, speed, or damage. Every three upgrades in each category introduces a new mechanic such as grenades, slow motion, or even b-hopping.\n\nPlease, please give me feedback as it is greatly appreciated. I hope you liked my idea and maybe even buy it someday!

nc5lru|An intuitive way to handle walking through and interacting with doors.|There's really not much too it. It may have already been done before. I dont know. It seems like the perfect way to handle them. \n\n- Say you're on Ps4, basically, if you hold square at a closed door, the player character will walk through and close it behind them, in one fluid animation. If the door's already open, the player will walk theough and close the door behind them.\n\n- If you quickly press square instead, the character will only open it. Same goes for closing it. Pretty much like every other game. \n\nSeems like this would be great for both immersion/realism, or if enemies are chasing you. \n\nIn real life if I go through a door and close it behind me, it pretty much feels like one continues motion. In video games its four: Open, walk through, turn, and close. All with a small pause in between. Something that feels so second nature in real life, should not be so difficult in a game. It seems like this would finally make handling doors feel very natural.\n\nHas any game ever done this?
nc43kc|A cute kaiju game where if you damage structures you lose points|Your goal in the game would be to try to complete some objectives and dodge enemy human forces and take down evil kaiju.\n\nYou also would have to do this while trying to keep the human, wildlife areas safe as you, enemies can destroy them but if you or an enemy destroys them you gain negative points and the human enemies will be more numerous and difficult in later levels\n\nYou would also have the ability to collect more Kaiju along the way to add to your team so you get more gameplay types from just one Kaiju\n\n.\n\nStory: You and a bunch of other kaiju had woken up a lil while ago and humans are trying to fight them off and in doing some invent new technologies to control simpler minded kaiju and create mechanical kaiju but then a big bad (typical evil) kaiju arrives and takes control over these enemies and empowers them and is trying to infest all creatures so they're under its command and obviously you don't want that\n\nStyle: 2D (Isometric or top down) or 3D (top down or Isometric or 3D camera following player and allowed to turn\n\nPossible other things:\n- Secrets\n- Extra lives so you can continue longer + limited continues\n- collectables &amp; cheat codes (don't disable progression so you can use them to help you in especially difficult parts)
nc30g6|Random game stat i thought about in FPS competitive games|i was thinking if the stat of distance between the player and the enemy they kill, then getting the average determined by each kill they get would be an interesting thing to see \n\nfor example, there are 2 people with similar scores in a 5v5 game of csgo (can be applied to the likes of R6, Valorant, etv) lets say guy #1 is 20/11/7, and guy #2 is 19/5/2 in the rounds they played were 15 at half time. if each kill were to be a calculated distance for the kill shot then each kill being averaged and displayed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* determines if you're a long range shooter/entry fragger (first contact) with the ak for example or someone who kills in close range/holding angles \n* of course every kill is going to be a mixture of both in game play but im focusing on the frequency and how often kills like these occur and what scenario/gameplay style you play as discussed in the comment above\n\nbut yeah thats just an idea that i expanded on from a random thought and found this page to share, any feedback is welcomed.
nc2nuv|1-Hub 4-Portal Random Map Diablo without respawn|A diablo-like game where you start in a town/hub like world with 4 portals to other worlds. You can visit them in any order you like. Each world behind a portal is a random generated map with a certain theme and monsters. You must find some keys, activate some switches and then beat the map's boss. Your goal is to visit all 4 maps and kill the bosses, to unlock the  final boss of the game that will appear in the hub town. Each map takes about 10-15 minutes for an average player. The skill level of the monsters is balanced to your XP/skill-level.\n\nSo to beat the whole game will only take \~1 hour!\n\nThe clue: When you die...you must restart the whole game!\n\nI thought about a game that has a high rate of replaying, you can further make speedruns or play in larger coop groups where the game is over when only one player dies!
nc2f7k|Plants Vs Zombies 2|\[Insert idea for title involving number 2 pun like Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\]\n\n^(Idea: Plants Vs Zombies Trwoo (Portmanteau of Two and True, as in this is the true sequel))\n\nI've always thought that og PvZ was so insanely well designed. It's a one in a million game. Looking at PvZ 2, I thought their approach lost too much of the original thematic and charm. I wanted to expand the game's mechanics with more plant-related stuff rather than put them of some kind of weird SF II campaign and have them do some weird electric stuff and wear &gt;!bdsm !&lt;gear.\n\nThe first idea I had in mind was the implementation of a four seasons theme. I was thinking that the player from last game has since founded a zombie-defense business, going from house-to-house, defending them from zombies. I couldn't decide whether the player should defend the same house through four seasons before moving on to the next or you defend a different house per season. In the end, I think the latter stays true to the original format and so let's go with that. Instead of Day/Night/Pool/Fog/Roof/Boss, we have Winter/Spring/Summer/Autumn/Halloween (Boss)/Winter/Boss.\n\nNext, I think it would be nice to have something like a rune system. That seems in nowadays. Basically, the Zen Garden is unlocked since the early part and has palpable effects in gameplay. If you go into the Zen Garden, there are three slots by the window and you're given a free sunflower plant when you first enter. If you put the sunflower by the window slot, then you have an extra sunflower giving you sun in-game. Other ideas are the ice-shroom, giving you free freezing every now and then; Cattail, you have one free homing cattail from the window; Blover, free blow-away of insects and balloons every now and then; etc.\n\nThen, going back to the seasons system, depending on the season, some plants are weakened or strengthened. For example, during the summer, freezing plants freeze for shorter but fire peas damage for three times instead of two times the normal pea damage, melon-pults are cheaper. During spring, sunflowers yield rate increases. During autumn, squash, pumpkin, and kernel pults recharge much quicker. In the winter, freeze plants are cheaper but torchwood creates an area around it where you can place normally non-winter plants. Additionally, the pool is frozen over and you need flower pots before you can plant on them. Since it is permanently frozen, there will be a lot of bobsleds going through there. Alternatively, we can make it defrost temporarily (like how you can push back fog temporarily in og) using jalapenos, but you will also sink all plants in that row. Using ice-shroom refreezes instantly.\n\nThere will also be new zombies, and they're introduced throughout the seasons. For example, in the spring there are hive-keepers. They bring harmful insects that fly ahead of them. To counter them, you'd need to place a pitcher plant near your plants or blow the insects away with blovers. Fume-shrooms can also attack the insects. In the summer, there are surfer dudes who run fast and carry surfboards over their heads. They protect a small area around them from overhead projectiles. So far, those have been my only ideas.\n\nI think it would also be fun to be able to deploy a small inflatable pool - a similar mechanic from BTD5 - where you can place water plants there.\n\nLast, but not the least, Crazy Dave is replaced by this Asian shop with an Asian merchant stereotype (not sure if that's offensive. if it is, let's just change that) which grants access to new types of Asian and tropical themed plants. For example, the pitcher plant, the snap dragon from current PvZ2, some kind of vine-themed plant, and more. Crazy Dave instead shows up at winter seasons as a Santa Claus cosplayer, bringing you random seed packets or other stuff.\n\nAnyway, that's about it. Just wanted to throw this out there. Ngl, I'm pretty disappointed at current PvZ2.
nc20wt|A Quiet Place: The Game|You're basically in a quiet place universe and the game/monsters can hear you making noise in real life
nc1qun|3|This game idea influenced by stellaris, endless space and crusader kings\n\nWould use something similar to ES2’s gameplay affinities so that instead of just having different stats each empire would have unique rules/abilities.\n\nWould use a character-driven system like crusader kings to simulate internal politics. To make it more flexible you wouldn’t be playing as members of a dynasty.  Instead you would choose a vision (which could also influence available victory conditions) and your “heirs” would be other characters that are inspired to carry on that vision.  Sounds vague because it’s meant to fit into a variety of government types/cultures, some more alien than others.  If I called it a political party or faction or something it would force every alien race to be similar to humans in some way.\n\nVisions would include things like conquering part or all of the galaxy, brotherhood between all aliens, anything else you (or modders ) could think of.  Basically how I play crusader kings except it’s an actual gameplay mechanic instead of metagaming.\n\nInternal politics would consist of conflicts between different characters in your civilization and would serve as an anti-snowballing mechanic.  That way if you fall behind in the early game you can still catch up when the empire next door splits into 3.\n\nTl;dr a space strategy game that focuses less on perfect gameplay/snowballing/map painting and more on emergent storytelling/an ever-changing balance of power/creative ways to take over the galaxy.
nc1e3f|Kingdom Hearts MMORPG|Overview\n\n\nConcept\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis is a hypothetical MMO taking place in the same world as Kingdom Hearts. It functions as an instance-based hunting game where players go through various environments doing platforming challenges, obstacle courses, and of course fighting enemies and bosses most with branching paths and collectables throughout. This game combines gameplay elements from across the series, including spin offs.\n\nInspirations\n\nThis game takes inspiration from Kingdom Hearts, Monster Hunter, Super Mario 3d World, Rayman 3, and Spyro.\n\nStory\n\n\nSetting\n\nThis story takes place in a realm beyond the one we know. In this realm, all of civilization is powered by magic, all magic is powered by emotions. In the days long past, magic was a scarce and volatile resource as a result of humanity’s diverse nature and the circumstances of daily life. One day, they discovered a way to harness a reliable and plentiful source of magic by creating worlds modeled after stories. However, if left unattended, these worlds would become corrupted and start producing a dangerous and uncontrollable magic that threatened all around it. As a result, young warriors with the power to summon Keyblades were sent into these worlds and rectify whatever was threatening their stability. This time, you were chosen.\n\nGameplay\n\n\nControls\n\n\nDualshock\n\nL Stick: Movement\nR Stick: Camera\nA: Attack\nB: Jump\nX: Block\nY: Reaction\nLB: Lock Target\nRB: Shotlock\nLT: Strike Commands\nRT: Magic Commands\nPad: Selection\n\nOverworld\n\n\nTraversal\n\nThe user can move throughout the world using various jumps, land and aerial maneuvers, and Special commands. The user must also take advantage of the environment to get to various points through the use of gimmicks and objects, some of which require a specific command to make use of. Some obstacles also can only be exceeded by using specific commands.\n\nBattle\n\nWith the Abilities equip between Missions, the user has diverse range of combat and traversal capabilities. The user can utilize basic attacks and combos using the Attack Input, these can be further supplemented by using combo finishers and mid-combo attacks through using the Block Input. Most direct attacks can be neutralized or even countered by either hitting them with an attack or with a Block Input. Shotlocks are precise projectile attacks that at their most basic launch many homing projectiles at multiple enemies, but there are variants. Shotlocks draw upon a FP, gained by hitting enemies with attacks, as their resource. Between Missions, the user can use the Command Board to fill slots that when using the corresponding input. Magic Commands utilize MP in the Player Character’s stockpile, and Strike Commands require a cooldown period after use. A Command Board for Items can be utilized by holding both inputs. By using the Selection Input, the user can exchange their Attack Input for things such as Special Commands, Summons, Limit Brakes, and Form Changes.\nSpecial Commands often involve things outside of battle such as manipulating certain gimmicks, objects, or the environment in a certain way, enabling the Player Character to traverse the environment in a new way, or to access areas not possible otherwise.\nSummons involve making a particular character from a particular world and utilizing their abilities as the users in exchange for all of the user’s MP.\nDatas are autonomous constructs of characters from each story unlocked through progression. Up to 2 can be used at any time.\n\nLimits are special high-damage attacks that can be used as a combo between the Player and a Data that modify their primary Attack, their Reaction Input, and end in a powerful Finisher. These take all of the user’s FPs.\n\nForm Changes are transformations specific to each keyblade that change the user’s primary abilities and current commands to specific unique ones, sometimes endowing them with unique passives.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nIf the Player engages the multiplayer lobby, they can create and join rooms where many players can gather. When one begins the “Prepping” phase of a Mission, up to 3 other players can join to assist them, however, Datas can’t be used while at least 2 are present. Players can use True Limits and True Finishers provided at least one has unlocked one.\n\nProgression\n\n\nLeveling\n\nIn this game, the Player Character themselves doesn’t level up, but the keyblades they use do. When a Keyblade levels up, the Player Character gains stat boosts, armor and accessory slots. Abilities and Commands unlocked can be equipped with any Keyblade.\n\nKeyblades\n\nThe Player starts with the Kingdom Key but can unlock more through progression. Depending on the Player’s equipped Abilities, they can even equip and/or use more than one Keyblade at once.\n\nMixing\n\nBy Mixing, the Player can create the most effective equipment, items, and stat upgrades. The Player can also Mix materials with their Commands to increase their efficiency relative to the Level and Stats.\n\nLists\n\n\nMission Structures\n\n\nCourse Missions\n\nThe Player must traverse an environment within a mission, defeating enemies along the way. The Player must complete various platforming challenges and puzzles as they go, often collecting items throughout.\n\nTask Missions\n\nThe Player must accomplish a specified task while staying within the guidelines presented such as a time limit, tagging specific targets, or gathering needed items. There is usually some manner of opposition the Player must mitigate throughout.\n\nArena Missions\n\nThe Player must defeat one or more teams of predetermined enemies. The consequences for failure aren’t as severe, but the task of doing so may be more difficult.\n\nGame Mission\n\nA Mission involving mechanics beyond standard gameplay. The Player’s reward is often scaled with their performance in the minigame.\n\nBoss Mission\n\nThe Player must defeat a specific high-powered enemy. These enemies do not appear in normal gameplay and as such offer unique rewards.\n\nKeyblades\n\n\nKingdom Key\n\nLv. 99 = 1000 Exp.\nStrength: 1 (x110%)\nMagic: 1\nAbility: Draw\n\nStrike Commands\n\n\nLv 5 Quick Blitz: Perform a jumping attack.\n\nLv. 10: Rising Strike: Smack enemies high into the air.\n\nLv. 15 Sliding Dash: Punish faraway enemies with a charging attack.\n\nLv. 20 Quick Raid: Throw the Keyblade at the enemy once.\n\nMagic Commands\n\n\nLv. 3 Fire: Launches a dart of flame at an enemy.\n\nLv. 8 Ice: Launches a shard of ice at an enemy.\n\nLv. 12 Thunder: Calls down a bolt of lightning on an enemy.\n\nLv. 18 Cure: Heals either the user or an ally.\n\nAbilities\n\n\nLv. 1 Jump: Press the Jump Input to leap into the air.\n\nLv. 23 Guard: Press the Input to raise the Keyblade for a brief moment to deflect enemy attacks from the front.\n\nLv. 2 Dodge Roll: Press the input while moving to temporarily become invulnerable to enemy attacks.\n\nLv. 28 Scan: View an enemy’s HP gauge during battle.\n\nLv. 32 Draw: Attract Prizes from a distance.\n\nMeteor Shower\n\nLv.  16 Lock onto multiple foes and launch small, star-like projectiles at targets in a volley.\n\nArms of Awakening\n\nLv. 21 Gain different attacks depending on the currently equipped weapon.

In Game Recommendation Series)(Depending on what ya do this could be Advanced instead of Intermediate)\n\nA 1 to 4-Player 3D Platformer w/ 4-Player Drop-In/ Drop-Out Local Split-Screen and maybe online multiplayer as well, along with potentially the ability to do both at same time would be cool\n\n(For example: by playing with one friend online and 2 other people on your coach at same time, or any other combination of online &amp; local Splitscreen multiplayer mixed together)\n\nBecause truth be told there have been many Singleplayer 3D Platformers and even quite a few Online Multiplayer Platformers but to my knowledge there aren't ANY 4-Player Splitscreen 3D Platformers except maybe Minecraft but that's more of a Sandbox-Survival kind of game and not a full blown 3D-Platformer\n\nSidenote:\n\nY'all can't tell me running around in a nonexistent Psychonauts Spin-Off 4-Player Local Splitscreen game fighting bad guys, or even for some of y'all with connections to the big guys in the industry, a Smash-Level Collab Super Mario Maker-Like Game but for creating your own 3D Platformer levels/ worlds/ campaigns and picking your own 3D Platformer character to play as against various enemies/ bosses/ worlds with all kinds of building pieces from different franchises wouldn't be pretty cool as well\n\nSo yeah a 4-Player 3D Platformer would be cool with a Realistic, Cartoon, Artsy, Japanese, or Anime look and your own choose of setting/ world/ characters/ enemies/ bosses/ etc etc\n\nHave fun and hope it came across well!!

nbx2hr|Looking for ideas for a meta(inside of a computer type) horror game|Hey! I’m a relatively experienced dev, but I’m not the best at coming up with ideas. I’m twiddling my thumbs thinking up with a new project, but I’ve got a semi-idea of what I want to do. I’m absolutely horrific at any type of art, so the game that I’m thinking of would be simulated on a computer screen. Like the player would be interacting with an 80s virtual desktop, clicking buttons, playing minigames, reading files, etc etc. \n\nRight now I have the idea that the player is maybe going through an old friends computer, when they realize there’s a virus on it. The virus is like a demon or something that is corrupting the computer, which leads to terrifying shenanigans. Technically, that wouldn’t be hard for me to do- I’ve actually made a game fairly similar to this concept, but just didn’t have enough ideas to make it fun. I think it could be cool though, so now I’m asking around for ideas lol. If anyone has a good head on their shoulders for horror games like this, mini games, or just have a story beat they think would be cool, I’d love to hear it !

nl0lze|Kamaz - a realistic VR driving sim where you are a soviet army driver, delivering supplies to an isolated platoon over rough terrain in the Russian-Afgan war|So, as an intro, I've been listening to a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LqrwVkBeoZmlENBNjrzBxbBzX8nq4ms) of soviet war songs I put together, and I came across a comment from a Sam Matthews in the comment section of [вперед КАМАЗ](https://youtu.be/ZB1ezt0r48w). I'm mostly just an ideas magpie, but I have thought of some expansions to his idea.\n\nin his own words, *"You are the driver of a KAMAZ truck and you must drive from hayratorma to Kabul. And while you are driving your truck becomes stuck, shot at, lost, dug in, engine problems, lost cargo, wounded people, road conflict, unusable roads... A 12-hour drive in a slow vehicle on a dangerous path that must deliver its cargo no matter what... maybe even a sleeping feature where the driver goes to sleep for the day and so the player can sleep or rest in real-time."*\n\nThis, ladies, gents, and all of you in between, is simply a phenomenal idea.\n\nmy immediate thought was something tonally like the depressed love-child of Desert bus,, euro truck simulator, stalker, mud-runner/spintires, and a pinch of rimworld, and to go even further. a 4-day round trip to refresh and resupply a dug-in platoon in deepest Afganistan, where you sleep in real-time. after you set a wake-up and bedtime in the settings. I'm not a monster, although...\n\nmidnight life or death raids on your supply column interrupting that *would* make the IRL sleeping a bit less of a gimmick... and running to your truck to frantically start it up packing supplies up as you go, or to act as a runner to pass medical supplies and ammo to the troops defending the convoy would also be amazing. give the player some agency, but prevent the player from just picking up two aks and going full Rambo. you are just a driver after all. perhaps you have a weedy little Makarov and a spare mag. perhaps not. all I know is I think the player should be very fragile and the enemies amateurish, but vicious,  frightening, and a force to be reckoned with. The cover and thin armour of the KAMAZ will be your best friend\n\nAnd every morning, because you would have to travel by night (hopefully this would be accounted for in the self-set schedule as to not fuck with your circadian rhythm too much) you would wind down and sleep with a campfire and the other truckers, tankies, and the odd soldier. this is where stalker can be seen, as you unwind from a night of stressful driving with some interactive toys. perhaps a guitar playing soldier you could request songs from, a pack of fags with a limited number for the whole journey. A bottle of vodka will affect your driving the next day if you hit it too hard and piss of your superior, but might give you the chance to keep moving if you catch a bullet. a map on which you've got to contemplate the next leg of your journey. deciding on the quicker route through a ravine, or fording a river that might kill or beach your truck and so forth. A radio you could chat with the blokes you are trying to save on to keep the goal in perspective. and depending on the progress you made and the casualties you suffer, they disappear one by one from the fireside, and the people on the radio get more and more worried. you can see the fuel trucks get lighter and lighter, and the meds and rations get fewer and fewer. you lose all of them, the game doesn't even end. even having the platoon you are trying to save cannibalize the trucks for parts, or use support staff like you as soldiers, would fractionally increase their chances of holding their position and surviving.\n\nThis is where that pinch of rimworld comes in - this would be an experience designed to make you fail miserably, figuratively and literally. perhaps the framing device would be an old war veteran recounting his story to his grandkids, an unreliable narrator. a story of resilience and perseverance, of pointless loss and suffering and camaraderie, only for it to happen again the next week. it would tell a story through interactions with the rest of the crew, and through rock hard gameplay. anything could go wrong, and you would have to fix it, and if you aren't fast enough with fixing it people you know and like will die.\n\ndriving a big, heavy, loud, and slow truck through dark, squat forests, deep ambush friendly ravines, fields of slowly sinking flares and the occasional danger close airstrike or minefield with being able to do nothing but drive like a 20-ton bat out of hell in VR sounds like hell, and I love it. it could be so tense when absolutely nothing happened yesterday, but a tank was hit directly with an RPG right in front of you the day before. you would never know if it would be a flat tire next, or an RPG to your trusty KAMAZ.\n\nAs a side note, I could see two-player co-op being a thing too. If there were separate threats to life and limb for you and your co-driver, played by your friend or a random, then losing then could become part of the story too. they flag a stray bullet, but survive, you'd better hope there are enough meds to go around that night, or even enough to stabilize them during the journey. having someone to chat to while driving the lonely roads would be nice, but I'm not sure how that would work with the IRL sleeping mechanic or then fireside conversations\n\nif you wanted to go truly off the rails, you could introduce cosmic horror and channel the more subtle side of stalker. have the journey be a slow descent into madness, doggedly trying to outpace an unspeakable horror and a chill down your spine. random people could disappear from the fireside, have the other characters mourn them, and suddenly have them return like nothing was wrong. everyone has no idea what you're talking about - "no, what? he's been there from the start. never left". and they just stare at you for the rest of the night with cold, dead eyes. the map changes regularly, but the route doesn't. you could wake up somewhere completely different from where you stopped. you could hear non-existent battles, see non-human objects no one else could just beyond your headlights during a long drive. having the player second guess themselves for 3 of the four days would be a massive feat, but my god would it be good. this is completely my invention, this part, and I'm not sure if this would work at all with the setting or tone or gameplay loop, but I'm still quite proud of this.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nlast stop folks. If I haven't bored you yet, then me going into the technical details defiantly will. read on at your own risk. thanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking more on the technical side, this is where mudrunner and spintires come in. The main mechanic would be driving, defiantly, so it would have to be highly detailed and polished. A simulation similar to what they did to create an incredibly hard challenge from the get-go. manual gear shifts, the clutch, perhaps a winch to help other vics that get stuck. support for driving wheels, sticks and pedals would be a must for immersion, [here's an example](https://www.amazon.com/PC-Driving-Degree-Vibration-Steering-Shifter/dp/B08MT6F3C9/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pc+steering+wheel+and+pedals+and+shifter&amp;qid=1621974639&amp;sr=8-4), but they would not be required. it would be a largely seated experience, so the user would only really need a VR headset if there was keyboard support implemented too. hopefully, that would expand the already rather small customer base.\n\nThe art style defiantly couldn't be low-poly, or simplistic. The tonal clash would be horrific, but I understand it's easier to make for solo indie devs, and I could see it working if you tried to match the depressive tone and didn't go too simplistic or oversimplified. speaking of simplicity, I don't think you could craft 48 straight hours of random events, difficult terrain, and scripted sequences without a AAA team or a spare decade, so it would have to be randomly generated. This could hurt the campfire scenes, but if you play your cards right this could be a benefit. You couldn't know when a character you really like would die, or when you would run out of spare wheels, or when the next attack would come. Could be basically plain sailing, or the journey from hell this would help keep the game as fresh as possible for the madmen who want to replay the damn thing.\n\nFor the campfire scenes, I'd prefer to avoid any sort of dialogue tree or end goal. They simply couldn't be randomly generated, because then every single character would lose any personality and purpose and the player couldn't really develop an attachment, but a fallout 4 style "yes, yes, yes with sass, fuck you" dialogue tree would also be really detrimental. it would have to be fiercely well written, and somewhat reactive to the player. something large, and seemingly bottomless like Disco Elysium's writing would be good. something not designed to be exhausted, but to be absorbed and engrossed in. Again, very difficult for indie solo devs, but worth it. because of the sheer amount of dialogue, I think voice acting would be the best idea. It would help the conversations flow between the player and the different NPCs, and prevent the player from getting hit with a wall of text. perhaps the conversation could continue without the player, but they could interject when they want more detail or want to make a quip of off the cuff remark. perhaps a system like [Façade's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade_(video_game)). but I can see the player breaking it very easily, and ruining one of the game's core pillars - immersion.\n\nAll of this is basically a moonshot. This amount of content, dialogue, random events, high detail assets. terribly inefficient and impractical. but as a very famous man once remarked on moonshots, *"we do not do it because it is easy, but because it is hard."* if one or two ideas here make it into the core principle, we could have our hands on a winner here. even if we have to scale the time involvement back, this could be an amazing experience.
nkylb8|I started developing a game but want to know if the idea is worth going forward with, I also needed to create a survey for a school project, so I created a survey to get a better idea of what to do.|I hope this is ok to do, I just not sure where else to go.\n\nThe main idea of the game is the player walks through out the world to discover mythological creatures and unlock information about them. I am mainly worried about the concept being boring and at the moment servers more like game development practice. I wanted to have a better idea about people perspectives on "walking simulator" type games and since I have to make a survey for a school project this was a good opportunity to get that information.\n\nThis is my first time posting here so please tell me if I did something wrong or if I need to do anything else.\n\nHere is the link to the survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScspWxCUPPIWkYeiB3k9cm8iGeXoXDAgYAlur6lNO2e5Zr8CQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScspWxCUPPIWkYeiB3k9cm8iGeXoXDAgYAlur6lNO2e5Zr8CQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nThank you for your time
nkxwhe|Discord logic! The game about everything as long as it’s related.|\nHow to play: \n1: Decide turn order (preferably based on order of icons in call)\n2: The first player will post a random image of anything. The second will post another image, (within a given time frame), along with a caption as to why it’s related. This continues, but a relation can not be the same as a previous one.\n3: Keep playing until someone fails to meet all of these requirements. Then, the loser has to say (initial picture) is like (last) because (initial) is like (next) which is like (next) which is like (last).\n\nAdditional rules:\n1: Call outs. When you think a persons logic is fallible, or that it’s been mentioned before, then you say ‘call out’. If you can prove your call out with most people agreeing, then that person loses. If you don’t, then it moves to your turn and you have a shorter time to act. You also can’t call out a turn if one has gone after it.\n2: Muting. It is polite to mute yourself while it’s during a call out.\n\nOptional rules:\n1: Points. You can decide to use points instead of just an instant lose. You gain points by the amount of seconds left in your turn when you post. You can also earn points by calling someone out, and proving it. In this case, they do not automatically lose, and you get the points they would. If you fail to meet the time limit, then you would not fail but rather revive no points. Play this until a certain amount of points or rounds. The least amount is the loser, and we know what happens to them.\n2: Long game. Whenever someone would lose and end the game, instead, they lose and the rest keep playing (with each consecutive loss adding more and more onto the ‘this is like that’ pile). The winner will not have to go through the losing process.
nkwofr|Cool horror/puzzle game idea|I got a great idea for a 2d horror/puzzle game.\n\nYou get a light and have to complete tasks to get to the next room. There would be 50 total rooms.\n\nThing is, to see you need to use the light but then creatures are attracted to you.\n\nWith the light off you cannot see but they will not be attracted to you. They cannot see you in the dark.\n\nThere would be a paranoia meter that scales the longer the light is off.\n\nYou would have a battery meter on your light that stops it from working. If your light stops, your paranoia meter goes up faster and you have to complete the level in complete darkness.\n\nYou can still interact and escape the room without a light but it's faster, and if you bump into a creature with the light off you will be chased by it.\n\nIf your paranoia meter goes to max you will scream, which will put your paranoia down 1/4, but it will alert the creatures to you.\n\nIf you are caught by a creature you have to restart the room. Some rooms will be long to raise the steaks of you being caught.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAlso give me credit please if you make or build off my idea.
nktn0l|a multiplayer horror where you haunt players to raise their heartbeats in order to kill them.|So been thinking about this for a while. Ive always wanted a game where the purpose of the game was to fully explore a randomize mansion without your heartbeat raising up to a certain rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir can be two ways to play the game. 1: use a real heartbeat sensor and try to calm yourself before the ghost uses an ability to scare you. 2. if you don't have a heartbeat sensor, the ghost abilities raises a game heartbeat if you are in sight of the haunting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more the mansion is explored the more abilities the ghost can unlock. starting by throwing objects, to showing your physical form or loud screeches, even hallucinations. When their heartbeat hit a certain rate, you can attack and damage the player. The ghost wins when you kill all players\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe players win once they explore the entire house and unlock the front door to leave. Lock doors are all over the house and some hidden doors would require puzzles to be solved in order to open them. Players can find items that helps discover if the ghost is in the room or temporary make the heartbeat stop functioning. (protecting the players from attacks.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway this is the basis of the game. A bit like phasmophobia but with a bit of pvp in it.
nktf9z|Accurate body atanomy and injuries|I love historically "accurate" games because they feel like a time machine. I just played rdr2 and it was the coolest shit. Buti feel like a harder games increases the sense of urgency and helps immerse you in danger. So what if a game as real as possible in terms of injuries. It's a little weird surviving a round to the face and then being the hero.
nksi9m|Dating sim that isn't a visual novel|hey! so I'm writing a game that focuses significantly on dating mechanics right now, but I don't want it to be a visual novel because they kind of bore me. I've seen some really great ideas in this sub so i wanted to post here.\n\nwhat kinds of features or mechanics could be in a game that focuses on building relationships while still having gameplay??
nkoeac|I’m sure this has been done to death, but, give me your “I could totally do Yandere Simulator better, I’d...” pitch|What are your ideas? How would you change the concept, the core gameplay, anything. I think its a semi-universal experience of hearing the story of Yandere Simulator’s development and go “oh well I could do better than that, I would...” \n\nI’ll start. Its a similar format, 2D instead of 3D, but its more of an homage to classic 80’s horror movies than a japanese trope. At the start of the game you are possessed by a “spirit” like a slasher, a slenderman-type, puzzle cube demon, (yes, one is a yandere) etc, and each have a “goal” be it simple like kill all campers, or complex like “reenact the conditions of how you died,” and you have a whole school year to figure out and activate your ploy, while fighting against spiritualists, investigators, and the girl you’re possessing who’s currently fighting you for control. Its the plot of all the horror movies we love but the player is taking the role of the monster, and gets to peak behind their curtain as to how to be this villainous thing.
nko9op|Colossi Raiders: Dark Souls meets Phantom Abyss|**Concept Overview:**\n\nWatching comparisons of the recent early-access title 'Phantom Abyss' to the phantom mechanic in Dark Souls I started to wonder if maybe the latter's asynchronous pseudo-multiplayer went far enough.\n\nThough I imagine most of this sub is familiar with Dark Souls, Phantom Abyss is new enough that I'll just run both down quickly anyway.\n\n*Dark Souls* features phantoms of other players going about their otherwise single-player adventures, which you can witness die and whom can leave messages for other players, allowing information to be shared between players without actually playing together.\n\n*Phantom Abyss* has similar asynchronous multiplayer, in which players try to complete a temple, for which everyone only has one try, whilst the ghosts of players (ala driving game ghosts) who have previously played (and died) in the temple do their own thing. This allows for information to be shared by watching what they do, where they go, and how they died.\n\nHere's my pitch at what a version of the two combined would look like.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThis is a boss rush game, of sorts. Giant colossi (think various Dark Souls or Shadow of the Colossus bosses) roam an otherwise empty wasteland world. You play as an RPG hero of some sort, with perhaps a limited class or loadout system (pre-game customisation, perhaps with unlockables or an in-game earned currency, but no progression once in-game). You are quickly thrust into an environment where you must do battle with one of these powerful entities.\n\nThen, you die. Almost certainly anyway. The bosses are designed to be unfair, overwhelmingly powerful, and capable of finishing you very quickly. Even if you survive their onslaught and dodge their attacks, you'll quickly find them to be HP sponges, and your own stamina to be a finite resource that comes back slower and slower every time you spend it. They *will* outlast you. Importantly you only get one chance per boss - you can go on to fight other bosses whenever you like but you failed at that one, your involvement in the fight against it is over.\n\nThat's okay though, because if you're not the last to fight it, you're probably not the first to fight the monster either. Every beast is it's own procedurally generated 'raid boss' style encounter (save for that you fight it solo), and it doesn't heal between players. You die, then another player turns up at the boss, weakens it further, and so on. Eventually someone turns up against a monster so tired and battered that it is a much easier kill.\n\n**Development Challenges:**\n\nFirstly, procedural generation would be a must. Phantom Abyss works because it has unique temples generated each run. A game like this would require interesting bosses to be generated from a wide pool of potential behaviours/mods/components in order to be challenging. Perhaps different environments, environmental hazards, and adds/mooks could contribute to this, but procedural generation of a single entity would be a design challenge to make feel right.\n\nI have limited experience with multiplayer development so I can't really speak to the challenge of asynchronous multiplayer development. You may be able to reconstruct phantoms from previous information shared by the player, tying that information to each boss instance generated (not unlike how the 'how you died' replays in first person shooters work).\n\nYou could perhaps add in a small 'true' multiplayer component as well, allowing players to band together in 2-4 player groups to challenge particularly powerful bosses. This might go against the 'whittle a big beast down gradually' design however, and highly skilled players being able to solo a monster is already a potential problem.\n\nA sense of progression would be difficult to attain in an otherwise rogue-lite experience. Meta-progression (unlockables or purchaseables for your character) would be a must. Perhaps when that final kill happens all players who fought it gain currency reward (for meta-progression) relative to their own contribution. This could be one of two meta-progression resources, another being experience earned when you die against the monster (which isn't contribution scaled allowing everyone to progress somewhat). See Phantom Abyss for how treasure is released when someone frees your trapped phantom. Sharing boss seeds to your friends to get them to help 'free' your earned currency could be a big part of the game.\n\nKey to the idea of 'a staggered raid taking down a big boss one by one', maybe different aspects of the boss can be broken and defeated piecemeal. The leg has a health bar, the wings have health bars, the eye laser attack has health, etc. Deal enough damage to a particular vital area and the boss cannot ever use that mod/component of themselves again, in all future encounters. 'BeastSlayerXXX42069 gouged out the eye of the colossus on the 4th May 2021' could be something that players loading into the arena see. You might have died but your accomplishment and contribution live on.\n\nOtherwise the key development problem would definitely come down to that common procedural generation design issue - how do you make it random enough to be 'new' most times, whilst handcrafted enough as to be identifiable? Whilst a mixture of procedural generation and handcrafted works great for world generation (see Spelunky), it would be very difficult to pull off with enemies. Perhaps some kind of augmentation/mutation system with cronenberg-like monstrosities where different generated 'mods' rolled into the beasties resulted in new appendages or behaviours. Graphically this could become a problem as well, if you wanted the game to look particularly compelling.\n\nAnyway, just thoughts I had this morn whilst procrastinating working on my own project. Hope someone can do something with this!
nkkkmu|horror game with no graphics|since horror games are mostly visually creepy and scary, I'd like to hear your ideas on how you could make a horror game scary with no graphics.\n\nno graphics doesn't mean no visuals. just no art. you can have text, shapes, lines, etc.
nkkdv4|An open world sandbox Dr Who game.|So pretty much as the title says. As an avid Dr who, Sci-Fi, space and general gaming fan this is something I've wanted to see for a long long time, I'm surprised there has been any decent Dr who games, but when "NMS" first came out it piqued my curiosity and want for a game like this. I have zero real knowledge of how to even begin to make it a reality ii am just a simple gamer with a dream for a game. But who wouldnt like to travel time and space in their own T.A.R.D.I.S?\n\n (First post here so apologies for poor formatting (posting on mobile) or any mistakes)
nk6m4m|A Wrestling MMO|Yes, I am going there.\n\nThe basic idea is, you make a character, you go to wrestling school (read: tutorial/training/grind), you train your stats, and join a promotion. You have stats such as charisma, technique (which lessens the chance of botches), popularity (which determines your income and crowd reaction), physical heatlh (the lower, the higher the chance of injury), as well as strength, dexterity, and intelligence, which are attributes directly linked to your character's in-ring-performance but only indirectly influence the crowd reaction. Note that popularity is different to crowd reaction. Popularity is your character's general likability while crowd reaction is the intended positive or negative reaction to your character's actions in a match.\n\nBooker: Ther person that determines the match type, and the outcome of the match. Booking is a template the player has to follow to get the best possible outcome and reward for the player. The booker determines what is and isn't allowed, how the match ends, and how long the match lasts.\n\nFace: The "hero" in a match that gets cheered on. Has to do everything to get a positive reaction (pop). Usually fights clean, can be beaten down and still able to turn the match in their favor (comeback).\n\nHeel: The "villain".  Does everything to get a negative reaction (heat). Fights dirty, and is able to turn the match with illegal tactics (if regular match). Heat also increases by disqualification.\n\nPop: Positive crowd reaction. Important for faces.\n\nHeat: Negative crowd reaction. Important for heels.\n\nTweener: Neutral character that can get away with illegal actions, but can also get a positive crowd reaction. Crowd reaction is limited, however.\n\nTag Team: A team of two wrestlers (and manager or valet) who compete in matches together.\n\nStable: A group of wrestlers or a faction within the promotion that includes 3 or more characters (not counting managers or valets).\n\nRun-In: Interference of another wrestler not scheduled to be involved in the match in any form. A member of a stable, for example, or another face rescuing the face from a predicament.\n\nGimmick: The in-ring's persona's most striking characteristic. Usually is an exaggerated trait (good or bad), but can also be completely made up. Gimmick is up to the player. The character's action, however, DO matter.\n\nSpot: A predetermined event in a match that pushes the story forward. A risky move, a counter that turns the match in the opponent's favor, or someone falling off a ladder or going through a table.\n\nSignature move: The trademark move for a character that sets them apart from other wrestlers. Sometimes a prelude to a finishing move, an invented move, or a spot or variation of said spot. Usually does not end matches, but can.\n\nFinishing move: The move a wrestler uses to end matches. doing a finishing move more than once, unless it didn't work the first time (evasion, counter, etc.) will get a bad crowd reaction.\n\nKayfabe: Immersion in the match and the willingness of the crowd to suspend disbelief. Kayfabe directly affects your character's popularity and decreases crowd reaction. In the game this would mean a face doing heel-ish things, such as using weapons when they aren't allowed or a heel trying to get a positive crowd reaction, as wll as ending a match too quickly or not as intended or injuring a character, or a character making a run-in when not intended, breaks kayfabe and therefore has a negative outcome for both players and the promotion. Also note that low popularity will decrease the chance of employment, as in it affects your gameplay heavily.\n\nYou also have a hometown-buff, which increases popularity whenever a show is held in your hometown (may it be Vienna, Dublin, New York, Buenos Aires, etc). This does not work in Live Shows that have a fixed location.\n\nYou have 2 types of shows: Live shows and taped shows. Well, more like taped shows and house shows, really.\n\nLive Shows are usually "booked" on the fly, so improvisation is necessary. Less charisma is required in a live show, and you can become a fan favourite, though popularity, status and income (money you can buy things with, for example additional training equipment or newer, flashier clothes that will boost stats) will be much less. It's basically a quick instance for people who don't have much time or don't want to spend much time in the game. By choice, any rando (free agent) could come in for the show and be booked, if one chooses to do so. They are more forgiving when things don't go as well as planned.\n\nTaped shows, on the other hand are much more time intensive. You have preparation time, and usually it is a series of booked matches. It is much more rewarding, but also a lot more risky, as it can make or break your character. You can only compete in these promotions if you are a part of said promotion.\n\nGameplay would be turn-based. Players have to work together and play their roles for the best outcome. The matches themselves are instances that can last from 10 seconds to 25 minutes (in rare cases, also 60 minutes), depending on match type. Moves performed will either gain pop or heat. It should also be noted that if you gain pop, the character's heat will be decreased and vice versa. Some moves or actions may also gain short term buffs. Objectives (spots, etc.) are fulfilled during the match.
nk5qjo|The 6 degrees of Bacon|For those that don't know, it is said that any actor or actress can be connected to Kevin Bacon in 6 degrees or less.\n\nIn this game, players take turns trying to connect any given actor/actress to any other actor/actress in order to score points. \n\nTo begin, each player writes down 10 actors/actresses that have had roles in at least 2 or more films on 10 individual pieces of paper/card which are then collected and shuffled. Then each player is dealt three cards.\n\nOnce it is decided which player goes first, that player must take a card from the top of the deck of cards and read the name aloud.\n\nThen the player's opponents must submit a single card from their hand faced down. Once all the submitted cards have been shuffled, the player selects a single card and reads this name aloud in order to start a minute long timer. \n\nIf a player can connect the two actors/actresses in a single connection i.e where they have starred in the same film, the player wins 6 points. The more connections the player needs to make, the less points they will win. Make more than 6 connections and the player will still win a single point but if they cannot make a connection between their pair of actors/actresses before time runs out, they score nothing. \n\nOnce a player has finished their turn, the rest of the submitted cards are placed at the bottom of the deck and opponents replenish their hand of three by taking cards from the top of the deck before the next player's turn begins. \n\nThis game is more for film buffs than anything but any feedback here is good too 🙂
nk5560|FPS, enemies chasing you, but you can only shoot at their reflections.|Demon dudes running at you all Serious Sam-like, but the only way to kill them is shooting at their reflections on mirrors, puddles or even at their images on screens.\n\nSo it's all about finding the right position to get them. Also I guess it'd work nice for some stealthing.\n\nMore of a weapon idea than a game idea isn't it?
nk4f57|A 3rd person, semi-open world Suicide Squad game with customizable teams|When I say "customizable teams" I mean that you will have dozens of characters to make what you feel is the perfect team for whatever mission you have in the game, as some characters would give you advantages and disadvantages. There are also multiple skins available for the game as well\n\nCertain characters have rivalries/special dialogues &amp; more\n\nThe story would focus on the adventures of Task Force X as they do Amanda Waller's dirty work before they escape from her control and Belle Reve prison.
nk2va1|My video game idea|I wanna make refrences to a few other games that i think would be good if they merged into one game...  So first off I think this game should be very customizable with a mix gameplay of black and white 2,sims4,gta,manhunt,thief,assassin's creed,skyrim.. I know that is very mixxed up and kinda doesn't make sense but just an idea.. so in black and white 2 u play a god who has control over a certain area/land and u have to go against other areas/lands their might be other games like this already but what im thinking is mix this with sims 4 which gives u the ability to play as the god/head of the world but then just like sims 4 u get to experience the lives of individuals within ur world aswell... so in black and white 2 u get to play different paths depending on how u treat ur lands u get more grim reality streets look more run down ETC... for my idea of a game i want this to be similar to how it plays out... u can build ur world/worlds.. choose to go to war with other worlds/lands whatever choose to be either peaceful and good within ur world or evil and bad within ur world... the process from good to evil must take time and work.. so u cant just change a good land into a bad land or a bad land into a good land you will have to work on it by building infrastructure\n\nChanging the hearts and minds of the people because for this game i think traits should be included for different lets say "people" within the game world.. Similar to the way it is for sims 4 with a little exception... different "types" of people within the game should come with a collective trait as a group black and white 2 played on this idea a little... but beyond traits as a group also individual traits.. or however it works it should be that their are all types of different people within your population who react differently to different things.. (however this would work).. Next I think relationships within ur population should also be a thing similar to the way it is in sims 4 also with the made up language in sims 4 i think stuff becomes less repetitive but for this game i think it should be less goofy... probably a  impossible task but i think it should still be suggested... that their are different made up languages within the game that are similar to real world languages.. kinda like that Dothraki language from game of thrones? I think that language would fit for a type of people with harsh traits..\n\n Next the actual gameplay of the game... Well I already said i think u should have the ability to play the game as a lord in the sky and then u can play as a individual but what to do as a individual? well similar to sims 4 if ur living in a peaceful place or even a bad place u should be able to live and do jobs within the land... even in black and white 2 u can select a random person and put them to work and then follow their life until they grew old and die... it should be this way in this game... how long u play as a individual depends on you.. (or until they die) but the lifespan should be customizable depending on ur tastes... u should also be able to follow this individual's life from childhood (going to schools built within the land aswell) now for the gameplay about gta,manhunt,thief,assasin's creed and skyrim... So lets say you dont want to be a good schoolkid and become a good adult... you can start doing bad things from childhood in this game... using similar mechanics to these games because once u play an individual it wont be like sims but more like gta u know... so what do u want to do? steal cars if u want or become a serial killer like manhunt a soldier like imperial legion skyrim or a thief within the land and assassin's creed to become a assassin and parkour legend... also the overall happiness,stability,peace should matter throughout the entire land and if u move from a bad land to a good land you should feel the effect... as different people with different traits will react differently and the overall peace of an area will get different reactions.. well that's about it i think.
nk2ug1|Cyberpunk Resource Management/Strategy/Socially Complicated Idea...|Cyberpunk is kinda the style du-jour lately, but I got thinking about something that Cyberpunk (both the TTRPG as well as the recent buggy AAA video game) touch on that really could have been expanded on. Characters in Cyberpunk are connected to each other, and those connections factor into how a given conflict or story could unfold, or exactly how dire the consequences of success or failure could be if your character isn't really invested in the fates of everyone else. Imagine a game where you build up a faction of cyberpunk style characters into a personalized faction (gang? crime syndicate? revolutionaries? mercs? corp clean up team?) that is in competition with any number of other similar factions on a city scale. Think..  \n\n\n\- XCOM2 style basebuilding of an underground lair/front/base/etc.. who joins up with you might depend on the kind of front you set up. Nightclubs attract all types of folks and earn good money. But when they get that soundproof booth in the basement, the biz starts really coming in. Merc hideouts are well hidden and protected, but expensive. Standard level work won't pay the rent here forever. Streetdoc clinics get lots of wounded, and those that live are pretty thankful. But once they discovered you were using expired synth-kidneys and twitchy neuroadapters on the sly, biz didn't do so good. And so on..\n\n\- Shadow of War style NPC generation, including concepts like class, skill specialties, fashion style, and most importantly, relationships with other NPCs and players. Can you really trust them? How do you know? What kind of things have they gotten involved with with the other NPCs/PCs? How will that change? Could an enemy suddenly become a good friend because of a single choice? Could someone be stabbed in the back by somone they thought they loved? What happens when you save the life of a friend that was secretly an assassin sent to kill you? And so on..\n\n\- 'upgrade' or 'adapt' your Faction members over time with cybernetics, cool gear, a wide variety of weapons and attachments. Sometimes because you can! Sometimes because you have to. Maybe that one merc friend you have needs a new arm after losing one in a firefight. Or maybe that streetdoc could use new eyes so he can start doing more complicated work. Just remember, if it ain't nailed down it could still be stolen or lost. And if its hardwired to your skin well, some people don't care so much about that. And so on..\n\n\- combat (in whatever form it takes) is chunky, brutal and quickly resolved. Death is permeant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlike.. a wierd mashup of xcom, syndicate, shadow of war... not sure if solo, multi, co-op etc.. any of those might be cool tho.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n.... also hi. I haven't posted on reddit in a long time and I'm clinically depressed. Hello.
nk2tab|A horror game concept with a senior citizen diseased.|So these days i finished the game resident evil 7, And now im gonna play the saga silent hill and after finish the game one thing comes in my head, "**What if there a game where we play with a 60-65 diseased man/woman and have to survive with these illnesses."**\n\nFor example im the game i have pneumonia and i have to cover my mouth to the enemy dont hear me coughing, I cant run too much because of the age, i have amnesia and only can advance in the part when the character remember for a example i go to the objective but the character cant go until he remember and in this intervale that he gonna remember you need to hide from the enemy, The last example i have is the character have parkison syndrome and he has limited movement like he cant crouch he cant lie down and run he can only hide on cabinets and escape from the enemy without the enemy seeing him.\n\nIm with this idea in my mind for a month and i wanted to pass this concept for you guys because i dont see too much games and never see a horror game with a old-aged man/woman. What you do you think of this concept?.

njood6|Animal Crossing but with gross creepy Zerg-like themes instead of innocent children and animals|I think it’d be fun to play a game with the intimate and slower pacing of Animal Crossing but working towards a cooler purpose, like developing your swarm of semi-gross aliens.

njkr9s|Ideas for single player first person game? (3d)|Not too advanced ideas, I'am intermediate dev.
njjp8w|Star Wars|A Star Wars game with the style of Halo Wars.\nMaybe have different campaigns for the 3 era's. You can unlock special units, upgrades and hero/villain characters by completing each campaign on different difficulties.\nHave 2 campaigns for each era where you play as either faction.\nMaybe add in special modes where you battle special enemies like death troopers(the zombie ones), planet specific enemies(Geonosians, Umbarans, Twi'leks, Death Watch and the Super Commandos, Wookies, etc. and maybe have random planet specific creature attacks(Nexu, Massiff, Vixus, etc.).
njj8et|Rockstar collab|I think it would be really cool, also expensive, if rockstar were to collab with Disney and create a Star Wars game. In which you start as a stormtrooper with a plan to take over the whole empire.\n\nI don’t know if someone has came up with already but it just crossed my mind and thought of sharing that concept.
njgwiv|Turn Based Combat Sim But Actions Are Queued Up And Applied At Once|In turn based combat sims you usually play out an entire turn where you move all of your units one after another, or the units are shuffled so you and your opponent take turns moving a single unit at a time.\n\nMy idea is a turn based combat sim where you queue up your entire teams actions at once (as well as your opponent) and play them all out together.\n\nSome actions would make other actions impossible (pawn A blow up bridge, pawn B run across bridge) so it would need to be coded in a way where the pawns verify their action is still possible throughout performing them or having them halt midway through if their action suddenly becomes impossible.

njcp58|Is it possible to develop a game like the division?|I am wanting to develop a game similar to the division 1/2, post apocalyptic city, different factions, looter shooter and making builds. I always start making my game for a month or so then immediately stop. \n\nIs there any other game equivalent to the division that i can make?\n\nThe main mechanics of the game is mmorpg, looter shooter and a city scene (Sacramento or Philadelphia and Camden)
njay9y|Opinions|Ok so I have a game idea but if I write it right does it sound like something you'd play.\n\n So here's the summary.....You play as a teenager in a weird landscape and your goal is to collect items but it's not required to finish the game but towards the end of the game and a little though out something try's to break through (there is also enemies) and when you reach the end of the game you find out that those items you can collect were there to distract you from what was happening in reality. \n\nSo does that sound like a good game also it would be 2d
njaqhg|Overwatch/Battlefield game- 12 players no role lock, but players dont choose classes but individual heroes similar to overwatch. bigger maps+more players=less teamwork, more individual contribution, more fun|
nja1dr|1 vs All Multiplayer Tactical Shooter inspired by Rambo or Die Hard|Imagine you are the "hero" of an action thriller, deployed in a closed-off environment with nothing but a basic gun and a knife. You have to eliminate all players on the enemy team or do some sort of objective (detonate a bomb, save 1 or more hostages, etc.). You use the environment to your advantage. You hide, sneak up on enemies that are wandering alone, and pick them off one by one. Eliminating an enemy drops all their guns and gadgets which you can pick up and use against the rest.\n\nThe enemy team is composed of 5-10 players who don't know where you are, but they know that you're coming for them. They don't have a radar or minimap or death counter of any kind, so they don't know when one of their teammates is eliminated.\n\nMaps would need a lot of cover and places to hide. There should be many routes to get to the objective. For example, if we have a skyscraper map, you can use the elevator, take the stairs, climb through air ducts or even break windows and scale the building walls from the outside.\n\nPlaying as the "hero" would probably only appeal to the most hardcore shooter fans, but using stealth and strategy I think even intermediate players could do well. Also, it would lead to a lot of amazing moments when you're in a tense 1v5 firefight and you come out as the winner.
nj7r6r|Eldritch Horror without fighting|Share some ideas on how you would make game centering around the Eldritch Horror theme but your main character cannot fight the creatures (ie. while they can fight or struggle to get away, they’re not picking up an assault rifle and going toe to tentacles with things)\n\nWhat would the character look and act like?\nWhat mythos would you use? (Bonus points for non-Cthulhu gods)\n\n\nOff-topic: First  time posting so I’d thought I’d start with getting creative juices going!
nj4mxe|Help Evil Corp take corporate domination and take over and destroy the planet forever.|When I was a kid I used to play this game called Syndicate, It was like a cyberpunk thing where you go around zapping people and taking over their minds. I'm sure there was a lot more to it than that but I cant really remember.  So I imagine the atmosphere of this game would look a lot like Syndicate, but the mechanics more like something like civilization mixed with something of a mafia or sim city type vein.  But your job is literally to destroy the planet... You have to figure out way to dump oil on beaches, destroy nature, log forests, turn entire swaths of the planet into mindless drones through drugs, advertising and media manipulation, buy politicians to get your laws passed, assassinate all the pesky do-gooders and whoever gets in your way, take over competitive companies, keep new eco technologies from ever seeing the light of day, all while staying a well respected businessman. (you lose the game by getting caught, not bribing the right people, or having the laws passed etc. money goes into  patent law, bribery, buying out competition, you know all the regular corporate stuff.)\n\n\nMaybe this will teach people a little more about how its done, raise awareness a little. I'm really not sure how I feel about the mental impact a game like this would have on the player. And of course the problem with real corporations is way more nuanced than this, but Im getting at the tactics at work behind corporate shenanigans that are hidden from most people. I feel like there are so many real life examples to be used in something like this.
nj1h2z|A game that uses both desktop and mobile|I've been messing around with the idea of making a desktop game that connects to your mobile device through a link to get inputs or display info. My first thought was to use the mobile as a gamepad controller and make twin stick shooter but that seemed very uninspired and I wanted to try something unique. Would love suggestions on what I could make.\n\nNotes: The only inputs that can be made on mobile is the touchscreen, can't use gyro or tilt functionality. Also, I want to minimise the load on mobile, so preferably something light and minimal would be best
nj0ka7|Unique city builder themes/settings?|The more unrealistic the  better. Yet it still has commercial, industrial, residential zoning etc.\n\n* Pseudo-Stone age city builder. Not limited to caveman villages, but all the buildings look like they are made out of stone. Bit like Flintstones without dinosaurs.\n\n* Hell city builder. City builder in hell. Resource gathering, required walls and fortifications against Demons. Some mild Factorio elements (supplying the defenses) and Anno elements (with a bit of combat on top of the city building)\n\n* Cardboard box, toy city builder. Buildings out of cardboard, cars and people look plastic. Otherwise, the economy and infrastructure is as complex as a normal city builder, the setting just looks like a scrappy cardboard diorama.\n\n* Transport-focused arcadey city builder that really leans into "as many trains as possible, as many planes as possible". Roads exist only around buildings in a square, no extra roads can be built. Rails are hyper efficient and can do unrealistic, roller coaster like paths even for heavy long trains.
nipdz1|Mad science - Disrupting the tech tree mechanic|The idea of disrupting the vanilla tech tree mechanic.\n\nI've seen games do tech trees/research in a couple ways\n\n1. In game menu, spend resources to unlock\n2. Randomized unlock (gambling almost)\n3. Find it in the world, you can research it without needing dependencies via tree\n\nWhat if research has failure? What if that failure was fun?\n\nThe premise, is that the tech tree is hidden information mostly, procedurally generated server side, such that all players have the same tech tree.\n\nYou may or may not know/see end goal (recipes). In the cases that you know what you are trying to build, but don't yet know it, it tells you generic categories that you may need. Example of this is a car engine. You need to know electronics, combustion, mechanical kinetic conversions (gears, pistons, etc).\n\nRegarding failure... things explode. Maybe your nuclear reactor melts down while trying to fix/upgrade it.\n\nMaybe you create a genetically engineered super bee by accident, and it infests your laboratory.\n\nMaybe you are doing advanced particle physics and you create a black hole that destroys your lab. Or a rift to another world/dimension that aliens/demons come through to reek havoc.\n\nShare successes and failures with friends. Mislead your competition with false data?

nidzs1|Game Idea: Shipping building + Pirating game | MMOG|Okay so imagine:\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nYou start off in a little row boat in the middle of a massive procedurally generated ocean world with lots of little islands to explore. You paddle around and collect resources (driftwood, fish, etc) and do little side quest missions and get paid in booty (gold, rubies, treasure etc). As you collect more stuff, you can upgrade your vessel.\n\n**Vessel upgrading:**\n\nYou start off in a small row boat. But you can quickly increase the square footage of your vessel by paying wood + iron. You can use gold to hire more crew mates. It would be a similar vibe as Sims, just for a boat (a bit more constrained of course). You can upgrade to a multi-level boat. You can install cannons (strength) + more sails (speed). The bigger the boat, the more gold you need to hire crew. For the crew, you need kitchens, sleeping quarters, etc. You can also have a hierarchy within your crew (chief mate (you), second mate, third mate, etc). These crew members can gain XP when battling or completing missions. Experienced crew operate the ship more efficiently (++speed, ++strength). There can be all sorts of cool upgrades that you can do on your ship.\n\n**Fighting:**\n\nBattle other (real) players who you encounter on the big open ocean will of course be an important aspect of the game. All online players sailing around in the same massive world. There will be lots of skill and strategy involved in battling another ship. How strong is your ship? 32 cannons? How agile and fast is your boat? If you win, you get all the reserve "booty" that the other ship had in the form of treasures chests that float in the water as the other ship is sinking. You may even nab a few of the opponents crewmates. It would of course be best to sail around with a gang of pirate friends so that if you do cross paths with an enemy, you can easily defeat them. You and your friends can all design your sail colors and flags the same to represent your gang identity.\n\n**Quests:**\n\nThere will be lots of side quests and missions that you can do in the world. Completing these give you resources and bounty. These quests are mainly found amongst the millions of small scattered islands and lagoons. Quests are typically fulfilling bounties. For example, kill a sea monster and receive 1000 gold coins. Or defeat a local group of pirates and get a free ship upgrade. These quests will help your battling skills (needed for when you encounter real players on the open seas!)\n\n**Item collecting:**\n\nLike games like Diablo &amp; Elder Scrolls, one of the most addicting parts of the game will be the item collecting. Besides the ordinary things like fish, wood, gold, minerals, etc. You can find rare artifacts that can be embedded or placed o your ship to boost various attributes. These rare artifacts can be obtained through side quests or just simply found.\n\n**More:**\n\nThere will also be "neutral" waters and islands. Here you can trade with other players, sell/buy goods from local merchants, and anchor your ship without having to fear attack. The map should be procedurally generate (endless) except for maybe a handful of the neutral areas that are designed by hand. Side quests should be endless (like Diablo).\n\nI have so many more ideas about the game... But curious what people think of the idea!

nhzl4i|Avatar the Last Airbender Deckbuilding Roguelike|Imagine a Slay the Spire-type game with ATLA characters. You play as either Toph, Aang, Katara, Zuko, or Sokka, crawling through a procedurally generated dungeon using turn-based, synergy heavy deckbuilding combat. Each character has their own starting passive ability, cards to choose from, and slightly different mechanics.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nPlot: Like Slay the Spire, the plot is minimal to non-existent. It would be non-cannon &amp; implausible to the continuity. It would be almost dreamlike.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\n***In this section, I just kinda explain the mechanics of Slay the Spire, so you can skip over this if you already know the game\n\nLike Slay the Spire, you’d go through a procedurally generated dungeon, taking down opponents room-by-room to reach the boss at the end. You build &amp; utilize a deck of cards, each corresponding to different bending moves &amp; techniques in turn-based combat. And just like STS, you can always see the opponent’s next intended move so you can plan accordingly. Along the way, you collect items that provide unique passive abilities (like Spirit Water, Glider, Bison Whistle, the Waterbending Scroll, White Lotus Tile, ect.) Each time you defeat a room, you are allowed to choose 1 of 3 random cards to add to your deck.\n\nEach card costs energy, and you begin the game with a maximum of 3. Each turn, your energy is restored. Each character’s starting deck would contain 5 basic attack cards, 5 block cards (which work like temporary HP that disappears at the start of your next turn), and 2 special character-specific cards. Cards can all be upgraded once; some cards are granted a damage increase or a block increase, some have their energy cost lowered, some gain an edition also effect, ect.\n\nThe path to the end is branching, so to choose a path, you always will be able to see what each room is on the map: Normal Combat, Mini-Boss Combat, Healing &amp; Upgrade Site, Shop, Mystery Room, or Treasure Room.\n\nLike every roguelike, if you die, you start over with a new dungeon, and because of the randomness, no two runs of the game are similar. You have to adapt your strategy throughout each play run, meaning the only way to advance further is to get better at the game.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nWhile I’d love the game to be more-or-less a knockoff of Slay the Spire, there are some ideas I have that would make it unique:\n\n• Elemental Interaction System •\n\n\nSome waterbending moves could inflict a “Soaked” debuff on targets. The debuff would stack &amp; diminish each turn. Soaked targets could be frozen, sapped of moisture for bonus energy, lowered mobility (whatever that means in a turn-based game), and dealt half Fire damage &amp; double Lightning damage.\n\nSome fire moves would set opponents ablaze. While Airbending would dry Soaked enemies off &amp; put out flames. Water &amp; Earth could interact to make mud, Water &amp; Air could make mist, ect.\n\n• Environments •\n\nBecause the Avatar world involves manipulating the elements, which cards can be played will often depend on the surrounding environment. The randomly generated surrounding area could be made of wood, earth, or metal. It could be flooded, causing all the enemies to start combat with the Soaked debuff, or there could be plants to draw moisture from or control. I think the dungeons would be randomly selected from a few environments. I imagine things like The Swamp, North Pole, Cave of Two Lovers, Spirit World, Sun Sage Temple, Boiling Rock, Day of Black Sun, a Fire Nation Ship Convoy, ect. Each environment will have different bending resources, different opponents, and therefore, different tactics. \n\nEx. In a Swamp environment, enemies will likely be wet, so a Zuko player would have to focus on abilities that utilize his swords, or dry off enemies. However, Fire attacks would do more damage to plant enemies.\n\nEx. Toph’s cards that utilize her Seismic Sense won’t always work on snow or wood. There could be a few cards that provide her with Earth to stand on in these cases, or she can focus on Metalbending.\n\n• Character Encounters •\n\nAlong the way, the player could encounter characters from the show in the mystery rooms. Depending on the character, these encounters could do several different things. Either for free, as a prize if you beat them in a fight, or in exchange for a trade-off, these characters will give you certain unique rewards.\n\nA master could spar with you, unlocking a new bending subtype if you win (metalbending, plantbending, sandbending, sword mastery for sokka, ect). This would unlock a whole new pool of cards to find.\n\nThe character may teach you a valuable move, granting you a card that cannot be unlocked anywhere else, like Iroh teaching you lightning redirection. Or Bumi teaching you about neutral jing.\n\nAnd depending on different factors, some characters will even accompany you for the rest of your run. This includes characters like Suki, Ty Lee, Mai, Momo, Appa, any of the Freedom Fighters, and if you can afford it, Combustion Man or June. These characters joining your party act as passive assists who stand beside you in battle.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nFinally, let’s discuss characters:\n\n🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊\n\nKatara would have cards dealing with Water, Ice, and Healing. She would need to manage her water sources in order to bend, and could unlock the Water Pouch item to increase her total energy each turn. She could also learn how to Plantbend or even Bloodbend if she meets Hama. (Again, non-cannon)\n\nSome of her signature moves that would be incorporated include:\n\n• Water Whip\n\n• Water Arms\n\n• Octopus Form\n\n• Wave Surfing\n\n• Healing\n\n• Icicles\n\n🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨\n\nToph would be able to see multiple enemy intents using her seismic sense. She would be a defensive character with more heavy &amp; costly attacks than light &amp; cheap ones. Since Toph “waits &amp; listens,” her main strong suit would be cards that plan ahead. I imagine cards that grant benefits to Toph next turn, as well as cards that prepare reactions (like “prevent the next time you would be dealt melee damage, then inflict Defense Down on the attacker”). She focuses on incapacitating enemies, thinking ahead, &amp; attacking straight-on. Over time, she could unlock Metal Bending, Sand Bending, and Lava Bending.\n\nSome of her signature moves include:\n\n• Earth Armor\n\n• Seismic Sense\n\n• Earth Tunnel\n\n• Dust Cloud\n\n• Neutral Jing\n\n🪃🪃🪃🪃🪃🪃\n\nSokka’s cards would involve his machete &amp; boomerang, his wit, and most importantly: his strategic prowess. He could have skills that bend the rules, taunt enemies, and manipulate his cards with skills that draw, reorder, discard, duplicate, shuffle, ect. He would be a very cost-efficient character, being able to play more cards per turn (in fact, I think his passive ability would be drawing more cards per turn.) His runs would also have more character encounters, as he meets Piandao, Hakota, the inventor man (forgot the name), Suki, Yue, and Hawky.\n\nSome of his signature moves include:\n\n• Boomerang\n\n• Sand Attack (like his fight with Piandao)\n\n• Space Sword\n\n• Sneak Attack\n\n🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nZuko would utilize Firebending, twin swords, and semi-acrobatics to be a high-damaging character. Along the way, he could learn Lightning Redirection from Iroh, or dancing dragon style from the Sun Sages. He could run into Jet and be given the choice to fight him or hide all of his firebending for the rest of the run in exchange for adding the freedom fighters to the party.\n\nSome of his signature moves include:\n\n• Twin Swords\n\n• Aerial Fireball\n\n• Lightning Redirection\n\n• Fire Onslaught

nhtwcq|Open World in games that are usually not so open|So this probably has been suggested already, and I feel like it's not an original idea but I haven't seen it so here goes.\nI've always wanted a racing game that would not be racing only, instead that would be the "main questline" of the game. We could leave our vehicle and go around exploring, personally buying things for our car, maybe doing some action sequence missions tied to the main story, or just exploring, but the main missions would be more race related (since it's primarily a racing game, only bigger and with more freedom). I've imagined the same thing for fighting games, like boxing and stuff where we could have our apartment and go out to train in the gym and explore the city and meet people for quests. I wonder why hasn't anyone made a game like that yet, mixing up the genres. I think it could be pretty cool and even help set up new standards.
nht5jt|Vampire Valheim - Survival horror where you are the monster|So Valheim-esque where you survive, craft, hunt, boss fight, progress through biomes and get stronger with all your skills.\n\nBut you are a primordial evil being that devours souls.\n\nYou start off naked and alone, hurt by sunlight so you are only active at night. Defeating enemies grants you a portion of their power. Deer - speed, Boars - strength, Frogs - leap, Humans - resistance to sunlight so you can be active for longer. Your appearance could even change depending on how proficient you were with skills, lvl 99 flight may have big wings, can always hide with clothing.\n\nYou can craft simple things but need knowledge from human civilisations scattered throughout the world to build bigger and better equipment, houses, forges etc. \n\nFirst island you are trapped on because water burns you, you must obtain the knowledge of boats to progress. Each biome is a different theme of human civilization. Viking -wood &amp; boats, Medieval - metal &amp; range, Egyptian - stone &amp; magic, Feudal Japan - black powder &amp; alchemy.\n\nEach biome would have human villages or cities you could terrorise, hide in, destroy or subjugate depending on how you treat the population and their figures of power. Kill - absorb 100% power but raise population fear, Let live - raise fear and renown, Thrall - give power to raise renown. Some civilisations will hate and fear you, some will try and hunt you down, some may worship you openly or in secret.\n\nBosses would be high ruling figures of the population or other monsters from their mythology. Gathering materials is for armour, weapons or magic ingredients - valheim food, or buildings. \n\nCombat can be unarmed, various weapons, mana can be used to cast spells - fireball, wolf transform, invisibility. All ranking up with usage and depending on the enemies you farm for power.\n\nMultiplayer means different civilisations fear/worship different beasts or monsters and may hunt your feral friend who kills all their sheep but whisper prayers to you who saved their king from a Troll.
nhrh3y|Animal Spirit: An open world puzzle game similar to Myst where you are the ghost of an animal|Feel free to use this idea.\n\nMost ghost stories involve human ghosts, or evil creature type ghosts, but in this game you’re the ghost of a dog or cat.  You were murdered by mean people that abuse animals.  Your unfinished business to to help animals in distress and to bring your killers to justice.\n\nThe game is a blend of Myst and a Nintendo GameCube game called “Geist”, where you were a disembodied spirit that could possess objects and living things (although in this game you can only possess certain objects). In the physical world, you need to possess objects and do things with them to accomplish certain tasks and progress. In spirit realms, you can interact with your environment more easily, but you don’t want to be out of the physical world for too long or you will be pulled into the afterlife and the game is over.  Sometimes, there are portals to a spirit realm, but other times you are sucked in automatically.  Throughout the game, you can interact with other ghosts (human and animal), and in some cases you will need to accomplish tasks with them to progress.\n\nYou can play as either a dog or a cat, and you can adjust the physical appearance at the start of the game.  Dogs are more social, and may be better at interactions with other ghosts. Cats, on the other hand, may be better at some solitary tasks.  I recommend that dogs and cats have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nMovement is 3-D and open world.  You appear solid in a spirit realm and translucent in the physical world.  As with all ghosts, gravity has no impact on you, and you can move through solid objects and orient yourself in any direction (there is no “up” or “down”).  In a spirit realm, you cannot move through objects, since your environment’s reality phase is the same as yours.\n\nYou win the game when you have saved all of the animals throughout the game and brought your killers to justice. You lose by either not escaping a spirit realm in time or failing to accomplish mission critical objectives.  Either way, you go to the afterlife at the end of the game, whether your business is finished or not.\n\nThe game should involve complex puzzles like the games in the Myst series.
nhktql|SugarCave|In this game i was thinking of a game that has a candy theme open world going on but it a high stakes platformer &amp; puzzles solve. This is similar to hollow knight or Mario but 3d like it takes two but solo for most part. The main story line is about a gummy, marshmallow and jelly boy that is trying to stop the  infestation genre engineered insects. This insects where sent by a company that would like to mine the cave for resources. The main gameplay is focus on Guerrilla War tactics and completing puzzles. There is cosmetics for the player to achieve and there is a multiplayer where you race through the platforms with other players just finished first at the finish line. Other game mode where you begin chase by players and have to beat insects along the way like minecraft sped runs. Next gamemode would be a swarm Arena where you fight different insects like shadow of war. The enemies can survive if you make them retreat but they will hold  a grudge on you and try to randomly attack you when free roaming on platforms or you are back in the area. The free roaming lets you take rescue missions bounteous races and random mini games. There is two hubs one for the player and another one for multi player. The player can have a home base for themselves and customize it and the multi player hub is more of large market city to shop with in game currency. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and critiques

nhdgrr|1v1 Randomized FPS|So I've signed up to reddit to be able to have a place where I can output all the little ideas I get while gaming, most will probably be eh but maybe one will be a hidden gem to someone and they will act on it and I will have a fun game to play :D\n\nSo I just thought about this today.\n\n1v1 Randomized FPS - What does this mean?\n\nI was thinking of having a case opening system like csgo, but whatever gun/weapon you get from the box you will have to use for the round. I think having a bo3 or bo5 will be best. The 3 randomized items you should be able to get would be an ability, main weapon, and some sort of utility. But heres the catch, you will get a certain amount of money every round like in csgo/valorant so you could choose where you want to spend your cash on. Do you have a T1 or a T3 rifle? well maybe the tier 1 could be $500 and the tier 3 could be $2000 with the tier 3 doing more damage. Utility could consists of multiple smoke grenades, stimshots, hearbeat sensor, etc.  I really enjoy doing 1v1s in various games and I think this would add a pretty cool twist and the matches could go pretty fast. For the abilties im still not sure on but im sure i could add on to it later if anyone would like to hear more. Let me know what you think or if theres games similar to this already!
nh8ske|Procedurally Generated Hunter/Gatherer RTS|This game will be similar in theme to Oregon Trail, only it will be centered on a tribe of stone age humans. There is no enemy except starvation and fickle mother nature. The tribe will grow and shrink based on the player's success gathering resources from the environment. Each play session will take place in a procedurally generate  map with different resources scattered about the map. At the end of the play session the tribe will move on to a new map with fresh resources. \n\nDuring a play session the player will need to send out tribesmen to scout the new area and locate resources such as berries, animals, water, wood, and flit. Harvesting tribesmen can the sent out with the appropriate tools to gather these resources. Wild Animals can be hunted but also may pose a threat to gatherers. \n\nGathering enough food and water for the tribe's needs will result in population growth between play sessions. Failure to gather enough will result in some tribes men abandoning your tribe   between play sessions. Also casualties from Wild Animals persist between play session. The number of tribesmen the player can have in the field is determined by tribe population. The type of tribesman is determined by the tools on hand. Tools can be constructed from gathered flint or traded at random events between play sessions.

nh3tgd|Underwater Photography Simulator|I wanted to share the idea I had for an open world game about underwater exploration. The game would be set on Earth in realistic aquatic environments. You would play as an underwater photographer with the goal of documenting as many species species of aquatic organisms as possible, aswell as documenting the various behaviors of said species.\n\nThe gameplay would consist of SCUBA diving in various environments on Earth to look for and photograph various species. I don't think I would want realistic SCUBA diving mechanics, I would just want to explore the ocean unimpeded.\n\nSome species would only appear under specific circumstances, and other species would have unique behaviors under various circumstances. For example, some predators may only come out to hunt at night. Some species are migratory and only appear on certain days, and some species prey on said migratory species. Some species, such as corals, only reproduce on certain days. To photograph these species/behaviors, the game could tell you when they are likely to happen. You would have to plan out some dives ahead of time to have a chance to encounter some of the more unique things in the game.\n\nYou would also be able to randomly encounter very rare species. Some examples of rarer species might include deepwater sharks such as megamouth sharks, some pelagic fish such as the ocean sunfish, and some Cetaceans.\n\nPlease tell me what you think about my idea, and where I need to improve it.\n\nThis idea is heavily inspired by the Endless Ocean series.
ngy2wj|Splinter cell like battle royale|ok so hear me out. The entire map in this game would have light areas and dark areas it would also be small. Unlike splinter cell you don't have night vision, but there are gadgets around like thermal goggles and a flashlight which like in chaos theory are only useful if you want to really make sure there are people there(a flashlight isn't in chaos theory but having a weapon that is turned on or off and  may reveal both your self and enemy players is interesting).  the only way to kill is to land on someone's head or  sneak behind them. At the end of the round dead players will come back as armed mercenaries(can't pick up items) (can be killed) and if your opponent dies from you or them first, you win.
ngx8e0|Online Life Simulator, but you have roles|That's it. That is the idea... I want to develop something that would be the child of GTA V and Club Penguin, the game where you can be anyone you want, date anyone you want and even kill other players. As far as your role is a killer or something.

ngtd47|A concept I posted on the CnC subreddit but gained little to no attention.|~~~~~~Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 4 ~~~~~~\n\nSometime after the Events of Uprising, FutureTech Corp. has nearly taken over the World, but several fraudulent and anti-competitive practices has led the Corporation into a trial by the newly-formed International Alliance for Global Defence (IAGD) in the IAGD Unified Court in Paris, France. They were severely weakened by this series of trials and revelations. Someone took advantage of this, the Soviet Underground, though weak, managed to capture the FutureTech headquarters, the HQ doesn't have any guards outside-in because they were banned to do so by the IAGD. Now that the  Underground has taken control of the Corporation, they reclaim their former territories in Eurasia, but they had a problem reclaiming their former territories in the Arab World, another one has risen too. Recently, terrorist groups all around the Arab World have united to form one big and terrifying Alliance, the Sons of God. This Radical Alliance has occupied the entire Arab World including The USSR's former Arab territories (Namely Iraq, Syria, and Libya) and is threatening to also occupy other countries. Because of this, the USSR, temporarily led by their most successful Commander (who also have taken FutureTech Spokesperson Kelly Weaver as a Sex Slave [as their forces transport the frozen bodies of Premier Anatoly Cherdenko and Chief of Staff Marshal Nikolai Krukov to Mexico, which was also occupied by the USSR, to be melted in the hot desert]), officially declared Total War against the Sons of Allah. Because of these growing threats, the IAGD, with its Supreme Commander also declared war against the two emerging powers. The new Empire Of Japan, now led by Emperor Tatsu, allied with the IAGD and used their arsenal, along with new inventions, to help defeat both the USSR, which is starting to become a threat to Japan through the USSR's Chinese and North Korean territories, and the Sons of God, in which they help the IAGD's South-East Asian Wing to repel the terrorists coming from an Sons of God-occupied Malaysia, Indonesia and Southern Philippines. Eventually, the Sons of God, led by its self-declared Leader of the World, ultimately declares an All-out War against the whole world, triggering a 3-way World War. Who will win in this war of the century? The World shall be the Arena for this spectacular competition of military power!
ngno8h|Heist Game Set in Monaco before and during F1 season|I just finished watching The B1M's video on Monaco on youtube (Link here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X\_lFFLpHuSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_lFFLpHuSQ) ) \n\nFirst, I just thought, "Monacos pretty small. It shouldn't be unreasonable to make a 1:1 recreation of it." After all GTA V's San Andreas is around 31 square miles; the entire country of Monaco and a few surrounding towns in France are around 10 Square miles. granted, that's 10 square miles of fairly dense urban area rather than mountains and forest, but still a thirst the size of San Andreas.\n\nThen I wondered what could happen on that map. A million GTA clones already exist, but I thought the transformation of the city during the F1 races held there could make for an interesting dynamic of pathfinding during missions. \n\nSo the idea is this: A heist game set during the F1 season. It's entirely free-form like a hitman game. You have to find a team, find vehicles and resources, and plot out a plan while the city is changing and rebuilding itself for the upcoming race. It all culminates in the player actually participating in the race as part of a diversion while the team takes down the target. The player would be able to switch from team member to team member at key moments in single player or a group of players can each have a role in multiplayer. \n\nThere would be no set missions or objectives other than the target (which could be a casino or the F1 race itself like in Logan Lucky) which has to be hit during the race. So the entire game would have a timer attached of 6 weeks which is how long it takes for the facilities in Monaco to be built. Each week would be a chapter with a different stage of construction completed. Players can load into any day within a week (A day would be like 30 minutes), but once that week is finished, it cannot be reloaded and any progress will be saved. So if you accidently destroy your getaway vehicles the at the end of the week before the big race, you're screwed and will have to think on your toes.
ngnacc|A multiplayer evolution game that starts simple before growing and updating in real time as the playerbase grows|Obviously, there's some Spore influence here, but I also had TierZoo in mind as well as Biblaridion's Alien Biospheres series.\n\nThe first released pre-alpha version of the game will involve playing as an aquatic worm-like creature that is capable of swimming, crawling on the seabed, and burrowing. Pretty much all you do is move around, eat plankton and algae, and gain points. But once you have enough energy to reproduce, you can use the points you've gained from eating food to upgrade your creature, and you can choose from a menu of various parts to grow or upgrade such as eyes, mouths, limbs, tails, armor, respiratory organs, reproduction, coloration, body shape and size, etc. \n\nEvery time the game updates, it adds other players' animals to the game, which new players can play as and evolve in their own divergent direction. Meanwhile, the devs will be changing the environment the players inhabit with each new update, whether it be new types of plants, lowering or raising oxygen levels, making the planet's temperature hotter or colder, splitting the continents, etc., which the players will have to evolve their respective species to better cope. \n\nThere will be both a single and multiplayer mode. In single-player, all the other creatures are AIs, whereas in multiplayer, almost every creature you meet is controlled by another player. \n\nOne thing I haven't figured out is how player species would go extinct. I know that in real life, animals go extinct when they die faster than they can reproduce, but I don't know how that would apply in-game. \n\nOther than that, what I like about this idea is that, unlike other evolution/animal simulator game ideas which are extremely complex and take a while to program before release, this one would be first released to the public as a relatively simple game, only becoming more complex gradually over time. After all, it can't be THAT hard to program a little worm that just swims, burrows, and eats.\n\nAny questions or suggestions?

npcfr4|Singing Dots Idea|Singing dots. You start with a singing dot and it sub divides automatically. Soon you have a few dots and resources come into play. Sending the dots to mine dot resources prevents them from singing. Resources allow them to keep singing and to divide.\n\nIdeally focusing on music and music complexity, maybe more dots make more complex songs.
np90li|Someone should make a horror game where if you blink irl something happens ingame.|The game should utilise the mechanic from "Before Your Eyes" story game.

My main idea was that there is some sort of creature in this game and every time you blink or close your eyes it moves or does something, although so much more can be done with this idea.
np6kof|A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game|Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?\n\nWell, I have an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.\n\nThe **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.\n\nThe **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:\n\n1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.\n\n2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.\n\n3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)\n\n4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.\n\nThe technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.\n\nThe **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role. \n\n1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.\n\n2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.\n\n3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.\n\n4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time. \n\n5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.\n\n6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.\n\nThe **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.\n\n1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.\n\n2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
np5s0m|Heist: A game similar to Hide &amp; Seek|It would be awesome to see this as a video game, but it can also be played in real life.\n\nPlayers: 4+\nAges: 12+\n\nSimilar to Hide &amp; Seek but the object is to get out. The games is to be played using an entire building: The bigger the better. \n\nBefore the game, one person is selected to be the guard. Everyone else will be a thief.\n\nThe players select one of the building's rooms to be the thieves' Lair, and one of the rooms to be the Safe. Now the thieves each put a personal belonging in the safe, and escapes to the Lair. The game can now begin.\n\nThe thieves now attempt to steal their belongings back from the Safe and return to the Lair. If the guard sees AND catches a thief, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when every thief has either been caught, or succeeded with their Heist. Whichever thief escaped first becomes the new guard. \n\n**Miscellaneous Rules:**\n• The guard(s) cannot simply patrol the Safe or the Lair; they must walk around the building.\n• The thieves may partner/group up, but groups win &amp; lose together. If even one group member gets caught, the entire group loses.\n• Depending on the size of the playing area/desired difficulty, more than one guard can be selected.\n• Both guards and thieves are allowed to use any tools they have/find to their advantage: Just don't destroy the building.\n• Players are encouraged to set traps, cause distractions, and everything else, as long as no one gets hurt.\n\n(Posting this on mobile: I'll come back later to format it better)
