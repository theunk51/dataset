od5sm6,Viva Pinata 3,"When is the internet gonna get Rare to make another Viva Pinata? It's been 23 years, Rare, just give us the game we all want. Imagine having underwater pinatas to care for and a bunch of new land and air animals as well. There could be cosmetics, new shops, new terraria modifications, BETTER MULTIPLAYER!!! I will not allow myself to die before this game comes out, if ever. How do you feel about another Viva Pinata game?"

ocyjv7,UVB-76 : You are a Soviet radio operator tasked with decrypting radio messages for the spy networks and nuclear operations.,"**Plot:** UVB-76 nicknamed ""The Buzzer"", is a real life Russian numbers station. It's thought to give radio commands to spies and agencies spread out through the sphere of Russian influence. The player is a Soviet radio operator tasked with decrypting messages.\n\n**Audio files:** The game dev could source sound samples directly from sites dedicated to recording them: https://priyom.org/military-stations/russia/the-buzzer\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/HuyVuVan2005/videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7qTzgD6MTY\n\n**Mechanics:** The game will centre around first by jotting down message using a table of russian letters, then ""decrypting"" the audio message into command codes. Then transferring the message to command and operatives according to procedure. The real life messages are known to follow a set structure that can be relied upon, and the player can be rewarded/penlised for how accurate they are. The dev or other players provide the ""expected"" \n\n**Aesthetic:** In the style of a spooky Papers Please, and follow a gradual story progression as the truth is discovered."
ocxexw,Under Fire,"A turn based game, in which you play as a firefighter trying to put out fires. Before the match starts there is a planing phase in which players are told where the fire will start and spread to next turn. Players are then tasked to put out these fires and save civilians with limited resources and turns. The game will start with simple kitchen fires, but progressively get more difficult like an entire house fire to a fire in a high skyscraper. Then it becomes super over the top and you gotta stop a volcano or something. You’ll level your firefighter as you play, getting better gear and better abilities that fit your play style. It could be played alone or up to 4 player co-op. There could even be a versus mode in which a player controls the fire and another player(s) tries to put it out."
ocv2zs,UFO Investigator RPG/Survival Horror game idea,"Not sure if this has been suggested here before but I have been watching the X-Files recently and this has sort of popped into my head. It'd be cool to have an RPG/survival horror game where you play as an agent of a shadow department (i.e one that doesn't officially exist) where your purpose is to investigate UFO cases, abductions by the entities involved with them, etc, etc. A puzzle aspect of the game could figure quite heavily in the form of trying to piece together evidence, there could be double agents within the department from other departments trying to sabotage your progress with misinfo etc, etc. \n\nYou could have a range of classes focused on different strengths, for example it'd be intriguing to have a class option for someone gifted with extra sensory abilities, one with a strong background in forensics and maybe something more combat focused. Just to give three potential examples. \n\nI know this is pretty brief and rushed out but does anyone have any thoughts?"
octo4z,A party game that can totally ruin friendships,"It’s called Opinionated. 10 players are sitting at a ring-shaped table. Each round, the players are given the same question, formatted like “What is your opinion on _________?” People write their opinions in 30 seconds, and then each opinion is displayed, but it does not show who said which opinion (to combat bias against a player). Each player has to choose which opinion was their favorite and least favorite. The player with the opinion with the lowest score is eliminated. This goes on until there are only 2 players remaining. In this last round, it goes the same, except the eliminated players vote on which one is their favorite. The person with the highest score wins :D Pretty much, it’s a game to see how easily you can offend your friends, and it can definitely make you lose them!"
octjpf,Weird Survival Game,"This is a game that, honestly, I have thought up more of the story than the game, but you guys can give me ideas for actual gameplay.\n\nThe game is called Coma. You are living in an apartment in a big city. You girlfriend has gone off to work, and you are staring out the window thinking. Just thinking. I forgot why, but you are suspicious of one of your coworkers.\n\nAll of a sudden someone tries to chokehold you, then there is some sort of fight scene, and if you manage to get to the last part without failing, you are in the kitchen grabbing a knife. You can sense that the are about to try to hit you with something. If you are frame-perfect, the game ends lol (just for speedrunners i guess lol). But if you fail...\n\nYou wake up in a forest. You see on one tree a sign that says “7 Days”. And then it gets blown by the wind into the sky. You have 7 in-game days to survive in forest. Somehow you have to collect certain things in order to climb up a tree that has a book at the top. It simply says “You are done”. And then you lose your balance and fall. In the air, the book if falling with you. If you manage to grab it before you hit the ground, you float into the sky...\n\nYou wake up in a hospital bed with your girlfriend next to you. The nurse says that you were in a coma. Your coworker was the man trying to kill you in your apartment. After that experience inside the coma, you appreciate nature and the wilderness much more, and after you recover, you and your girlfriend move deep into the forest.\n\nThis is so dumb, this is more of a Wattpad story than a video game idea, but yeah the gameplay parts are the interactive cutscenes and the survival in the wilderness. Maybe there are bears and stuff, and you have to craft stuff in order to find the stuff in order to craft the thing that helps you climb the tree? I don’t know, but that’s all I got. Any ideas?"
oct7j6,First Person Twist,"This is totally not becoming a game, but just wanted to say cuz some features are interesting for ideas for different games maybe.\n\nPretty much, it’s round based, and it’s multiplayer and there are different maps. You just want to get the most kills out of everyone, but you start with no weapon. Around the map there are many different things that might seem like background stuff for decoration, but you can use them to hit and throw at people and kill them. It’s like using everyday objects to kill people.\n\nThis next part will be a little bit of a reach, but maybe there are NPCs that if they notice you are dangerous can call 911, and if you don’t kill them before they call 911, the police will come and try to arrest or kill you.\n\nAlso was thinking of random power-ups that are cringy references, but that’s just me."
ocsfeg,Potential game mechanic?,"I had a random thought, would it be possible to make it so that an rgb keyboard could be use as a quick time mechanic? Light up  a key instead of an on screen prompt  I don't know how it would be implemented or developed, but I think it would be an awesome way add  something new to an rpg or even shooter."
ocqly5,A Life Simulation game where the society is created by the players.,"The game has 32-Bit Graphics that aren’t restricted to the oversized pixels.\n\nThe setting is confusing cuz the cities look futuristic and there are some futuristic technology things (like teleporters that you can change the location to where you want to teleport to), but besides that, everything else is current society stuff. There are farms and beaches and mountains and forests that look normal and stuff. Also don’t know whether to have a generic map for each island, or have each island be randomly generated, or just have a whole, randomly generated, pretty much infinite world.\n\nAnyway, the idea is, it’s an online multiplayer game. You have 3 life slots. When you start a life you can change how you look, and you can choose the colors of what your 3 sets of clothes look like. You are also given a phone (with many cool features, like texting, a camera, and an app store where you can install player-made apps (somehow, I have no idea how that would work, probably shouldn’t be an idea, but would be cool)), a certain amount of money or whatever, and... that’s it. I guess. Anyway. you choose where you want to start, and, I mean, I have been focusing more on the city part for ideas, but pretty much, it is a player-made game. All of the food you eat is from players that are farmers and stuff. And all of the companies are player-made. I have way too many cool features in my head, but yeah. Your whole experience is player-made. Anyway, each city will have 256 blocks, and each block will be 16 by 16 lots, but there are 6 levels. They aren’t just skyscrapers, they kind of form a pyramid. It’s hard to explain. Anyway, each lot will cost some amount of money based on how close it is to the ground and city center, and yeah.\n\nThe chat can be that you can choose a generic voice or literally record every sound in the text-to-speech thing with your own voice if you want. The main feature will be voice-to-text-to-voice chat. You can still be walking and not have to type anything. You just hit the chat button and record yourself, check if it says what you want it to say, and send. And then if you want in settings you can have it so that it only goes to text instead of voice, but voice will be default, because then it can be based on how far you are from the talker, and, you get it. Awesome, right?\n\nAlso, you have a hunger bar, a stamina bar, a happiness bar, and an overall health bar. If your health goes to zero, you die, and that life is lost along with all of the stuff and accomplishments you’ve had. I was also planning on having realistic sicknesses in a decently simple way, and you need to maintain a decent diet and stuff with nutrients, cuz the food has that stuff. Heck, maybe the food can even have a likability stat that tells how likely it is that your character likes it. The more a character hates a food, the more their happiness will go down, and vice versa. \n\nMaybe I’m going a little too far, but I am an idea machine right now lol.  I have way more ideas for this game, but I can already see the top comment saying “Really cool idea, but from a realistic view, you’re asking for way too much.” I get that, but I just wanted to share it :)"

ocje4l,1v1 Horror Strategy Game (plus first person controls)," \n\nHello  everyone! I have a new game idea that I think could be great, but  before I pursue it I want to see if others think it could be successful  as well. It is a horror strategy game that would have a similar feel to  chess where you have pieces (horror characters) that you can move around  a board/map while the player themselves can also run around and act as  another character. Think of FNAF-like movement where each character can  be moved from room to room. Each player would have a team of characters  that they could move around. Characters can fight each other, there is  also player v player and player v character. You would control the  characters with a tablet while you run around as the player, using  sounds and clues given by each character to figure out where the enemy  is.\n\nI  think exploring these ideas alone could result in a cool game, but I  still need an end game or win condition. I thought of maybe progressing  the characters to certain places to control areas in the map (domination  kind of gameplay) or maybe just kill the other team.\n\nIf  there is anything you would add or get rid of, or maybe a cooler win  condition please let me know! I think the mechanics could be really cool  if done right, but I want to see what other people think."
ocg0lf,AI manipulation,"so what if this was a stealth game was about manipulating AI, so like if there's a croakadile(frog/crocodile) then it'l bite the player but if you put a dragonsly(sly dragonfly) in the guards pocket then it will get distracted. you might even be able to steal it and tame it, and you could trick it into gobbling up guards in the next mission. wouldn't have crazy graphics, so low poly 3D gameplay could work. of course, you could do whatever you want with the idea, this is just a suggestion if you have no ideas. i don't know how many people it would take, with what budget, and for how long, so i'll mark it AAA."

ocd2yt,Bureaucratic nightmare puzzle game,"You are a young entrepreneur excited to start your own business. The only step left to take is to get the official approval from the government, but it is when you meet the dystopian bureaucracy that you learn that this is going to be the hardest part of your journey.\n\nYou start at the gates of a huge government building, in front of you are long, lifeless corridors with countless doors to either side. In you hand, you have got a form, and the address of the office you have to go to. After finding the right place, a door labelled with strange glyphs and a very non-descriptive job title. Making your way inside and presenting your documents to the worker, you are promptly rejected: it is not possible for them to grant your request without first being presented with further documents. They give you a few vague hints as to who might be responsible for those and send you off on your odyssey through the building, navigating the maze like corridors to finding the right people and fulfilling their increasingly ridiculous demands based on their increasingly unhelpful hints.\n\nThe main gameplay concept consists of two tasks: Learning the language of bureaucracy to know what you need to do, and figuring out how you can actually meet those requirements. \n\nThere are three main objects to the gameplay: Door labels, responses, documents, and forms. The door labels, as you will figure out while playing the game, are not random. Encoded in them are where in the building the door is located, and what the person inside is responsible for. Learning to interpret those will allow you to more quickly find where you need to go: If you need to acquire some document, you will need to ask yourself, what glyphs and job title someone providing it should have, and what place in the building those would correspond to. The responses you get from workers in response to providing documents or forms, initially, serve as a sort of tutorial, giving you some clues as to what some things might mean, but will, later on, also mainly consists of codes whose main function is to inform you (as soon as you know how to interpret them) as to what the person actually requires of you. Documents are what you might get from the bureaucrats for providing them with forms and documents. They are usually tokens of success (doing what the person required of you), but may later on also contain information dependent on how you filled in the forms (again in the form of glyphs and weird codes) that could be part of another persons requirements. Forms are, apart from figuring out whom to talk to and presenting documents, your main way to interact with the game. You are handed forms by some people and are then tasked to fill them out: On the form, you will find some glyphs up top that tell you what the form is about, as well as a few multiple choice questions, labelled only by glyphs whose answers are (you guessed it) again glyphs. Once you have submitted the form, you will receive a response indicating whether you have filled out the form correctly, and you may receive some of the previously mentioned documents.\n\nOver the course of the game, your main challenge will shift: At the beginning, you will feel quite lost, not sure what any of the glyphs mean and not really knowing why your forms are accepted or rejected. Once you start to learn the codes, though, and you feel like you finally understand how the bureaucratic machine works, your focus will change to figuring out how exactly you need to answer the forms to get what you want. This might be as simple as figuring out which of the responses satisfy all of the multiple requirements, or it may require you to think outside of the box: If I need to submit this form to multiple people, do the documents they give me actually depend on my answers, or can I change the form before giving it to the second worker? Does the bureaucrat actually care about all of the document, or could I get away with handing them the wrong one?\n\nWill you be able to navigate the bureaucratic nightmare and finally be able to start your own business?\n\nTLDR: Heaven's Vault meats Papers, Please with more puzzles."
ocd1rn,"Figuring out my zombie/ish/undead trope characters for my fighting game, this is what I have so far","One is a combat medic female nurse who was in love with her bf/lover general doctor, who she tried to save and protect, but the doctor ended up becoming more and more of a monster, almost zombie-Frankenstein monster. You can switch between both duo fighters back and forth. The medic being more fast and close range but weaker and the monster doctor being more slow and stronger.\n\nA parasitic infected zombie with symbiote abilities that was turned into a zombie in a lab. Can use it's symbiote parts as assistance to attack.\n\nAn early 20th century German alchemist who has been trying to find a cure during the Spanish Flu, who had become some form of a plague-like zombie and has been living the past 100's of years with this plague curse in isolation. He's sort of like a Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde type character. He can turn into a stronger plague zombie each time he injects himself.\n\nA female telekinetic ghost from feudal Japan. She goes on with vengeance after her father and family were killed. She wears a kimono with long black hair covering her face with a spirit like undead appearance and uses telekinesis to attack. Possibly the use of necromancy of ghosts from her fallen homeland.\n\nAn undead zombie female also from feudal Japan. She carries vengeance after her husband was killed. SHE WAS AN Onna-musha female samurai warrior that had samurai armor and uses a naginata as her primary weapon. She is very fast, like a fast moving zombie and will rush in to jump, attack and slash at you and even teleport.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do any of you think of my zombie trope ideas?"
ocbv3i,Mobile Multiplayer Gambling Game,"This mobile multiplayer gambling game wouldn't involve much gameplay.\n\nEach game consists of 1000 players trying to eliminate each other to win the jackpot.\n\nEvery day, you get one ""shot"", which you can direct using the compass and the game uses your location to identify if you hit someone, thus eliminating them. Each player antes a fee at the beginning of the game and the last player standing takes it all!"
oc7dpo,"Rhythm game, but also a side-scrolling shooter at the same time?????","The main character is a musician who fights monsters in their city and has collaborations with other artists (multiplayer... maybe), in this post I compiled some ideas for the game in no particular order.\n\nThe fighter (chosen/main character?) gets dropped off on a stage and receives a weapon + amount of ammo that corresponds to the chosen difficulty, (easy mode gives you a lot of ammo and guns, for example) \n\nUsing the amount of ammo the fighter receives, they have to win against the monster before it runs out. The monster will attack or show its weakness to the beat of the music, allowing the fighter to damage the monster (while it shows weakness) or doge.\n\nTaking damage, falling off the stage, or getting hit by the surroundings gives the fighter a permanent debuff which can last the entire game, or for only a few minutes ( bad aim, slowing down, lower defense, etc ) depending on the chosen difficulty.\n\nThe level ends with a grade, telling the player how well they've done, and the public's opinion on the fighter, the grade is decided by the following;\n\n*Is the monster killed by the fighter? Wounded enough for others to take care of it with ease, or gotten away with minimal damage?*\n\n*Is the fighter wounded during the fight?*\n\n*What equipment did the fighter use?*\n\n*What outfit did the fighter wear? ( flashy outfits make the public think you're cool, but doesn't affect the grade too much)*\n\nIf the fighter receives too many bad grades or is unable to continue fighting, they will retire.\n\nObviously inspired by games like Touhou and Friday Night Funkin, and if anyone's interested in programming this game,,, I can be your pixel art artist."
oc5yl3,An idea for animal AI,"I think it would be ccol to make animal AIs more like the mutants in The Forest. In The Forest when you first meet mutants they act more curious and act based on your actions. Also in real life many animals including predators aren't really just boring herbivours which their only purpose is only for resources/food and running away from players nor dangerous hunters which always hunt whatever they see crossing their eyes. They also make mistakes, are clumsy and do ""stupid"" or funny things or other weird stuff.\n\nDid you know that in Africa male elephants are reported to have sex with wild hippos? What if you were playing this hypothetical game where you would casually pick up four wheeled vehicle and driving along until suddenly a some kind of huge animal/alien like creature starts chasing you... You try to drive as fast as possible but you can't out run the beast. You panicly jump out of the vehicle and flee only to realise that the creature doesn't have any intrest in you... It seems to try to make an impression for the vehicle and starts some kind of sexual display and an attempt to mate with it. This doesn't last long however so you better take advantage of the situation and LEAVE!\n\n\nThese types of occurances will make them more unpredictable and makes the player cautious every time whether harmless or dangerous looking the animal may be."
oc35gs,Game/Simulation idea based on creating your own nerf guns and playing PvP matches like paintball.,"I always liked playing nerf guns and having with my friends you play in the house and shooting at each other after you run out of Foam darts you find them across the house. I thought what if players could create all these set pieces of guns according to their will and create their own guns, for example, Pistols, Shotguns, Assault rifles and even they can mix these types like having shotgun as an attachment in rifles. then share them among their friends and worldwide, Then use their guns to test and play with friends. \n\nInitially, they start with limited resource items and then progress by winning matches and they get rewards to build more setpieces or guns.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective, of course, to make players feel immersed while creating the guns and shooting.\n\nThe multiplayer PvP follows the rules of deathmatch and paintball. The levels can be houses, outer environments, paintball arenas, etc..."

obunbm,2D Top-Down Barren Planet Survival,"Core Premise: You're in cryo with a few others, in a settler pod flying to a brand new paradise. You pass through an asteroid belt, and the ship gets pummeled, frying the nav system, and waking you up. You're able to steer the thing to the closest planet before the whole ship starts breaking apart. It's lifeless. Congratulations. You and your crew just inherited a wasteland planet of your very own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a settler ship, it came equipped with everything you need to survive on a beautiful jungle planet... You're not on one. You've got seeds, saplings, a wrecked ship with limitless O2... if you stay on it... and an H2O generator for a small amount of water over time. You've also got exactly one O2 tank and a mask, the one from the ship's cockpit. The rest are somewhere floating around that asteroid belt with the back end of the ship... You're alone, and you can't get anyone out of cryo until there's plenty of food, water, and oxygen to go around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main idea is simple enough. You leave the ship with the O2 tank, and can scout for a little while before returning for more oxygen. You can collect some resources, but there isn't much out there. You need food, so it's time to plant some crops and trees in the tiny O2 bubble the ship is providing you. Everything will grow pretty fast because it's all futuristic, and genetically modified... not because it's a video game or anything...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFully grown crops will expand the O2 bubble just around them, but it will disappear once you've harvested them. You can plant trees to expand it better. They will provide a bunch of different resources, sparingly, like apples, or rubber. They will grow on the tree every once in a while, but will regrow over and over. The problem is, you've only got a limited number of saplings and seeds, and they all got jumbled up when you crashed. So, planting the original lot is a gamble. You won't get anything to grow unless it has at least some O2, so trying to plant beyond the bubble is pointless. You need to cut down trees for their saplings, but this will take away some of the O2 bubble, so you need to keep replanting. Only fully grown trees give enough O2 to expand it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe broader your O2 bubble, the further you can explore, and the more the ground slowly becomes fertile with local plant-life (not all friendly), expanding out from your ship. This planet once had life, so there's plenty to explore. Maybe you can find something to help you survive...\n\nThe goal is to awaken some shipmates to automate some tasks, as well as bring life to this planet. There's also some building involved, just like any settler game, like lumber mills, and things of this nature."
obngb9,Point and click adventure set in a pokemon-like universe. (Or just a pokemon fangame),"And by that i mean monkey island with pokemon battles. That's pretty much it. You go around, have humorous conversations with other trainers, do item puzzles, and occasionally battle with your set (relatively small, only 3 or 4 mons) team, who are just as much characters as the humans, on a quest to do something that ISN'T becoming leauge champion.\n\n If we somehow COULD make it a pokemon fangame without getting sued (although judging by exactly WHAT Nintendo does or does not dmca being based on whether or not they're making a game with the same ideas [new mainline pokemon game, rereleasing mario 64, metroid 2 remake, mario 1 battle royale, etc], i think we'll be safe), I'd base a few things off of the kanto arc of the anime, such as having that one jigglypuff as part of your party, your rival(s) are as petty as the team rocket trio (with a nice jab at the old ""obvious disguise"" routine with the heroes immediately knowing it's them, but everyone else is still fooled, and the story forces them (the heroes) into going along with it.), and there are a few episodes adapted into the game.\n\nA few ideas for the team:\n\nAn eevee saved from the evil team, who did experiments on them to have them change evolutions at will like type:null. (Taken from the manga, and also used to add more variety to other trainers' teams)\n\nThe aforementioned jigglypuff, who acts like a showbiz diva\n\nA lucario who goes through a similar arc to ash's charizard\n\nPikachu libre, who wants to become famous in the battle frontier (or equivalent)\n\nA ditto with an identity crisis\n\nA male gardevoir or female gallade\n\nA shuckle who is convinced that he can evolve, and gets into wacky hyjinks attempting to do so (yes, i DID take that from dorkly, thanks for noticing!)\n\nA porygon-z that gets further corrupted and becomes missingno (Although it doesn't get the ""glitchy cuthullu"" portrayal missingno usually gets, instead it's trying to find a way to fix itself and un-evolve into a porygon-2.) If used, a puzzle should involve using its item duplication powers somehow."

My goal is to release *any* game, however, I always aim too ambitious and it never comes to fruition. I have many years of professional game dev experience (in a team) so don't worry if it's technically challenging. I'm just looking for something I can dedicate some time too away from my job as a solo personal project.\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas."
obcx7l,Health / Mana Bar Mechanic,"I recently thought of a interesting take on the normal health / mana bar system. Instead of having two bars, one for health and one for mana, you only have one.\n\n The catch is the helsrh amd mana bars grow from opposite sides and whenever there is empty space they both grow to fill in the empty space.\n\nSo lets say ur bar is 100 units. You could start off with 50 health and 50 mana. Lets say you take 20 damage and your health and mana grow at the same rate. Eventually you will get to 40 health and 60 mana. Then lets say you cast a spell that costs 50 mana. If you let your bar fill up, you'll have 65 health and 35 mana. \n\nThis introduces a bunch of play styles. Like you could play super safe and have alot of health, or you could be powerful but fragile. \n\nFrom a game narrative perspective theres a bunch of ways to take this. One I really like is that the mechanic is a cursed placed on a powerful wizard. \n\nNot sure what type of game this mechanic should be used in. My first thoighht was some action game / metroidvania would be best. \n\nI thought of this mechamic a while ago. I thinknots really interesting, but Im kinda burnt out rn. So hopefully someone else can make use of it"

op885f,Randomly Generated story game,"Would anyone play a game that every time you restarted all the ai, shops, cities and pretty much everything changed?\nYou would build a storyline in one play through where you join a faction and they have randomly generated rivals and motives, then if you want you could restart and everything would be different. \nAll ai have different attributes that are randomly assigned and you can interact with all of them some of them may have things for you to do, some of them may despise you completely despise you. \nLike entering an randomly generated AI world, with no specific storyline until you create one. \nPlease drop a comment if you like the idea."
op5axx,Turn based party type game,"I want to make a game I could play with my friends where each person takes turns. It doesn’t have to be like an RPG, or a fight, just something casual like a party game. I also want characters to be significantly involved somehow, like they have different advantages or something. But it would have to be one person at a time, and it couldn’t be a card game of any sort cause everyone is looking at the same screen, and you wouldn’t be able to hide your cards. What are some game genres or ideas that would fit this criteria?"
op3yar,A life sim or romance sim thats like GTA but way more of a casual game?,"I've always wanted to find a game that was open world, mainly casual gameplay, has romance and is in first person. \nLike if The Sims, GTA and a Bethesda game were merged together. Kinda. Basically a game with the casual-ness of The Sims, the graphics and pov of GTA, and with like companions and some romance stuff, like a Bethesda game. Not a whole lot of combat involved, if any, and it would mainly focus on immersion and everyday life. NPCs with backstories and unique personalities that you can befriend, bring along with you, romance, etc. I guess it would have to have some sort of storyline too, for people to be interested. \nI'm no game developer. I'm just constantly searching for games that are similar to this concept. I love casual gameplay but I also love RPGs. I guess I just wish there was an RPG that wasn't so combat-heavy and was more immersive."

oozhfx,I’d love to make a game based around sound with someone,"Hello, an Idea has just popped into my head whilst I was brainstorming and I think it could be really cool if done well. Perhaps even a franchise based around senses.\n\nBasically, the game is based around sound with minimal amounts of graphical aspects (otherwise it wouldn’t work). You have to listen carefully to even the quietest of sounds so that you can try to find out what happened to you before you had a coma. My inspiration is before your eyes since the story will be the same sort of structure.\n\nThe game would last somewhere between 1-4 hours so that you could do it in one sitting. I’m not sure about the details so I’m open to suggestions. Let me know what you think!"
ooqkp9,A James Bond game that uses Alpha Protocol as a template,"Super Bunnyhop pointed out that Hitman is the best Bond game for the aforementioned reasons, and IO Interactive is currently making a Bond game. However, I believe that crown goes to Alpha Protocol. \n\nAlpha Protocol, despite its flaws and glitches, is the only game I felt like playing as James Bond. My ideal game would be remaking Alpha Protocol into a Bond game, featuring the Daniel Craig model, a few script changes, bug fixing, John Barry score (or David Arnold score), and the functional combat system. Throw Blacklist's gameplay into here, and I would not play anything else anymore."

oon3vl,A game about storming a terrorist filled tower with only a baton,"It's called BatonForce. Basically you are a member of a SWAT team, who, despite his superiors' orders, storms a building filled with terrorists. The negotiations have ended and you are only one against the enemy.\n\nBasically you use the baton for most of the time. You smash windows, whack terrorists and do all kinds of cool action-movie shit with it, like reflecting bullets, use it as a bat to hit smaller items as projectiles and such. You can also take dropped weapons off the ground, empty the whole magazine into an enemy and hit the empty gun towards another.\n\nAbout 100 floors, saves after every floor, yadda, yadda. The environment is highly destructible and you can even break holes into walls with explosives and shotguns."
oom9zo,A single player FPS where you play as an exterminator,So basically people pay you to help get rid of pests in their homes by shooting them.\n\nBut your company has a strict no property damage policy: The client gets some of their money back every time you miss and accidentally shoot their furniture or walls or ceiling or whatever. Your goal is to remove the infestation while making as few mistakes as possible.
oom36h,A hero shooter/platform fighter hybrid,"I'll list down the elements the game uses from each genre\n\nTeam Shooter:\n\nObjective-oriented game modes (Capture the flag, Payload etc.)\n\nLarger Maps\n\nRespawn points\n\nMove cooldown (No ammo packs, it reloads by itself)\n\nTeam-based, obviously\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlatform Fighter:\n\nThird-person 2D fighting game viewpoint\n\nDirectional moves (which direction you input decides which move you use)\n\nKnockback\n\nPlatforms\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would be a mix of ranged and melee fighters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther ideas:\n\nCombo Mechanic: When you successfully land an attack the cooldown for its next use is halved.\n\nRespawn portal: When you die, you are transported to another map where you must reach a portal to respawn back into the game. Attacking enemies in this map will knock them back, which can stop them from reaching the portal"
ook551,A game like Golf Clash but for math?,"Thoughts on this idea:  \n\nGolf clash is amazing.  You play 1vs1 in golf holes, each player taking a turn.  The winner wins all the coins and trophies. To enter a game you need a certain amount of coins and trophies, and the higher the level the harder the holes are and the more you win.\n\nI want to take the same concept and apply it to math!  You play a random person 1vs1.  It costs X coins to enter the match, you each get asked a few questions, and the winner gets all the coins.  Coins can be used to unlock new levels, buy fun math things that help you in the game, new skins, new avatars, etc.   Can do everything from really simple arithmetic questions to more complex stuff.  \n\nI think the game could be a lot of fun to play and practice math skills, and can be used to learn and introduce new concepts. \n\nCould also be really fun to do the same thing with coding problems.  You enter random games with people and compete to solve a quick coding problem - kinda like the social network movie interview process.\n\nWhat do you think? Any feedback would be awesome!"
oojyem,An entire game based around the ship section of dead space 3,"True survival mechanics with rogue like elements?

oojg6f,Monster inc horror game,"I don’t see this feasible being I don’t see Pixar ever attempting to make this a thing. \n\nIt would follow an government agent getting involved into the case of anomalies of monsters have been scaring kids throughout years mankind, the investigation would lead to interviewing people who have seen them from they were children to having been sent into the monster world by the agency. It would lead to kidnapping an monster that came through. The atmosphere of the game would be a \ndark/ horror game.  Tell me what you think."

There’d be a story and bosses as well.

There would be ring outs and support type Battle Monsters that would make a return from both the Pokken and Tekken series. The story mode would be a whole different story altogether. It would play like a Dynasty Warriors game where you have to fight off a plethora of mechanical monstrosities while also completing various small objectives around the much bigger battle arena. This would culminate in fighting off said Battle Arena's boss, a boss which will test all your fighting game know how."

oo22eg,An FPS equivalent to Smash Bros.,"Basically, a first person multiplayer deathmatch, where players can choose between famous FPS protagonists, like Doomguy, Gordon Freeman, Chell etc. and gameplay would depend on which character you play, matching their respective games, with a few minor tweaks for balance.\n\nGame Mechanic Examples:\n\nDoomguy can use the SSG's Meathook to grapple other players, but unlike Doom Eternal, the players can still still move around, but slower.\n\nGordon Freeman can use the Gravity Gun to pick up and launch props found around each map.\n\nChell can use the Portal Gun to move herself and others around the map, typically trying for environmental kills or fall damage kills. Also she doesn't take fall damage.\n\nAny thoughts on this idea? New character and mechanic suggestions perhaps?"
oo18a3,Open world monster evolution game,So I thought about this for a minute now but I have a game idea that’s different so the game is a open world monster game so u start off as a weak monster who escapes a lab you must try to eat and consume humans or animals every chance you get but you will be hunted every time when you first start off you’re this humanoid small monster who must sneak around to eat on animals in the lab while you’re being hunted by security than after consuming enough you can evolve and customize what aspects you want such as armor to not take a lot of damage or claws or the ability to fly or breathe under water and you level up every chance you get by consuming and causing mayhem you will also be dealing with other monsters that escaped and must find and kill them around the city you will go form a small 4’10 monster to the size of Godzilla if you level up through the whole game
oo0il8,Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror," Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits.\n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. Here is link to google doc file with world backstory and general game idea:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAnd let me make clear one thing - I didn't go to describe all those different actual gameplay mechanics like - what exactly main character will use as his weapons, or what type of upgrade he can install, or what type of enemies game will have - yet, because the purpose of this concept is describe what exactly this game is about. I believe before you go to all technical details you should define the main idea of the game and what are you trying to say to the player.\n\nSo please let me know if you think this story is shit, or maybe you liked it but you'd change or add something. Thank you for your time!"

I forgot!"

ontkap,very realistic tactical shooter,This game is insanely realistic with the needs for food a water as well as rest differing levels of body armor a lot of guns etc up to like 200 players in a lobby 100 on each team with vehicles as well. this is not very in depth but it gets the point across

onrlsj,A New Gen VR RPG,"Hello there, thanks for droppin' by to read!   \n\n\nI am Marshal and something I desired since I've gotten a VR system was an RPG that felt right. Having multiple paths to choose, personalization(Character creation), and a good combat mechanic. The last time I played something that reminded me of my idea was Dynasty Warriors, a great RPG series. Or Conqueror's Blade, a good MMO RPG.  \n\n\nNow, my idea.   \nThis is a first person VR game. A constant throughout the game will be you will fight as the commander and you will fight alongside your troops.  Your decisions will directly affect the performance of your Army and overall Kingdom.\n\n It is a game where you play as a strategist/commander in a fictional land. You build up the character you are, such as picking the personality, looks, and even the upcoming of your family(Being a commoner or royal). After the selection there will be a tutorial explaining mechanics, how the states are at war, and side characters. Maybe even a mock battle?\n\nAfter the tutorial you will be on the road to protect your own state, talk to other states to avoid conflict, grow bonds, or declare war. Below is a list of features that the game would be based off. We will call these the ""Rules and Guidelines of the Kingdom""\n\n1. Every state you fight there will be different enemies abilities, looks and equipment), aspects. The size of your army, the haul of food, and the location itself (being near a river or other geographical perks) will come into play when you converse with diplomatic personnel. \n\n2. You must make sure you do not run low on these four core things, Food, Army, Population, and Morale.\n\n3. During the conflict you may have to sacrifice one of the core items to elevate another, this would be based off your own strategy and Army construct. \n\n4. Each Army will have to equip their Army with default communications, weapons, transportation, uniforms, armor and skill level.\n\n5. You will have the ability to increase the default levels based on achievements e.g. kill streak, staying alive for a certain period of time or after a battle. These increases can be applied to any default level item. \n\n6. You will have the ability for you to play as your commander or conscript, depending on tasks and battle performance this will lower or increase your units morale. \n\n7. This game would not have levels. You will not fight to get to the next level instead you will have milestones. Once a pre determined goal is achieved you would have the option to advance your kingdom/society according to one of the four core values (Food, Army, Population and Morale).\n\n8. There will be a metric where you can marry a leader of another Army, this would create an alliance in order to share all resources of each Kingdom.\n\nEndgame Ideas:\n\n1. you will start to face harder enemies, spies and rebellions within kingdom based off in-game morale.  As Morale increases the less likely rebellions will happen and vice versa. \n\nIn the end once you have taken over all of the states the game will end with the player choosing to rather end the game at that point or continue it. If you end it there, a cut scene will appear showing the kingdom stats and then credits. If you continue the game, the game will have more rebellions and a new enemy will appear and the game will continue."
onqxwl,Assassins Creed spin-off game that plays like a combo of AC and Hitman.,"The AC story wouldn’t be tainted at all by this but this idea definitely builds off of both of those titles. \n\nThe game would be called “Animus” rather than AC. For those that are unfamiliar the Animus is the machine in AC that can recreate the memories of people from the past and let you experience them as if you were actually there. \n\nIn the new Hitman World of Assassination trilogy- agent 47 finds himself in 20 different ‘destinations’ across the globe, with different targets in each. Each destination is a total sandbox, you can assassinate your targets in any way you can think. You can unlock different weapons and starting locations by mastering each destination.\n\nOk now that some of the background info is out of the way. My idea is that rather than a destination, your character goes into the animus to a certain time period. Your character would play as an ancient assassin in an ancient setting, like the coliseum or pyramids, or Great Wall of China. And you’d assassinate real people that actually lived and were assassinated, and you’d be using real historical weapons to eliminate your targets."
onqmr2,Realistic pizza delivery sim,"Sounds boring at first glance but I've driven a wrx for delivery for years and I get in to a lot of street racing while delivering. I've been thinking about an idea for a more realistic not nfs type delivery game where you take deliveries but also have the chance to race people while you're at work like drags and short sprints and also after work for more cash.  \n\nI like the idea of a realistic base for money like maybe taking out a loan to buy a better car and pay the loan back at the penalty of your ""heat"" raising against the police or something. I have a thousand more ideas but wanted to make this post as short as possible"
onlg2z,"A monster hunting game, but the game is designed so that 90% of the battle is planning and preparation. No leveling up; no unlock trees; just going out into the world to get the things you'll need for the battle plan you've come up with.","I like Monster Hunter, Dauntless and a number of other monster hunting games well enough. What I *don't* like is the grind. The vast majority of those games is spent leveling up gear and stats, and picking up random ingredients strewn about the map(s). This game will replace that with something a little different.\n\nLike *Breath of the Wild* you're given one and only one objective: Defeat the END BOSS MONSTER.\n\nYou can't level up or make ""stronger"" gear; however, the boss monster is weak to X weapon, susceptible to Y traps, is impaired by Z poison, and it inflicts reduced damage to N armor. You'll have to defeat four different boss monsters to get the materials needed to make those items. And each of those monsters will have their own required gear that you'll need to defeat smaller monsters for.\n\nEach monster is a small puzzle. Other than the END BOSS MONSTER, you aren't told what the monsters' weaknesses are or what strategies to use. You'll have to figure them out on your own by observing them, stalking them, researching/asking about them in town, and by fighting them underprepared to test out strategies. Once you have it figured out, you gather your gear, drink some expensive temporary buffs and put your strategy to the test.\n\nIt's important to point out that no gear makes you stronger, per se. You can only beat monsters through smarter strategies and better skill."

onh6i7,Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror,"Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits. \n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. So let's go:\n\n**The Long Road** \- game about space truckers adventure.\n\n*Main idea*\n\nDefine for yourself - what do you understand as a reality? Would you agree to live in a world of dreams, live through adventure, experience all emotions and be ok with it knowing that it's all going inside high-tech VR machine? Life is a process of getting experience and emotions. Any emotions and feelings are real for you as a person, as long as you are aware of where you are and who you are, regardless of what world you are in. So is there any difference between them?\n\n*Elevator-Pitch*\n\nHave you ever experienced derealization? Maybe even for a second couldn't understand whether you were dreaming or not? What do you say if you stay in that second forever? \n\n*Setting* \n\nFuture world. Big spaceship with a cargo going through a long journey to another stellar system. Such journeys are possible all because of the new technology which allow to a space ship use space-time shrinking to quickly travel to a long distance. But as all technologies this one have some limitations. Ship couldn't travel to  any destination though a one jump, there was a possible max distance and very long engine recharging process. But because of this, space travels which before took several dozen thousands of year now only take 20-40 years to most of the systems. Even though space travel progressed dramatically in terms of time they occupied, they still took a pretty long time for a human, so all ships aimed to travel far should have been equipped with hibernate capsules. When a ship travels during engine recharge brakes, which even with most modern models would take 5-10 years, all crew members should be passing waiting time in those capsules, and when engine recharged all crew should be awake to manually control the next jump. Jump usually took 2-5 days depending on a engine model and travel distance.\n\nIn our journey ship crew  have to deliver very important cargo from one point to another and along with it test new hibernate capsules which would allow to crew members not to lose time between jumps in unconscious dreams but use this time to experience different experience in preliminary prepared virtual sceneries to stimulate their brain activity and prevent brain degradation. This degradation was known as a ""professional"" sickness of space truckers. When a person spent several dozens of years in a capsule some parts of the brain were degraded too much and after a journey the whole crew had to take 1-2 year of break to restore their health to be able to travel again. New capsules should have fixed that. \n\nIt's a long journey though a cold dark space inside a tin can where you can't leave. You can't make this journey faster. \n\n*Plot and world backstory*\n\nFuture. Humanity made a breakthrough in space travel. First engine which able to affect space-time is developed. Using this engine you can make jumps through a really long distance. Thanks to this technology this was a start of a ""far"" space exploration era. This engine had his limitation though. You can't travel to any point in a space, just to limited maximum amount of distance. When engine was created limit was about 0.5 light years. Recharging process of that engine would take about 15 years. \n\nFirst hibernate capsules were developed a bit earlier and were used in solar system exploration travels. They also have been used on pilgrim ships - special ships with a crew who agreed to have this one-way trip to the closest star systems with habitable planets. \n\nTechnology developed with time. Humanity domesticated more and more systems with time. Engine development allowed it to increase distance but recharging times still were pretty long. Most modern engines still would take around 5 years to recharge. Private corporations \n\nplaced their production facilities over many different systems allow communities there to grow. To transport goods, supplies and people corporations tried to use autonomous trucks at first, but pretty quickly realized that during jumps the ship becomes too unstable and needs manual control. Also those trucks pretty quickly become an easy target for a space pirates. It was obvious - ships needed a crew.\n\nThat's how space truckers came to life. Small groups of people were sent on a several dozen years journey. During flight crew usually used working shifts and were always divided into groups of 2 people - pilot and engineer. When the engine recharges each group at some point has to be awake to monitor ships systems and make sure the recharging process goes without issues.\n\nIn our journey crew got new assignment from a head office. They are getting brand new “truck” with the newest hibernate capsules. They should pick up and deliver very important cargo to a pretty distant stellar system. Along with delivery they have a ""small side quest"" -  test new hibernate capsules. Those brand new capsules instead of putting a person in an unconscious dream allowed him to experience different sets of emotions in prepared scenarios in order to stimulate their brain, so after a trip crew wouldn't need time to restore their health. But crew members don't know that you have to be very careful with playing in those scenarios. It might suck you in if you don't stop it at the right time. Some of the scenarios have dangerous side effects which might affect your mind. \n\nOur crew doesn't know yet that their side quest is actually the main purpose of this trip and who knows where it's gonna get them.\n\ndialogue somewhere from the game prologue (just for better narrative feeling)\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n\- Hey Bob! Did you hear those corp rats giving us new truck for some important trip? Heard they installed new version of sleeping machines which should help us to not get stupid by the end of the trip as usual, what do you think?\n\n\- Wow, that would be cool. I wanted to pay off my shithole apartment in sector 7 for such a long time. Wouldn't want to spend another year trying to get my brain back working.\n\n\- Yeah, I also heard they didn't test them yet, but listen...it's good isn't it? They promised to pay twice more for this trip. I don't think those corps would want us to die if that cargo is so important, it should be easy.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n*Main character and his abilities*\n\nMain char - member of the crew, mechanic.

But also you can choose and go play through different scenarios in that world to make it more interesting for you to spend that time.

ojawv3,New enemies for Pacman, what new type of enemies would you come up with for Pacman?
oj8jbf,A class customization made for RP and immersing yourself in your character.,"So recently, while trying to come up with new builds to do for Skyrim, (I made a Vampire Warlord. I know you didn't ask.) I had an idea for a mechanic that basically allowed you to take free range of creating a class, like Skyrim, but a bit more complex in some areas and a bit more simple in others.  \n\n\nSo here's how it would work: Most RPG's (and this mechanic is RPG focused) have the usual skill trees with perks and talents, but in this class customization, you could select three skill trees where you learn their skills faster than any other, helping to immerse yourself in your class. (For example, if you wanted to make some type of mage, you could select light armor, some form of magic, and idk let's say alchemy/potions as your three skill tree buffs.) At the start of creating your class, you would also start with a few points which you can put into these skill trees to start them off leveled up a bit. (Kind of like Neverwinter Nights or Baulder's Gate) And then you give yourself a class trait. You start out with a few basic ones, but more can be unlocked by playing the game, long quest chains, etc. These class traits would be a skill that you can only have one of to help make your class a little more unique.  \n\n\nThe last step of this class customization would be choosing from a backstory for your character which will give you certain advantages but might give you a disadvantage or two, and once again help to immerse yourself in your character. (Ex: Like if your chosen backstory was farmer, you would have advantages in eating and medium/light armor but would have a slight disadvantage when it came to magic/spells). Some of these backstories would start the player off in a new area leading to a new intro and possibly a few short side quests, although they could lead back to the main story. These backstories could also be unlocked by playing the game, as in, beating story arcs, long quest chains, beating the game (and getting different endings if the devs are into that) etc. Maybe you can make your own backstory with it's own lore but it would have the normal starting area and not give any advantages or disadvantages.  \n\n\nTo wrap up, you name your class and go on your way. This type of class customization would be fantastic (although, I will agree it likely needs some fine tuning) for RPG games. The unlockable class traits and backstories could possibly add lots of replay value to the game, something devs usually hope to give players the experience of, without making the game feel unfair at the start. This type of class customization could also give players a lot of creativity and power over what type of story they want to play. It could now be easier to play the demonic villain, it could now be easier to play someone with a hate for the undead, it could now be easier to play an old grumpy mage hermit, etc etc. and truly immerse yourselves into these roles. (The only thing that would make this perfect is if more modern RPG's had vast dialogue trees like older D&amp;D games) I won't ever be making this (I never could get into programming, I tried four times) but I hope someone does someday. It would be ***magnificent*** \[insert Italian hand emoji\] ."
oj8g1f,Racing Royal,"This game seems very simple to imagine and yet I have never seen a game like this anywhere. The Battle Royal mechanic has been overused and yet almost every game looks the same. A good way to revolutionize this type of game is I think via a Battle Royal racing game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Racing Royal the race is drawn as the game goes on, in an Open World city. The player closest to the head of the race is the first, the closest to the first is the second, the closest to the second is the third and so on until the last. Every 10 (20 or 30) seconds the last one in the race is eliminated. Players can choose not to follow the race route, to take shortcuts or to collect upgrades that appear all over the map. The winner of the race is the last person still driving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you know a game that look like this I would realy like to play it."
oj5wbu,FP GAME IDEA,"Hey Guys I'am looking for a first person game idea. So far I've only got cutting tree's with an axe on my game. I was rhinking about a chicken killer game, but I don't know how I can make a game about that, any ideas?"
oj5uu1,A game where you primarily play as Venom,"I think that Sony and PlayStation are missing out by making an M-Rated Venom video game. The game would feature a younger Eddie Brock when he just gets the symbiote and after being embarrassed/humiliated by Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The game's Story would have a symbiote who is experienced with combat and other powers from other past hosts before Peter put it under containment allowing players to have many other powers to play with in an open world sandbox with many great action locals to destroy/play with. It would have a story where Eddie uses the suit to track down super villians and Spider-Man along with saving the city from a massive threat of a symbiote invasion or a robotic take over and eventually teaming up with all the heroes/villians he has faced throughout is story. The main feature I would want to implement to not have to warrant a skill tree would be the decision to spare the Heroes/villians you encounter to help you with the final confrontation or to consume the hero/villian and have more powers to use in the final confrontation. This final confrontation would be either Doc Ock or Spider-Man with his own symbiote (either carnage after realizing there would be no one to kill if Venom would win or some other symbiote that would actually have good intentions). The game would have 5 different endings. One where you stop Doc Ock. One where you see the good side in Doc Ock's plan and help him. One where you kill Spider-Man and cause a symbiote invasion using the radioactive part of Spider-Man's blood to multiply the amount of symbiotes creating ""Venom Country"". And one where you stop to reconsider what you have just done and let Spider-Man bring you to justice. The Last ending would be where you free Carnage from a mental institute and go on a killing spree all throughout the big apple. A carnage DLC would be something I would love to add to the game along with a Silver Sable DLC where you hunt Venom down. Of course Rated-M for drug abuse, Intense violence, blood and gore, and strong language. The game should be made by Insomniac, Rocksteady, and Neversoft. Tell me what you all think in the comments!"
oj1fdd,Giving directions simulator,"The core concept is a game centred around giving directions to passerbys through hand gestures (or any other form of cardinal direction) around a small open world city. \n\nPersonally, I'm imagining it as a rainy night in a small, dingy city. Most of the light coming from streetlamps and the signs on clubs and restaurants. Occasionally, various NPCs stop you on your way around town to ask you for directions to the aforementioned clubs and restaurants. The core mechanic would be to do your best to familiarize yourself with the city and point the NPCs in the right direction using only cardinal directions.  e.g '' Take a left, then another left, then a right, then straight until you reach Club Flamingo''\n\nAs for further ideas, I'd encourage creative freedom, there's a few ways a game with those mechanics could go. High score/reputation system/infinite walking simulator/social sim, etc.\n\nWould like to hear your own thoughts/ideas here."

oiwvil,3v1 Groovy TPS,"There are 4 players(3v1) in a 3D space. 3 of the players are the hackers or “ disablers” and the other the powerful  “firewall” system, programmed to protect the AI core at the center of the map. This player will have access to the security system of the facility. They control guards, enable turrets release traps and more to try and stop the disablers. Disablers will have abilities they can use to defend and heal their teammates or to attack and disable the firewall. every round, players can improve their skills and equipment, and the AI can upgrade its system.  The Disablers team wins a match by shutting down the core, and the Firewall can win by successfully defending until the time has run out, or killing all of the Disablers.  The game is finished when one team wins three rounds . There are a number of characters with unique abilities to choose from. \n\nVisuals:\nThe game and characters will have a minimalistic and colorful retro design based on 70s sci-fi with heavy psychedelic influence.

oin3st,Hunger Games but you’re the Head Gamemaker,"This idea has been in my head for a while. I found out that I love management games but I also enjoy some hack and slash. But imagine if you could do both. Here’s my idea:\nYou’re a Head Gamemaker in Panem and it’s your job to create a Hunger Games worthy of broadcast. Imagine if you could decide the arena. Turn it into a desert! An arctic! Or a city! It could be those like sandbox-y Planet Coaster-esque retraining but the tributes actually interact with it. You could decide which weapons are available. You get info on the tributes and can tailor it as suited. You could cause effects such as the fire in Hunger Games, or the clock in Catching Fire (might be a bit much haha but still)\n\nMAYBE you could even watch like tribute showcases, give scores and stuff based on their attributes.\n\nI was even thinking about like mutts and the sort. Imagine if you could do something like genetically engineer mutts, make can go for a specific tribute, etc, give them features. You can choose where to release them. Perhaps as the Games progresses, you get an entertainment rating, etc. Or like maybe you could do something with the tribute parade, and interviews etc. \n\nThis would be micro management on a whole other level. \n\nAt the end of the game you could get like an overall entertainment rating, how much people enjoy the Games, etc those things. \n\nOof I’m getting really excited haha"
oimx3w,Arcade soccer game with some Mario Kart vibe,"Hello there, here is a simple idea I got as some soccer tournaments just ended this week, I would like your opinion/thoughts about that, so any comment would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nMy main references are Super Mario Strikers and Rocket League, as you can play with small teams in quite small stadiums, the action is quite fast and the style quite arcade. The idea would be to remain in a cartoon style and throw some funny situations along the game. Something like Kopanito but in a smaller arena, with maybe less characters and of course much more items (in addition of the ultimate that needs to be charged over time), and why not some arena random behaviors (for example mole invasion), or some weather effect with real impact on the game (like a tornado, or thunderbolts).  \nWhy soccer/football ? Just because it's the current most popular sport, and it allows simpler graphics (for example a character can have the same animation while running with or without the balloon), but if you think about any other ""sport"" feel free to post it.  \nAs in Mario Kart, not only the skill should reward the player, but also smart plays with the items. They can be used either defensively or offensively, but friendly fire is enabled so it should be used wisely. As the game takes place in an arena, some AoE spells could also be added, but still with non lethal stuff, the game should remains suitable for all audiences. A hit character is only pushed a bit in the air, or is stunned for a bit, then can start play again.  \nOf course there would not be any referee, so players are free to unleash they ferocity. Maybe the goal keeper could be non playable and should dodge all attacks to avoid any cheat. Moreover, the arena is closed, so the ball bounces on sides to avoid any free time for the player (which would be compensated by quick games of several minutes).  \n\n\nFinally, I think there should not be any ""stats"" on the players or the team, which leads to some frustration of ""you won only because you picked this team/character"", only cosmetic differences. Maybe only the ultimate could be based on the character, but then the balancing should be perfect.  \n\n\nSo what do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point."

The closer the zombies get, the harder it is to hit the golf ball the way you want, because you get scared and shake more with decreased distance between you and the zombies.””\n\nYou can shoot the zombies, set traps, or hit them with your clubs if they get close enough.” Credit: u/Jfonzy\n\nI like this idea a lot and just got an oculus quest 2 and would like to start working with it keeping in mind I’m a solo developer. The addition of vr allows for wacky physics that add a lot to the overall experience. Multiplayer is the same deal as a lot of the fun comes from the players themselves. For example, instead of working together to fend off the zombies to help your teammate golf you could use them to your advantage as a distraction. Of course single player would also be available with a campaign of sorts. From a development perspective it’s appealing as the gameplay would be, no pun intended, par for the course for a vr game, shooting and swinging. This is labeled as a request as I like the core concept but need some input on a clearer idea of specific game modes, what a campaign would look like, and generally what you would what to see in a game like this."

oie41t,Help with a game mechanic,"Ello'. I wanted to develop a short project, and challenge myself by using a game engine with a ton of limitations. The game idea I settled upon was a short top-down game in which enemies would be following you, and you have to destroy them and score points by making two or more enemies collide. Sort of based of the ancient myth of the labyrinth of Crete. When I was doing a bit of research, I came upon a game called Catch Me, by a dev named T1mBer. Unfortunately, the game's concept and visual style was highly similar to what I had planned. (Note that this game was made before I even came up with the idea so they didn't steal the idea, and I just found out about the game days before writing this, so I didn't steal anything either.) This brings me to my question. Does any one have any game mechanics or features that could differentiate this game so it doesn't feel like a blatant copy? Also, the game can only use the keys W, A, S, D, I, J, K, L, O, U, SPACE, and ENTER, and no mouse controls. Its a limitation of the engine. \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nOmnis316"

oiaek3,VR Slasher Game (You are the Slasher),"This is a single player and multiplayer game. You can play with bot victims/prey or people victims. If playing multiplayer then the victims have to perform tasks (clean the house, house sit, go to work) until they encounter the slasher. (They will hear a heart beat when the slasher is close) ig single player then the Ai does this automatically.\n\nAt the start of the game (not startup) you get to create your slasher. You can choose your weapon; claws, knife, axe, etc. each one has its own stats, buffs and de-buffs (The claws do massive damage but are short range and you are unable to pick up objects that aren’t the “prey”, the axe has long range, does high damage but is slower and has weight to slow you down, but it can be dropped). Your costume can also have buffs and rebuffs as well. You want to be a Clown? Most people may be suspicious of you if you are in a certain area, but it could also lure out a few people as well to make for easy targets. You want to have a similar costume to Ghost face? (Phantom) You can run faster, especially with a knife or claws, you are also harder to detect in the dark and have a bullet resistant vest so you have more health, however if you get spotted and are unable to react you become instantly hunted. \n\nThe goal is that in each level you have certain victims you have to kill (kind of like Hitman), you can kill any NPC though. There is no time limit, however there are police who will try to stop you if they get alerted. They won’t know where you are at all times, but if they figure out your targets they may try to bring them to a safe house making them harder to kill. (There is a pattern and you have to try to make sure you don’t leave clues and keep your pattern hidden)\n\nThere could be levels that you can go through, or instead have an open world dynamic somehow with a survival mode and day cycle with a story. The levels can have their own story.\n\nMisc mechanics; you can drop your weapons (aside from claws) and pick up other weapons you find through the map if you so choose. You can use the environment to get kills, i.e. bricks, walls, sharp objects that are in the environment. The victims may know you depending on the level, so you get bonus points if you “reveal” yourself by removing the mask and showing them your face before you kill them. If they escape while doing that and they go to the police it is game over. After each level you can level up your equipment and costumes and skills.\n\nI’m not a game designer, but i personally play them and would love to see this."
oi9bc1,Language Civ Game,"A simplistic cutesy civilization, god sim type game with different regions or continents. The main mechanic, and hardest to add, has to do with language. You start of with English (Common) or whatever languages you feel comfortable adding as the first and common language. Every person starts off in the same area, continent or region. These people will create a nation with a language. As people expand and move off the main language will start to change or have slang. (There could be a rough translation). This could be done via a random word generator using simple word structures than will occasionally replace words in the common language throughout different nations or regions, even religions if you want to get fancy and add that. The starting region is least likely to change, you can put in a mechanic such as it’s more likely to change depending on how many times people have moved or split off, locations, types of plants or wildlife in an area. If a region gets invaded then their language may become more common in that area. As a player you can get a rough translation as we’ll if that is possible to put in the game. The rest is up to you to do whatever you want with."
oi85ss,The Scapegoat: A Bronze Age action rpg where you’re a Goatman combatant.,"Feel free to use this idea, or add to it.\n\nStory:  A nomadic tribe in 1,000 BC had a ritual to “cleanse” themselves of their sins. During the year, they sinned constantly. They sinned against each other, and against other tribes and nations. At the end of the year, their “holy man” performed the ritual to transfer all of their sins onto a goat. The goat was then stoned to death by the people, and the tribespeople cheered, believing that they have cleansed themselves and destroyed the evil.  The bad news is that you were the goat. The good news is that God was so angry by this that He resurrected you as a Goatman (or Goatwoman), so that you can travel the world and strike down evil!\n\nGameplay: The game can begin in any part of the world, which can either be chosen by you or chosen randomly by the computer. The view is 3rd person, and the camera angle can be manipulated to show any view that you want. Each part of the world has many areas for you to explore and do battle in.  As you defeat enemies, you gain experience, get better stats (hit points, strength, dexterity, and magic), and acquire gold that you can buy items with. Since you’re not human, many merchants won’t do business with you, so you will need to diplomatically find merchants that will work with you.  In parts of the world where gold money is not yet used, you can barter with merchants. Character level should go to 100.\n\nCharacter creation:  You can choose your gender (males have horns and females don’t, and their voices sound different). The available character classes are warrior (strength based), rogue (dexterity based), mage (intelligence based) or cleric (wisdom based).  You can also choose your fur color and eye color.\n\nAppearance and speech: Your Goatman or woman should look like a hominoid goat: [http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/\_\_cb20131110134033/cryptidz/images/thumb/1/1f/Satyr.jpg/316px-Satyr.jpg](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131110134033/cryptidz/images/thumb/1/1f/Satyr.jpg/316px-Satyr.jpg)\n\nThe speech should sound like human speech mixed with the “baa” sound that goats make.\n\nSkills:  Warriors, rogues, mages, and clerics should have skills similar to those in other role playing games. Warriors and rogues both use stamina to execute their moves, and mages and clerics use magic points to cast their spells. Stamina and magic points regenerate over time, and you can gain items that facilitate faster regeneration.\n\nGear:  As you defeat enemies, you acquire better armor, weapons (swords, spears, clubs, axes, staves, etc.), rings, amulets, helms, gloves, and other items. Basically, the gear is similar to those found in other rpgs, but the metallic weapons would be bronze instead of iron.  Healing potions and herbs can be found throughout the game, and can also be bought. Sleep heals you a bit as well.\n\nFood and water:  Goats and Goatpeople are herbivores, so you can either buy food or water or simply eat vegetation and drink from freshwater sources.  You will need to stock up before spending lots of time in desert regions.\n\nTransportation:  You start the game on foot, but you can acquire horses or camels to get around faster.\n\nEnemies: Most of the game, you will be fighting with evil humans all over the world, and also with wild animals that attack you. The one that decides to make this game could also incorporate demons or other evil creatures into the game.  Enemies in each region regenerate, but bosses don’t.\n\nEndgame:  Once you have completed all of the objectives in each region of the world, you will need to defeat an evil cult. Somewhere in the world (which could be randomly chosen by the computer for each game), there is an evil religion forming that masquerades as something good. You must enter their citadel and defeat them.  The final boss is an evil cleric in league with the Devil.\n\nFeel free to chime in with your own ideas on how to develop this idea."
oi5czk,New Multiplayer Sword Fighting Game!,[removed]
oi512u,"""Choose-your-own-adventure"" video game, through a 3D book","Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about after finding some old books called ""Choose-your-own-adventure"", where you build your own adventure based on all the choices you're making while playing. I'm thinking about ways to turn it into a video game, by adding some RPG elements, but finding the good balance between random generation and hand-made stuff is hard to reach, so a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nMy main references are Hand of Fate and Slay The Spire, where the game design perfectly handles the repetitiveness of all the plays, despite always playing with the same cards against the same opponents.  \n\n\nSo in my mind I would go into a ""real"" book that the player opens. There would be a class selection, so the player would have to play differently based on its choice. As the main game loop, a random ""encounter"" is chosen and displayed/drawn on the left page, with a basic illustration and some text. Then on the right appear all the choices the player can make, that can vary based on previous choices, chosen character class, owned items, ... When the selection is made, dices are thrown, then the next page turns to display the result. These ""encounters"" are chosen randomly each time the player chooses this book. But there won't be always a ""good"" and a ""wrong"" choice, so the choice to make doesn't depend on the result it gives but on the current situation. At the end, if it's a linear story, player has to go through X encounters, else after getting some requirements, the last ""encounter"" appears automatically.  \n\n\nTo add more content, I would like to add some ""action"" into the game, like Hand of Fate did with the realtime combats. In my case, the camera would go lower on the book, then some models would pop up from it (like with real pop up books) in a paper style (so 2D sprites on top of the 3D book, like in Paper Mario games), but I still don't know what gameplay could fit here (adding cards and go to a Slay the Spire style could work, so the ""characters"" could remain static, but it feels quite easy to go that way).  \n\n\nI also thought about adding a online multiplayer system, where sometimes the choice has to be taken quickly, so the first one taking a decision would actually select the choice. Adding social aspect in RPG games often leads to funny situations, specially when players are going RP.  \n\n\nIdeally, adding also a story creator tool could help bring new content to the game over time, and people would be able to create any story (so not only Heroic Fantasy style), even if I'm afraid it's too much work as many encounters need to be added, the more content there is the more replayability will be added...  \n\n\n What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point."
oi4gn4,A Bomberman-like in full 3D with some RPG elements,"Hello there, I would like to begin a new personal project to improve my skills on Unity 3D, so I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about since I replayed some retro Genesis games (in this case Mega Bomberman), I'm still trying to find new ways to improve the main gameplay, so a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nSo the main base is Bomberman, there are several players in a ""fixed"" area (meaning no camera movement, for readability purpose), and the last survivor wins the game. I would like to go into full 3D (so 3D graphics but also 3D gameplay), like Bomberman 64 did, to take advantage of it and build 3D levels with some relief.  \n\n\nOne thing I'm not sure about is the fact that players can be killed by explosions, I would go more into a ""Smash Bros"" style where the players need to be kicked from the arena. So one explosion pushes the character in the air in a ragdoll style, then after a few time he wakes up and can move again. Maybe in some cases it could be good to explode hisself, like the rocket jump in Team Fortress 2, to go on higher platforms, for example to pick a bonus. Also the overtime could be the arena sides falling into the void little by little.\n\n  \nI would keep rocks or any other obstacle to destroy to seek bonuses, but I would go with various items to not only go with classic bomb amount and bomb explosion radius, for example ice bombs to freeze a player, or walking bombs that seeks the closest player in the arena, or any other common spell we can see in RPG games. The idea is to bring as much gameplay varieties into the game to make the party quite unique every time.  \n\n\nAlso I thought about bringing some life to the arenas, like active arena behaviors to give a bit of randomness, or random NPCs who try to defend their area. The activation of the behaviors would be linked to the explosion amount, or the explosion area, to stick to something immersive.  \n\n\nFinally, to balance a bit the game so it's not only based on skill, passive abilities could be choosen by the first killed player on each play (or 3 skills for the players who lost, the first one to die is the first one to choose which one he wants), to help him survive longer the next game against better players.  \n\n\n What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point."
oi3cvh,Concept of arcade game," \n\nConcept\n\nHello, friends!\n\nI would like to share the concept of a small arcade game for mobile devices, which I recently started working on. I will be glad if there are those who want to read a small description below and say something about what they have read!\n\nThis is a simple arcade session game in which the player will have to control the wind currents with the help of a touchscreen, carrying a small ice crystal across the winter sky, which turns into a beautiful snowflake during the game session. The snowflake is very fragile, so the wind have to blow on it very carefully, otherwise it may break and the game will end. The longer the player manages to keep the snowflake in flight, the more victory points he will get. I want to make a concise and relatively simple game, the purpose of which will be a set of points, but the gameplay will not be limited exclusively to collecting the necessary items for this, as in most similar arcades.\n\n**Theme:** In essence, this is a game about achieving and maintaining balance. The player must score as many points as possible. There are two ways to do this : by creating a beautiful and fragile snowflake that easily breaks in the air flow, but allows you to score points faster, or by creating a not very beautiful, but strong snowflake that will last longer in the atmosphere, but brings less points. I will tell you more about this below, in the section about mechanics.\n\n**Game mechanics:**\n\n**Scoring of points:** From the beginning of the game session, the player begins to receive victory points. The longer the game session lasts, the more victory points he will get. Snowflake falls from top to bottom. If it did not crash from the player's careless actions, the player receives victory points for each unit of time (second) of flight. If it crashes, the game session ends.\n\n**Control of a snowflake:** The player cannot control a snowflake directly by moving it across the screen using a finger movement on the touch screen. Instead, it can create gusts of wind by moving along the touchscreen in the right direction, which affect the snowflake and make it fly to the right place. Or not to fly where you don't need to. At the same time, a very clear control of movements is necessary so that the gust is smooth - too sharp a finger movement on the touchscreen will create a very strong wind that can destroy a snowflake.\n\n**Changing the characteristics of a snowflake:** The snowflake has two conditional characteristics - ""beauty”, which increases the speed of scoring points and ""strength”, which increases the stability of the snowflake before external influences. Increasing the value of one characteristic automatically reduces the value of another. At the same time, the player does not see the values themselves in the form of numbers, the snowflake on the screen only changes visually. If it grows new rays and takes on a more complex shape, the speed of scoring points increases. If the rays become thicker and simpler in shape, the speed of scoring decreases, but the snowflake is better able to withstand sharp gusts of wind.\n\n**Warm and cold zones:** The characteristics of a snowflake change when it hits warm and cold zones on the screen, which are visually marked as clouds of different colors. ""Warm"" clouds increase the characteristic of beauty, and cold clouds increase the characteristic of strength. With the help of wind gusts, the player needs to direct a snowflake into these clouds or bypass them if the player believes that he does not need their effect at the moment.\n\n**Air vortices:** In addition to warm and cold zones, there are air vortices on the screen, which are dangerous by default, and they need to be avoided in any case, because if a snowflake hits them, it can collapse. A snowflake with high strength, however, is able to fly through them for some time, however, not constantly - at some point it will still collapse.\n\n**Random gusts of wind:** In order to push the player to make quick decisions that at the same time require careful movements, there are random gusts of wind in the game. They occur if the player does not do anything for a few seconds and takes a snowflake in a random direction. Such gusts of wind cannot destroy a snowflake by themselves, however, they can drive it into an air vortex or lead it away from the desired trajectory. For example, if a snowflake just fell into the cloud that the player needed, and he waited until it just flew through it.\n\n**References:**\n\nThinking through this concept, I was inspired by mobile games in which control is carried out using a touchscreen, and which often require a quick response to what is happening on the screen and at the same time success depends on the accuracy of the player's movements. These are games like Fruit Ninja, [Hole.io](https://hole.io/) or Twisty road. At the same time, I wanted the player to have the opportunity to choose the tactics of passing the game session. He can rely on reliability and get fewer points in exchange for the fact that the game will forgive him more mistakes or take risks to get more points. Or look for a balance between these two extremes.\n\nThis is my idea, thank you to everyone who took the time to get acquainted with it! I hope you will find something to say about what you have read - I will be glad to receive any feedback."

ohxnui,New Game (Wonders Of Fantasy) Android Game,[removed]
ohw0rz,"Forest Ranger ""HOG""","Basically, it's less of a game, as a big open forest you can walk through and enjoy the scenery. The actual gameplay is collection. You hit a key, or right click to take snapshots of animals or birds in the trees, on the ground, or flying (these will be random, and they'll fly/scamper all over, and likely the most difficult bit in the game), collect bugs, stones, seeds, and maybe seashells if you put it near a shore.\n\nEssentially, you're something like a park ranger, or at least someone living in the woods interested in collection. You've got cupboards full of empty jars, and empty photo albums to fill. Any item, or pic of a new animal gets saved (you can swap with better photos if you get one).\n\nThat's just about it. It's a nice peaceful game about enjoying nature, and collecting stuff in your path. The object is to collect everything. No monsters. Nothing to kill."
ohu2wz,A game where you play as a team of androids that pulls off heists.,"So I've gotta give a lot of credit for this idea to the animated short called Blindspot from Netflix's mostly excellent sci-fi anthology Love, Death, and Robots.  The short follows 4 heavily armed robots trying to heist the contents of this train like semi-truck.  As I rewatched this one, it suddenly occurred to me that there was a lot that could be done with this.  I recommend checking it out to see if you see the same potential I do. \n\nThe art direction has a cell shaded, cartoony, and video game-esque type of charm, somewhat reminiscent of something like Borderlands.   I feel like that is the perfect kind of look for something like this.  As for the premise, we are a group of robot super-thieves.  The focus of the short is this rookie character, but I could see swapping through them throughout the campaign (probably even mid-mission, or co-op 4P).  What're we doing?  Pulling off heists to get more money, to get more gear and abilities, to go on bigger heists.  \n\nMechnically, I'm imagining it being a third person game with each character having unique specialties (shooter, brawler, demo, etc.).  I feel like one of the biggest potential opportunities here is that they're chasing a fast moving vehicle.  This should be somewhat of a recurring thing.  To do this, they have these cars with open tops which they can set to autopilot and jump up onto the train.  Gameplaywise, this could have some interesting opportunities.  \n\nImagine summoning your car to quickly escape a near death situation by retreating behind your teammates.  Imagine being able to give your car quick little commands which improve the odds for you.  For example, you could tell it to position on the right side of the rail car you're on top of and bump into it.  If you combine that with the character doing it having the ability to anchor himself to the roof, it might send guards who are shooting at you flying off while you remain in place.  You could also work in more ""augmented reality"" abilities, like locking onto someone in your line of site, and it's the car that shoots a missile at that reticle. You might even be able to perform team vehicle attacks which do things like set trip wires or spike traps.  \n\nThe first several missions should either be ground or car chase based.  Eventually though, with enough money earned, I think purchasing single rider water and air vehicles could add new dimensions of complexity and variety.  I also like the idea of a respawn system where you don't fail a mission until all 4 characters die, but you don't get that character back until you fail or quit.    \n\nI've thought a bit about a story too, if anyone cares.  I feel like it could be interesting if it's never really addressed where they came from or how they were created or anything for a long time.  It's just merc buds havin a good time.  Then, second or third act, all the money they've heisted is stolen from them by someone.  Turns out it's the creator, of course.  He made robots that could heist for him to insulate himself from risk, and his plan was always to kick back, monitor them, and take their pile when the time was right.  So, naturally, ya rally together, and go on a mission to kill dad."
ohsfz2,Fighting Super intelligent evil Dinosaurs in Prehistoric times with futuristic laser weapons from a highly advanced Venus.,"Long ago before time began, the Venusians ruled the solar system on their sunset ringed planet. \n\nIn all their wonder and creation, they had slowed their plant’s day cycle to a 1/3 of solar year. They knew that it wouldn’t be long for their world to go through catastrophic climate collapse, and bring forth their own extinction. \n\nFire and ice encircled their world as they escaped towards a new planet, Earth. This planet was ruled by another species known as the Dinosaurs who wanted nothing more than to claim their place as kings of the soul star, a magic crystal in the middle of our solar system(Sol) they believed was the source of all life and power, that the Venusians used to give themselves magic.\n\nAs the Venusians landed on earth, they were betrayed by their subjects. Instead of offering them shelter as refugees, the Dinosaurs began to kill as many as they could. They meant to destroy the Venusians and finish their extinction. \n\nThe Venusians took up arms against the Dinosaurs, and that is the premise of the game.\n\n- You play as a Venusian Survivor\n\n- the setting is prehistoric jungle in epically big proportions. \n\n- all the enemies are gigantic and absolutely terrifying. Like, piss your pants terrifying. They are bigger than you, stronger than you, and faster than you without your technology.\n\n- your technology makes you a demigod, you are superhuman. Able to run and jump faster and stronger than any human ever could with cybernetic robot parts. \n\n- your lasers weapons go pew pew, but in a very loud terrifying way. Your weaponry is like electricity on steroids, as is all very bright lasers and plasma.\n\n- as the dinosaurs can kill you in one shot, so can you with one or two on them, but there are a lot more of them. You are always outnumbered and on your toes, blasting and running as fast as you can to the end of the level. \n\n- the end of the level is the goal. You want to reach it in order to survive, but hidden side objectives would be hidden along the way at greater difficulty to get but could alter the story in small ways(which side characters survive).\n\n- multiple endings based on how you played through the story, each one offering a different level of happy ending to unhappy ending. in either case, humanity survives by someone blowing up a Super-Nuke that has the explosive potential of an asteroid hitting earth. Final level involves fighting through hell on earth, similar to the Venus Home-world, but recoverable. Except for the Dinosaurs that get wiped out.\n\n- all weapons are bright and shiny tech in an otherwise horrifying and dark landscape. \n\n- The Animals that the Venusians brought with them look mythical, like unicorns and gryphons, and there could be an epic boss fight against a giant red dragon while riding a unicorn and shooting laser beams that go PEEEOWMZzzzz! \n\n- and the leader of the Dinosaurs are the Dragons. Dragons are absolutely the main antagonist to the game I’ve just now decided. They’re the Lords of the Dinosaurs, the masterminds behind the plot to overthrow the Venusians. \n\n- the Venusians look like robotic angels, because of course they do. Get a real hell VS heaven vibe in there. Good vs evil. \n\n- upgradeable kit and armour\n\n- interesting game mechanic, but you could always have a couple NPC teammates with you that you can also upgrade and lose in the story. \n\n- epic 80’s style synth music similar to Farcry 3 Blood Dragon. TWRP would probably rock it and be my first choice. \n\nI just smoke a bowl of Cannabis about a half hour ago so I hope this is coherent, but that would be my dream game. \n\nA Sci-fi shooter in a story driven narrative similar to the first 3 Halo’s but with upgrades and progression to yourself and your kit along the way, with interesting side characters(or pets) the player will connect with and not want to lose.\n\n—-\n\nOn an unrelated note, i love Farcry 3 Blood dragon. Anyone who’s ever played that game knows exactly the kind of setting I want lol"
ohs1gi,Pet Sim + Procedural Survival,"In this game, you play as a robot whose goal is to raise cute, fuzzy aliens. You have landed on a new planet with these aliens in eggs. You must prepare their home, allow them to hatch, and then keep them alive and happy. To do this, you collect resources, build structures, and construct other robots to help you with this task.\n\nThe player themselves is immortal and is able to survive just about anything -- but the aliens you are raising are squishy, fragile and quite dumb. They do pretty much what they want and might end up getting into hijinks or dying. There are hostile monsters on this world which would like to eat them as well.\n\nThe aliens are cute, and very individualized. Perhaps they look something like furbies. They have special coats, different colored eyes, make different noises, and have different ""personality types."" The player can name them. Eventually they grow up and lay eggs of their own, and then ""fly away"" as adults, perhaps even growing wings.\n\nThe robots/systems you build to keep your alien colony alive are quite simple -- either mining or moving resources, acting as defense or alarms, or fulfilling the specific need of the alien creatures. Think something like Factorio in terms of the kinds of components you hook together."
ohrdmv,Dual narrative ww2 dream,"It's literally a dream, I don't expect anyone to really take any inspiration from this, I just want to see how the idea will do.\nGameplay:\nBasically, its like an optional multiplayer campaign or you can play as a solo campaign, but it's you design and customise from like 1 to 4 or something characters(soldiers) and their loud outs, and each time you die that character dies and you have to choose another character in multiplayer, and in solo your entire squad  plays(as AI) and you can switch person before missions, so you can have different loud outs. I'd imagine you'd have to water down the difficulty a bit and have regular healing points and refill points, and it'd be a bit like Republic commando where you can direct squad mates.\nSetting:\nSo the setting would be for campaign one would be an allied story where its either French or Polish resistance and I don't mean to seem ignorant in just mixing them but I really can't decide. Anyway it'd be guerilla warfare, like stealth and blowing up bridges/assassinating important figures or destroying people and if you break the stealth than you'd have to deal with repercussions like going underground or getting parachuted out, or you could have the alternative of running of with guns or money shipped in and going on the run from the allies and the axis. For campaign 2 you are part of the elite trained chinese NRA 88th division. You are no one, you are just a regular private and it would make sure you can't kill an entire Japanese division and you have to keep cover or die. This would have the option of betraying but eventually in 1945 you are shamed and probably hung or desert where you have to go on the run. Campaign 3 is an axis perspective, a bit like the last tiger from battlefield 5 and you go from the start of d day starting to see Normandy fall and then capturing the desperate feeling of the German people of Berlin in 1945. Once again desertion option. Each campaign needs a new set of soldiers. \nPlease don't take this seriously, Im just spit balling here. It would be based as much as I can on real life operations and missions I'd try to make it personal."

You start a game, you have a cast of 6 characters (who may or may not all be part of or roadies for a touring rock band) each have a unique ability to help you escape or defeat this cult. A character dies, they're dead. You can still progress but it is more difficult without the deceased characters' abilities. Key items, map layout, and cult member appearances are randomized each time you play.\n\nStory is limited. Players may find bits of lore throughout the world but I don't want cutscenes to break up the casualness of the experience. Also weapons are scarcely available and serve so the player can defend against 'followers' of the cult family who do not possess the mutant strength the core members of the cult possess. The violence in gamw would have to be tiptoeing the limits to give it that 70s grindhouse feel.\n\nMultiple ways out. Escape or find a way to kill this hippie cult. \n\nTL;DR - Rob Zombie + RE7 + Dark Pictures Anthology"

Suddenly, a scream echoes out - our hero (the player) has discovered hair on his pillow.. He has… *Started to go Bald!!*\n\nAnd so the game begins.  You are presented with a rear view of the main characters head, and a few options as to how to progress.  Your goal in this game:  To keep from going bald at any cost!  This game simulates the real experience of losing your hair, and all the ridiculous paths one might take in prolonging, preventing or even reversing the process.\n\nYou have money which you can spend in game and more options which become available as you progress.  The game is a battle against the clock as you must keep on a strict schedule depending on the path you take.  Very similar to Papers Please, the rules of the game evolve and expand and it’s up to the player to keep track of everything.  This is an economy game, and you must balance both your time and money\n\nIn game options\n\nExample, if early on in the game you choose to buy Rogaine, you must apply it twice a day between specific hours, and be advised that it will not take effect until 6 months of in-game use.\n\nLikewise, if you choose to take propecia, you  must take the medicine once a day - and this medicine is very expensive.\n\nOr you could save up your money for hair plugs, but you must also invest in hats to wear before your surgery\n\nYou could volunteer for highly controversial experimental gene therapy\n\nThe options get more ludicrous as you progress."

ol5f0b,Real Murder Mystery Game,"If something like this has been done plz tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game would be something like Town of Salem/Hitman/Among Us ig. I played the demo for a hitman game the other day and I loved the whole idea of assassinating people and hiding their bodies and covering up your tracks and stuff and I think a mechanic like that would work really well in a multiplayer murder mystery game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the game can be played with up to 10 players. There is 1 murderer and 1 detective (this can vary depending on the gameplay itself but those would be the two roles). The players will be put into an enclosed area, pretty big so there's room to explore and stuff. Each player will be given a unique objective/mystery to solve on their own to keep them busy. There isn't any pause or meeting room or anything, the game doesn't stop until someone wins.\n\nThe detective is an anonymous role who doesn't know anyone else's role. They will have a journal or whatever with the clothing and stuff of each player as well as their blood type and fingerprint. Throughout the game you will end up opening doors and stuff (so no gloves are allowed), and your fingerprints will be left on them for the detective to scan or whatever, the murderer has a use for this too but we'll get to that. The journal is something the detective can write in, whatever notes they want such as where a certain player was, etc. They can share this journal with other players if they want, but they must be careful because if the murderer reads it then they automatically get a copy of it that will update the next time the detective lets them read it. The role of the detective is to kill the murderer, they are not given a weapon but instead must find one, this is explained later. But they must be careful bc if they choose wrong then they lose their detective role and it'll be given to someone else randomly.\n\nBut the importance of the detective role is that you are immune to the murderer. The murderer's job is to kill everyone. They know who the detective is and are not allowed to kill them until all other players are dead, then it's a 1v1. The murderer has a map of the area with all its secret entrances and pathways and stuff. They are not given a weapon, but instead must find them throughout the map. Only the murderer and detective can pick them up but they can be found by everyone else. So the murder must find weapons and kill the players. They must hide the bodies and destroy all pieces of evidence, fingerprints they left behind or blood on their clothes and stuff. But the murderer also has the ability to gather fingerprints and blood to use them to try and accuse someone else.\n\nThe murderer will be posed as a common player (with no role).. They can twist stories around by taking a player's fingerprint from door handles and place them on weapons, or sneakily drop the victim's blood on another player to make the detective notice. They can also do this to twist the common players against the detective, since the murderer knows who they are. Each area will have a voting room or something where every 5 minutes a countdown starts for players to vote. Once the 5 minutes is over the voting poll restarts. Depending on how many players are alive, at least half of the players must vote for someone to be kicked out. But voting is completely optional so you would have to get substantial evidence to get half of the group to vote someone out. Anyone can walk in and vote at anytime and the voting is public, so other players will see who you voted for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is pretty long but I hope it makes sense and sounds like a good idea. If you have any questions please ask and I'll try to come up with an answer."

okyxho,GAME IDEA : BIG PROJECT! SURVIVAL,"**Hello!** (Sorry for my English, but I am European) I had this **game idea** in my head for a couple of days now, and I was wondering if I could give this to someone or some people that would make it **real.** The game would be based on real survival in nature. A multiplayer survival videogame. You would start the game with a small tutorial, and then you would need to select a class, like Mammals, Insects, and Fish. Every gameplay would be different. Then you choose which species you want to be. Every species has unique and different advantages. To get a better idea, I will leave down below a couple of links to some videos on youtube, posted by u/TierZoo. He tiers species in an S, A, B, C, D, E, F list from the most overpowered to the most useless. You can get the idea if you wrap your hand around it. Anyway, let's get back to the idea. \n\n**-INSECTS-**\n\n(Low eyesight distance)\n\n\-If you chose the insects, you select a species, Maybe ants. Very powerful in teams, acid spray, powerful damage, small mobility, stealth, etc. \n\nOr you could choose hornets. High mobility, high damage, not very good at fighting terrain species, but good for defenseless insects or others. Overhaul, the hornet is very defensive. \n\n**The bees** are doing a lot of work. Good fighting aerial insects, they have very good sources of food and good defense. The work would be exhausting tho.\n\n**Butterflies**. Very low on defense, hunted down by aerial insects, but easy food. Very high mobility, good for dodging.\n\n**-MAMMALS-**\n\n(High Damage)\n\n\-If you chose **mammals**, you select a high variety of species.\n\n**Monkeys** good known for their intelligence, easy source of food, live in groups, very social, good climbers, good for escaping other threats\n\n**Bears** are very good at attacks, deal lots of damage, have high defense, low mobility, variety of ways to eat. Most of the time they live alone, so if he gets caught by a pack of wolves, he is done.\n\n**Wolves** live in packs, are very social, have a lot of damage, mobility, low defense, stealth, good eyesight, etc.\n\n**Cats** are very good at mobility and stealth, catching birds, mouses, fish, etc. Also low damage, but good eyesight.\n\n**Birds** like hawks, pelicans, owls, sparrows, etc have good eyesight, a variety of ways to hunt down prey, high aerial hunters, very fast, low stealth, low health, low mobility on the ground, vulnerable while they sleep, always in need of a shelter.\n\nThis is all I have time to write, but I hope you got the idea and someone could definitely make this game. Also when you kill enemies, you get XP to unlock other perks like Bears eating honey, ants spraying with acid, better stats, etc. Also thanks for reading this. If you are deciding to do this big project, please keep me updated.

okwrce,Stardew and Yomawari: A Japanese Farming Sim ?? pls help,"Hi everybody, firstly I'd like to preface this by saying im very stoned right now so if there are things that are too vague or just confusing and hard to follow.... I'm sorry. \n\nIt's also my first time here so if I chose the wrong flair, again, I am sorry.\n\nSO imagine: typical farming sim a la Stardew Valley, Sun Haven (new and so far liking it a lot), Harvest Moon-- but I want it to be the Japanese countryside.  little darker of a tone, maybe more somber is the right word? The slimes are oni, the leafers are japanese folktale yokai.  Still otherwise totally the same farming aspect, just yknow more emphasis on rice instead of wheat, idk if the indigenous livestock of Japan are different than the cows and pigs we have , I also think it could be an easy way to make the ""grandfather who passed this farm down to you"" into a fun secondary quest, like how Stardew did but I know in Japan they consider the deceased a bit more, and other region-specific things.

okl2my,A racing game version of FIFA,"Imagine a big licensed game with the same concept of fifa (hear me out) it has F1, F2, F3, IndyCar, WEC, Formula E, Karting etc etc. And the leagues are like FIFA, F1 is the Premier League, IndyCar is La liga etc. Transfers can happen. You can manage teams, player career starting in karting would be amazing I think (will never happen unfortunately) but would be sick eSports racing would be easy to do as it would all be in the same place as well as that there would be much more variety, you could go for the triple crown, you could have a multi year career like Fernando Alonso where you try to win everything everywhere. Also to add on there could be a massive player/driver database so you could manage your favourite team in your favourite series with your favourite drivers. You could make Pato O’Ward at McLaren in F1 happen you could make up for lost time by maybe giving Wehrlein that Mercedes seat he never got or even sign your favourite young driver like Logan Sargeant to your team you currently manage like Penske to their young driver academy? All I know is some of these companies have the money for the licensing. But whether this game could work or if it could happen is very doubtful"
okken2,The Injustice Of Human Evolution,"Story:\nThis story acts as a world war III in the far future. Technology has grown in the year 3061, cars fly, nuclear weapons have improved and are bigger and better, and Exo-suits shield soldiers from the depths of deep war. America’s Conflict with Russia Continues as it breaks the world apart. A soldier in the US Army named Private Joseph Walker and his team are killed in a forest in Russia. Joseph survives and wakes up after The US Army’s Surrender. He plans an idea to destroy the Krovendofh and kill general Aleksei Ivanov. Resulting in America’s victory and the fall of the Russian Federation.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is a first person shooter set in Russia. The character scavenges weapons from weapon crates, finishing missions, spending Ruble or scavenging from dead soldiers. You can perform silent takedowns or lead a gunfight. You have a notoriety bar, if your bar reaches the top, your will immediately die. Avoid gunfights and high profile actions to lower your notoriety. You can also pay a gossiper to lower it. Your notoriety forces you to use shadows and protective cover to your advantage. You also have an Exo-suit which must be repaired at the start of the game, it let’s you double jump, climb higher, swim faster and increases your stealth. “Field mods” let’s you modify your weapons and add attachments while on missions. You can receive attachments from looting corpses and chests. The sights of russia are dark and gloomy due to the explosion of the sun (which was repelled by advanced human technology named “The amplifier”, that captured the radiation and sent it away)."
okh7pv,Question.,Is there any idea  from here that takes off into a final product game?
okf0j4,Manhunt but it's a battle royale,Basically 100 people lurking about in the shadows trying to take eachother out. It would have a focus on stealth and players could set traps and create diversions. Battle royale games have these tense moments (like hiding in a room listening to the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs)  so that could play out well in a horror game. Spectators could vote on what sections of the map close off next or where traps and loot will be.
okcxnh,How to make playing merchant not too boring in a RP game,"Basically, i'm planning to do a game where ""you can do anything"", i know, cliche and sounds impossible, but i'm studying the idea for the past few years so i kinda have an idea on how to make this work, but there is something i'm not finding much of a solution which is basically, jobs that are unrelated to combat and need npc interaction.\n\nLike, a lumberjack or a miner can just do it's job and bring back the resources to either craft things or sell them, but what would something like a merchant do? for context basically the idea of the game is that you're basically like any other npc in a medieval fantasy setting, and anything you do can affect their lives, so you can for example kill someone and put the knife on another npc's house so the detective can find it there and put him in prison, or you can seduce a married woman and make her cheat on her husband, so she either dumps him or she discovers and tries to kill you both, things like that.\n\nSo things that can be actively done by the player are easy to think and design, like combat, mining, crafting, selling, talking etc... but how would roleplaying as a merchant or someone that sell services work? staying at one place and waiting for a npc to come to you to buy your things would probably be very boring, if you are like a mercenary, what would you do if no one needs you for a long time?  \nI thought about maybe just you putting items on a showcase and npcs take them and pay, but that would break the immersion since by logic they could just take the items away and not pay, maybe you could hire someone to do the job of staying there and sell things, but that defeats the porpuse of you ""being able to do anything"""
okbrx4,Dishonored style stealth assassin game with the freerunning movement of Mirror's Edge,"\nI think one of the unappealing aspects of the stealth genre to the mass audience is the player movement. In most stealth games, the player character controls slow, sluggish, and restrictive. The sneaking involves constant waiting and patience, with the player approaching deliberately to the guard's behind, or staying in the corners until the alert is gone. For the experienced players, this is the enjoyment. For the casual audience, this is a bore.\n\nI believe the early Assassin's Creed games had the potentials to remedy this old genre quirk and explore the new type of stealth, but the goal of the series was hindered by many other conventional video game elements, like the dull tailing missions that force the player to walk around someone for five minutes, the crowd stealth, combat so easy that the player can kill everyone in the surrounding area, and a lot of hiding. They block the pure joy of the acrobatic stealth. Dishonored aimed to be the ""fast Thief"" but it still followed the old stealth genre conventions. Both games require little skill to execute parkour moves since the platforming gameplay is mostly automated. \n\nBecause of this, a stealth assassin game with the player movement and the level design of Mirror's Edge can work. Mirror's Edge games have the most immersive, elaborate, and rewarding platforming gameplay, but the rest of the gameplay outside of this core control movest has been weak. The first game was a highly scripted, railroaded A to B experience hindered by the narrative, QTEs, and the restrictive level design. Catalyst was the full openworld filled with unnecessary RPG elements that seemed as if only there because the developers were concerned with what focus-tested well.\n\nImagine the first-person freerunning platforming game, in which the player does not need to hide but has to move constantly. The player's footsteps do not make noise, which encourages the player to always run even when the guards are nearby. You get wide, vertical, interconnected levels where the target is, just like the player, is a runner, who is surrounded with guards and other various obstacles. The player has the knife, which means the player has to get very close to the target to assassinate, but there will be no combat system against the guards. Some guards are the gun-wielding types who are slow and generally stationary. Some are the runners with melee weapons just like the player. During the undetected state, the player can perform takedowns through kicks and jumps without these moves being locked-on animations that take seconds. When detected, the player can shake away the alert mode by outrunning them or has to chase after the target. It focuses on the simple gameplay of the fast, liberating platforming working together with the light stealth gameplay, which can create an emergent experience."

ok78ip,Dieselpunk-tech Fantasy Noir setting with Fire Emblem/XCOM tactical RPG combat and Yakuza closed open-world/hubworld.,"This is a bit of a crazy idea, so bare with me.\n\n**Premise**\n\n\-Set in a [Standard Fantasy Setting](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting) that's undergone a technological revolution and advanced from a late Middle Ages tech level to a 1920s-like technological revolution, with a lot of blending in between. Knights, cavalry and mages exist alongside tanks, automobiles and machinery, and all of it ties to the blood of the planet, Seithirium, the root of all magic and noted for a glowing blue hue.\n\n**Lore &amp; Story**\n\n\-All humanoid races (races derived from humans) consist of humans, elves, dwarves and orcs, and all are genetic offshoots of humanity due to Seithirium mutation and evolution. There exists three races of beastmen (one lynx folk race, one barn owl folk race, and one harp seal folk race) as well.\n\n\-Magic is largely feared and oppressed in society, and a secret organization within the equivalent of the Catholic Church is basically Knights Templar Meets SCP Foundation, and is tasked with protecting the world from ""aberrations,"" supernatural beings who spawn from the collective unconsciousness and its darkest fears. As a side note, mages are routinely enslaved in many cultures, and are the common scapegoat for any supernatural horrors.\n\n\-Setting mission statement is to burn the fantasy warehouse down, subverting and playing with a variety of tropes while exploring the logical conclusion of a medieval society rapidly evolving into a modern one. The setting uses the fantasy world as a baseline for a variety of inspiration from pulp and era-appropriate fiction, with the threat of world wars, smuggling and lost ruins aplenty. Neon-laden taverns and primitive casinos exist in a contrast of medieval buildings with modern trappings, all kings remain in absolute power with radical talk of communism, fascism, socialism and democracy in whispers amid a rapidly changing time period. Instead of focusing on typical fantasy quests, story takes place exclusively within a rapidly changing metropolis city in Not!Denmark called Helsingor that is home to many different criminal gangs and a strong noir vibe.\n\n\-Central theme is the omnipresent nature of change; changing times, old ways becoming invalidated, and the gradual transition from the innocence of an unlearned world to that of a learned one. However, that isn't to say that hatred doesn't ultimately cause as many problems if not more than turbulence. Much of the conflict is likewise driven by ideologies who can (and in some instances, do) destroy more than they create due to hatred, and how the only way to truly push forward a better, enlightened world is to respond with compassion, wisdom and empathy. Despite how grim the world generally can be, the tone on the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism) is thoroughly optimistic in general instance as the times are truly changing for the better, and how love can be the most powerful force of all, regardless of the particular instances (platonic love, romantic love, sibling love, mad love), and how it overcoming hatred is of the utmost importance.\n\n\-Game features an ensemble cast with a customizable Avatar (read: the newer Fire Emblem games' Avatar) at the helm who is customizable in species, gender and class akin to a BioWare game, and they can form a relationship with one of 22 of your fellow major party members. They also start the game by making a pact with a greater aberration to gain full control of time in exchange for acting as a ""warden"" of time, to keep the timeline on it's better course. Implications this has are listed below in gameplay.\n\n\-Biggest inspirations story-wise is Eberron, Valkyria Chronicles, Baccano!, Empire of Sin (except, y'know, actually *good)*, Fire Emblem: Three Houses and just about every crime noir film of the 1940s.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n\-Gameplay is largely best summarized as a triad fusion of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, XCOM and Yakuza 0. Combat proceeds in a diagonal square-based system with options for melee and range akin to Fire Emblem: Three Houses and ranged weapon distance, overwatch system and general difficulty of XCOM. Outside of combat (which you only engage in by going on Missions; generally speaking, each playthrough can be completely different from another based on the order you do things), there is a Yakuza-like small open-world hubworld with a variety of different minigames and activities to partake in (pool, gambling (poker, blackjack, slots, roulette, baccarat), boxing fight clubs, item delivery, batting cages (as era appropriate as it'd can be, of course), go-kart racing akin to Mario Kart, mini-golf, etc...). Obviously, I intend to focus on making sure the main meat (the tactical combat and the hubworld to restock on weapons and items) is immaculate, afterwards I'd direct focus to the minigames to prevent distraction.\n\n\-Game has some form of permadeath in it, on two levels; the 22 main characters you have are ""Hero Units,"" who cannot die on the battlefield normally, and a variety of different grunts that you can customize and develop freely (as Hero Units are fixed) called Grunt Units, who can die on the field. Hero Units can die at one of five points in the story; during each of the five Acts, there's a massive mission where you have to assign roles to Hero Units akin to ME2's suicide mission, and them being put in a role they're not optimal in will result in their death (and to prevent frustration, you can retry at any time in all modes but ironman, and you are given a spreadsheet for what they're best at). Them dying massively influences the overall plot and the others' reaction to their deaths.\n\n\-You can build relationships between yourself and the characters or between the characters in a Support-like mechanic. Anyone can support with anyone, but only Hero Unit/Hero Unit supports have unique dialogue, and Hero Unit/Grunt Unit or Grunt/Grunt supports have a generic line and allows the player to imagine the details of their personality. This socialization element has some dating sim elements, but can only be done on the hub world and can be freely ignored otherwise. Each support has five ranks, Rank E to Rank A, though in rare circumstances that the group is romantically or platonically pairable, you can go for a Rank A+, which gives them a unique ending in the epilogue.\n\n\-New weapons, armor and spells are developed based on progress and ""investments"" (the game's research mechanic, which has a short day-by-day cooldown based on how big the investment is). There's also some small strategy elements where you can help get protection rackets from local businesses to get regular income between (and outside of) battles, so you can expand your local empire in ways to benefit yourself.\n\n\-Finally, the game lets you have the ability to rewind in time to redo events or plays that don't work out well; the game's difficulty doesn't start with a high number of these rewinds (a la Mila's Turntable), but investments can increase the number of resets you have to help complete your game.\n\n\-The game also, outside of supports, which are largely fixed, has a pretty random element that ensures massive replayability; different types of sidequests can manifest as well as unique missions and events, as well as randomly-generated missions outside of story missions.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA noir-ish ""Diesel Fantasy"" tactical RPG with social elements and a fusion of Yakuza, XCOM and Fire Emblem: Three Houses."

ok6m36,Unique 3D styles that are easy to make," I am currently planning out the creation of an open world 3D platformer collectathon with an emphasis on movement and exploration. I tried making a character model, before realizing how difficult that actually is. I thought about going low-poly, but I then realized that the “low poly” look is extremeley overused on the indie game front. I then thought about a blocky/Minecraft styled look, with more normal maps, but I then realized that people might think that I copied Minecraft. Finally, I thought about a yoshi’s crafted world/sackboy/paper mario origami king style, but I then realized that would be difficult to model.\n\nCan you suggest any unique and beautiful styles that a single person like me can realistically do?"

ok3f8w,Series of RPGs set in Isaac Asimov's Robot/Empire/Foundation Universe,"Been reading through Asimov's books and keep thinking how cool a series of games could be in this universe. \n\nIt could start with a sort of a detective game based on Caves of Steel / Naked sun / Robots of dawn where you play as Elijah Baley or even just an entirely new character set in that universe. I think the subterranean cities and the mystique of the outer worlds lend themselves to a lot of creative liberties for game designers. \n\nNext could be about imperial conquest and the rise of the galactic empire, you could play as a rebel or general in armada. \n\nLast would be in the foundation universe, less open world but more linear missions where you play as the main characters in that era. \n\nI think it would be cool. I've never seen a good adaptation (outside of I, Robot or Bicentennial Man) of this extended Universe. I know Apple TV is doing a Foundation series (which I have strong doubts about) but I think it would be sick as a video game series."

Your land is where you start the game building and gaining new land by challenging other players for their land. This game is set around a “world timer” everybody in the server will move at the same time the timer and run from 5-6 minutes. During that time you can choose to build on your land or send your units out to get more land.\n\nBuildings in this game can help train troops to make them stronger or to help you gain resources for your land. If you wish to do so you can also make allies and friends to trade with.\n\nClasses in this game are unique because it will change your heroes, lords, and unites. The classes are pretty much different races with special attributes based on which class you pick\n\nClasses:\n\nHuman - standard class no attributes but no disaadvantes either\n\nElves - Magical based class and less tanky class\n\nDwarves - Tanky small class but slower than other classes.\n\nDemihuman - Jack of all trades class you could get heroes and lord with good stuff or bad.\n\nTrolls - Strength based class but your heroes can rampage when angry.\n\nDemons - Magical and strength based but bad during the day\n\nAngels - Magical and speed based but weaker at night\n\nMerfolk - Magical based and way better in water very weak on land\n\nUndead - Strong during the night but weak during the day\n\nSpirits - Cant be attacked by pure strength has to be attacked with some kind of magic but slow.\n\nAll of these classes have their own kind of looking town with different heroes, lords, and units and different buildings that can be made."

THE MAP WOULD BE A NEAR-ACCURATE RECREATION OF NEW YORK IN THE DECADE YOU PICK TO PLAY IN. EACH FAMILY WILL BE EXTENSIVELY BIG AND METICULOUSLY DENSE. ACCURATE TO THE REAL FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE, THINK OF THIS GAME AS GTA BUT THE MAFIA VERSION, THIS GAME WILL BE PURELY CHOICE BASED AND HAS LITTLE GUIDED DIRECTION, IT WOULD BE PURELY HOW YOU WANT TO PLAY AND YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES BUT YOUR CHOICES HAVE REPERCUSSIONS)\n\nTHIS IDEA IS HEAVILY HEAVILY DETAILED AND I SPENT WEEKS PLANNING IT OUT. FEEL FREE TO COMMENT IDEAS AND DISCUSS THE GAME I WILL BE ACTIVE WITH REPLIES. IF ANY DEVS SEE THIS AND ARE INTERESTED THEN I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT.....ENJOY\n\n\nMy game idea is an open world game based on the 5 families of New York. The game will be historically accurate and you can pick a decade to play in. 60,s,70s or 80s.(these 3 decades where huge decades in the mob where we saw the rise of gangsters like Gotti, Castellano, Gaspipe and Demeo etc.) Now if we wouldn't be able to get all the actual real gangsters in game there is always mods to help.\n\nSo you pick which era you wish to play in and can also pick one of the bosses to play as or start as an associate trying to get made into a family. In the game if you start as a boss then you just deal with controlling your family, commission meetings and sit downs, ordering hits, finding ways to get money, choosing to have guys made or even rewriting history and declaring war on another family. \n\nNow if you wanted to go the more complex route and start as an associate, you get to create your Gangster and you pick what borough you live in and give him and choose a backstory etc. \nYour backstory decides your start and chance of being made. So if im your backstory you choose to have a family member in the mob it will heavily increase your chance of being made. If you choose to go the harder route, you start as a guy with no mob connections and try to work your way up.\nIf choose to start as a guy with no mob connections, then its up to you to how you want to go about making connections you could do the following things:\n\n1.You could start hanging around in mob owned bars or social clubs. (There will be a rating meter in the game with every character you encounter,its down to your actions whether they like you or not,BEWARE make the wrong move and Be killed then its game over).\n\n2.Become a killer to make a name for yourself in the neighbourhood, but beware as if the police arrest you and you are found guilty you get sentenced to life and its game over.\n\n3.Find a way to make alot of money and become a ""good earner"". This can be by being a loanshark, drug dealer, car thief etc. Or even scams such as getting money from big corporations. Choosing to go this route will take time and effort as you have to make it work and earn the money, not all scams will be successful.\n\n4. Get buddy with a made gangster and try to get close to him in attempts to get made.\n\n\n(If you have anymore ideas on ways you could go about getting made, feel free to comment below)\n\n\nOnce you have successfully made it into becoming an associate of one of the 5 families. You will have many tasks to complete and things to do to become made.\nThese tasks will include maintaining your reputation, bringing in money and putting in work.\n\nAfter some time of grinding as an associate( This will take time but this game is not a game intended to be a quick 100 hours and done. This game would be a simulation RPG that is intended to be played for hundreds if not thousands of hours, as each level your at in the game would be majorly detailed and anything could happen which would add the to role play such as you get locked up, the money you earn from a certain scheme declines or comes to a stop via either bad luck or bad business management. This game would have real world factors throughout, so if you have a stake in a certain business that is involved with the stock market and there was a stock market crash,you would begin to lose money etc. ( we will go into real world factors in a bit).\n\n\nAfter building up trust with certain made gangsters, you will at some point be proposed for membership into a family(the timescale of this will vary in each save you have as it all depends on the induavidual character and their own success as a criminal,also its not promised you will ever get made, it all depends on the particular character and their success)once proposed you will be called to a meeting and under go the ceremony where you are officially inducted into the particular crime family. \n\nIn this ceremony there will be a cut scene where you go through the procedures of being made,finger being pricked...saint burning in your hand etc. \nYou will also be told the rules and regulations of being in the mob and that you must swear to Omerta and failure to do so results in death(once you die the game ends and you can either restart or start a new save)\nYou will also be informed of your privileges as a made man such as noone can put a hand on you without consent etc.\n\nOnce you are inducted into the family your respect level will increase and you will be able to reap the benefits of a made man which include getting free meals in restaurants and bars, people in the neighbourhood going out of their way to please you, getting respect from everyone yada yada.\n\nThe purpose of this game is about ambitions and trying to achieve your goals. It is up to you as the player as to what goals you have and what you want to do. \nYou can be the overly ambitious mobster who wants to go straight to the top and become the family boss. Doing so will take time and alot of effort. You will have to do things to improve relationships with other made guys in the family. Or you can go the bloody high risk route of trying to create an inner family war and take your position in blood. Choosing this way will have little success rate and other families won't respect you and depending on who your families boss has good connections with, other families will also try to have you whacked. So the safer option to becoming the boss is to grind and grind. Make money, improve relationships, put in work,make good decisions and increase your respect. You will work your way up from soldier to captain to underboss and then finally to boss. !NOTE!\nWorking your way up in the family will take hundreds of hours but this game is about realism and living the full life cycle of a gangster. Finally becoming boss will be a rewarding thing and something that once achieved is satisfying. \nAs you go up in the family ranks you start to have more and more responsibilities such as running your crew, performing well in sit downs and making money and so-forth\n\nChoices in this game would be HUGE. Every action means something and has an effect one way or another. You kill a guy and don't completely get rid of evidence the cops will come sniffing around. If the guy has connections, expect a retaliation. If you move into another guys territory with your business of choice, expect confrontation and to be challenged.  I think you see where I'm going with this.\n\n\nEvery character in the game will have their own personality,traits and reputation etc. Every character will have their own agenda and goals. Below i will go into what each entail.\n\n\nPERSONALITY: Personality will be a huge part of the game, every induavidual character will have their own personality and agendas. Some characters personalities will be tough, hard nosed,stubborn and greedy making them hard to do business with whereas others will be more easy going and soft. This is just a brief summary of personality as the personalities in game would be very complex and detailed.\n\nTRAITS: Each character will have traits. Traits along with personality will affect the outcome of your dealings with the induavidual. The traits seen will be things like:\n-HOT HEADED\n-GREEDY\n-ARROGANT\n-HOMICIDAL \n-GOOD EARNER\n-PERSONABLE\n-BIGOT\n-GOD FEARING\n-PAITENT\nand so on. There would be tons of traits in this game and each character would have a certain amount of their own to make up their character. Each trait has an effect on how the character acts. \n\n\nREPUTATION: Reputations will vary from manical, morose, sadistic heartless feared killer to not very respected pushover. Reputations would have a huge impact on this game as it has influence on how in game characters interact with eachother. If you piss of a guy who has a reputation for violence, expect a surprise attack at any time(we will go into gameplay in a bit).\nOr if you come across a guy who isn't respected and seen as a pushover you could step on his toes and get money from him via extortion etc. \nJust like personality and traits, every in game character will have a reputation and the reputation system will be dense and detailed. \n\n\nIN GAME WORLD AND REAL WORLD FACTORS:\n\nIn this game the world which would be New York would be bustling and thorough. Every neighbourhood would have its own ambience and vibe. The Npcs depending on where you go in the city will change. Go to Bensonhurst,Brookyln expect hostile npcs, go to New York, New York expect friendly and outgoing npcs.\nMy aim for this in game world would be a vibrant one.\nNpcs would go about their day and live their own lifestyles. They will go to their jobs in the day the city would be alive. As the day comes to an end, you would be able to see People going home from work and the streets gradually emptying(depending on where you are, go to manhattan at night and see the streets well alive)\nThe game would have a lively world with events happening daily. Criminals will roam the streets and go about their days to achieve their goals. This wouldn't be a game where if you do nothing then life stops. No, you will need to stay active in the life and stay ahead of your competition. Sure in the game you would be able to live a lifestyle where you could go to bars, party, meet woman, hang out with friends, go shopping,buy real estate, take drugs and just go do ordinary things. \nBut beware,Live too much of the high life and get lazy on your hustle then expect to fall behind your competition. Also live the high life too much you may get sloppy and make mistakes which could draw attention from the police. \nEVERY ACTION WILL HAVE A REACTION.\n\n\nThis game would be about roaming the open world and living a lifestyle as much as it would be about your criminal hustle. \n\nThe way the game would play is that you will be doing whatever your doing in this open world game and then out of nowhere something could happen like other gangsters try to kill you(this will not be a cut scene, but in the gameplay). Your friends could set you up and invite you to a place where you could be whacked, so you constantly have to be on your toes and be aware of your decisions. Another example of a real world factor would be that whilst the game is ongoing and your going through your characters life cycle, people may inform on you and have you arrested, so you will have to be careful and watch cars there are following you,you would be able to get your car checked for bugs and watch out for wiretaps. Police in this game, just like people coming to kill you, could roll up at any time. You could be out on a date with your in game girlfriend or hanging out at a social club and police could come and arrest you,so you will have to be conscious of your surroundings at all times. Im open to discussing more ideas for real world factors but im not going to go into any more yet.\n\nMy hope for this game would be to really get the feel of what it is like to be a gangster in the American mob.\nI picked the eras of 60s 70s and 80s as these were better days for the mob and they were at the peak of their powers. \nIn this game I want to get across the feel that you could be wiped out at any time, once your killed, the game ends. You could also be arrested at any time and unless you are sentenced to life, the game will simulate your sentence and you can go to the timeline menu to see what is going on on the outside such as whose been killed, whose been made, whose been arrested, who turned informant, who is boss etc.\nOnce your sentence is up your character will have aged to whatever age they are when released. !NOTE! Keeping your mouth shut and riding out a long bid will increase your characters respect MASSIVELY!\nOn the flip side you could choose to become an informant for the feds and give information in exchange for your freedom. Each time you are an informant will differ,depending on what is going on in game. HOWEVER if you are found out to be a snitch expected to be murdered!\n\n\nI've spent hours and hours writing this up and I have sooo many more ideas for this game that I would be more than happy to share. I have pages of notes for this game but for now im just going to end it here. I hope you all enjoy."
ojsgfq,Mission-Based Martial Arts Game,"In this game, you play as a student in a hidden school that indoctrinates people into a martial art that grants its users superhuman capabilities and supernatural abilities. The MC came from a destitute family that sold them at a tender age for a small fortune. At the school, he and other students endured agonizing daily training to condition them for lethal combat.\n\nThe game is primarily a 3D open exploration hack and slash where you have various abilities such as a combo-based quick attack, a guard breaking heavy attack, a limited damage-neutralizing defense, a deflection that sets up opponents for lethal critical attacks, a projectile attack with a first-person aiming mode that deals multiplied damage for striking a target's weak points, A few high-damaging attacks with special modifiers or techs, and some basic to advanced parkour and stealth abilities. As you progress, defeat enemies, and obtain collectables, you'll upgrade your base stats, unlock advanced variations of your techs, and augment your basic abilities. You'll choose your scenarios from a list in a main menu where you can either progress normally through mildly open levels or explore for optional bonuses and collectables, including branching bonus scenarios.\n\nThe first half of the game is when you graduate to practical training, where you'll be sent to kill malevolent supernatural entities spawned from corrupted chi due to the fact that the school was built in an area that's a chi hotspot. However, in one of the latter missions of the first half, you eavesdrop on your instructors and discover the graduating students are sold to big name figures in the global underworld as slave assassins, and a power-hungry warlord is paying top dollar for you, the best student the school has ever seen.\n\nEventually, you begin slaughtering the instructors, who then begin sticking your fellow students on you for the false promise of freedom. After killing all the friends you've ever known, you come across the school's grand master, who attempts to kill you using the school's secret technique. Though wounded, you've memorized the technique and adapted it as your ultimate attack, using it to kill the master who hails you as the greatest practitioner in the history of their martial art with their final breath.\n\nIn the second half, you're forced to travel all over the world in an attempt to escape would-be assassins. Apparently destroying the school left a massive power vacuum in the martial arts underworld and practitioners of the other one hundred seven supernatural martial arts attempt to track you down and kill you to enhance their own reputations.\n\nIn the final part of the game, you and the others discovered that all the bad chi given off by the constant life-or-death fighting corrupted the world's chi on a massive scale and created a horde of entities that have already decimated a third of human civilization. You and your adversaries call a truce and go around forming an alliance with the other schools to combat and defeat the new menace, which also unlocks other playable characters with their own techs and variants of the MCs primary abilities for use in a free play mode that enables you to access areas that were previously unreachable."

ojohbd,"Survive, build, and expand your underground community while fighting AI takeover (Rust/Ark but as a 2D platformer)","Rust/ARK but as a 2D platformer\n\nOpen world 2D/2.5D pixel platformer survival game (think terraria).\nThe “Mother Core '' is located in a ship in space, orbiting the earth. She is an AI, no longer able to be controlled by mankind. She has one goal, complete and total  control over the world. but humans are resilient, and have made an impenetrable shelter deep underground.  Whether or not Mother and her minions will be hostile depends on your cooperation, or interference, with her plans.\n     Players can teleport to her ship through the Communication Hub on earth. Protective fields prevent players from using any items while inside. Inside the spaceship, the player's mind is transferred into a controllable worker bot, unable to attack but equipped with advanced tools they can use to build more advanced technology and robots, as well as collect and process unique materials. Merging with the Mother Core will give you access to her facilities; infinite food and resources, however failure to follow the Mother Core’s strict set of guidelines will result in punishment by death or a permanent ban from her ship. Returning to life as a human is difficult, if not impossible. You will easily be identified as a traitor by the tattoo on your forehead, given by Mother as punishment for disobedience. \n Humans living in the compound  will be able to choose between a number of ‘jobs’. Having a job will enable you to purchase things such as a home to protect your player or specialized weapons or tools.There are many ways to get a role.  Players can be voted in or out of certain jobs or given a role by another player. Some jobs can only be accessed through certain structures, which need to be built first. Some tasks require bureaucracy; having a criminal record scanned by the registration worker, or being required to have a bank account. Resources are shared between members of a faction, factions can be changed, allowing a player to attack members of other factions. Players can also become a criminal, stealing resources and property or stealthily taking from other members of a faction. However, being caught will result in a trial or  even death, you could be banished from the faction, or sent to jail by the sheriff. When it comes to the human world, the rules are made by the players. When killed, the player will respawn with a completely random ID in the living chambers, their previous identity a secret ( i realize there is a flaw here to be worked out where players could spawnkill a player if the server has a small amount of players)  Having a large server of players means complex rules, communities and dynamics. \n\n(please keep in mind i have never played rust or ARK survival, i just know that some key mechanics are similar)\n(also inspired by a mod i used to play on Gmod)"
ojhs2x,"An open-world magic game where you run a magic shop and have to collect resources, fight enemies, and learn recipes in order to create magical items to sell.","I'm imagining this as a 2D pixel art game in the same vein as Stardew Valley. After researching lots of games that involve running a magic shop, I haven't found one that includes the perfect blend of gameplay I would enjoy most. Here's my list of mechanics I would really like to see in a game like this:\n\n* Patrons of the shop can bring the player leads to locations of rumored magical resources. The player can also do their own research by reading books and fragments of scrolls they find.\n* The social aspect of the game should be a primary focus, just like Stardew. Patrons are fleshed out and have their own lives and stories.\n* The player must create every item that gets sold in the shop. At the beginning they do so manually, but there should be machines that allow complex materials to be farmed.\n* Every potion has its own recipe that can be learned, but the player can also choose to experiment, sometimes resulting in drastic consequences. Unknown potions can be tested on yourself, a willing volunteer, or sold to a random stranger who may come back and complain, or end up with incredible powers.\n* While the player is out adventuring, there's an NPC that runs the shop's day-to-day operations. They can make basic potions, enchant items with simple effects, and earn passive income for the player. This NPC can potentially get better over time if you train them.\n* Some resources can only be gathered by killing monsters, so the combat must be satisfying. Obviously the player will have access to many spells, so there could be a mechanic where you must curate your spellbook to find the perfect synergies.\n* There could be a skill tree for each type of magical discipline such as Alchemy, Enchanting, Scribing (scroll-writing), Brewing, Herbology, etc. There could even be paths such as Smithing or Tailoring.\n* Patrons can ask the player to perform tasks for them such as disenchanting cursed objects, creating very specific magic items, and curing them of ailments.\n* As the game progresses, the player gets more powerful and can upgrade their shop into larger structures with more rooms for various tasks, eventually resulting in a mage's tower with portals to various locations they have been to.\n\nI apologize for my long post, dear redditors. I'm full of ideas for a game like this, so I'm just spitballing in hopes someone will find inspiration here. If there's a dev team out there with the ability to make a game like this, I hope I've given you some good ideas to start with!"
ojfv8u,Horror game idea with criminals and superheroes,So basically i think an interesting concept to explore could be a horror game where the player is a criminal who robs banks and the idea is that the superhero uses fear and tension to defeat the criminals.\n\nI am not sure how easy it is to properly combine horror with a crime game but i think it could be great if pulled of well.\n\nYou could also make some other criminals induce fear too like the boss of a gang or something

ojd7rz,Unique 3D styles that are easy to make,"I am currently planning out the creation of an open world 3D platformer collectathon with an emphasis on movement and exploration. I tried making a character model, before realizing how difficult that actually is. I thought about going low-poly, but I then realized that the “low poly” look is extremeley overused on the indie game front. I then thought about a blocky/Minecraft styled look, with more normal maps, but I then realized that people might think that I copied Minecraft. Finally, I thought about a yoshi’s crafted world/sackboy/paper mario origami king style, but I then realized that would be difficult to model. \n\nCan you suggest any unique and beautiful styles that a single person like me can realistically do?"
orfzjt,Horror themed open-world RPG in a victorian-like setting (not survival horror),"I'm getting into game dev and an working on fleshing out this idea of an open world rpg with supernatural horror elements: demons of various types, possessed people, wendigo, skin walkers, witches...  I'm not sure what else, but I'm going for a consistent feel. Different origins is fine (Native American, Germanic, Norse, etc.). \n\nI'm not entirely sure of the gameplay loop though.  Since they are supernatural, I want there to be something more than physical fighting, but not magic since it won't be fantasy.  There could be exorcism/banishment type actions after wearing down a creature in a fight.  Maybe like the Constantine movie.  I'm also thinking of the movies, Van Helsing, Brothers Grimm, and similar, and the show Supernatural for ideas on how and what to fight.  \n\nThoughts?"

or3ybt,Frontier Engine: A Post Apocalyptic Steampunk Vessel Command Game,"Hi guys, this is my first post on the sub, and I just thought of a really cool premise for a game and wanted to share it, let me know what you think!\n\n**Premise:**\n\nIn an alternate history, circa 1800s (Victorian era steampunk) . A natural disaster has caused the global death of vegetation, resulting in mass desertification of around 80% the land mass. Massive sandstorms of deadly speeds roam freely across the endless dunes; covering up the last remnants of a forgotten civilization. The survivors are forced to live underground, where they built settlements to facilitate the continuation of humanity while they wait out this natural phenomenon. However long that may take...\n\nThe surface is no longer habitable, nor traversable. However, humanity has mastered steam power, and created a myriad coal fueled legged mechs to traverse the harsh terrain above. These hulking behemoths are the only things you can see in the distant landscape and are responsible for scavenging, trading between settlements, colony relocation and of course, ""conflict resolution"". \n\n**Objective**\n\nYour settlement has lost contact with the rest of the world for years now, and the coal resources are quickly depleting. You are in command of a dreadnought class steam engine about the size of a 7 story building, it was originally designed as a scout, but has been refitted for combat purposes, and modified to accommodate for future upgrades. You are tasked with the mission to form a crew and venture out into the unknown in hopes of reconnecting with the lost world and convince them to save your colony.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nYou must manage your crew and the resources on board to keep the steam engine functional as it journeys towards a destination of your choosing. Some preliminary systems include but are not limited to:\n\n* steam core to power the entire engine\n* greenhouse to enable food production\n* armory and artillery stations\n* crew and captain's quarters\n* Tesla style oscillator for electricity generation\n* Vents for cooling\n\n(And more to come! Ideas are welcome!)  \n\nYou will likely run into random events (i.e survivors, extreme weather, ruins etc) But the main attraction is other steam engines. Some could be friendly and allow trade, some could friendly until provoked, some could attack without warning. Combat would be conducted over long distances with all sorts of steam punk artillery. FTL is a good baseline for what it might look like. The game should try to be as atmospheric and immersive as possible.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nWell this is all I have for now, there are probably a ton more ideas I can add, but I think just the premise is good enough for a starting point. Let me know what you think! If nothing else it was fun to write this and theory craft in my head. This concept was heavily inspired by games I played like F.T.L, frostpunk, silent hunter, rimworld etc."

oqy1yy,GrappleMania: Oops All Grapplers,"I have an idea for a fighting game where every character is a different type of grappler.

I think it'll be cool if it's set up like a wrestling game with environmental attacks and the ability to drag people to certain parts of the background but its supposed to be played like a 2d fighter or a 2.5d  fighter with a line system like Fatal Fury. \n\nGrapplers are hated in fighting games but if everyone is a grappler then can you really hate them? So I'm pitching oops all grapplers with all the rope bouncing high flying action of your favorite Grapplers."
oqwvsq,A Reseting MMORPG with Permanence,"I am not sure if this is a good idea, but here it goes.   \n\n\n# Overview\n\n  \nMMORPG, but actual specifics of the gameplay are not important to the idea. It can be WoW-like or a shooter, whatever. The important bit is the game structure. It is built on a two week cycle, with 4 zones that should take 3 days to complete (expanding as necessary, and balancing as it goes on.) Each zone requires every player to work together to win. Defeating world bosses, completing goals, and so on. But once something is done, it's done. No respawning bosses or doing quests that you missed out on. This means that any specific rewards for these cannot be mechanically superior to others, or there would be a riot.\n\n# Boss Structure\n\nThe game is based around killing world-bosses (Think gods and massive dragons). Each world boss will take a full day, maybe two, to defeat working together. But to get to the world boss, players need to defeat Mini-bosses and Encounters. A mini-boss is a big-ol-monster that needs to be defeated. This is done by fighting it directly (Slow, but important to distract it), doing side activities (Like building a bomb to launch at it or recruiting a friendly NPC.), and cutting off resources to it to prevent healing (Depends on the bosses theme, a robot thing might need mechanics to run at it which can be killed). There should be enough variation to prevent players from grinding the same thing over and over. A bit of clever design should be enough. Defeating a boss pushes the player-controlled area deeper into the zone.\n\nEncounters are like mini-bosses, but with several enemies or a small army that needs to be defeated instead.\n\n# Timing\n\nThe game will need a very strict time-gating mechanic. The zones need to be balanced so they each take a few days, but also that it doesn't feel like players are waiting around for stuff to happen. To solve this, I think the bosses and the like should be sectioned off. Massive amounts of HP require players to do side activities to damage them as well as just straight-up fighting them. After ""defeating"" a boss or other encounter, then wait an hour for it to recover off-screen, then fight the next phase. Each miniboss or encounter should take about 12 hours. With 15 minibosses (or encounters), I think this should be enough. Have three on the field at once, that would be 2.5 days to defeat them with 12 hours dedicated to wiggle room and fighting the world boss. With 4 zones, this is only 12 days, but those extra 2 days give more time to defeat the bosses.\n\n# Player Types\n\nPlayers are split into three types, scouts, support, and soldiers. This is not an explicit choice. You do not click a button that tells you which one, rather the types are based on how you play the game. Scouts go around the dangerous zones, collecting resources and fighting smaller things. Soldiers fight in large battles, killing enemies and world bosses. Support stays in the peaceful zones to craft, do casual content, and the like. The game will be balanced to require all three to defeat a zone. For example, to defeat a boss soldiers might need new weapons crafted by the supports. These swords might need special material gathered by scouts. Soldiers might have to defeat a world boss to open up an area for scouts to explore, and so on. \n\n# Rewards\n\nPlayers are rewarded for each mini-boss, world boss, encounter, and other activity they take part in. They will be given a resource that can increase their power. XP for leveling and gaining new abilities. Money for upgrading gear and buying consumables. Cosmetics that stay with the player (Low drop rate). And a meta-resource that carries between game resets. This meta-resource is used in conjunction with an achievement system to purchase new content. New classes, new class ability options, new crafting recipes, abilities to move more quickly, and the best cosmetics. For example, to unlock a ninja class, maybe you have to defeat a certain boss and spend X meta-currency. \n\n# Servers\n\nIf multiple servers are affordable, then they will be offset. So players of different schedules and timezones can experience the same experience.\n\n# Replayability\n\nOne question you might have is why would you replay it if the game just resets? Well, to encourage this, the minibosses will be different/varried slightly on each reset. Different orders of when they come, different placements and different goals for them. After a few months, most players would have seen everything, but they can continue to play to grind the more difficult to obtain meta-rewards. These rewards should be balanced to basic stuff, so as not to overshadow new players immediately.\n\n# Expandability\n\nIf the game is successful, it can receive constant updates to add new bosses, events, and encounters. More zones might be added as player count increases, different end-game bosses, and so on. A private server system with easier monsters can be set up as well for friends who don't want to wait on the rest of the world. \n\n# Monetization\n\nLet's be real, this game will be expensive. So it will need a solid monetization strategy. A subscription is a great model, but it requires a lot of trust, which the game will not have at the start. baring that, it's hard to monetize a game without being sketchy.  \n\n\nMy idea is an initial low-cost, of 15 bucks or so. A solid cosmetic shop with frequent sales. And a subscription that allows for premium cosmetics. Such as emotes, dancing, and the like. The sub also allows the player to open golden chests which provide cosmetics that you would find in the shops, meta-currency, and the like."
oqwc1d,"Paintball FPS where you shooting things, freeze them in place, and Paint them with assorted colors","This is pretty a Note to Self for this idea that just popped in my head. A game world of mismatched art style, theme, and characters. Everything is your enemy, but you can shoot them with splash gun, freeze them, switch to various colors, and paint them. More mechanics are need and I don't know where this going. So ill update this post as new ideas come. I had to write it down before I forget."
oqqf71,Ball and Labyrinth game for blind people,"If you've seen those [ball in labyrinth maze games](https://www.amazon.ca/John-N-Hansen-Wood-Labyrinth/dp/B000BNQFQ4/ref=pd_day0_2/145-7837756-5532168) where you try to get the ball from one end of the maze to the other by tilting the board\n\nThe idea is to scale up the maze and have higher walls, and your character has to get through the maze without getting squished by these massive rolling boulders.  There are several of them rolling around the maze in learnable patterns but you have to do it with your ears only as it's an audio-only game.  Rolling boulders make a sound, the louder, the closer the boulder, but they're muffled by walls, so you can hear them banging against walls around you, and in so doing you're supposed to learn the terrain, determine the boulder patterns, and navigate around them to the finish point\n\nThis idea was partially inspired by one submitted here yesterday about gravity being determined by player's head direction ([thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/opwp93/arena_fps_where_gravity_shifts_to_where_you_look/))"

oqokv8,Game about managing post-soviet easter european states.,"Ok so hear me out gamers, I have an idea for a game where you have to run an eastern european state from 1989/1990/1991/1992 (depends on the state) up until the present day (or make it endless i don't care) \n\nYou'll have to bring economic reform to bring western investment. Deal with corruption, modernize infrastructure, restore old cities and landmarks to create a tourism industry. Fix the outdated health care and education systems. Deal with scandals, riots, civil unrest, ***Russia*** and avoid becoming the next Yugoslavia. \n\nAppearance wise I'd probably be similar to something like Rebel Inc. and Plague Inc. or a paradox map game.\n\nYou can have multiple difficulties and quirks based on countries. East Germany: tutorial. Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, The baltic states, Hungary: Easy. Romania, Bulgaria: Normal. Russia Hard (not very hard because you can't get bullied by Russia if you are Russia. Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus: Very Hard. Yugoslavia: F@ck you difficulty \n\nThanks for reading this (you weirdo) and please don't crucify me this is my first post here"
oqnxa1,GTA/zombies/escape from NY,"Remember in old GTA games you could enter codes to change the game a bit? One of them made every person hostile towards you which was chaotic fun (you could also arm everyone with rocket launchers, but that was too much) This is an idea for a game inspired by that:\n\nYou start in a large GTA style map. Miles big. You start on one end, and in the opposite corner, an NPC is infected and starts infecting others, and it starts spreading. The longer it takes you to get there, the more infected you'll meet, and the harder it'll be to find patient zero. You win when you kill patient zero. More points for killing fewer infected on the way. (You could technically just need to bump into patient zero to ""cure"" them.) It's the same logic as movie hive villains. Destroy the ""leader"" and it all stops.\n\nHalf the fun is trying to get there as fast as possible. It should be a little trickier than just hijacking a sports car and speeding straight there. The more skilled you are, the easier it would be once you arrive, and a new player would certainly be overwhelmed if it spreads halfway. I imagine you could run into gangs or cops who could also want to stop you for their own motives.\n\nThe difficulty could be shifted by changing the start points of the hero/patient zero to different regions of the map, requiring more challenging main routes. There could be different maps of various sizes, but it's already a tall task to make one huge map. Ideally, one could be procedurally generated somehow for the most discovery. You could change the infect rate of spread, or make ""two"" viruses on different edges so by the time you finish one, the other is spread far.\n\nOr maybe there would be side-quests (simple ones, but it takes time and a detour) to upgrade weapons/vehicles to balance the directness. It's starting to sound on paper a bit like Dead Rising, but as I imagine it, it feels very different."

Take the concepts from Vampyr like creating medicines and administering them to people and other general doctoring work, and expand upon that. The idea of playing as a sawbones in the middle ages doing your own research and experiments to create new medicines and treatments and actually using them. Then at some point a new disease unlike anything seen before begins to spread and it's your responsibility to research and attempt to create treatments and potentially a cure for what would turn out to be the black plague. A hygiene system of some sort, some medical procedures and creating medicines from plants and rudementary chemicals. The concept as a whole was very intriguing to me.

oqa48x,Long-term turn based map-based strategy game,"How I had the idea: I enjoy games I can play for ~10 minutes a day and work towards a long term goal. It's why I have Civilization saves that last years, and I set up ongoing chess games that anybody in my family can play a turn on when they walk past. However, I feel like the aspects of Civ that makes it hard to have long-term multiplayer games are some of the non-military parts like culture and tourism. I was trying to think of a game that takes aspects of Civ but streamlines it for a long-term type of game, and this is what I came up with!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nCore idea 1: Earthlike map. I am debating on whether the ""world"" (animals, biomes, cultures) should stay earthlike or be more fantasy, but having the main structure (Shapes of the land and bodies of water, as well as mountains and deserts) of the map is important to me because I feel like the shapes and terrain the Earth naturally creates leads to really interesting war situations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nCore Idea 2: Emphasis on Infrastructure. Cities in this game could rely on geography and location to determine what strategical value they hold. Have a city right next to an important front? Use it to create (train?) troops and get them to the front lines faster. Have a city next to a mineral rich area? Set up mines. Cities deep in your controlled territory maybe can be used to research better technology, lead the way politically, or finance your ongoing wars. Taking an important territory or city should be extremely impactful, both because of how much coordination is needed and the rewards after. Taking land should put wind in a player's sails and put the opponent on the back foot unless a well coordinated defense supported by infrastructure is set up by the defender. Remember, in this game, you play the ""long game."" Since regions and cities are so customizable on what they produce, I think maybe drawing your own state lines could be help with this, but maybe would be too complicated (?).\n\nCore Idea 3: Streamlined mechanics. I really want to stress this one. In Civ, you have to create science production to research faster. In this, new tech and advancements shouldn't need science to speed them up, they are just a set time (but require money?). Economy should not be overbearing, and the main part of the game should be moving troops around your fronts, like chess pieces on a chess board, occupying a territory or city as a whole, not a specific part of a territory (like a chess piece occupies a square). Not sure if influence should be a mechanic, with fringe territories turning to the opponent's side.\n&gt;\nPlease give advice: I am not sure if a lot of things are right for a turn based game like this. Should there even be a tech tree if I'm trying to make it streamlined? Should there be an emphasis on infrastructure? What are some ways to shape this multiplayer, long-term, combat game?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nDesign ideas: These are in no way concrete, just ideas on my vision of the game. The graphics style would be nice if it was kind of like Age of Empires 4, or the For Honor map. The time period could be older, or more modern, which would dictate things like railroads vs. roads, and tanks vs horses. If the game was fantasy, I think having dinosaurs that could be ridden as horse type creatures could be cool, but that's just an idea. I also think unique cultures not found in human history could be interesting, but could maybe be bought with a currency I mention below instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nImportant mechanics: Since this is a long term game, it could end when a player controls all territories, or when players agree to a ""treaty."" The treaty mechanic could rely on a currency that doesn't affect the actual gameplay, but can buy skins and maps outside the main game (in the menus). The player who was winning would want to negotiate a treaty where they get more land, as that yields more of this currency, and the player(s) who are losing would want to negotiate a treaty where they regain more land. The catch is, after a certain amount of back and forth, if a treaty is not met, both players have their currency rewards halved or something of that nature.\n&gt;\nI will add more ideas as they come, but this took me a while, so an upvote would be appreciated so more people can see my idea. Furthermore, questions and advice, as well as ideas of your own would be awesome."

oq7pw2,Building game focused on the enviorment,"I thought of an game where you build an emipre of Industry, Society and Military while the actions of the player heavily influence the enviorment. Like you can build Windturbines connected to a water container, peoducing hydrogen to store energy(which would be more expensive) OR you could build nuclar power plants to get energy but radiating the enviorment which is costs less.\n\nI also thought of an aliance type thingy like with Anno or Civilisation but with a twist. Though being in a non war contract, your allies could backstab and attack you. The AI could use two tactics the, what I call the 'Roman way', all open assault where it just throws it units at you, and the modern tactic with strategic attacks of well equiped units specialized for one action like attack, boobytraping etc. .\n\nAs I think the Industry and Military aspect are very big and I want to make a fun game to play either way you can choose the Society aspect will be narrowed to Loyality, room to live, as well as food and water. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever though I think I have the core idea fleshed out quite good, I have no idea in which scenario to put it in. Current times, Ancient long died out forgotten species, Warhammer 40K like or in the future. \n\nI am not that idea full and would love things to add or scenarios you would like to see the project in."
oq7gtz,Ideas on a roblox game,I’m thinking of making a roblox game but i would love it if you guys could give me some ideas on what you think will be a fun game. I want to make a game that everyone can love and enjoy:)
oq6rps,a new TTRPG called Exile,But not just any Table Top Role Playing Game it’s one about cryptozoologists who get isekai’d into a dimension where all of Earth’s Cryptids and Fearsome Critters come from. Perhaps the rules could be based on Dungeons and Dragons?

oq4054,Game Idea: Monastic Simulator,"Have you ever wondered what's the deal with monastiscism? What do monks and nuns practice and what are they up to, for real?\n\nAll these questions and more can be answered by Monastic Simulator, a silly, but teachable game for docile players who wants nothing more than to run your own monastery. Choose between a total of two races: monks or nuns. Participate in celibacy by not participating in sexual intercourse, or do and earn some points but make sure the head-monk/nun doesn't see you! Increase your monastery and add a shop, get an economy going. Add more buildings, do your church service, invite guests, upgrade your monk/nun with better abilities, maybe buy a cloak or spend your points on a new wimple or cape. Wager wars on competing monasterys, send spies to infiltrate other monasteries and by the end of the day maybe you succeed to take command over other monasteries by killing with head nun/monk with a pitchfork level three.\n\nThis is something me and a friend came up with while playing Graveyard Keeper which is kind of similar game in term of sillyness."
oq30pl,A Rogue-like Multi-player Spore Type Game,"A game kinda like Spore, but you only get a few options of body parts based on what you currently have. Simple body parts unlock more complex body parts to choose from. However at each evolution point you can only choose 1 upgrade. If your species dies that body part becomes soft locked (for that species only, subsequent species are free to go that route). Each body part leads to a new tree of body parts available, the only way to evolve is to get food. \n\nStart at the single cell phase and move up to more complex life. A species is kinda like starting a character. Each life stage is effectively locked to that life stage so players can play the part they want to at any time.\n\nHave a species map that shows the progression of all species ever made on an account using game stats. It would mostly be a neat visual for the player to see what worked and what didn't."
oq0epf,Gun building/designer where you'll make guns for the military and/or civilian market,"I take inpiration for this idea from Mikhail Kalashnikov's story of how he designed the AK-47.\n\nThe game would have different ways to start a game, like: \n\n&gt;2-3 campaigns (in places like USA, Germany and Russia, though it's up to the developer) where specific objectives have to be completed each level, obviously.\n\n&gt;custom singleplayer game where you can start your career in any country (any region if that country is under foreign control) with your custom company name on logo in any year in 10 year intervals.\n\n&gt;Optional. A multiplayer where multiple players, totaling up to 10, can either work together or compete to become the best gun designer and company.\n\nThe game's time period would be from 1900 to 2050/2100, making it roughly a 200 year long gun history. As you might imagine, you'd start with bolt-action rifles, pistols, revolvers etc., go on to assault rifles, semi-auto rifles and such, to finally some kind of futuristic guns.\n\nThe game could also go on a bit of an ahistorical path like the USSR losing because you made efficient  enough guns for Germany or a country's independance is preserved becuase the local (yours) gun producer helped to make efficient guns.\n\nGun designing should be pretty lenient/option rich, like wether to use a wooden or metal stock, maybe even a synthetic one if you have the tech, what metal to make it out of? steel, straight up iron, cast iron??, aluminium, your choice."
opzhvj,A game with a hangover type premises,"A nice, simple idea. Take a load of randomly generated scenarios with variables like ""at (location) you did (action) with (item) to/with (person)"" and huge list of those variables and you have a scenario, and take 5 or six of these random scenarios and you have the entire timeline of the previous night. \n\nThe story is, on a Saturday morning, you wake up hungover with no memory of the night before, and have to make your way around a free roaming city trying to price together what happened the previous night in order to retrieve something (we'll just say your wallet or something)\n\nYou have 48 in game hours (because your character has to work on Monday at an unspecified office job) to work out what happened by finding clues around an open world city for example, you've woken up with a statue from the park and have to go to the park and ask around, maybe sneak into the security hut to find the CCTV, or maybe you left another clue there like your jacket with a takeaway menu from a restaurant in the pocket, thus sending you to your next location.\n\nDue to your character still being technically drunk, you can't drive anywhere, and you have to make your way around on public transport or maybe doing little side missions for friends in return for a lift here and there, or can encounter a bicycle or something. For the first few hours of the game, navigation and conversations ( multiple path conversations with a skill level that slowly rises as the hangover wears off) are harder until you've completely sobered up.\n\nIf you fail to locate your wallet in time, the game ends with you being unable to get to work on the Monday and your boss angrily ringing up to fire you. If you DO manage to find it in time, you manage to get to work where a coworker comments on you looking rough and your character saying something like ""I've had a crazy weekend, this is what happened.."" as the voice becomes muffled and the camera pans over a newspaper on a table summarising your hijinks, your general stats of the playthrough etc, all in a front page story and when you've pressed next, your co-worker grabs the paper saying ""better shred this so the boss doesn't see it"" implying you'd have been fired if they knew.\n\nThat's it generally. I think it could be a fun game in any format. Phone, VR, console, whatever.and with the amount of variables, each playthrough  would be completely different, and if it's done with comical variables, the end result of each scenario can result in a hilarious situation."
opycy4,Evolution Game,"I've had the idea kicking around for awhile regarding a game that allows you to build the world's ecosystem and watch as it plays itself out. This game could be incredibly simple, or Ark/NMS level complex.\n\nThe basic idea is this: Using an options menu, you can design plants and animals, selecting where they go on the food chain, their habitat, etc etc. Once you have created your creature, it becomes an actual mob on the games planet, and you can watch as it flourishes or dies out, depending on whether the ecosystem it prefers is strong enough to support it making its own niche.\n\nFor example, I want to make a large pachyderm herbivore, which lives in savannas and eats exclusively a shrub-esque grass I've already created. I have to use my judgement on when to introduce this creature, because if there is not enough of this wild grass they will die out. If there is too much grass, the herbivores population will explode to the point the grass is driven extinct, followed closely by our lovely papcyderm.\n\nSay that second scenario takes place, Pachyderms are multiplying rapidly while their food source dwindles. Time to create a carnivore to balance out the systems. Rinse and repeat until you have created a stable ecosystem. \n\nThere could also be random events such as natural disasters, disease, and other circumstances that throw a curveball at your perfect balancing act.\n\nThoughts?"

opwh0o,Need help with Game Mechanic ( Nuclear throne etc style ) - Tales,"&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi Guys. I always hang around here and must say what a great community.!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my game story Idea has been set out. It takes place in very tales.\n\n   \n**Story**  \nTales  of the world has been forgotten. But there is a reason for it. They all  have been captured and only a few left. When the last story characters  has been captured the offering will start and the BAD ENEMY WARLORD NAME  HERE will cross the tales realm to our realm to enslave all mankind.  \n\n\nPlayer  enters this lost library.  First he find a open book. ( Tutorial  mission ). Player enters and start going thru levels like Nuclear  throne.  Every enemy you kill gives you some part of the missing pages  in the book ( XP ) until your player Transforms into the Character of  the  Tale he is in ( Acting as a second live ). If the player looses a  life  he will transform back into a normal character. Save the Librarian  who is actually a Wizzard tasked to protect the Tales. ( Or Is he )  \n\n\nPlayer is tasked to save some of the key Tales. as Follow.   \n\n\nPlayer enters **Robin Hoods Book**. When gaining XP he will turn into the **HOOD** for  the second life and for a 3rd Live the player can randomly turn into  any of the unlocked characters. Final boss for area ( The Sherrif ).  Beat him and the HOOD is unlocked and in the Library.  \n\n\nThen player enters **Wonderland**. Enough XP and Player turn into **ALICE**....  \nHave perma death with somethings carrying over.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot some more level ideas. But you get the flow of things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was my concept. But Now thinking my XP idea is jsut bad... Dont like it,  Player can't choose character.\n\nThe problem. The Game Mechanic. What is the mechanic. It has no mechanic.... Just a twin stick shooter at this point. I have some prototypes already.  Will post some screenshot below. Generic gameplay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMechanic Ideas for a twin stick shooter? \n\n* Player tendency has good and bad? Yes a mechanic but what is the implication of good and bad in the games context?\n* Give some reason for the player to shoot and not to shoot? Limited ammo? Get charged by stands with books on it at random points? Enemy drops pages that is health or ammo? Other wise the game can just constantly shoot.\n* Collect Something on each level? Wait this is not a mechanic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA crap really need your help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""WByHdJS"" data-context=""false"" &gt;&lt;a href=""[//imgur.com/WByHdJS](//imgur.com/WByHdJS)""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""0YcebIE"" data-context=""false"" &gt;&lt;a href=""[//imgur.com/0YcebIE](//imgur.com/0YcebIE)""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""nuKTzJ3"" data-context=""false"" &gt;&lt;a href=""[//imgur.com/nuKTzJ3](//imgur.com/nuKTzJ3)""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;"

Normal: There's a time limit and you have to destroy as much as you can. Each destroyed item yelds a score.\n\nYou have to have a certain score before the time ends to pass the level.

All tools are unlocked.
opuonq,A dog agility racing video game!,"Feel free to use this idea\n\nI don’t know whether or not you’re familiar with dog agility races, but they’re really fun to watch. Dogs are timed as their handlers lead them through an obstacle course that includes ramps, cones, slalom poles, tunnels, bars to jump over and more. In these competitions, dogs usually race one at a time, and they’re scored based on accuracy and speed.  In the game that I envision, the obstacle course is larger, wider, and designed for up to 8 dogs to race at once. This means that there would be multiples of some things like several lanes for the pole weaving, larger tunnels, and wider ramps.  If an obstacle is missed, then the dog doesn’t lose points for it, but must go back and re-do it. The first dog that reaches the finish line wins.  Also, in this game the handlers are absent, so it’s just the dogs on the agility course.  In each game, the layout of the course should be different, and the placement of the obstacles should be different. Some games might even include pools that dogs need to swim through.\n\nThere should be numerous breeds of dogs. The more the better. It’s possible that the game could be designed so that different breeds have different running speeds and different maneuverability stats, but it might be a better idea if all dogs are equal.\n\nPlayers can either play against the computer, or log on to Dog Net and race against other people. If friends want to log on and play against each other, then they can create their own private game. When you log onto Dog Net, you can either join a public game, or start your own private game where others can join if they have your password (which you would create when you start the game). \n\nAs far as controls are concerned, this game requires several buttons, so it would be best on either a computer or a gaming system. The joystick or arrow keys can orient your dog in any direction, one button would be for running in the direction that you’re aiming, and one for jumping. The height of the jump would be based on how long you hold the jump button down, which is important since some obstacles would require higher jumps than others. When you take your finger off the running button, you will come to a stop.  If the controller has the right buttons, then there could also be side buttons that enable the dog to veer right or left, which would help in the slalom poles.\n\nThe background can be in an outdoor grassy setting, in an indoor stadium, on the beach, in the snow, or in the city.  Backgrounds can be chosen randomly, or by the player that initiates the game.\n\nAs an extra, there should be a dog library tab with information on all the different dog breeds.  This should be accessible from the intro screen.\n\n[https://i0.wp.com/www.dgpforpets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Canyonview-Sheltie-shelties-puppy-shetland-sheepdog-Kelowna-BC-CKC-Canadian-Kennel-Club-dog-breeder-Penticton-Kamloops-British-Columbia-Saskatoon-Saskatchewan-Alberta-Canada-agility-161.jpg?ssl=1](https://i0.wp.com/www.dgpforpets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Canyonview-Sheltie-shelties-puppy-shetland-sheepdog-Kelowna-BC-CKC-Canadian-Kennel-Club-dog-breeder-Penticton-Kamloops-British-Columbia-Saskatoon-Saskatchewan-Alberta-Canada-agility-161.jpg?ssl=1)"
opuit3,Would this be good RPG battle mechanics?,"It's how I thought of battles and how you level up, imagine it being a turn based RPG like Lisa or off. But you can see what the enemy will do next turn, all it's stats and how much damage it will do and its effects.\n\nThe catch is your equally as weak or weaker than them, but you might have a few skills up your sleeve, you might have a skill that can turn the battle. And you don't get stronger as you level up, you just gain more skills. (As life is in general)\n\nA example is that You can hit harder for more mana or cure a debuff. The battle's winner is on who can adapt the most, prevent the enemy from dealing to much damage or applying to much buffs or debuffs.\n\nAs you level up you can do the same as the enemies but it's a test to see who can do it better, they might have better buffs and stats but you can see what they can do and about to do next turn.\n\nThought it would require alot of playtesting, I would like to see a game like this happen. Would gladly help with ideas to."

oprz06,Red Rectangle Rampage (a meme game tbh),"Red Rectangle Rampage would be a 3D platformer starring a Red Rectangle (no joke, it’s just a red Rectangle.). I’ll call him Red.\n\nRed would go through different levels and worlds with different gimmicks and weird textures and memes. A common theme is Dream. There would be 8 worlds and 8 levels in each.\n\nThe main baddie is a giant Cylinder that reads, “Ur Mom is Dumb,” and is named Jeffrey. In order to defeat him you must push Dream’s Manhunt Videos at him. First encounter (1-8) would require 1 video pushed, Second (5-8) would require 3 videos pushed, and The final (8-8) would required 5 videos.\n\nJeffrey would have little spherical goons that do certain things depending on their color.\n\nPink ones charge at you, Purple ones throw balls at you, Blue ones have a diamond sword, green ones explode on impact, etc.\n\nThere would be Mini Bosses as well, One for each world. I can explain more in the comments if wanted. I don’t want the post to be too long!\n\nGimmicks I’ve imagined so far are buttons that spawn a timed bridge for 10 seconds, moving platforms, cannons with the Dream logo (inverted) on them, crate buttons, and doors that must have something done to open. \n\nJokes would include Among Us, Dream (logo, smp, catchphrases, videos, etc.), corrupted texture, Minecraft mobs, world problems, etc.\n\nIf the player falls off the level or gets hit, they would explode. There should also be a button for it.\n\nIf anyone needs more info for development or just plain curious (most likely second option), let me know where and I’ll go into more detail.\n\n(If I messed up flairs, let me know and I’ll fix them)"
oppydp,A multiplayer survival horror game where spooks trigger for individual players separately.,"What if the scares/events in a multiplayer horror game didn't always trigger for all players, but sometimes only one or two at a time? e.g. one player experiences a jumpscare, but the other three only see/hear a normal environment. If done right, this could mix in disorientation and uncertainty into the multiplayer experience and give the effect of some, or all, they players going mad (""What do you mean you didn't see it?? It was right there!"")\n\nThis idea could be expanded on too. Perhaps the clues of the game could give each player conflicting information, creating ingroup tension as the players try to work out who has the real answer. Maybe a random minority of players can see the monsters while the others can't, so they have to act to warn/protect their friends."
opphek,Is my game idea worthwhile?,"Basically, my game would be a 2d twin stick shooter where the focus would be on guns. You'd kill an enemy that would spawn out of a portal and that enemy once killed would drop a random gun. You'd have to use that gun and the player would be forced to move because of the random spawn positions of the enemies. The main idea is that the amount of guns would determine points (if you have a certain amount of points you'd go on to the next level),. Also, the gun you'd have would change the gameplay (affecting how you'd take out the enemies, etc.).  Different levels would feature different scenes (ex. hell, ice desert, et.) and different enemies.  The main scene itself (present in every level) would be a platform type scene.\n\nWith all that said, my questions are...is that a type of game you would actually want to play? Is it fun enough? Is it reasonably scoped?(I'm thinking of making the game solo and in just a few months.)  Would be nice to see what you think along with your constructive criticism."
opor49,The game about sandwiches and shootouts...,"The game is called sandwich 2, the sequel to sandwich. It starts in the a sandwich shop. A customer comes in and gives you an order. You have a short time to review it, then the countdown begins. You have a very limited time to make the sandwich, its a speed run style game. If you make the sandwich in time, the customer pays you and leaves, but if you don't finish in time or mess up the order then that customer will appear in the final shootout. There is 10 orders in the day, and in the end the customers who's sandwich you messed up come to attack you. For example, if you mess up all 10 orders there is 10 people attacking you, but if you only mess up 1 then only 1 person attacks you, giving incentive to try and get it right. In the final shootout, everyone has guns. There could be different types of customers who have pistols or rpgs and so on, but if you win the fight then you keep the money you made that day which you can use to upgrade your restaurant, but if you die then you lose the money and have to try again. If you get all the sandwiches right in the day then there is no shootout and you keep the money you made + a 20% bonus. When upgrading your restaurant, you can upgrade it normally, like new kitchen appliances or tables which could give bonuses like a slightly longer time to make the sandwich, or you can buy things to help with the shootout  like turrets or bulletproof glass, or you can buy guns for your load out that you can access during the shootout. \n\nI know its pretty dumb but thats kind of the idea, and it could be fun. What do you think, and do you have any more ideas for it?"
opmoha,an adventure/horror game from my dreams!,"I saw this in one of my dreams a couple years back and it was such a good dream,it stood with me since. I recently dreamed it again and remembered it again now that im browsing the sub. *Long post ahead!*\n\nI am mainly looking for improvement and extra ideas as i was planning to make this game myself. Heres the idea: \n\n##Story\n\nYou are a highschool student and you are on a school trip to a old manor for a couple days. The manor is filled with mysteries and puzzles and the guy that runs the manor is a really weird guy. (Its like Harry Potter and his school dynamic) \n\n##Mechanics\n\n&amp;gt; These were all in my dream so dont blame me please.\n+ Its like a Persona day/night system, you hang out with your school friends, eat your 3 meals, join tours, follow your teachers, dont be suspicious. when the night falls and you guys go back to your guest house, your adventure begins. You sneak into manor, check each room by room find some codes, avoid staff/owner, solve puzzles, basic horror game stuff.\n+ You find some weird things happening, stuff disappearing overnight. You have to ability to tell these stuff to any of your school mates. They all have different buffs/debuffs to give you. Some might not believe, your roommate might cover for you during day so you can go on extra adventures, tech friend might give you cameras, lock picks. However the game gets harder the more people you tell, the owner gets suspicious of you over time, he stumbles into you at night etc etc.\n+ New mechanics/enemies introduced overtime like a hidden part of the house behind a bookshelf/under a shed. \n\n##Video\n\n+ I dreamed this with Thief(2011) graphics but something like Hello Neighbor also makes sense. \n\nSorry for the long post! Tell me what you think of this please!"

opkqm6,Robot Logic Gladiators,"I’ve had the idea to try and make a small robot battling game from a top down 2d perspective. The game’s main focus would be basically simple robot battles in an arena.

ofbztb,I need help on deciding what to do for my game,"So I don’t know if this belongs here, and I don’t know if this’ll break any rules but basically, without spoiling too much, my friends and I (mostly me) have been making this F.E.A.R. inspired game for years. Technically it started development before I played F.E.A.R. but right now I have the story finalized and the environments planned. The problem is is I’m not sure what to do gameplay wise. I’m using the FPS Creator engine (grew up using it and basically know it’s ins and outs, plus I started developing this idea on it back when I was in middle school) and after constant revisions and remakes, I have two ideas. \n\nThe first idea is a more old school corridor shooter with fairly basic AI; this will work best for my friends who are not avid PC gamers or gamers in general. The second idea is more of a mix of F.E.A.R. 2 and Call of Duty, with fast paced battles but slow atmospheric buildup, and more intelligent AI. Here’s the problem I have though. This idea I have, is to make an anthology horror franchise, with this first (or second if you want to count my demo as the first part) game being an homage to F.E.A.R., if by nothing else concept alone. I’ve already made several ideas for other games in this universe, but I can’t decide between the more classic feel or the more modern feel. \n\nThe classic feel would work but I’m not sure it would be as much fun to a more hardcore audience. I’m not going to lie and say my atmospheric buildup is great and the voice acting is spectacular, both are, I’ll admit, not as good as they could be, although one can be excused because the voice actors are all graduated high school students. The casual shooter is finished, for the most part. A few bugs here and there that I’ll have to work out and I’ll have to place the voice acting in once I’ve finished mixing it. But it’s basically done. \n\nAs for the more modern game, this would be a lot of fun, especially with this AI designed for this type of gameplay. The problem is is I’d have to completely redo the entire game in order for this work. The AI is similar to that of F.E.A.R., and needs more of an open area to work properly. Old school corridor shooter wouldn’t work well. And here’s the other problem. FPS Creators memory issues. The program was created in 2005 for windows XP and it still has the XP mindset, meaning that a game using a lot of fancy shaders, graphics and scripting would take up a lot of space of the limited memory in the program. And I’m afraid if I do this idea, I’ll have to cut MASSIVE parts of the game for the sake of finishing it, in addition to completely remaking it. I’m afraid I bit off more than I can chew with the story (which isn’t anything super crazy but has a TON of working parts.) \n\nI’m not sure what to do. Make the weaker game with a better story or make a better game with a more compressed story? I’ve been working on this concept since 2010, I’ve poured my heart and soul into it. I’ve rewritten the story hundreds of times, remade the game dozens of times, and restarted so many times, I have all these different anthology stories and games mostly finished, all of which are revolving around this first title that’s supposed to be the Gateway hub of the entire universe. I mean I’ve made concepts for prequel adventures, sequels, spin offs, etc. all of which are incorporating all these ideas I have. But I want people to enjoy the first title, the gateway to this world. And I’m not sure what to do. Throw all my best mechanics out from the get go or start simple and have the game improve gradually as I finalize them. Please give me some advice because this is super exhausting to think about."

Same thing goes for Chrome Hounds. I thought the customization and different parts you could get and the enemies you fought in Chrome Hounds, as a experimental military vehicle, was outstanding. \n\nPlease, someone get this to the nearest game designer and have them look at it.

of58w7,"A glitchy AAA game, where you glitch between the years 1910 and 2070","Hi guys, I'm extremely new to game design, but I've been thinking about this one idea for my university project (I cannot express this enough, it will be snippets, and maybe you can roam around a room MAXIMUM)\n\nWhat if, there was 1 constant game (story, NPC interaction, signage, map etc), but, one had the aesthetic of the 1910's, and the other in 2070. \n\nE.g.  \n1910, french lady with a coffee smoking a cigarette\n2070, new age zoomer with monster zero and a vape.\n\nSignage, where 1910 was a billboard, but 2070 was a hologram\n\nWeapons, same stats, different aesthetics, sounds, experiences\n\nAnd the story, characters were the exact same, but the skins glitches between the two\n\nFirstly, is this even possible to have something in a GTA vibe, but have it glitch in and out of art styles\n\nSecondly, I'm sure this isn't a new idea, if you can recommend any precedents that would be greatly appreciated\n\nThirdly, cool right?\n\nThank you"
of4ptv,Racing Game Idea,"So I've seen a lot of racing games, and none of them have what I want all in one, so I thought I would share my own idea. First off, we need a lot of cars. Like a lot. Next we need good customization for every or most cars, similar to nfs heat, but better. Next I want to include not only the option to race, but to just casually drive around too. We need lots of things to do, and we will need a big map. I'm talking 5 times as big as nfs heats map, and the option to download custom maps and races. Then we need a custom race track creator, and one that's really good too, and not like most custom map creation tools like Tony hawks pro skater games. Kinda like skyrim modding but in the racing game, where on PC there would be no big restrictions for assets, but on console only using assets the base game provides. And the most needed thing is a solid multi-player. We need many options for online play, racing, free driving, time trials, 1v1 races, battles kinda like Mario Kart (dunno how it would work yet) and the ability to play people's online maps with other people (kinda like team fortress 2 servers). This is just a rough idea, and I think it would all fit in to a game that's AAA. It would need lots of work to do properly too lol. Lemme know if this is a shit idea or a good one, cuz I have lots more to add. TL;DR: cool racing game with lots of customization and the ability to choose how you play easily."
of38lz,Daredevil game where you *as the player* are blind.,"This would be unlike any other game and it is stupidly easy to mess it up but it could be amazing if executed right. \n\nIn fairness the player would be able to see while free running and in cutscenes. Free running would be based off a much tamer world on fire perspective we saw on the show while cutscenes would just be standard cutscenes.\n\n\nCombat is where things would go black, not completely black as you will visual UI, indicators to help inform the player, and some very archaic visuals just to give players a small amount of context of where they are, add on some brightly colored intractable objects to give the game sleeping dogs.  Outside of visual indicators audio queoes will be the bulk of combat challenges, this may sound simple but you can add depth to it and make it an original type of fighting game. Of course the sounds will be heavily overdone which actually fits the daredevil lore. A knife for example will make a very specific sound once a guy is about to attack you, a visual indicator will show where the attack is coming from, and then you'll need to use the dodge mechanoc to avoid the attack, add on other mechanics like guns and enemies throwing objects and tough guys and there could be a lot of challenge coming from combat that is 90% audio. Visual,  Beating heartbeats will be shown to tell the player where enemies are in relation to them and a heartbeater counter as UI will tell them how many enemies there are to beat. The hearts will even start visible beating harder to show the player when they are about to go for an attack. Once the player finishes a fight we'll show them a replay of the entire fight but with actual visuals to let them see how much of a badass they really are, think superheat for this.\n\nI know this entire game does sound convoluted and like I said it's VERY easy to mess up. But it has a lot of potential and could be really rhythmic and exciting if done well."
oeyzad,Chao garden mobile game?,"I had a loose idea after watching a YouTube video, and all I got is a chao garden from the sonic series on your phone, cause chao are cute, and who doesn't love cute?\n\nI imagine it would be a combination of maybe gacha and puzzle levels to obtain items to give chao, or to get new chao in general. \n\nCould also be a Mario run style platformer where you can run one way and can take multiple paths to get all the items in a level. If it's actually sonic, and not a knock off or custom made series, I think this would work well enough. Not to mention, you could unlock multiple characters to run through levels.\n\nAgain, loose idea, and wanted to share it somewhere, and here seemed like the best place to do so. \n\nSidenote : I am not a programmer or developer of any kind, just have random ideas :)"

It is level based. There will be different chapters and in each chapters, there will be a number of levels. We play as [Bubo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xn0WVS3mZ4c5ljg-I7bxpWRqq-Ls9qnB/view?usp=sharing) a small slime like creature(maybe I'll change his appearance to something better). Our objective is to save [Gugy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWWhPnI479KluPpqDWSmRR-5r3PWtHrx/view?usp=sharing) (who is bubo's girlfriend) from other ""evil qunos"". Qunos is their species name. There will be ghost qunos, ninja qunos, bomb qunos.. etc as enemies. Each enemies will have special powers. For example, ninjas can throw ranged weapons etc..  Evil qunos will be travelling along a path, guarding a key to the next room(level). We should stealthly move throught the level and take the key and escape the to the next room. Our enemies can't look back. (Like in pacman) There are things in the level to distract them. And there will be teleporting points in the room to teleport to another point in the room. \n\nThese are my current ideas. Do you guys have any recommendations or ideas for any addition features? If any, then please inform me. Pls Pls Pls"
oesnjg,i want a stylized idea for a game??????,STYLIZED IDEA!!!
oergmv,A NEW CHAINSAWMAN GAME,"With the manga chainsaw man getting an anime announcement, I was thinking about what kind of game would fit mechanically with it. \n\nI keep imagining a DMC or NG style action adventure, but do anyone have any crazier ideas."
oer886,Do you guys have a stylized Game idea that it is simple and not like shooter or any thing like that,The i want is a stylized the stile is stylized and the idea is stylized
oeqyz4,A hypothetical game idea,"I've been pitching a game idea for months for a world building project made by C. M. Kosemen and Simon Roy called ""A World of Dinosauroids.""\nI was very fascinated by the amount of lore of this world building project that I can't help but think what if there would be a game based on it.\n\nMy hypothetical game would be a survival game that takes inspiration from Subnautica and Death Stranding.\n\nI can't list everything I have in my mind otherwise I would be writing a whole bible so I might want to make multiple parts based on the basic game mechanics for like maybe every 4 days or I'm gonna make weekly updates for my ideas.\n\n\nAnyways. What kind of game would you design based on this project? Let me know! I'm eager to hear your thoughts and ideas in the comments!\n\nHeres the link to the website:\n\n[A World of Dinosauroids](http://cmkosemen.com/dinosauroids.html)"
oeq1il,Football manager style wrestling management game,"I'm certain someone already posted this at some point. But does it exist? Something like hiring wrestlers, managers, doctors, refs, booking matches,  booking venues, custom wrestling promotion style, custom belts/championships/tournament/PPVs, long and short term storytelling, match/performance rating system, wrestlers compatibility. stealing talent, loaning talents, contract negotiations, tv ratings, PPV buy ratings, and stuff like that. Like a football manager but for wrestling."
oenft8,County life or sheriff simulator.,"I've had this idea for a while but haven't really obtained the skills to make a full out game. I personally grew up in a small town in northern Idaho. I understand some may think this is too big for an Independent dev, but I think some may want to attempt or take from my idea. I've always wanted to play a police simulator game based in a rural setting. I got the idea from playing my summer car a few years back. I thought how cool it would be to have a more in depth game that went over a sheriff's everyday life.\n\nThe game itself I don't think should be story driven but more decision driven possibly, but in depth enough with encounters that it keeps the player engaged.\n\nA few things I think would/should be involved to make it more in depth are: \nDon't make the player the actual sheriff, but make them the deputy or include multiple modes where you're the sheriff and are the shot caller, or you're the deputy and are on call;\n Possibly involve two different difficulties, one with a food, water, health, etc. and another without such for the players that just want a police simulator;\nMultiple towns, I think two - three small towns with 5 to 10 minutes of modest driving in between them would give it that county/rural feel, especially with a logging area and a few farms along the way;\nHousing, I think a few options with rent to pay would give it a good life simulation feel;\nBusinesses, I think each town should have multiple businesses that each have wares for the players to buy, such as a diners, grocery stores, or gas stations for food. A dealership for personal vehicles. This can really go anywhere for businessess.\n\nI have a few more ideas that I just think are personal wants, they may actually be useful for the game but I'm not too sure. I'm not too sure if this is too lengthy or something so I'm fully open to the negative replies but nonetheless if you need anymore reply, or add my Snapchat to talk privately :shawnoe32"
oen4di,A physics based combat game where different weapons have different scaling properties,"For example, weapons that scale with Momentum would do more damage the faster they are moving. This would be really good for weapons like flails or whips. There could also be weapons that scale with Gravity and do more damage the farther they fall. For instance, if you did a plunging attack off a high building using a weapon with an S+ scaling in Gravity, you would just obliterate whatever enemy you land on"
oem8ef,Cool 2d visual novel concepts?,I got a new game engine that I’m excited to use but I have absolutely no ideas on what I should make. Any suggestions?
oekvfe,Does anyone have 2d story game ideas?,
oehuzq,RPG with an unique TurnBase Combat mechanic.,"**Hi everyone!** I'm currently making an RPG heavly inspired in undertale and earthbound and I need some help in the combat system. I have litteraly no ideas. \n\nI want something unique that doesn´t feell like that the player isn´t playing another final fantasy. \n\nI love the undertale mechanic but I want something different since the gamplay is already similar. \n\nThe person with the best idea will get his/her name in the credits :)  \n\nThe story will be about demons or something, I can´t decide it yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Sorry for my poor English, it's not my first language and I'm still learning :P **Thank you**!"
oe9xzd,What flairs means?,
oe65s0,Open world history/mythology RPG,"\*DISCLAIMER: I dont know if it's possible but if it is it will take a really long time\*\n\nIt's an open world and the map should be the earth, based on where you live is where you should start/spawn. You are going to choose between some classes (Like you do in WoW). The earth should have some houses where you can follow the main story but you can do other things like building your own house just like minecraft, you should be able to chop down trees, eiter the trees drop aplings so you can re-plant them or it could be on automate, dosen't really mather. But as it says in the title it should contain all mythology creatures from all the different countries. Like where i live we have something called Troll, it's a giant that lives in the forrest but if you go to the ocean you might counter the legendary Kraken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope some people understand what type of game this is and i would love to make it but im really bad at programing."
oe5q3e,A Transformers themed battle royale,"Simple concept, start as a robot (no vehicle mode) you have to scan a car to enable the vehicle mode.\n\nthe car form is your armour level, so bigger the vehicle the higher the armour, once the armour level is down to zero you have to scan a new car to re up your armour.\n\nweapons can be found in drops. \n\nupgrades or mechanics like pings/rader can be picked up and they get added to the model.\n\nthe ""ring"" could be the warp gate closing effect from the shows or maybe the rust stuff from the prime show\n\nthen obviously it's giant robots fighting destructible building's and terrain if on earth. but it would be cooler if it was on cybertron. \n\nThe style of war for cybertron / fall of cybertron"
oe5hsk,"A cactus rolling game. Sonic, in slow motion. Momentum conservation.","You play as a potted cactus that got stuck underground, and is trying to get to the surface.\n\nThe cactus part is sticky, and will attach to objects such as walls, etc... but the pot is not. So you need to gather momentum and keep that momentum in order to keep moving, otherwise you'll get stuck on your side and can't get back up.  \n\n\nIt's basically slow motion sonic, but underground. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo enemies, except there are a bunch of mushrooms that want to be your friend and cheer you on. Little do the mushrooms know that they release poison spores that kill you (so you have to keep moving forward). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to avoid water because cactuses drown, and  you can stand in sun rays that pierced the surface in order to get a speed boost. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly two commands. Jump, and roll."
oe24mw,Space-Prison Boss Rush,"Okay so I really love boss fights in video games so I came up with a scenario where you literally just fight a bunch of bosses in a tournament. Here's my idea:\n\nYou have been falsely accused of treasonous acts against the supreme ruler of the universe. Your sentence is to spend the rest of eternity in the Void Colosseum which orbits around a black hole on the outskirts of the solar system. It is essentially a prison where the most dangerous of criminals are sent to fight each other in an endless tournament. The only way out is to make it to the finals and defeat the prison's most powerful opponent. The prisoners are affected by a curse that activates upon death. Their minds are sent back in time to before the fight they died in. You must fight against various monsters, bounty hunters, war machines, demigods, and interstellar beings to make your way up.\n\nSince you are a normal human, you start off with zero combat experience. The most you are given is a dull blade and broken armor. As you fight and die, you gain abilities and combat experience. For example, successfully dodging enough attacks will increase the speed and distance of your dodges, and landing attacks with your weapon will eventually increase that weapon's attack power and speed. As you win more fights, the combatants will become increasingly harder to fight and you will eventually come across an unstoppable opponent who will effortlessly destroy you no matter how much skill you gained from previous fights. At this point, your only two choices are to fight forever, or try to find a way to break the system."
oe12cr,Car-racing MOBA - Dream MOBA combination!," \n\nAlright so here goes my concept of this game.\n\n**Base game** \- Although it would have some futuristic elements, the game would feature open-world realistic elements, cars, destruction etc. Think of the base game as Forza Horizon 4 where the graphics are an eye-candy. So let's take Forza Horizon 4 as the base game.\n\n**Let's add the MOBA flavor now** \-\n\n1. The game would feature laps-based racing on various tracks (similar to FH4)\n2. When a match is found, you'll select from a list of cars (similar to Champions selection screen in League of Legends or any other MOBA)\n3. These cars have their own passive + 2 abilities + 1 ultimate.\n4. The match could feature up to 10 laps (could be variable as per the ""fun factor"").\n5. When a lap ends, there will be a 15-second freeze (the screen would gray out), quickly giving you options to amp up your gear. The car at the first place would earn more gold than the others and so on. This would feature - a) Leveling up your ability (you can choose to level up one of your 2 abilities, or ultimate ability after the 5th lap) b) Adding a tweak to your car (handling, acceleration, transmission, top speed etc.) c) To give the trailing cars a chance, they will be given a package of nitro boost, with the car at the last place having the most nitro boost. Use the nitro wisely!\n6. If you wreck another car during a lap, you get more gold! So even if you're at the last place, you have more chances to get gold, get stronger and push to the first place.\n7. After the end of every lap, cars heal themselves with 500 health.\n8. Cars also suffer collision damage (from other cars/environment) which means you would need to drive efficiently as well (duh! it's racing after all!). Collision damage from cars is called 'ram damage' = 100 damage (but can be modified by cars' abilities).\n\nWin condition - At the end of the 10 laps or so, the car that crosses the finishing line wins!\n\n**Game modes** \- Given this concept, the game could also feature- 5v5 team-based racing- Destruction derby\n\n**Cars ideas** \- (inspired from Twisted Metal series)\n\n**Spectre ""The Special Weapon"" (1200 health)**\n\nPassive - Whenever Spectre is tail-gaiting behind a car, it gains a drafting boost, giving it more speed as the drafting continues.  \nQ (12 seconds cooldown) - Spectre goes in auto-pilot for 4 seconds taking full-control of the car. If in range of the car ahead, the auto-pilot would tail-gate to gain a drafting boost and fire a heat missile dealing 150 damage.  \nW (10 seconds cooldown) - Spectre fires a shock missile directly ahead hitting the first car and locking it's steering for 2 seconds. During this time the affected car cannot steer left or right.  \nUltimate - Spectre fires a homing missile locking on to any target ahead of him and dealing 500 + 10% of the missing health as damage. A small HUD would appear to select a target car ahead of Spectre.\n\n**Outlaw ""The SWAT Unit"" (1400 health)**\n\nPassive - Outlaw can issue ""tickets"" to high speeding cars by ramming into them. If Outlaw rams into a car speeding over 60 mph (96 kph), it issues a ""ticket"". When a car stacks over 4 tickets, it suffers a sudden speed loss to 30 mph and is dealt with 200 damage.  \nQ (10 seconds cooldown) - When in range of the car ahead, Outlaw activates it's siren initiating a chase towards that car and gaining +20 mph speed. If Outlaw rams into the car during this time, it issues 2 tickets (can stack with passive).  \nW (9 seconds cooldown) - Outlaw throws a spike strip behind it's path. If a car runs over the spike strip, the speed would decay -20 mph/second for 2.5 seconds and dealing 250 damage.  \nUltimate - Outlaw sounds a loud siren for 2 seconds after which all the cars speeding over 80 mph suffer a sudden shock, slowing the speed down by -40 mph, dealing 400 damage and issuing a ticket.\n\n**Hammerhead ""The Monster"" (1800 health)**\n\nPassive - Hammerhead has slower speed than other cars but +150 more basic damage (ram damage).  \nQ (8 seconds cooldown) - Hammerhead throws a short-range hook directly ahead. If a car is hooked for 2 seconds, Hammerhead pulls it briefly before ramming into it (100+150 damage).  \nW (10 seconds cooldown) - Hammerhead extends out a long steel barricade for 3 seconds, attached to it's back preventing cars to overtake from left or right.  \nUltimate - Hammerhead turns on the MONSTER mode for 6 seconds, gaining +30 mph speed, +400 ram damage on first hit. If the first hit wrecks the enemy car, an extra 2 seconds are added to the MONSTER mode."
odybbb,Lucky &amp; Wild VR,"Not sure if anyone ever played the old arcade game ""[Lucky &amp; Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OOP-1WHSKE)"" but it was a pretty unique arcade game that would be a great concept to port to VR. \n\nThe main player focuses on driving but also has a handgun to fight back if playing alone. The coop player sits shotgun and also has a handgun.\n\nThe VR version could expand on the abilities of the passenger. With a convertible that player could be launching rocket launchers out the roof."
odw6ys,Twitch enabled horror game,"Just a stray 4th wall breaking mechanic that I just thought of, not a full scale idea.\n\nA horror game, possibly concerning the ghost of someone your character killed (for whatever reason) that can detect if you're streaming the game and will join your twitch chat as a bot and haunt you with creepy messages that directly relate to your gameplay."
odvfzu,Survival Horror Game Where You Get to do Actual Work,"Okay, so this is going to sound a bit cliche but I have attached a link to this post which shows a demonstration of how a VR environment can be used  for work [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrHWZVMugo&amp;ab\_channel=RedStapler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrHWZVMugo&amp;ab_channel=RedStapler)\n\nNow imagine if someone could implement a survival horror game such as FNAF where you have to stay in one place whilst also being able to interact with your work environment. Some problems of course would be trying to concentrate whilst also being on edge for potential jumpscares. But it was just an idea I would like to share.   \n\n\nIf anyone has other ideas for VR office spaces it would be cool if you wrote them down below\n\nThanks!"
odu9kc,The walking dead: walkers world,"The basic idea is that it's an open world extreme survival game\n\nYou create your own character and give them different attributes (similar to fallouts S.P.E.C.I.A.L system) with fitting choices to the world  and theme \n\nThe game would take place (if it were possible) a almost full scale America\n\nClans can be made \nAs well as camps/facilities which can be made with recourses found in the world \nNPC's can be gained from helping them in cities etc. And gaining them to your base would be an option\n\nIf enough Npc survivors can be found you can start trading arrangements with other clans , but things can go wrong with these trips as they are Npc ran so natural occurrences could happen such as problems like walker attacks or other multiplayer people/ clans attack the vehicles the NPCs use \n\nYou could start trading gear with clans without using the game feature of using NPC's, for safer negotiations but the Npc trading drives are just to save the player time \n\nResources could be very hard to find but farming and engineering can be done by using either NPC's or using your characters own skills \n\nUnlike later seasons walkers will be common to see as many games like dayz have zombies but they are never a threat due to them being mostly non apparent in gameplay \n\nEventually herds of walkers will start to appear but they will mostly be on highway areas \n\nWalkers will mostly be attracted to players due to noise mostly game chat or gun shots \n\nAs places such as camps when so much game chat starts eventually walkers will be attracted\n\nCars will be a huge part of this game as unlike in most games storage is reflected in a realistic manner and travel will take long amounts of time travelling to long distance locations \n\nMost if not all cars are fully built when a server is started but over time people will start taking parts such as tires and batteries, fuel will be hard to find (not as hard as dayZ as it's near impossible to use cars) \n\nIn gameplay unless NPC's or online players are killed in a head location they will eventually turn (online players won't have control of the walker version of them) \n\nThat's basically it, this is a game that would basically only be possible in a perfect world 😅😅 but it's still a cool idea I wanted to share please don't hate"
odszix,SMALL CREATURES survival game,"all survival games need a gimmick dinosaur, post-apocalypse, zombies again.. and much more\n\nbut for the longest time, I have always wanted a survival game based on the creatures you would find in your back garden and living the hidden lives of those animals. I thought the idea of playing as an animal was dead in the water as for years nobody ever picked up the idea until The isle game along no doubt helped by the new boom in dinosaurs media. But unfortunately, bugs and little creatures aren't as interesting, and projects that attempt to make survival games based on such a premise but with arthropods as the main focus often get ruined. a few examples were insect kingdom where the dev demanded 100,000 to finish the game despite providing bare bones and in my opinion, unengaging and terrible game mechanics and Ant simulator which had all its funding spent away by shady people who apparently betrayed the lead developer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\napparently, the universe hates this idea but new hope came when I saw the trailer for grounded only to realize your not gonna play as bugs but a bunch of annoying kids. So you know what I'm gonna issue a challenge to develop a survival game set in the undergrowth WHERE YOU DON""T PLAY AS HUMANS but as insects hell at this point id be fine with playing as a rat.\n\nAnd here are some ideas\n\n1. don't make it a 3rd person game I know it's tempting but trust me making it 3rd person robs the game of its true scale. though this prospect might get confusing for walking up walls (which insects tend to do) don't worry Natural selection2 tackled this problem brilliantly where they fixed the camera of the player so they wouldn't be disorientated. If you want a terrible example of this look at alien vs predator and watch an alien playthrough (you might get motion sickness).\n\n2. add multiplayer, why ? well, we already have singleplayer only games where you play as bugs deadly creatures, Badmojo, and others unless your game is gonna have a revolutionary groundbreaking story living in an empty world filled with bots is incredibly boring and your game will die.\n\n3. add progression, whether it be insect growth to adulthood or possibly even upgrading your skills(possibly through an RPG system or skill tree) players need a reason to keep playing a goal to reach.\n\n4. ACTUALLY RESEARCH INSECTS AND OTHER ARTHROPODS, there are so many interesting creatures out there that get left out because ""we want big spider"" or ""ant cool"" look at other creatures for example\n\ndragonflies fast and quick aerial predators that can hover but as babies, they live underwater as predators, there are assassin bugs that literally collect hundreds of bug corpses on their backs as armor, there are spiders that can walk on water, the bombardier beetle can light an explosive reaction so hot it cooks ants alive, there are so many other gimmicks to add to make VARIED GAMEPLAY instead of ""haha ant crawl up the wall"".\n\n4. ADD MOVEMENT OPTIONS, people love moving why do you think rocket jumping became such a beloved feature, bugs can fly run up walls dig underground, and jump. \n\n5. you need bots, your game needs to be able to be fun even without a huge player base which unfortunately for a premise like this will probably be the case because pussies will be too scared to play because ""spiders are so scary"" so adding bot enemies like roaming spiders or an ant nest full of aggressive ants that players could raid is important.\n\nso far these are my ideas and grievances with the genre I don't know if ill ever live to see such an idea happen since too many people think bugs are icky and would rather step on them than take the time to understand them let alone play as them in a videogame."
ods2r9,How would you make a online flash game (not really a game idea rather just something I can never figure out a answer to),"The closest I've seen is just slowing down other people, which really isn't ideal. But then again you can't actually just ""make it"" because that's you know.. impossible."
odk90o,Word guessing game but with pronunciation,"the gameplay goes so you would see a word but it's instead written how it's pronounced. For example,  Hello would be həˈloʊ and so on. I am still not sure what could make it more interesting and hope to get suggestions from the comments"
odjdzx,Looking for a puzzle game idea,Anybody have an idea for a puzzle / strategy game?
odj0yy,I was listening to Machine Head and Slipknot when I had an idea...,"Action based game set in South America during the time of the conquistadors. From a once well established township, that has fallen into ruin due to small pox, a young lady, daughter of a shaman steps up for her people. He sends her on a quest to drive back the conquistadors on his dieing breath. (Small pox would be depicted as a curse brought on by the westerners.)  \n\n\nShe heads through the jungle to the next nearest village/town that has apparently been ransacked. (insert combat tutorial vs wildlife). She would have eaten a hallucigen that the warriors in her tribe use before a hunt/battle. So the walk down would get progressively more distorted/trippy on her way. When she arrives at the village that is being occupied by conquistadors she sees (insert all horrible things they are doing) them as half man/demon things due to her hallucingens. Heavy metal music such as Slipknot - Distasterpiece type will be playing. Combat would be arena style very similar to Senua's Sacrifice as I feel the pacing and weight of it would suit the setting.\n\nExploration should be limited, giving the player a very linear path like Senua's Sacrifice, Tomb Raider, Uncharted to allow for set piece scenes and space for cinematic story. This isn't the type of game where you want your character to be running 24/7. Atmosphere is key. Running in combat environments, sure but otherwise no.\n\nAs the character takes the psychedelic warrior brew, the jungle will grow darker/more hellish as the character is NOT having a happy fun time. Whilst making the environment blurry perhaps, it should make entities/interactable items pop out, even maybe glow to represent the hyper focus from that state of mind.  \n\n\nIn her journey she will have visions of her father guiding her, the environments get more and more surreal as the game goes on, it ends in her actually driving them back (alternate history much). At some point she finds a historic/legendary weapon. Keep time span of the story vague.\n\nEvery town can be approached with stealth or warrior smash style. Stealth involves sneaking and ranged weapons (poison blow dart? Bow?) and take downs and hiding the bodies. Some towns will be easier to stealth or to just leeroy.  \n\n\nPsychedelic drugs restore her health but here is the caveat. There are different endings, depending on if she took minimal amounts of psychedelics or insanely heavy amounts. The best outcome is she pushes back the conquistadors and made Queen or something for her efforts. The middle one, is she pushes them back, but her own people banish her at the end because she is too scarred from the experience making her violent/crazy. The worst outcome is that she took so much damage that she ignored during the playthrough that the moment she beats the last mission, she falls to the floor, dieing of her injuries."

odiiz8,I an building a FFA shooter inside a game called Crayta. Any mechanic ideas?,My idea is a shooter where you collect 'energy crystals' which spawn randomly acrosd the map and the first player to collect 5 crystals wins. Crayta is an online platform like Roblox or Core. Does anyone have any ideas for mechanics?
odi4q7,My first concept,"  \n\nMy first concept. Please share your opinion and tell me how this concept could be improved.\n\n*(Sorry in advance for possible mistakes in spelling, as English is not my native language)* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot basis** \n\nOn December 26, 1991, Lenin wakes up in one of the Khrushchevka flat. In an attempt to prevent the collapse of the USSR, he moves between the rooms of a large and spacious Khrushchevka (about 14 rooms per level), using fists and improvised means, engages in battle with people who send both real personalities and characters from Soviet films and other fictional characters (for example Cheburashka). In the last room, a boss battle awaits him, after which, instead of preventing the collapse of the USSR, he is pulled to the upper floor (in the past several years ago). Each of the floors personifies a certain era of the USSR, depending on the ruler. And on every floor, Lenin is trying to save socialism. In the course of the plot, the player only has to find out why Lenin woke up in Khrushchevka, and what awaits him on the top floor when he gets to 1917 year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genre**\n\nRoguelike, top view, drawing - pixel art, soundtrack - sovietwave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**References:** \n\nMoving between paneled rooms in Khrushchevka flat as moving between rooms in ""Binding of Isaac"". \n\nFrom the same Isaac, the idea of constant descent into the underground is reversed, since time goes in the opposite order, from the collapse of the USSR to its appearance, then Lenin ascends through the floors, and does not descend. \n\nThe combat system is similar to ""Hotline Miami"", in addition to fists, you can use improvised items, and sometimes firearms. \n\nAlso, as references for drawing, you can refer to such beautiful games as Noita or Graveyard keeper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be glad to hear your opinion on the concept. Tell me what could be added to the game."
ode7ay,Mechanics ideas for current game,"So I have a locomotion setup I need ideas to slow down the player as he/she attempts to reach end checkpoint.\nI have security cameras that close exits to your current room when detected, which you have to find the control panel to unlock and door and temporarily disable cameras.

oddv77,The world is in desperate need of a game where you play animals in a medieval setting,"It doesn't matter if it is fantasy or not, but for example, I think a game where you and your buds, as wolves, raid a human's wagon on a road. The humans could be AI or normal people But I think It would be incredibly fun, especially sense there could be birds or rats in city biome and larger animals or even herds of bison in the wild's. Basically the isle with normal animals and humans in an era were animals could actually compete with us, and often win. I think the world just needs more survival animal games in general though because they're so much fun and it's still a pretty new genre!"

odc9j4,Looking for some criticism and ideas for my NSFW game!,"I'm currently working on writing a NSFW twine game with a medieval theme. It's going to be low-fantasy, with subdued magic elements and a dark vibe as well as lots of fetishes. I've kind of hit a writers block and am curious to see what people think so far, what they've got for ideas, and whatever else in regards to input they'd have. So here's a general idea of what I have so far. All feedback is appreciated!\n\n\nAbout you, the player:\n\nYou grew up in the walled city of Agara, and have never left. The outside world is unknown. Rumors speak of larger cities and unspeakable horrors that lurk in the forest. You are 18 years old now and have always been on your own. You've lived off the streets as a beggar. You had a family once, but your parents mysteriously disappeared when you were 5. You have no family here and are completely alone.\n\n\nThe City of Agara (uh-gar-uh)\n\nDescription:\n\nThe city of Agara is a small, walled city built in the hills of the grass lands just outside the forest. Most notable for its scenery and smell, Agara houses lots of wood fires, creating a very smokey and well-lit impression. Homes here are primarily built of wood and stone; the poor live in shacks of low quality wood, whereas the rich live in homes of cobblestone and durable, stripped wood.

on6evb,"Part MMO, Part Dungeon Crawler, Part Crafting, Part Shop Tycoon","My absolute dream game is super duper simple and chill. I just wanna be able to run my own tavern, man. That's all. And have weary adventurers come in and chat with me while I craft up their healing items/buffs for them to either take with them, or recover.\n\nSo whenever I daydream about how I'd want this game to work out, players could choose what they want to do. You could be an adventurer, and go dungeon diving for loot and and cool weapons and armor and hang out with your pals on your quests. Adventurer types get a totally customizable 'hideout' in the neverending dungeons below the earth, and you can amp up and decorate it with cool stuff you find. You can either make your hideout public or private, and if it's public people can come across it at random while adventuring and take a little breather. But you specifically cannot store food or supplies in these hideouts indefinitely, as there is always a chance pests will sneak in and eat everything (no matter what you do, dungeon rats will always get in and steal your snacks), and so you always need to go back up to restock or prepare for your next dive.\n\nOr, you could be the classic NPC type character, who instead forages above ground for ingredients and materials for your tavern. NPC types get an inn/tavern instead of a hideout, and can totally customize it as well, with cool stuff you build rather than find or win from bosses. You level up your crafting and cooking skills, and learn to make potions and rations and meals that can heal, buff, or debuff. NPCs can set their taverns to public or private too, and if they're set to public, then adventurers coming up for air from the dungeons can come across them at random (or if they've got yours favorited they can zoom right there).\nIf you happen to be online at the same time ab adventurer comes across your tavern, you can chat, or roleplay, or whatever, and haggle prices and deals or trade for cool furniture/custom stuff to put in your tavern, or super rare ingredients for recipes or craftables. If you are offline and they come across your tavern, they just see the listed prices of what you made and put up in stock, and they can purchase stuff.\nNPCs can also choose to put a limit on how many items one person can buy from them so they don't get cleared out for future adventurers while they're offline.\n\nObviously this has a lot of room for improvement and way more cool features and stuff, and I've obviously never made a game in my life, but this sounds like it'd be fun for me to play at least. So maybe someone else will think it's fun too!"

omxe54,Animal / Creature Breeding - Game Idea,"**Game Idea based on realistic animal breeding simulation focused on Genetics.** \n\nHey guys, I am thinking more and more about games that I miss in my life the last few years. The answer to that is everything around Animal Simulation: 1) Animal Breeding and Genetics Development and/or 2) Veterinary based Games. \n\nThose did exist in some ways, but they are extremely old and not satisfying to play anymore (if they even work on Windows 10). Sadly I am nowhere near understanding how to Develop my own Game, therefore I hope someone will pick this up - because the request is actually quite big if you google it. \n\n**Concept**\n\nA single-player game (more advanced version: online to trade animals) based on simulation of animal care &amp; breeding, mainly for adult players. You start on a small farm, which you can upgrade in terms of size and different houses over playtime/achievements - you will be provided with 2 starter stables for 2 animals and one breeding house. At the beginning of the game you pick your starter animal race (inspired by the starter Pokemon :p) - I am thinking of: Horses, Dogs, Cats, Chicken etc. It doesn't have to be animals that usually live on a farm, to make the breeding more interesting. \n\n**Idea Size**\n\nIt depends on your motivation - this idea almost infinitely scalable. \n\nSmall: No animations but pictures, simple button clicks for taking care, breeding &amp; stuff. Genetics are not too detailed.\n\nMiddle: Focus on a detailed Genetics system similar to a Science Tree in a strategic game (currently thinking of CIV where it develops over time).\n\nBig: Animations and/or detailed pictures of the animals which all look different in a way. Include an online market to trade the animals. \n\n**Why** \n\nI googled a lot around this idea - currently there doesn't exist a game which fulfills the above purpose in any kind of way. ""Ark"" is probably the game which is the closest to the idea but yet far away. And: The request is definitely there! So many people are requesting this type of games because they all remember simple games when being a kid around this game mechanic. With today's quality of games there is so much possible around this idea - also the design should be realistic (no manga/anime style pls) and should target the teenager/ adult group.\n\n**My Input**  \nIf someone is interested in that I'd definitely love to chat further about this idea, because there is so much more in my mind. \n\nAlso: If you are really interested in doing this - I could actually help regarding the marketing of the game because I do work in that field. \n\n  \nLove to hear your ideas and feedback. Thank you in advance!  \nP.s: Yes, I did check almost every potential game - nothing is close to what I am looking for. There is always something that doesn't work out well for me."

Get killed by a Grandma. Die while under 3 different Damage over Time effects. Die from a Christmas Tree. Die from falling for over 30 seconds. Die in your own home. Beat the entire game in one life only to die at the final boss.\n\nIt starts to become a puzzle game as you try and figure out how to best kick the bucket in increasingly stupid ways all for those sweet, sweet achievements."
omn89t,"Turn-based, multiplayer LEGO castle defense game with custom traps","The main idea came from a game we played IRL with a childhood friend, but I'm confident it could be built into a video-game. The game is basically like the title says; A turn-based, multiplayer LEGO game in a medieval setting, where each side has a castle to defend as well as troops to siege the other player's castle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MAIN GOAL:**  \nPlayers must siege the opponent's castle, go through it, overcoming any obstacle they put on the path, and obtain their flag to win the game. However since both sides have a castle on their own, the player's attention should also be set on their own castle, as the opponent will try to do the same. It's a fight against time and cleverly placed traps (which I'll get into in a second), with lots of strategy options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RESOURCES:**  \nThe player is given a set amount of resources, and each item, trap or soldier has a value to them. A player may choose to have a basic castle with lots of soldiers and siege weapons, or have an elaborate castle with multiple, deadly traps, but with very limited troops to attack. The player can have multiple builds, for whatever strategy they want to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE CASTLE:**  \nThe player can choose from different, pre-built castles, but they are strongly encouraged to build one themselves. For faster building I'd think it would be better to use several built aspects, rather than building a castle up from individual blocks like IRL, but if it's feasible, there could be an option for players to build from scratch.\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous part, the player is given a resource number, and can use them up as they see fit. For example, they have 1000 resources, and a simple gate costs 5, but a more elaborate gate with a moat surrounding the whole castle might cost 100. Of course the latter would be harder to get through for the opponent and different parts would require different siege weapons or strategies.\n\nThe castle can also have multiple floors, traps and many obstacles in them. One could build a maze, so the attacking players will have to find a way out, but they could just lure the enemy team into a room with gold, where a pressure sensitive tile would lock the door behind them. The possibilities can be as endless as LEGO itself, but naturally this would require a lot of testing and balancing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE GAME:**  \nThe game would start with each player choosing a build (castle+soldiers). Then your build is revealed for the other player and then they are given a small amount of additional resources, and the chance to *slightly* alter their troops and siege weapons if necessary, but they cannot alter their castle. The players will only see the opponents castle from the outside and the soldiers they've put outside the castle for attacking. Anything inside, be them traps or more soldiers will remain unseen for the opponent until later in the game.\n\nAfter the preparation phase the battle begins, the player with fewer used resources will start. In the first couple of rounds it's just moving towards the other player's castle, and choosing the strategy. Maybe sending a troop to flank, setting up choke-points, etc. If two opposing troops are in vicinity of each other a battle can begin.\n\nThis is the part that is not yet clear for me, as this would require a lot of testing, but we played this in a way that in one round each side can have a set amount of moves (I remember doing 2 things per round). So one side can choose to move one unit closer and then attack, or attack from further away, which will lower the chance of success but then they can attack a second time. Obviously, later in the game this will get more complicated as the players will have to move closer to the other player's flag, defend their own by setting up traps (oh yes, using a trap will also take up moves, they could use all the moves a player has in one round if it's a very elaborate trap), and still fighting in the battlefield at the same time. So the pressure sensitive tile I mentioned has to be activated by the player, otherwise it will ""malfunction"". This part is more close to chess I think, because if Player A forces a move out of Player B on the other side of the battlefield, then A can go inside the room for the treasure, without risking their lives.\n\nThe game ends when one's flag is captured or a castle can't be protected anymore (no more soldiers and only non-lethal traps remain in the castle). We played it like classic capture the flag, so we'd have to take the enemy's flag back inside our own castle, but I think it would just further complicate things now, as well as artificially prolonging the endgame. But maybe some testing can prove me otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my idea I've had since I found parts of my castle back at my parent's place while cleaning. I almost completely forgot this game we played as children, but now that they are dusted off, there's a lot of nice memories. One day I'd like to see this game in a video-game setting, so the few LEGOs I had as a child wouldn't restrict me that much on what I can build. Needless to say, this can be a very large project, even AAA if it includes tons of assets. (However, I'd assume using LEGO can cut down a lot of cost and work, since the building blocks are already set, and easy to use shapes, but I don't know anything about game development, so I could be astonishingly wrong here...) It would also require lots of testing, balancing and such, as I mentioned above.\n\nThe saddest part - for me anyways - is that I don't have any experience in game making, so I won't be able to make this idea into reality, at least not for a couple of years. However the idea kept me awake at several nights now, so by writing it down here may give me some sort of relief.\n\nThanks for reading."
ommshz,A rallye (racing) game with random generated tracks,"My idea is a racing game in which the goal is to reach the finish point as quickly as possible (like in hillclimb or rallye racing). The comparison with other players should take place through online high scores. The trick that should distinguish this game from others is that the tracks cannot be practised in advance: You get one chance. No resetting, no reloading, nothing. \n\nThe basis for this would be, on the one hand, that the track cannot be selected in advance, but only one track is possible at a time and, on the other hand, a huge basic number of tracks. To really increase the number of tracks, they should be generated by the computer. With the help of machine learning, the players could also be used to teach the computer to generate ""good"" tracks by asking for a rating on the track after a race. If the track is literally undriveable, no other player has to try it."

omljq4,Old-School-Zombie New-School-Sandbox Multiplayer,"**Core Concept**\n\nA sandbox game wherein zombies infest the world, threatening the players with their numbers, much like the zombie movies of the past, instead of with an abundance of special variants. Players will choose a primary class upon character creation, and can later choose a handful of minor traits from other classes to round out their builds. Each player will have 1 life, but can be revived through a few special means. Upon death, a players will spawn on the outskirts of a new server, as a new character. They will retain a special in-game currency to allow players who achieved a lot in their previous playthroughs to get started quickly in their new server. Players can then compete to see how long they can survive.\n\n**Location**\n\nAt first there would only be 1 map. Each map would have carefully crafted POIs but the contents would be semi-randomized. Ideally, new maps would be released occasionally. Players would be randomly assigned a location then (attempting to mimic IRL where people do not choose where they start). Since the players would change, but the maps wouldn't, the worlds will continue to evolve differently over time. Perhaps players who died in a world at one time might return to that same world randomly as a different character later, exploring what is familiar to them and how things have changed.\n\n**Community Enforcement**\n\nA concept like this does not work without either de-incentivizing negative behavior or making positive behavior profitable. PVP would need to be opt-in. However, the sandbox/survival elements of the game should be challenging enough that players recognize the necessity of working together.  \n\n\nIts possible this is too verbose or not creative enough. I've never written a game idea out before. I just liked the feel of fighting of hoards in Dead Rising, I'm a fan of old zombie films, and I like the sandbox elements of games like 7 Days to Die but feel like there's very poor incentive to keep playing at the very late stages. I've never developed a game before, but I have 3 years of Java full stack experience in the field and a BS in comp sci, so I at least know my way around some 1s and 0s"

om0t9h,A gathering mechanic where you pay off sprites (or similar) to gain auto loot.,"I'm starting to see a lot of magic game ideas and I love it! The thing with magic games is that they usually get conflated with survival games because alchemy requires reagents which requires gathering. I was thinking to myself, ""How do you gather stuff in a cool magical way that doesn't feel like you're a scrub who's picking up endless chicken nuggets?"" The answer is minions!  \n\n\nBut then there's one step further: what if you start out by scrambling to pick up stuff because these damn pests keep stealing everything, but then later you realize you can use that to your advantage in order to gain autoloot? It could also create the cool feels of shipping off supply crates to your base like MGSV. Maybe you exchange a certain reagent or drink a certain potion and suddenly this thing you're fighting becomes a really useful tool."

oly0mg,Creating Devil/demon/archangel family for my fighting game,"Im trying to figure a way to create these protagonists for my fighting game. The main protagonist is the first born son from a devil mother and wizard father, the two other siblings are either born from the same mother or from a different mother. The wizard father hates his first born due to the fact he was born with this demon bloodline from his mother and rejects him as well as the other siblings reject him. Would this make more sense if his two siblings were not from the same devil/demon mother?\n\nAnd the first born son would be average height, while his two younger siblings would be very tall. But they are all within human height, kind of like Lucifer Morningstar and his siblings, does this make sense? I just want the bio of these characters to be plausible enough."

olxc65,A balanced game idea,"I don’t have any story or anything, it’s just a mechanic I though up. The game would have a single player, PvE co op, and a PvP multiplayer.

It tricks players into playing nice with each other so they can do better against each other. The multiplayer is where the exp comes fast to level you up, increasing stats to do better in co op and get better items and it all repeats itself!"

olvojq,D&amp;D Inspired Wizards Journey to become an arch mage with a magical tower,"So, I've been randomly thinking of this for a while while zoned out at like 1 am. And while, all of this will never happen I just wanted to get it into the aether. Like the Secret or some shit. \n\nSo, 30,000 foot view. The game would be closer to mages in D&amp;D(and associated lit). You have to study. You can only use your spells so often. Etc. Etc. The game would follow you as you travel from a journey mage to an arch mage with a tower. You would quest for materials, spell books, artifacts, and the like. You would need to study. Studying new spell books has a cost. Performing rituals has a cost. . You create items, enchantment, and Summons. You hit major milestones in the game and age and mastery. As you age, your base stats and abilities change. As your masteries change you can study higher level spell books and perform higher level magics. You do this while building your tower(details about the tower have been omitted for brevity. I'm obsessed with Wizard towers). Everything you do will increase your age. Some spells might advance it more. Some might reverse it to some degree. Those spells might be too expensive morally. \n\nGameplay is pretty simplistic. Think Hades style look and feel(graphics unimportant). Persona style ""time advances when you do x"" mechanic. But far less rigid. Side quests would be procedurally generated based on what you're doing. Tower upgrades would be handled via game progress and standard game ""upgrading building"" type mechanics. You stop time. Choose your spell to cast and how and then hopefully that spell completes before your enemy gets to you. Or you use a bevy of magical equipment you find and make. \n\nLike, I could keep going but when would I stop. But, basically that's it."
olqr2e,A space war game where you live the life of a fighter pilot,"Feel free to use this idea, or to add to it.\n\nThe game that I envision revolves around a war between humans and an alien species. These games are common, but what I imagine goes into so much detail that you feel like you’re there. You a fighter pilot, live on a huge international space station, and go out on combat missions. However, this game involves you living your life. You meet people on board the space station, have a small apartment, have relationships, go shopping, watch the news, etc.\n\nStory: The year is 2093, and we’re out amongst the stars.  Not too far though. We’ve been a few hundred light years from Earth.  In our travels, we found a solar system that was abandoned by some alien species long ago.  Since there’s no one living there, we move in and begin colonizing worlds. Unfortunately, midway through our colonization efforts, an alien species arrives.  They’re the ones that abandoned this star system, and they tell us that they still own it and want us all to leave. It’s hard to just pack up and go home at this point, because there are already around 100,000 humans living on various planets and moons. Furthermore, when they arrived, there were only a handful of abandoned installations on a few planets, so the aliens’ claim of ownership seemed pretty weak.  We try to negotiate, and recommend that we share it, and they reject our offer. A war follows.\n\nCombat:  To beat the game, you need to complete many combat missions.  You typically won’t go out alone. You’ll be part of a team.  Also, you won’t mow down scores of enemy ships like you do in most spaceship fighting games. Enemy fighters are about as strong as allied fighters.  They’re shielded just like you, and taking down one enemy fighter will take some time. It’ll be a little bit like a WW2 dogfight.  Your fighter shoots blasts of energy which drain the battery, so there is a re-charge time after numerous shots. You also carry a limited number of bombs for the bombing missions, and only a few missiles which you will need to use wisely.  The movement is 3-D, and the view can either be 3rd person or 1st person from the cockpit.  While you’re are in a team during combat, don’t think that you can just fly around and wait for your friends to take out all the enemies. The game should be programmed so that your squad mates fight about as well as you are fighting.\n\nMissions:  I recommend about 100 missions.  Some will be simply fighting with enemy pilots. Others will be bombing missions, defensive missions, escort missions where you protect allied cargo ships, or information gathering missions.\n\nThe space station:  It’s huge. It’s the size of a small city with people from many different nations, and is located in the periphery of the contested star system.  The station is shaped like a gigantic disc. It spins, so there is artificial gravity.  You can find just about everything here: Apartments, grocery stores, movie theaters, restaurants, schools, etc.  You live here, and between missions you can take all the time you want to travel around, do things, and meet people. You can even have relationships and get married, but you and your fellow fighter pilots can be killed, so you may want to think twice about getting too emotionally attached to another pilot.  Only about 10% of the people on board are military.\n\nVictory:  There are two possible endings. One is where the alien military is defeated and they withdraw from the star system. The other is where a truce is reached, and our two species agree to share the star system.  Midway through the game, you will have an optional mission to rescue alien civilians from a doomed ship. If you do this, then it will be a show of compassion and respect, even during a war. After this, the war continues, but the option for a diplomatic victory will be available.  Right before the final mission of the game, your commander will ask you which outcome is preferable. By then, you would be a famous and respected pilot, so your input would be valuable. For the conquest victory, you simply destroy all enemy craft, but for the diplomatic one, only military craft are targets.  The final boss of the game is a huge robot, which must be defeated regardless of which ending you’re aiming for.\n\nGame modes: Easy , medium, and hard. In the easy mode, the enemy pilots are dummies and go down easily. On medium, the two sides are equally weighted. On hard, the enemy pilots are awesome and very hard to kill. If you die, you must re-start the mission, unless you choose the ‘permadeath’ option, in while case death ends the game.\n\nOther:  Games can be saved.  At the beginning of the game, you can choose the gender, ethnicity, appearance, and nationality of your pilot.  The aliens look a little bit like porcupines with two arms and legs, and they come from an adjacent star system."

olh652,Horror game concept idea.,"This is from a dream that i had and i liked the idea of it, just placing it here in case someone wants to use it, is just a dream so mostly of the things might not make sense anyway. \n\nbasically  you begin is a room with 3 doors, at first you cannot move your mouse so you're looking at a single door (like a point and click) once you step in you get a lantern, you can walk around and move the mouse around (the idea here is to make the player pick up the flashlight at the very begin, because it will be important for look around  in the dark and see the other doors) as you look in the dark you can see the other 2 doors, but you also see a hallway at your left, sounds like the wind if blowing there, on your right has another door, but there is the living room, once you step in you have the acess the kitchen, where you get batteries for your lantern, since it was a dream i dont remember much of the other rooms, but was like a house.\n\nwhat i remember is that sometimes some limb parts fly to the hallway, you can pick up them but once you drop they will fly again, and your mission is to rescue the people inside because has an entity in the house, who is trying to collect the bodies part and make some kind of ritual or just to feed a monster on the end of hallway, thats why the ""wind"" is actually the monster breathing.\n\nThis entity has 3 forms \n\n1. the watcher, white eyes watching you from distance, it also can be used to know with direction he will be coming.\n2. the follower, it will follow you around the house, but only when you turn around it jumpscare you, after few minutes he is gone, you can tell by his respiration behide you, and if you hear something breaking it might be it. (if you stop walking it wont help, he will get more and more closer to you, so keep walking).\n3.  the killer, that he kills the other people in the house, you can avoid it trying to hide they inside of some places, such as closet, under bed, etc, you can tell that he is going to attack by some screams that you can hear on background.\n\nso far, i remember had 3 people in the house, one of them were a fat granny that act like a karen (i also remember that you could take ""weapons"" to defend yourself, such as a pan and you could hit the granny with it, she would be mad at you and would run away from you, staying near that hallway, exposed for the entity) she would refuse to hide and only would hide if her husband say so, but to make her husband to do it, you need to ask to his daughter to talk to him (who is your wife) and since theyre in different rooms they would walk around the house too. (something similar to that other game from imscared creator, that you need to find the people and murder them, but in this case you need to rescue them)\n\nfor the game design, i imagine something pixelated, like imscared or power drill massacre, with 3d and low design, and the game name would be ""The three doors"" and just in case, no the game isnt a whole dream, this entity exist in the house and is attacking the neighborns and it finally came to your house to kill your family/feed the monster."
olgyoo,Strategy/skill based multiplayer shooter game,"Idea:\nA team of 4 have to defend the VIP(npc) while 2 player compete to kill the VIP. VIP will have random tasks they will do. To keep things simple make, let there be only one VIP with repeated rounds. There will be other NPCs in the area so the killers can hide(like hitman).\n\n\nStyle:\nTop down or isometric topdown like Tokyo 42. Can be futuristic, normal or noir-style, but location must be a public area.\n\n\nMechanics:\n\n\nFor the team of 4: can only buy a weapon for each at the start of the round. With more points they get in game, they can improve their weapons, shield strength and surveillance. Surveillance include more surveillance cameras and security scanner at the entrance.\n\nFor the 2 hitman: they will be competing to kill the VIP. They can buy 2 weapons at the start of the round or a weapon &amp; an item. Item include map, the VIP tasks, grenades, bombs and etc. They can dress up as npc like in hitman but they need to be careful so no player sees them.\n\n\nNote: most will think that if the 4 player surrounds the VIP, then there is no chance for hitman to win. However, hitman can make time bombs, snipe, poison, or create a scenario to make the VIP panic &amp; run. So the 4 players will be forced to strategise and survey the area.\n\n\nThank you for reading my idea. I welcome all suggestions even if this is not come to fruition."
olg6vo,Open World car game... 1970s edition,"Now before all the 'try this game' comments, I know there are a lot of games that have parts of this idea of mine, but none that I know of that's exactly this. Many have some classic cars but none are actually fully set in the timeframe and have the cars and gameplay with it.\n\nOn to the game itself.\n\nFor some years now I've had thoughts about a car game, not racing specificly set somewhere in the 1970's. The setting I'm thinking about is a small US based city with a large open area around it with some backwater towns.\n\nGameplay:  \nI'm not sure yet what would be the big story, but I'd love to see a Forza style 'collect your favorite cars' idea where some players would go for speed, others for gassers, some for stock car racing, low-riders and even some in the van sub-culture. There could be competitions based on performance on a track but also based on votes on showcars.\n\nA good and modern arcade game is nothing without police car chases. For inspiration and imagination I look at chases in the Dukes of Hazzard, Bullitt, Gone in 60 seconds, Smokey &amp; the Bandit and so on. Chases with classic cars and oversized policecars through backwater towns and the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you'd really wanted to go over the moon with this you could add some early NASCAR races, motorcycles and even demolition derby's to it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm not really expecting for someone to make this as it probably wouldn't many gamers. I was just wondering what people think is interesting about such an idea and if people have even more ideas."

ohb75c,SuperShock,"So basically a superhero immersive sim. Using all the classic immersive sim tropes but adapting them to a superhero style. Basically you’d wake up as a character in a room with no recollection to your past. \n\nThrough a few story beats you find out that you’re in a government facility where they experiment on superhumans (or some fancy way of saying it). You yourself are also a superhuman who’s super power is that you can adopt powers from other super individuals when injecting their blood into yours. \n\nAs you progress you fineness yourself among an outbreak where a few superhumans have managed to escape their confinemens and the government agency has deployed their own special SuperHuman Culling Unit. You’re aided in escape by a fellow superhuman named Push who wants to help you out while also looking for his twin brother Push. In a skirmish where Pull gets shot and is dying, you’re able to extract his blood and start fighting back against rhe SCU. \n\nThroughout the game you’ll have to fight superhumans and gain their powers such as Osiris; a man that can turn his body into sand, Gravitas, a superhuman who can control gravity, and Madam LaRouge; a villain who’s able to hide in the shadows and make voodoo dolls of her enemies to torture them from afar and many more superhumans. \n\nYou’ll also be up against elite members of the SCU such as Knightwatch; a specially trained stealth soldier who’s able to blend in with his surroundings as he hunts you down with quiet weapons like a bow and knife, Expert (honestly couldn’t think of a name); a veteran soldier who carries around bullets and grenades that are able to disrupt the power of the superhuman individuals, and Cleric; a towering soldier clad in armor that isn’t so easily broken bolstering a single action rifle that is both stunning and powerful. \n\nBasically like any good immersive sim, using your powers in unexpected ways to achieve results in whatever manner you deem acceptable. I have an idea for a list of all the superhumans and SCU agents but that’s the gist of what I’d love to see in a game."

I already have an idea in mind, something similar to the copy ability from Kirby, but I dont know how it would be executed. Example: in odyssey, the capture mechanic is the ""core"" mechanic, and cappy is the way it is executed. That is what I am requesting. A cool way to execute a mechanic. I really want players to utilize the move set of this hypothetical game, so use this video if you want to know what I’m talking about. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rlmVxrq-3Go. ONE MORE THING, it has to be a ranged attack, but not too far from the player, because jumping on an enemy is hard."
oguqce,Short film/Skit Party Game,"If I was to describe this game in as little words as possible, it would be: charades except teams act out prompts in game with characters, props and sets, which is recorded with an in-game perspective camera, then shown to other players at the end of the round for voting. You must rank the other teams skits and they get points accordingly. \n\nFurther explanation:  \nThe teams are separated from one another before they get their prompts. Players would be given a selection of props, characters, and sets to choose from after they have their prompt. Then each player can take on different roles to act in the skit. One player controls the camera, which is an actual in game object (although they can set it up to point in a fixed position and remotely toggle recording on and off if they want to act as well). Whenever the camera is recording, players in game mics are also recorded. Each team gets a short set amount of time to design their skit and then act it out and record it, the time constraint should be tight to force impromptu and silly ideas. Teams can give their skits titles, and also add basic effects if they like. Once the timer is up, the teams are reconnected in a movie theater setting, and one after another, the teams skits play on the screen. Once all skits have played, you rank them in order of preference, and points are awarded accordingly.   \n\n\nAlternative ideas:  \n\- some teams might not get good characters, props, or sets for the prompt they are given, and so it might be better if each team actually creates the prompt and selects the props etc. for another team. For example, my team could give another team a dog and human character, some bowls, a house set etc. and the prompt ""if dogs had humans as pets, instead of the other way around"".  \n\- teams could also be rated on the quality of prompt they came up with and the props etc. that they paired with it.\n\nStyle:  \nI was thinking an isometric 3d topdown or third person with art similar to overcooked. You would of course have the ability to change to the in game camera's perspective to see exactly what it is seeing/recording though.\n\nI'm also welcome to any variations of this idea that make it more fun, simpler, or more feasible to create. Thanks."

ogqzhw,Space 4X game where speed of light actually matters,"Hi all. Here's a little idea that came to my mind recently. I might attempt to prototype it one day, but feel free to use it if you find it interesting. \n\nThe game is set either in a tiny galaxy or a star cluster \~50 light-years in diameter. You start as a ruler of a single star system which is your capital/seat of power. The setting is hard sci-fi. Each turn takes a year of real time. During each turn, you have a pool of orders which you can spend to perform your usual 4X actions (build structures and fleets, do research, send exploration missions). \n\nThe main mechanic of the game is that the universal speed limit works just like in our universe. Your basic ships travel at 50% speed of light. Information travels by radio waves at light speed. If you have a colony that is 4 light-years away from your capital system and you order them to build something, this order will reach them in 4 turns. Same with the feedback information. If something happens in this colony, you will only learn about it after 4 turns have passed.\n\nI imagine this mechanic would lead to some interesting scenarios. A colony's gone black. Maybe it's just a busted transmitter and they'll resume the communication next turn? Or maybe something bad happened and you need to send a rescue mission? Or maybe send a fleet, just to be sure? Perhaps another colony has been attacked by an alien force. Does it make sense to send a fleet to that system? Could they still be holding with their meager garrison? Or should we write them off as a casuality and use this fleet to mount a defense elsewhere? You could also recruit governors of different types and send them across the stars to make some decisions in your stead, but of course, they wouldn't be 100% reliable (some could be corrupt or incompetent and in the worst case, they might want to rebel and secede from your empire).\n\nBasically, the incomplete/delayed information would work as a kind of a fog-of-war and put a brake on the snowball effect which is prevalent in this kind of games. \n\nThe main purpose of the technology tree in this game would be less about who can develop the best lasers/shields, and more about finding better ways to manage a vast, interstellar empire (FTL communications, warp gates, efficient bureaucracy, and so on)."
ogprjl,Self regulating difficulty mechanic in Time Traveling mech game.,"This game is about piloting a far future mech in a near future conflict. The main gimmick is that the time travel agency the player works for has a limited amount of mass it can send back in time for the entire campaign. The campaign will consist of a series of missions,  beating one will unlock the next. However the mass of the mech used to beat that mission will be subtracted from the total mass available for the entire campaign. Since this game is about time travel, the player can replay any mission they have already beaten and choose a different mech. Should they beat it with a lighter mech, that playthrough becomes the ""canon"" timeline and the mass freed up can go back to the campaign pool for future missions.\n\nThis will allow the player to explore the level on ""easy mode,"" driving the biggest most destructive mech, then switch out to smaller weaker mechs to increase the challenge. Completing the level with lighter mechs will allow the heavier mechs to be used in later missions. Hard core completionists can try to beat the game with mass to spare, while more casual gamers can still experience most of the content with a mechanic to encourage them to try a harder difficulty.\n\nAlso if you want to blow off some steam after a hard day of work you can stomp the biggest mech through the level that is giving you trouble for grins and giggles."
ogp7ok,I need ideas for a warioware type game,"I LOVE the warioware series, and i'm thinking of making a game in it's rapid-fire-microgame style, but i need ideas for the microgames. I'm sorting them into 8 categories:\n\nAnything goes: the miscellaneous category, i need some really easy ones (like your mom/sister) for the intro stage, then some hard ones (that's what s/he said!) For the last stage\n\nFantasy: stuff with magic/strange creatures and a lack of technology.\n\nArcade: the equivalent of the 9-volt stage, these are refrences to anything from the arcades, preferably namco, atari/midway, sega, and those non-digital arcade games like skee-ball or wack a mole. I KNOW the boss game is going to be dance dance revolution.\n\nThe movies: basically every bad parody movie ever as a stage, these games should parody famous movie scenes.\n\nSports: speaks for itself. Don't be afraid to use some more obscure sports for these.\n\nOld-school viral videos: the kinds of things that were popular on early YouTube. Fails, lame dancing, and pets reign supreme in this stage.\n\nThat's life: stuff that can be recreated with things you have at home. The things that dr crygor's stages in warioware usually were about.\n\nAt work: games involving people's occupations, both blue and white collar. This could range anywhere between a plumber unclogging a toilet to paper basketball in office job.\n\nSci-fi: the same as fantasy, but with technology instead of magic, and usually involving outer space.\n\nAnything that can be fit into 4 or 8 seconds is acceptable, but longer games can be used for the ""boss"" games.\n\nNot to mention the arrange modes."

ogfnz2,"You knows whats missing from battle royales, spectator influence.","The Hunger Games movies and books suck, personal opinion, but the spectator or sponsors aspect they have is something the gamemode could really use and quite frankly needs. Especially since so many games encourage and sometimes force playing in pairs or a group, and we all know theyre more fun with friends. Teammates could give temporary intel or buffs, the entire dead player base could vote on map influences or give random attributes to the players like low gravity or big heads.  \n\n\nI feel like this would make the gamemode in general more exciting for everyone, so you dont have to be good to play long, and are otherwise just waiting between finding matches."

Thoughts?"
ogcch3,"You play through someone's life, non linearly","**Central Idea*****:*** The time in the player character's life is navigable. Instead of playing through the adventure or story in a linearly order, the player could select any chapter in their life to jump to and play through. Maybe the player starts with the beginning, infancy, or instead right before they die. This is more of a thought experiment than just a ""for fun"" game, but hopefully it would be enjoyable to play and get the player to think a little.  \n**Gameplay:** Although the idea is non-linear time, that doesn't actually speak for gameplay. That's because you can probably do this within many genres. When you go to a chapter in time, you always start in the same place, and I'm assuming a fairly linear level. That's because in my opinion, an open world game would probably be too complex for both the developer and player. \n\nA ***story game***, in the form of a visual novel or puzzle game would be feasible and could make a lot of sense. You could require knowledge or abilities from the future to make events in the past much easier, or possible at all. Certain encounters wouldn't make much sense until you go back in time and get an ""ah ha"" moment. Past puzzles could or would set up future puzzles, maybe even change them based on the players actions.  \nOr instead a ***metroidvania***. You would unlock abilities at different chapters of time that would, in typical metroidvania fashion, make other areas easier to access. Although there could be hard locks to certain level, soft locks might make more sense. A new player would need X ability to get past a stage, but an experienced player could do without. A twist on the typical metroidvania idea, instead of navigating a place, you are navigating time.   \n\n\n**Last thoughts:** The story could have an event (almost randomly placed in their life) that would act as the final boss which explains the time travel ability, but I don't know if that would fit. Also there would be trippy questions like if there is any free will because each chapter is always the same, and how can you do an event from the past to get to the future if you needed the future to do it. Maybe some one has beat me to this idea, and if so id love to see it. Let me know if you have any ideas or questions!"
ogc57p,Pizza delivery without a car but with a skateboard and a harpoon gun,"In the near future gas and cars are very expensive and you are only a pizza delivery guy. The good news if you have a skateboard and a electromagnetic harpoon gun.\n\nYou need to deliver pizzas around the town and you get larger tips for how fast you can get to the house. There are cars driving around the town(in game driven by people but in reality AI driven) so you hop on your skate board and shoot a passing car. If you hit the car you are pulled by a rope to follow the car. If the car makes a turn you can reel in the rope to cut down on the whip effect but if you are too close and the car stops you may slam into the back of it(and die), if you are too far back you may hit a wall.\n\nYou can disengage the harpoon gun and shoot another car(if you want to go straight and the car is making a turn or to stop to make the delivery). There are no set paths to go, just get from the pizza shop to the delivery address but cars are driving on their own paths so if you hang onto the wrong car you can go in the wrong direction.\n\nAs you earn tip money you can buy upgraded skateboards, better harpoon guns etc. \n\nWhat do you think? Would this game be fun? How complex would the AI programming be and would it be feasible to have all these cars driving on AI routines to make the city look lived in on modern hardware?"
ogbjm4,Kill rivals or recruit them to your party.,"The game's combat is a simplistic souls-like, you attack to do damage, guard to neutralize damage, dodge to throw of the tracking of your enemy's attacks, and parry to set them up for a critical hit. By collecting things either hidden in each level or dropped from slain enemies, you can upgrade your character's primary capabilities.\n\nAt certain intervals in the game, you'll come across bosses that are humanoid, or rivals, that once defeated will prompt you two choices: kill them and take their primary ability as a special ability, or spare them and recruit them to your party that can be switched out in each level.\n\nYou'd need their primary ability to transcend certain obstacles and reach optional collectables in previous levels, but each character has a distinctive fighting style very different from the MC's such as having ranged attacks, attacks that deal multiple hits per use, attacks that are the most effective and efficient against certain types of enemies, or attacks ideal for crowd control."
og9k3i,"Subnautica, but underground.","I've had this bizarre dream, and I wanted to share it because it actually felt like a decent idea.\n\nThe game would begin with a tutorial where you play as a miner. Basically, a mining expedition stumbled into a massive cavern, and you are the only person who escaped, warning that you've found hell, and that you've seen the devil himself.\n\nAs it turns out, they've stumbled into an enormous cave system that's been isolated for hundreds of millions of years, and is now inhabited by monstrous descendants of Cambrian fauna. The true protagonist is a scientist who was sent with a team of other explorers for a rescue mission to try and locate the missing people, but he gets isolated for some reason.\n\nHe would have to survive in a massive cavern, with plenty of critters running around.\n\nYou  only have a pick, a flashlight and some rope. You could use the rope to climb, the flashlight to see, and the pick to climb/fight.\n\nThere were trilopites, isopods, crabs and glowing bats running around as harmless creatures. \n\nThen there were these giant lobster-like creatures that didn't have claws, but instead had fingered arms. They'd try to grab your arm with their hands, and bite you. You could break their arms with the pickaxe though.\n\nAlso remember there being a giant crab that looked like a boulder, and its shell was too thick for you to hurt with a pick, so you had to push it off a cliff. \n\nAnd if I recall correctly, there was some spider-like creature that clung on the ceiling, and would fall onto you.\n\nAnother creature looked like a giant snail with glowing antennae. You could pick it up and use it like a flashlight, or you could throw it at the lobsters which would eat it instead of you.\n\nI also vaguely remember a run-down elevator you could fix for fast travel.\n\nAnd lastly, the cave had multiple different biomes, like an underground cliffside, and underground sea with glowing coral, mushroom forests, crystal valleys, and claustrophobic insect infested corridors."
og8ul1,Survival Open world Monster game like spore but Better,"Okay, what if there was a game like the spore creature part but you make more realistic monsters to roam and survive a large open world map. Could maybe be both an MMO or single player. On the MMO you can find other monsters (other players) and team up or fight them. You could make monster's more adapted to specific biomes such as deep sea would use bioluminescence to capture prey but also have a disadvantage not being able to see well. Or monster's that can fly and perch on mountains but are slower when walking or running. The longer you survive the more likely you are to evolve and become more powerful. There is probably better mechanics than what I could think of but I still think it is cool."

og2zmh,"Here is an idea for an infinite dream game, IMHO.","Ever since I saw AI dungeon, an idea began to form on my mind and is now a lot more mature, it just lacked the environment, until I saw Valheim.\n\nLets take a game like Valheim, it uses procedural generation to make great environments with a flora system that can also produce occasional mineral rocks, land marks and the odd structures.\n\ndevelop that to make occasional villages and roads to connect those places, populate the place with more sentient actors, like other characters.\n\nThis is just the beginning, lets add some need and goal-based quest system.\n\nI mean the whole logic part of the game can be placed upon the goal system.\n\nWhen you or any other actor gets hungry, then the goal to eat food pops into your/their goal list, as opposed to quest list.\n\nIf you/them have any food-like item then you/they can eat and fulfill the goal. If not, then another goal is generated: Acquire food.\n\n=== === === === === === === === === === ===\n\nWhat now? Well, if it is the player's goal, then it is shown in a list of goals, needed to be fulfilled, sorted by importance level and the availability of the prerequisites.\n\nIf it is an actor's goal, then if the actor is marked as important, i.e. involved in your previous adventures, then the goal can be translated to a sentence like: ""***The farmer is hungry***"", and be fed to a system like AI dungeon, pun intended.\n\nIf the actor is not important then a routine previous output for the goal is taken and interpreted for the actor to perform.\n\nThe AI would interpret the input with previous entries and come out with a result.\n\nThen this result is interpreted by the game engine, and it would weed out the too bizarre, unmanageable and bonked outputs and select the ones that it can manage to interpret and convert into the games actual environment.\n\nIt can add new goals to track, spawn new required actors for the roles or select the suitable available ones,  spawn or select needed items, and place them in the places defined by the AI output doing what was specified there with the generated or picked items.\n\nNew goals and events are fed into the AI as they are generated, outside of the AI system, by other systems, or player actions.\n\nSomething like: ""***The player picks the picket of the guard.***""\n\nThat particular guard can be previously generated by the landscape generation system on the entrance of a castle, or be generated by the AI system on an output like: ""***A guard appears and blocks the way of our group of adventurers.***""\n\nThere can be a grouping system that adds a collection of actors or items and gives them a containing name.\n\nFor instance the instant that an NPC accepts your offer to join you in your adventure, a group is generated and named, and you join that named group.\n\nWell, back to pick pocketing action, the items in the pocket can be generated, when the guard is generated, but if the AI results in: ""***And finds a rare item.***"", we can wait for more output from the AI to define the item and generate that particular item to place in the list, or choose from a list of predefined rare items, suitable to be in the pocket of a guard.\n\nOr maybe the output would be like: ""***The guard notices the player's action and steps back and draws a laser cannon from his pocket and attacks the player***"", which the interpretation system then replace the laser cannon with the weapon pre-generated when the guard was generated, or pick from a list of more suitable weapons for the environment and the guard status.\n\nThe system can understand the step back and attack actions and perform them correctly.\n\n=== === === === === === === === === === ===\n\nWhen you begin a conversation with an NPC, the goal system can step in and generate some predefined text for your choice, sorted by the importance of their particular goal.\n\nSo there can be conversation entries available to choose from, like this:\n\nDo you know where can I find a job, I need the money.\n\nThis goal can be the result of your being hungry, and lacking food, so you searched for it and found some, but the owner was a merchant and asked you for money in exchange, so the goal to make some money was generated, which resulted in that particular conversation entry.\n\nThere can be other entries like:\n\nWhere can I find Sir Drakulz?\n\nIf you select this entry, it is converted to: ***""Where can I find Sir Drakulz?"", the player ask the clerk.***\n\nThen it is fed to AI system and the output can be something like: ""***He is probably in the castle.***""\n\nYou know the castle was generated by the environment system, and was fed into the AI system as soon as you were in it's sphere of influence, just as any other place, landmark, actor,  and item.\n\nSomething like: ""***There is a castle nearby.***""\n\nSome less important entities, like a chair nearby is only fed when you touch or use it, and something like a ***sword*** on the table, can replace the ***blaster*** when interpreted by the system.\n\nSome feeds are global and define the global environment and theme, and can be chosen as you initiate your game, others are fed as needed.\n\n=== === === === === === === === === === ===\n\nThere is no difference between the player and any other actor, so when a goal is added to you, you can follow them by their importance level, and when a goal is added to another actor, they would follow them by their importance level.\n\nThe goals can add conversation entries to any actor, and they will use them, and the AI system would interpret them a come up with results for the talking party.\n\nThe goal system rules the game, so when some events happen or when you hear an answer to your spoken words, maybe a goal can be offered to you to add to the current list.\n\nSo when someone answers: ""***Maybe Sir Drakulz knows about the lost piece.***"", the goal to find him is offered to you, by the UI, like: ""***Do you want to find Sir Drakulz?***"", and if you accept, the goal is added to your list.\n\nIMHO, this combination of AI Dungeon, Valheim, and a need and goal based internal logic and conversation system can make the ultimate infinite life ruining game of them all.\n\nThese are just ideas for any interested party, as I don't have the time and means to make such a game, and I don't claim any rights on the ideas.\n\nJust want to inspire some party to make such a game.\n\nBy the way, I have thought a lot about these ideas and have some nice solutions on how to implement them, and can offer them if anyone is interested.\n\nLike how to keep track of the entities that we feed into the AI system, and if it would be better to use Sims style conversation grunts, and the like."

Lets give an example(i would attach an image but idk how to)\n\nThe party of 4 enter a battle with 1 enemy. After choosing an attack, a box appears showing 5 boxes. The box in the center has a skull, representing the enemy, while others are empty. Select a box and circle will appear in it. The colour of the circle will represent who is going.\n\nThe idea is to strategize the way to fight. If you want the enemy to die fast, put the 2 strongest up first.

ofxdij,DarkHearts,"The year is 20XX and humanity is on the brink, being under siege by Darklings, once innocent humans and creatures, corrupted and mangled by a living parasite called Dojinshii, nothing can harm these creatures aside from an ancient alloy which has given birth to ancient weapons forged many eons ago, however humans have recently discovered how to forge this alloy themselves, though it's not enough. A mad scientist comes up with a solution, a being spliced from different DNA, and infused with this virus to be a darkling himself, able to harm these creatures without such weapons... You are this warrior, born to end the destruction and despair the Darklings have wrought.\n\nThe game itself: imagine a side scrolling slasher/bullet hell, where you gain upgrades and unlock new abilities which you can use to combo enemies, including bosses. But you yourself can also be comboed, enemies and bosses can do combos on you and normal enemies can work together to make your life hell, where a single hit can turn half health, into death(depending on difficulty). So let me go over the finer points.\n\nPlayer main abilities: The player has access to a small amount of basic punches but, most of your things will actually come from proper energy and sword use as your punches and kicks come from the same button your sword is, lemme go over them quickly, both your energy and sword have a bar, the more you use your sword the more it depletes, once empty you can't use your sword at all as you can't summon it at all as it appears and dissapears from your hands rather than staying there permanently, instead you punch, but it regenerates when the sword isn't used, energy is slightly different, same as the sword, all energy moved deplete the bar, however unlike the swords passive restoration, the energy required a moment of respite to Regen. Since it's a bullet hell with many things on the screen at once at times, a dodge is essential, and the dodge can be upgraded and changed, but the basic is, you hold a direction and hit the button, and you dash that direction, in the beginning before upgraded, you dash then can't move in the air, you just have your dash momentum and gravity, once you hit the ground you have a split second of recovery, this can be removed through upgrades, which is gonna be heaven becuase of the bosses, of course if you ground dash, where you never leave the ground, then there is no recovery at all, aside from a moment where you can't dash again, however this moment isnt terribly long, about .80 seconds, or so, I haven't gotten the exact numbers, but it isn't terribly long.\n\nCombo System: Not fully fleshed out but the majority is here, depending on your difficulty, combos are gonna be longer or shorter, we'll take Hard as the example here though, with differences being told at the end.... So bosses have something called Hitstun Decay, where the longer the combo goes on the less your hits actually stun them allowing follow ups, however some bosses the combo system works differently, on big bodies, you can't move them with your attacks, meaning some combos won't work at all, but they still get stunned from hits, just not as much as smaller bodies, meaning you'll not be comboing these bosses as long or often, smaller human sized bosses can be moved from your attacks, meaning you can take advantage of certain moves to get a full longer more damaging combos, however special super powered human sized bosses have a move that gets them out of combos instantly, usually damaging the player if they are too close, punishing the player if they get too greedy. The player can also be comboed, however the player also has this Hitstun Decay, though reduced on hard, meaning you'll be comboed longer, on Nightmare(unlockable after beating the game on hard) there is no hitstun decay for you.\n  Combo Structure: the combo system is mostly free form, with few absolutes, but there are a few rules that the player must adhere to, let's go over what can cancel into what, but first...\n\nMoves: There are four main types of moves, when talking about combos, you have your basic moves, which would be just pressing attack, these can then be canceled on hit into special moves or dash, special moves are slower and longer recovery moves that require more input, for example spinning slash, a move where if the player is in the air will spin like a ball and have their sword out, much like zeros spinny slash, would require something like 216 attack, or something, these special moves can be canceled into dash as long as they hit, into other special moves, or into super moves, these are usually super slow but super damaging moves that have a lot of recovery, usually your combo ender, however later upgrades allow you to cancel your super so it never comes out but still takes the bar cost, allowing longer combos. Now onto the rules, you only get to use a special twice per combo, and dash cancels take energy, and a hit super almost never allows follow up, I say this because of a theory combo that may be cool, where you use one of the sword moves, where you throw your sword and it spins in place for a moment damaging whatever close to or on top of it, and then you super and becuase of the sword you can keep it going due to the hit stun, idk though. Each move affects the hitstun decay differently, basic attacks affect it the least, removing the least amount of stun frames on hit, specials are the next in line, removing more stun frames on hit than basic attacks, dash attacks are next, then finally supers, removing the most hits, multi hit moves while always removing more stun frames than single hit moves, don't count every hit, meaning for example a single hit from say a single hit special could for example remove 1 frame of hitstun, the 3 hit special would only remove 2 frames. Those aren't the absolute numbers just an example, some multi hit moves would count all hits, such as a three hit combo from the sword coming from a single sword special input would count all three hits, but a flurry slash comprising of say 5 hits wouldn't count each hit. Speaking of, energy attacks both have less hitstun and remove less stun frame, while sword attacks have more hitstun and remove more.stun frames. You are allowed 1 hard launch after any moves that hard launch instead soft launch, what's the difference? Well a hard launch sends the enemy up into the air a short distance and they don't recover until they hit the ground, while a soft launch they can recover before they land.  1 hard bounce, after all bounces become a soft bounce, a Hard Bounce is the same as hard launch only they bounce a very short distance off the ground and don't recover until they hit the ground again, while a soft bounce they can recover at any time during the bounce. One final thing to note, while not a set in stone rule, more of a possible rule, is damage decay, the longer the combo goes on and following the same rules as hitstun, each move would do less and less damage, but this rule is a possible rule I haven't decided if it would actually be in the game.\n\n\nLevel design: Taking heavy inspiration from games like MegaMan, the level design would follow suit, being a 2D side scroller with platforming and stage dangers on some, while they can be taken slow, they should be designed so an expirenced player can just smoothly and effectively speed run right through, as an ideal play of a stage would be fast planned but often dashes through picking and choosing what enemy you'll take down, but a player could also player would have the option of taking down every enemy and methodically making their way through, with little softlocks based on speed, but rewards the player on making it through certain things quickly, such as making more progress or gaining access to a spot otherwise closed off, such as an upgrade or shortcut and such. \n\nSpecial Moves: Now you may be thinking, ""Calan, the special moves are quarter circles... So.... Are there a limited number of them? Or can you pick and choose?"" The answer is you can pick and choose, let me go over inputs, which I'm not opposed to changing,  S=sword, E= energy, X= input exists for both\n214X, 236X, 412X, 632X, 236S+E(this is your super) \nMeaning all in all you have up to 4 special moves each, im open to changes to this tbh and there are more special moves than 8, meaning you can pick and choose your playstyle and combos. With certain once complimenting eachother more than others. But in the end free form and open ended.\nSo what do you have to pick from? Not all are in my head, but I'll go over a few that I have fleshed out let's start with sword\n1: a three hit combo, with the last one being slow but heavy hitting, with the last hit causing a Hard Bounce, can only be done on the ground.\n2:A ground slam, where the sword is slammed point down into the ground, if done in the air you shoot down, on impact with the ground it creates a shockwave around the impact, which if on the ground does a Hard Launch, while the aerial version causes a soft bounce.\n3: A forward lunge, doing up to 3 hits as it goes forward, in the air this move can be directed but not in a 360°, more of a 100° with the center being straight down.\n4: A rising slash doing up to 4 hits, on whiff or if not canceled you don't recover until you hit the ground.\n5: A single slash sending a projectile going across the ground.\n6: An aerial spinning slash doing a max of 6 hits, if all 6 hits connect it does a Hard Bounce, but only on the first time, every other time it doesn't bounce at all, however if you hold down after the input you spin the other way, useful for if you are falling down you can keep the enemy from going down faster than you. \n7: A sword throw, which has many versions, you are only allowed one of these\n Basic: You throw your sword and it dissapears shortly after thrown.\n Spinning Boomerang: it is thrown spinning, making it's way forward then coming back, your momentum is stopped as you stand there when it's thrown, if done in the air you float there while it does it's thing, it also pulls enemies toward it, meaning while it's coming back it pulls them towards you. \n Hibernating Spin: the blade is thrown spinning, travels a short distance then stays there floating in that spot for a short time, then dissapears.\n Teleportation Blade: You throw the blade straight and teleport to it on hit.\n\nEnergy Specials:\n1: A basic beam, hitting a max of 5 times, in the air it can be angled downwards, but only at a fixed angle.\n2: You slam your hand into the ground and it causes a pillar of energy to rise up instantly from the ground in front of you, on hit it causes a Hard Launch.\n3: a slow moving ball of energy that tracks to the nearest enemy.\n4: you cause an explosion of energy around you, hitting every where close to you.\n5: a barrier that lives for a very short time, but when you are hit, it drains energy bar rather than health, has big startup cost, and massive damage hits break it, stunning you for a short time and depleting your entire energy bar.\n6: a quick but short dash backwards, it has no invinc\n\nNow onto basic moves, as for the sword if you keep mashing the sword button you'll do a little combo that can be changed and upgraded depending on how you want it to act, but basic no upgrades or changes you do a three hit combo, left horizontal sword slash, right horizontal sword slash, into a bit of a slower over head slash. Now each of the three hits can be changed and you can even add more hits, for example that second slash could instead be changed to a forward stab, or a shorter range angled shoulder to knee kind of slash, the last hit can be a upward slash, or a forward lunge, etc etc... The energy is a bit different, hitting your energy button fires a energy ball which travels along decently fast, you can spam it to throw up to three quickly without upgrades, this is mostly your ranged attack, and combo fodder.\n\nSo how exactly do you get these upgrades and stuff, well easy, Darkness. With every Darkling you kill you gain a currency called Darkness, which you can spend to upgrade things like your dash, to dash farther or shorter distance, dash more in a row, change and upgrade your sword skills, increase your max energy, max health, max sword bar etc. Upgrade and receive new specials, gain new supers etc. But you can only do these things at base, where there's even a test dummy that can move and such so you can practice combos, it even shows how much damage each move does when you hit it.\n\nEnemy Moves: certain enemy Moves will have an alert before they happen, for example if a boss decides to do a forward dashing lunge, a ! will appear in front of them, with 2 lines above and below it showing their trajectory, it'll also beep 3 times with them attacking on the fourth beat, if they do multiple lunges from this single lunge, the rest will also do the alert, but only beep twice, with them attacking on the third beat, if they do it fast enough it may not alert you at all, for example, a full screen beam coming from one end and going to the other, which appears filling the space between both points instantly, then extremely quickly after another appears just a tiny distance above it, and it keeps going very quickly sweeping across from the bottom of the screen to the top very quickly, only the first attack will have any kind of alert.\n\nI have more info but this post is rather long and it took me quite some time to write it. I thank you for reading this whole thing, it's more of an idea, I'm absolutely open to suggestions and special designs and such things if you have any questions please feel free to ask, I'm sure I forgot things or didn't say things clearly."
ofx2ed,Two part dinosaur game!,"This has been a dream game of mine to make for a while, but I have no programming skills, so I share it here for any and everyone!\n\nAnyway, so the first part is a park builder, you set up facilities for guests and staff, habitats for dinosaurs, change the terrain, ect, normal stuff right?\n\nWell, part two, either when your ready or after X time passes, disaster strikes, everything goes wrong, and the game goes into first person mode, and now you are an employee/guest of the park, and you must escape either to the docks or a helicopter pad, while evading dinosaurs that have escaped their enclosures and are hunting you, or just so happen to be in your way. Of course you can pick up tools, items, and weapons along the way, but you'll have a hard time killing the bigger dinos even with the best weapons, cause ya know, it's not a dino hunting game, it's a dino escape game(killing a big dino can be a difficult achievement sort of thing). \n\nAnd, maybe the ability to build a park and post it to challenge others to complete it? Maybe groups can escape together? Maybe extra challenges, like collecting dinosaur DNA samples from a lab before you escape?  Lots of options with this, I think this would be a kickass game!"

You would have to investigate different areas of the world to collect evidence and witnesses to build your case against Parasol Inc. Then you would have to prove their guilt during the trial. \nThere would be a dialogue tree for when you are questioning witnesses which impact your relationship with them depending on your choices.\nThe player would also get to choose which evidence and which witnesses they would bring to trial.\n\n(This is my first time posting, so please tell me if I did anything wrong)"
oftria,Dr Robitnic Prequel Idea,"Would love a prequel with him as a young boy. At first you don’t know it’s egg man and the whole time you are thinking, “wait, how is this a sonic game?” No cartoonish animorph villain (kind of) and no main animorph characters. His name is Robert  (Bobby) Sputnik in this prequel (Robotnic). He gets lost in the woods one day and is very spooked by some animals. He heads into a cave for shelter and enters a hidden lab and finds Dr. Mammalian (Who is a blue great ape). In the background you see some hedgehog shaped things in a tank (silhouette of them anyways). At first he seems harmless and asks you to fetch him a few things in return you can stay there and eat. He eventually gifts you with a mech of sorts with a suction. He asks to to capture some small creatures for his project as he wants to help save them by, “making them just a bit smarter”. Then you have to defeated rare and dangerous animals, at one point you even have to defeat a dragon like creature, but only have time to take one of his horns as it fell off during the battle. Towards the end of the game you realize that he was turning the animals into chaos emeralds, however as a by product of this some of the energy in creating these emeralds leaked into one of the animal pens and transformed them into the animorphs we know and recognize. Eventually you have to defeat Dr. Mammalian, but after because you helped him to begin with the animorphs lock you away. This can be tweaked but I feel is a solid idea."

Here is the gist of the game:\n\n* You and your friends start on a planet where you mine/harvest local resources in order start a colony. The towns on the planet will have willing workers that you can recruit to join your party to speed up resource collection and will eventually stay in your colony as you construct buildings that require workers to operate, such as farms and factories.\n* Soon you will be able to build a starship that will be your primary form of travel to other planets. Just like your colony on the planet, you'll be able to customize your starship to fit your needs. With a starship now available, you'll be able to travel to other planets with unique and rare resources to further expand your colony.\n* During your travel to these planets, you and the companions you choose to bring with you will encounter other ships, pirates, blackholes, etc. As every planet has new resources, different challenges, and different races and species, so too will the expansiveness of space.\n* As you progress you will be able to start building your own droids for your colony and starship, as well as building a small force that you can use to rid planets of hostile foes so that you can colonize the planet for yourself and expand your kingdom.\n\nI'm open to any thoughts and/or feedback!"

It's a survival game where the player is left in a deserted area, maybe a foreign planet, maybe earth after an apocalypse, doesn't matter. The goal is to set up and defend a farm from any number of threats. The thing is, all you have is a handful of mixed ammunition and some vegetable seeds to start, but if you plant the bullets you'll literally grow a gun that fires them. You can harvest more ""Seeds"" from the plants as well to keep your clips full, and depending on the level of care/skill at growing things the player has, the better weapons they grow.

ofch20,A hack and slash game where the enemies are based off of folklore or mythological creatures from different counties,"Im surprised no one has done this yet. There are a decent amount of countries with their own unique monsters or creatures. Like Japanese,Polynesian, African etc.\n\nMy idea for the game is a God of War(specifically the originals)/spiderman ps4 style game. You play as a rookie Hunter who is looking for a job or jobs that can help get him to the top. \n\nIn the game you will have two types of weapons a melee and ranged weapon. Melee is the weapon you will be using most and each melee weapon will have its own special power and unique moves. You will also be able to upgrade your melee weapon and gain new moves or special attacks. Ranged weapons are used to get in extra damage and extend combos. Each ranged weapon will have ammo  that will slowly replenish when you run out or when your not using it. Every weapon has its own special attacks that uses energy. You can get more energy for each enemy you kill. The less damage a special attack does the less energy it takes and the more damage it does the more energy it takes.\n\nMost enemies will have their own weaknesses which you can exploit to take them down quicker. For example an enemy may be weak to a specific weapon you have or take more damage from behind.\n\nThat is all i have for this idea feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below."

So I have always loved games where skill is the most valuable thing to have and you don't ""win"" just simply out of luck (let's say hitting a random critical strike, or finding a rarest loot), and till this day I have never gotten to experience anything like this other than fighting games, like Mortal Kombat, but I kind of don't like their setting, meaning that you are kind of locked in a small space and you are only fighting one enemy. My idea involves that there would be multiple people spawning on the same map, and all of them being on their own, fighting for highest points or something similar, but it's focus will be mainly combat, so you'd get situations like 1v3 fights, or 1v1v1v1 fights or stuff like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMainly it should be melee focused game with, as I've mentioned, easy to play, hard to master combat system with a lot of combos and interactions and whatnot. Also since it is going to be fast paced game, movement will be important as well, like double jumps, wall climbing, sliding, bullet jumping (from Warframe), you get the idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting would be some kind of dungeon similar to what we see in Dead Cells, and as title says, it'd be 2D so there'd be more momentum to the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also like to think that verticality and bigger would play huge role as well, for example, being able to climb some kind of small platforms while another enemy is chasing you, only to find out at the and of your chosen path, another enemy awaits you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust to make things more interesting, maybe there'd be optional PvE segment to the game, for farming up stuff, I always liked the idea of boss dropping rare items not because of 1% chance, but because you killed them inhumanly fast, hence you got rewarded for it. But this might be out of scope."

ov64t5,A strategy game related to,[deleted]
ov1ehs,"A persistent factions/survival, open world multiplayer game about Colonial America/New England in the 1600s","Thought about this while on the toilet. Been very interested in King Philip's War and surrounding history recently. I thought it would be fun to play a game about this time period. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are several factions that players may join, i.e. Massachusetts Bay Colony, Connecticut Colony, Wampanoag Tribe, Nipmuc Tribe, etc. Each with specific characteristics related to their location, histories, etc. Colonists and indigenous peoples would ideally be very balanced, to promote skill-based play instead of a more 'colonists steamroll the natives with superior technology and disease' take (since the colonists, for some time, did have a hard time fighting the natives). The exact characteristics I am not sure of, but oh well. Maybe I will flesh it out more later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game should incorporate systems of base building, economics, diplomacy, combat and more. It would be dynamic, much more than just a war simulator. Ideally, factions, should be encouraged to interact in a multitude of ways other than armed conflict. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Rounds' should be longish. Perhaps similar to ""wipes"" in Rust and Escape From Tarkov, where the map is reset once a week, month, etc. in order to prevent a game from going stale, or to prevent one faction from taking over too much for a long time. Several maps could exist, or they could be randomly generated. Each faction should have a starting point, a small piece of land that they control (or to make it more realistic, natives start with more land, but this could easily upset balance). These starting points would be just as plentiful in resources, and just as strategic as all others, so no factions have any unfair starting advantages. Factions should be able to claim land for themselves, but at a cost: literally, with currency, or by making it so that overextended colonies and tribes are put at disadvantages by spreading themselves too thin. Treaties should allow factions to negotiate land claims. Perhaps a war score system could exist, similar to the one in games such as HOI4 and EU4, in order to aid this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharacters should be able to assume different positions within the faction. There should, of course, be a leader, that is elected, or whatnot, a surgeon, soldiers, etc. Nothing too overwhelming, just basic hierarchy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCombat should be fairly straightforward. There are melee (swords, spears, pikes, etc) weapons and there are ranged (muskets, bows and arrows, etc) weapons, as well as some sort of armor for both sides (though colonists would obviously win here. Could scrap armor if too fucky with balance). Melee combat should not be over-complicated, but interesting enough to have a learning curve, and be satisfying to master. No weapon should be too much more powerful than another. If a player can fight, it shouldn't matter too much what they fight with (that is of course, unless someone with a dagger goes up against someone with a sword. Of course, they'd be at a disadvantage, but on the other hand, they should still be able to pull it off if they're good enough. Think Mount and Blade.) Of course, as it is the 1600s, guns should have pretty poor accuracy. Weather should affect their use. If it's stormy, probably not the best to try and use your flintlock. This could hurt balance, but could be evened out by colonists having better armor/weapons, though not by too large of a degree. Natives and colonists should, at the core, always be capable of giving the other, or each other, a hard time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDynamic diplomacy should exist. Factions should be able to make agreements, form alliances, join coalitions, and infight. It should be interesting and encouraged enough that players do not constantly seek to wage war against one another for the sake of war. **This should not be a war game with other elements. War should be but one cog in the machine.** I, of course, realize that it also relies heavily on the players to decide on whether they wish to immerse themselves in the diplomatic elements of the game over the military ones. Perhaps war could have negative effects on economy and manpower, making life harder for those who wage it, in order to give it some weight? Maybe people could be able to send letters to others? Or have to carry the letters themselves, braving the wilderness, or foreign hostility?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEconomy should also be important. Players should be able to farm, chop lumber, raise animals, or do things like smith for money, or to trade with other players and factions. Currency COULD exist, but simple trade would be more encouraged, especially with other factions. Perhaps merchant NPCs could wander New England's landscape, peddling various items? Who knows?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world should be relatively large and dynamic, with several different distinct terrains and areas to explore. Several natural monuments and landmarks should exist, in order to make navigation possible. Maps could work, as well, but not with a player's position pointed out. A map should just be a piece of paper with the map drawn out on it, a tool that players can use in conjunction with landmarks and recognizable areas in order to properly navigate their world. Different terrains should have distinct differences, pros and cons. Forests would be harder to navigate than plains. Natives might have a battle advantage (or even some kind of navigational advantage, since they know the land) in specific areas such as swamps and forests, whereas the colonists might be in a superior position if they fight in fields. Wildlife should be very present. Small animals like birds and squirrels, even raccoons could be hunted for meat and pelts, along with elk and deer. Bears and other dangerous predators could pose a serious threat to players who choose to leave the safety of their homes unarmed, alone, or at night. Fishing could have its own system, as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game should encourage roleplaying and interesting and complex interaction between players. Although they might belong to a tribe or colony, these players are still individuals, each with their own in-depth personalities and stories. Stories that they may write themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn-game voice chat and text chat would be ideal, though text chat should be limited to fellow members of factions, and ideally proximity-based. Voice would also, obviously, be proximity-based. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe players should be at odds with hunger, temperature, and stamina systems. A player should be able to easily freeze to death in snow if they are not properly equipped, for example. They should have to eat relatively frequently, though not overbearingly so. Sprinting and melee combat should drain stamina, which recharges quickly. Weather should affect a player's condition. Players could become too hot or cold. Rain should make players more susceptible to freezing. Mud and snow should hinder movement. Additionally, night time should be dark and somewhat difficult to navigate. Light should be important. Where there is light, there is safety. A player should have a hard time out in the wilderness, alone at night, where they are prime targets for enemies or predators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInventory should be affected by equipment. A player with a sack can hold more than one who doesn't. Weight could affect character movement. The more things someone is lugging around, the slower they may go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResources such as wood, stone, and more would require harvesting in order to build things in settlements, fortify walls, etc. Gathering resources should be relatively easy, but require tools. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistorical accuracy should be important. Not to an overly pedantic amount, but things should still be accurate for the most part. I wouldn't want to see any magic or anything of the sort, either. As much as the people of this time might've believed in and feared it, it shouldn't have a place in the game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, this game should be paced, and thrive off of player interaction, roleplay, and patience. It should be an immersive and engaging experience that keeps things fresh with wipes and diverse and fleshed-out systems, without becoming arcade-y. It shouldn't become monotomous! There should be basic functions like farming and wood-gathering that are just chores, but nothing else should feel like a boring routine. The game should encourage teamwork within factions in order to survive. Above all, surviving is the most important thing. Decimating your neighbors or living as a swamp hermit could be fun, but also incredibly challenging if you lack the grit to pull it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just some VERY basic outlines I came up with for the game's structure, and I am not a game designer. The most experience I have is making games on Scratch in middle school. If anyone would like to add on, or give their ideas, please do! I'd love to flesh this idea out more. Let's talk!"
ouxce1,What are some of your ideas for crappy mobile games?,Give me your shittiest hyper casual mobile game ideas.
oux7el,High school Marching band game,"This game would be about you making music, organizing a marching band, and making the best marching band to exist. \n\nThe mechanics are song making, player’s skill, teaching, and management. \n\n-song making \nYou can take existing parts or making your own music to make pep toons, show music etc. when making a song you can control what instruments are played, how they are play, and visuals. however when you make a song, you have to mind the difficulty and “rating”. if a song is a song is easy, it could be not very good, however if it is hard, it could be good . You must strangle the two because if you have too many hard songs, you gonna have to choose the right \n\n\nplayers\n\nYou will be given random players and your job is to put them in the best spot to be played. Some will be labeled as “poor” or “excellent” which will dictate how good they are.\n\n\nTeaching\n\nPlayer will be taught in 5 week period by section leaders no matter what but if you train with them, that get a bonus teaching level. however there is a time limit for each day.to help people and if you pass the limit the day ends.\n\nManagement\nMostly like fundraisers, what to spend money on, just money spending and all that. \n\nAfter training, you go in to the game phase and the competition phase.  Game phase will make you more popular is your band is good, and less popular if your band is bad. if you have a really good band you can go in to competition which will dictate your future . If you bad, you gotta start over again , If your goodyoull get more people in addition into your current players, making it hard to manage. \n\n\nthe more years you survive it gets harder."
ouwthe,Super Mario Souls,"I've been having this idea on the back of my head for a while, ever since I saw an artwork in the internet of a ""realistic"" Bowser. It was a Bowser that genuinely looked like a demon, facing Mario with fire flower's power and holding Princess Peach in a hanging cage.  \n\nThe artist (""JasonChanArt"") called it ""Mario Souls"".\n\n[This is the artwork] (https://www.deviantart.com/jasonchanart/art/Mario-Souls-612487561)\n\nPersonally, I think a video game based on this idea would be really fun, being like an alternate version of Mario, reimagined. I also read a comment that imagined this being what Mario truly sees, and everything else in other games are actually like that thanks to a filter that makes things look color and joyful. \n\nStory-wise, it's just another Mario story. Maybe show Mario and Luigi's origin, but I would definitely make it being a story about the first time Bowser kidnapped Princess Peach, the first time he was ever seen and recognized as a threat by the Mushroom Kingdom, and the first time Bowser and Mario faced each other. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, I think this is where the most fun would come out of. After seeing Sekiro's mechanic where you have to break an enemy's posture in order to damage him, I believe a similar mechanic could be implemented in Mario Souls. Before you go comment and shit on this idea saying that Mario would never use a sword or a shield...I completely agree with you. That's why the combat mechanic that I thought of is this:\n\n- In the original Super Mario games, there was only one way for you to defeat enemies: jumping on their heads. However, only that would be kinda easy in this game, and this is supposed to be Mario Souls. So in order for you to defeat enemies, you need to find an opening to hit 'em, like Sekiro, (and the enemies would still be goombas and turtles, maybe redesigned, but I think it's okay for them to keep the same looks, maybe a little bit more realistic).\n- The enemies attack you by charging at you. If they touch you, you get hit. You can receive up to 2 hits, before a 3rd one finally kills you, and brings the ""game over"" screen. \n- The enemies don't have an HP level, since all it takes is one hit to kill them, but instead they have a STAMINA level. You must tire them off in order to jump on their heads, and for that you need to DODGE. A lot. Thus, the whole combat would focus on ""dodge, dodge, dodge, kill"". Once the stamina has worn off by evading, you can finally jump on their heads and kill 'em.\n- Another thing I thought about, is that there is a secret progression system by the amount of enemies you defeat, and once in a while (and randomly) you can finish enemies off by jumping on them straight ahead, without needing to dodge and worn them off.\n- If you try to hit them while they have their stamina bar at its fullest, they will hit you.\n- If you dodge JUST before they hit you, you can deplete their stamina bar completely, and finish them off. That would be the ""parry"" in this game. The visceral attack.\n\nAs far as the camera goes, I think the common souls-like 3rd person perspective can work. \n\nThe visual would be the same style of the artwork I mentioned earlier, go check it out if you haven't yet. Maybe there could be a ""realistic Mario"" as well. \n\nIn terms of Level and World Design, this wouldn't be a platform game, and I still have to think a lot about that, since these aspects in Souls games, specially from FromSoftware, are the best thing about the whole game, so if anyone has any ideas about that, plz comment.\n\nAnother thing that I don't think could be added, are the classic question mark boxes, but if you have an idea about how they could be used, once again, plz comment.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it, I don't know if you could make a 5 hour game with tons of levels based on this idea, but just a couple of levels and a boss fight with Bowser at the end would be really fun."
outcqv,Some Abstract Concepts I need help linking together,"Hi I have some abstract concepts for a game that I want to develop into something more coherent.  \n\n\nTo set the scene, I was thinking:  \n\- The art style is a playful 3D Toon  \n\- Third or isometric perspective\n\nI have a couple of concepts that I want to include:  \n \- Exploration that is limited by something (fuel or nightfall, etc)  \n \- Slowly build up more territory or infrastructure to journey further  \n \- Large beasts that roam the world, that limit your expansion until they are defeated, and can destroy some of your infrastructure to throw a wrench into your plans  \n \- Some kind of farming to supply your exploration  \n \- A little buddy that follows you around\n\nI know this is a very constrained list, but let me know if you have any idea on how to link a couple of these ideas together"
ourxuq,A 2D sidescrolling rpg/action adventure game based on medieval illuminated manuscripts/miniatures,
ourozt,ProcGen Battle Royale,"I see so many shooter games where you can lose to someone that knows the map better than you, maybe you didn't know about a specific peak you could've taken or a back entrance that your opponent sneakily took to bamboozle you. \n\nLet's not forget those who take advantage of dirty glitched snipe spot that no one would even consider to expect.\n\nIs there, or could there be, a ProcGen Battle Royale that gives you know map knowledge advantage what so ever?\n\nFor instance, the core of a building in a city is taken at random from a selection, and then its addons such as windows/balconies/walls/outside stairwells are also selected at random to create a unique building in a randomly generated city plan. Further features may include that no city building is the same as another. In open areas it certainly doesn't hurt to have varying terrain with a selection of rock formations, trenches and derelict housing.\n\nI feel like Rust, whilst it has taken many years to get it right, has finally managed to get onto something - it's terrain generation is fantastic with it's monument placement now tuned into to surrounding environment but, it doesn't matter what server you go onto it will never feel the same. Every game is different.\n\nWhilst most Battle Royale/Shooter games do feel different with each game that is not up to the map, that is entirely up to the playerbase and how many bots vs sweats you have in your lobby - if you take away the one thing that gives multiple thousand hours an advantage, which is map knowledge, not only do you give the vet players a refreshingly new experience everytime, you also give the newer players a fair chance to come out on top thus keeping a higher playerbase!\n\nThis isn't quite a ted talk, but I'd like to thank you for coming either way.  \n\n\nTL;DR - RNG FPS good, static map FPS bad"
oupojp,Horror game about playing a non horror game.,"This is kind of meta, but in the game you'd be sitting at a desk playing a game on a PC. As you play the game creepy stuff starts to happen in the room around you. The game-within-a-game starts to become creepier, featuring more horror elements as you progress. You can look around the room for hints about how to progress in the game-within-a-game.\n\nFor example yoy might hear tapping on the window. First time you look over there is a tree branch. You look back to the game-within-a-game and see there is a monster looking through a window now. If you look back at the window in the outer game, suddenly it's the monster tapping on the window, and other such spooky nonsense akin to five nights at Freddy's.\n\nThe inner game would be simple, 2d and probably puzzle based. Story in the inner game would be conveyed through text. The outer game would be 3d, and would be first person. This would also work quite well as a VR game."
oupi85,A lovecraftian survival game set on R’lyeh kinda like Conan Exiles,
oup8sx,Earth Avengers: A Space Invaders game where humans are the invaders,"Feel free to use this idea.  This would be a great simple game for beginner programmers and game designers.\n\nStory:  After a failed invasion attempt in 1978, a mothership managed to flee the Earth to a nearby solar system.  As the captain of this ship, you feel bad about your people’s attack on the Earth, and would like to establish a peaceful colony on this new world. Unfortunately, the humans wanted revenge.  They just wouldn’t let it go!  You must defend your newly formed colony from the Earth avengers!\n\nGameplay:  The structure of the game is identical to the original Space Invaders, but it’s on an alien world with spaceships from Earth attacking. You control the mobile cannon at the bottom of the screen. Instead of a mothership, a space station occasionally flies overhead, and you get extra points if you shoot it down.  There are 3 barriers between you and the attackers, just like in the original. These barriers are shot away over time. The stages are endless, and get harder over time.  You have 3 lives, but you gain one extra life for every 5,000 points. You lose the game when you run out of lives, or when an invader reaches the bottom. As with the original, the invaders speed up as they get closer to the bottom.\n\nBackground: The background is an alien world with a bluish-green sky, exotic plants and alien buildings. The background music sound like the same theme from the original Space Invaders, which speeds up as the number of enemies goes down and they get faster.\n\nScoring:  This is pretty simple. you get points for enemy ships that you shoot down, and extra points for shooting down the space station. Players should be able to submit their scores to a server, which would keep track of the highest scores globally."
ouo2ae,A marketable Mobile 2D game,Pls tell me a simple 2D game for mobile.
oumejt,A large scope space game where you create your player character's alien race and the game populates the universe with NPCs of that race.,"I didn't know whether to tag this as Dream or Mechanic, since it really only goes into one aspect of the game itself. Since I don't know if something like this is mechanically possible, I tagged it as Dream.\n\nIt always kind of bugs me when a high SF space game only has a handful of alien races to represent the general populace. The Destiny series comes to mind where even after two games and countless expansions, and you still only fight the same four alien races (and their ""taken"" counterparts, which makes 5, I guess.) Mass Effect does it a little better, with a dozen or so alien races populating the universe.\n\nI always preferred stories like Hitchhiker's Guide or Guardians of the Galaxy, where the pages are overflowing with weird and wacky alien designs. To me, a universe teeming with life should be represented by an abundance of different creatures and cultures.\n\nThus, the game idea. This would be a large scale MMO (yes I know you're already rolling your eyes but bear with me) where your character creation actually effects the in game universe. \n\nThe premise is the game takes place in a sort of central hub for the entire universe, where all walks of life converge, trade, and discuss diplomacy. Once again, think Mass Effect.\n\nWhen you create your character, you are given an extremely detailed editor to essentially form whatever type of alien you want (within reason. I think for mechanic's sake, you would have to create something at least vaguely humanoid.) You can mold every portion of your character to your exact specifications. Does your player have hair or feathers? Does it have horns? Is it organic or robotic? What shape are it's irises? Is it 8 feet or 3 feet tall? How many fingers does it have?\n\nOnce you create your character, you are brought to a screen where you answer questions about it's race. What planet does it come from? Is it a war motivated race or does it strive for peace? What is the environment like on it's home planet. Finally, you're asked to give a backstory to your character's race. \n\nOnce you've finished creating your character, the game begins to populate the universe with NPCs of the alien race you've created. It does this by taking the player character you've created and algorithmically making slight changes to the model's physiology. It makes differences in height, facial and skeletal proportions, aesthetic changes like hairstyles, eye color, etc... \n\nEach player that joins the game brings a new race to interact with the sprawling game world. You'll see NPCs from your homeworld interacting with each other in the game's social hubs or going on their own quests on hostile planets. They can even give you procedurally generated missions of their own.\n\nIf you inspect an NPC that is not from your homeworld, you can pull up their race's backstory, as written by other characters. You could even make in game decisions like your homeworld is at war with another player's (this would be an extremely advanced mechanic, lol.) \n\nThe game would populate, but not overpopulate, the universe with all of these converging races and give an all new immersive experience.\n\nObviously, there are a lot of hurdles with this idea. Trolls and lazy players come to mind, who would create offensive or otherwise inorganic races and planets. I would suppose a detailed moderation team would have to be implemented to keep the game cohesive. That being said, controversial alien races may add to the experience. After all, the game is a converging of many different people with many different cultures. It wouldn't all be utopian peace.\n\nI don't have much more than that. I think a game that implemented this would be neat. It would take a LOT of resources to work but I think it would be a space game like nothing we've seen before."
ouki5i,Lego game.,"[Sorry for bad spelling and grammar]\n\n(Lego video games has always been something I'd play when I get bored from other video games, what I like about the lego games is the characters and unlocking all the characters, more like collecting actual lego figs)\n\n- Lego Earth/ Lego History/ Lego WW: \n\n.These 3 titles have always been something I wanted to see from lego. \n\n- HUB areas and open world: \n\n. I always thought the hub areas could be different countries or diffenet famous war sites in differnet countries, or even include the whole countries that participated in the WW but this would be too much and is most likely not to happen. \n\n- Roster: \n\n. The roster is what made me even think about this game, basically the character are gonna be historical characters from differnet countries (Hitler), artists who existed at the time (Leonardo DaVinci), Scientists (Einstein), the soldiers and rankings of each country's army, and so much more character. This would probably be one of the biggest lego games character roster ever. \n\n- Story:\n\n.The story of this game would be way bigger than any other lego game, each mission will be a story for example the story of the mona lisa, how the Wright brothers made a plane, 16 days of Berlin and many more major historical events. \n\n- Purpose: \n\n. This game could be a very great game to teach younger people more about history in the comedic way of Lego games, also it could be a really fun game for history enthusiasts."
ougwkq,Outward Style RPG set in the Crusades,"I recently picked up Outward, and much like my last post concerning a medieval doctor rpg, another idea came to me. An RPG similar to Outward in that it is a hardcore rpg, but set during one of the Holy Crusades for Jerusalem. \n\nBeing that the game would take place in a real and preferably historically accurate setting, no magic would be present. \n\nPerhaps to make up for a lack of spell casting the weapons, armor, and crafting systems could be made more intricate. A layers system like Kingdom Come for armor, with different aesthetic pieces and ornaments depending on which faction you were part of (whether that be the Muslims or one of the many factions of knights that participated.) \n\nI like the idea from Outward that you are no one special and any skill you wish to acquire you have to work for. Perhaps as a way to get your character into the setting, if you choose to start of as a European (who would then obviously have to find their way into a mercenary guild, be a knight, or be conscripted), a Kingdom of Heaven style setup, wherein you didn't know your father, he shows up going to the Crusades and wants to take you with him, dies of some injury or illness on the way or upon arrival, but on his deathbed he knights you and so on. \n\nHeavily tie in the religious aspect, such as having the ""main story"" affected by how zealous and devout you are. \n\nPerhaps a few larger scale battles for historical accuracy and to add in some more combat. \n\nMake leprosy a concern. If contracted it obviously effefts the outcome of the game. Perhaps, depending on how pious you are, according to the faith of whichever faction, your god may miraculously heal you of it.\n\nI also liked the system from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood where you sent Brotherhood members on missions. So maybe, depending on how high you rank up in your given guild or faction you take on some administrative role that has you sending companies or regiments out on patrols, scouting parties, etc.and they gain experience through well, experience lol."

oua3k8,"I had a dream about this game, so I wrote down what it was.","3D modelled world, complete with cities, towns, farmland &amp; forestry, also on the waters edge. \n\nAirfields &amp; Aircraft carrier (both allied and enemy ones) are in several locations around the map. \n\nThe “missions” (actually just maps) have 100 missions each, ranging from things like “Defeat the 5 enemies that are patrolling this area of the map”, “A building in this area of the map needs to be destroyed” ect And after each mission completion the next mission automatically starts, there is only manual save and no automatic checkpoints, saves can only be made when landed at a base. \n\nEach map has a boss, at missions 50 &amp; 100, which has you in a dog fight against an ace pilot. \n\nEach mission completion rewards you with money, so does each enemy you destroy, landing at a base also gives you the option to upgrade your aircraft, with damage/armour upgrades, armour, weapons, damage repair, refuelling (as yes, your aircraft will lose fuel overtime), aircraft selection (as there will be multiple planes to chose from) and finally cosmetic liveries. As well as, crew! You can train, upgrade and purchase crew members to help, such as a fighter that constantly follows you, crew members to help put out fires your plane may have, man the machine guns, and a navigator who will automatically spot &amp; mark enemies on screen for you. \n\nGeneral features \n- enemies bases will constantly spawn enemy planes unless destroyed.\n- Flyable aircraft are only bombers, enemy planes and allies are in fighter aircraft. \n- Landing at an enemy base has a chance of taking it over. \n- And I’m sure there probably would also be a story throughout the game."

ou2xio,A game based around different peoples perspectives in a certain memory,"So I'm gonna make a lot of this up on the spot, because the core concept is based around how different people remember a particular scene completely differently, picking up on different details and whatnot, which could make for an interesting game idea, but I've only just thought of this so here goes with the improvisation...\n\nYou're a cop interviewing witnesses to a crime scene, say a bank robbery, and with each witness, you play out their memory of the same scene, but things are completely different based on how they remember it. One person remembers something that others remember differently (say a woman in a blue dress involved somehow, but everyone else either remembers a green dress or no woman at all) some people's versions are insanely detailed, resulting in a level with lots of props and interactions, whereas others are very limited in detail, resulting in a very bare level with next to nothing going on outside of the main crime. Some people's details lead to new evidence, and new witnesses (such as finding out the identity of the woman in the blue dress and interviewing her), and other people's details lead to dead ends because they've completely fabricated false memories by misremembering things. And some people's memories are so ridiculous and imaginative, like they claim ninjas broke in and saved the day or whatever, so you think they would be wrong about everything but their memories may include small details that are actually relevant, such as overhearing a criminal mention where their hideout is or something.\nYour job is to get to the bottom of it and work out which details are important to follow up and which are completely useless, and ultimately use all of this information to nab the bad guys.\nEach memory is and individual level which is repayable, complete with secret collectibles galore, some unlocking new witnesses and furthering the story and as the collectibles are essentially the details used to determine what is fact and fiction, you have a ""drawing board"" of all the collected details which you can review between levels with an element of puzzle to it, or even use in other interviews during conversation (like ""ask about the woman in blue/green""). And in the drawing board segment, you have fellow cops who you can present some of this evidence to to see if they know anything (maybe you got an item that was found at the scene, so a colleague suggests checking the serial number and locate where and when it was purchased and by whom etc, or maybe a witness' memory shows a partial tattoo they noticed on one of the robbers, so your colleague knows of criminals in the database with potential matches of that tattoo). Maybe details picked up in later ""levels"" can be used in earlier scenes to unlock a whole host of new information, and may even alter the level itself.\n\nAnyway, that's the top and bottom of it. You play cop and gotta separate useful and useless information via playable witness accounts in order to unlock new interviews and progress the story, or unlock other fun secrets as bonus content.\n\nFeel free to try to make this happen."
ou2jpg,Exploration game,"You’re a captain during the age of exploration and a little bit after. \n\nYou have the choice 4 different areas to explore. The Arctic, Temperate regions (North America/China), Tropical (Central/South America, Africa, India and Indonesia) and Southern (Australia, Antarctica). When you select a region, you are given an optimum time period to start in based on when exploration was most common (Arctic 1750-1900s, Temperate 1500-1700s, Tropical 1450s-1700s, Southern 1750-1900s). Each region will have strengths and weaknesses. The Arctic will be slow, dangerous, and unpredictable but the natives are nice, lower amount of disease and your crew will be more loyal. The Temperate will be average speed, decent weather, and easier to explore, but the natives are more hostile and your crew is more likely to mutiny and there is a higher risk of disease. The tropics is the fastest travel time, decent weather, and most prosperous, but the natives are extremely hostile, most likely region to be mutinied, and highest risk for disease. The southern region has slow travel speed, unpredictable weather, and crew who might mutiny but less hostile natives, fewer natives, and more food. You can explore anywhere in any time period but the lack of technology or the area already being discovered will make it harder. \n\nIn order to set sail, you need money. You will be able to host dinners, balls, and plays to help receive funding from beneficiaries. You can also ask the rulers or scientific organizations for money. Once you gather enough funding, you are able to purchase supplies, buy ship(s) and hire crew members. Each crew member has a different skill set including loyalty, health, age, adaptability, familiarity of region ect. The amount of money you raise to buy supplies is up to the player. \n\nNow it is time to set sail. You will leave from a random port in the country where you originate from. You will be able to choose your own journey and where you go and land. Now you are at the mercy of the sea. \n\nOnce you land in a temperate or tropical region, you will be able to create a colony. You won’t spend much time on the colony since you will have to return home, but you will be able to check in on them and see if they are doing well. You will be able to create colonies in the arctic and southern areas but they are less successful (except Australia). \n\nIf you discover something new you can name it after anything. Monarchs, crewmates, or beneficiaries are recommended. Islands, ponds, lakes, settlements can all be named. \n\nYou can return and report your findings. If they are satisfactory they with me might give you funding for another trip. If you don’t do well, getting funding will be more difficult. \n\nHow it ends. You can either retire and it shows you all the area you explored, or you die from the countless ways sailors died back then."
ou23h3,Game ideas physics already working,Hi there I'm looking for an idea for  a game to do with some physics I've been working on in unity. It's a ball that you can ping around like a slingshot via touchscreen. When your aiming the direction of the ball time slows down and if you hit something dangerous you die. I'm not that artistically talented so I'd like to keep the character like this and I'd like it to be simple enough to be a mobile game.\n\nAll Ideas are appreciated as I am stumped :)\n\nEven if its something completely different

otsxsi,we need a gta online multiplayer type game but in a cyberpunk or watch dogs type game.,"i think this would be awesome. in a perfect world, it wouldn’t be a cash cow like gta online is to rockstar, and it could be more like a cyberpunk cityscape than los santos. crazy vehicles like the akira bike or crazy sci-fi APCs with railgun turrets on the roof.\n\nand i think there could be a lot done with this idea. things like incorporating watch dogs 1 multiplayer ideas almost in a dueling style, like you could hack another player to steal money from them (a small limit, like mugging in gta) but then a timer starts, and the hacker has to be stealthy to avoid identification by the target. or little ideas for side quests like having actual characters run stores (weapon stores with guns and swords, implant workshops where you can purchase and upgrade your character’s implants) and storeowners need you to collet items or take care of some loose ends.\n\nthere could even be npc gangs like in watch dogs 2 or cyberpunk 2077, and quests could involve them too. there should be a main story imo but it shouldn’t be required to progress in the gameplay if the rest of the world. apartments and garages could be crazy considering the strange architecture of most cyberpunk cities. i have a lot more to say about this idea but i don’t want to write a whole essay lol.\n\nTLDR: there should be a gta online styled game based in a cyberpunk world with a story that is well made but not required to continue the game."

otl5l6,Text-based RPG/MUD using 3D Text in 3D World...,
otkz82,Text-based RPG/MUD using a 3D Text in 3D World...,"Hello All. I developed a 3D Text Subsystem to display [Player Stats directly on Characters body](https://youtu.be/ccPKgsLuADs). For [my game](https://thegamedevstore.com/v2/dragon-gold/), I'm going for all 3D UI, zero 2D. \n\nIronically, I'm expanding the debug console/logging subsystem to translate 3D Input/Output Events into Text and [Audio](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/google-speech-kit).  The loggin subsystem effectively converts the 3D game into a Text-based game. \n\nThen it dawned on me, with markup to define additional Audio/Visual effect, I could regenerate Text output with my 3D Text ([1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864560067659563038/unknown.png),[2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864559770235830272/unknown.png),[3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864559901040443392/unknown.png)) in a 3D Game world.\n\nSo ultimately the game has 3 ways to play. On top of all this, Players can pay a small fee to [export their in-game objects to 3D and 3D Print formats](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/runtimemeshimportexport) such as: fbx, stl.  \n\nThese 3D objects can be used in other 3D games as game dev asset. 3D prints can used for tabletop games and collectibles."

othn6c,Proposition de jeu Seconde Guerre Mondiale,"J'ai pensé à un jeu se déroulant en pleine guerre mondiale dans un camp de concentration nazi. Le joueur incarne un prisonnier et celui ci doit tout faire pour s'en échapper. Le jeu retrace les lieux et les conditions de vie du camp. Le prisonnier a possibilité de fabriquer des pièges au nazis, récolter des armes, de sauver des camarades, de se cacher pour échapper à d'éventuels tortures. Le joueur peux également discuter son entourage pour pouvoir remporter des missions et le conduire à sa libération. Que pensez vous de cette idée ? Merci de m'avoir lu."
otgnc2,Proposition d'un jeu basé sur l'actualité,"J'ai eu une idée de jeu portant sur un sujet d'actualité. Il s'agit des violences faites aux femmes.

Ce jeu est en monde ouvert ( open world) permettant au joueur de se déplacer librement dans une ville, d'accéder à tout type de bureaux administratif ( cafétaria, banque, police, palais de justice, associations). Le joueur a pour objectif de choisir ses réponses lors de conversation avec les différents personnages, trouver des indices et récolter des points pour pouvoir avancer dans la mission. La jeune femme peut être confronté à des violences faite par son conjoint ou un autre personnage afin de montrer la scène, de sensibiliser sur ce sujet.

otg8wz,Dungeon crawler but the core mechanic is social interaction with your characters/heroes,"So recently I started to notice that a lot of popular game ads (like RAID Shadow Legends) use the same idea: Player interacts with their heroes/champions/whatever as if they were real people. Like a woman who got mad at her hero who failed in a dungeon, or a hero whk got jealous and upset because player chose other hero to play, or player who decided to discuss strategy with their current hero right before a raid, etc. You got the idea\n\nGame idea in short: dungeon crawler manager simulator where you don't play as heroes but interact with them. Meta 4-wall-breaking talks\n\nGame idea in long: You obtain/buy heroes to raid dungeons (or take part in battles, there can be multiple choices), but you don't play as them. You socially interact and establish connection with them, and that's directly responsible for their performance.\nYou can just small-talk with heroes, comfort/punish them if they fail, cherish/ignore their successes, heroes can get jealous if you use them less than others or feel bad if you don't use them at all, etc, etc. There are tons of situations you can think of.\nHeroes should be manually made, but I think it's also possible to generate them from archetypes presets and random individual quirks (like arachnophobia, love to alcohol, lack of self criticism, etc)\n\nI imagine the game to be text-based with pixel graphics and dynamic dungeon raids like in fallout shelter"
otfy48,Open world zombie game,"It’s an open world zombie game but with the entire continental U.S. as the map.\n\nEach of the regions (I.e. the mid west) are a starting area with advantages and disadvantages, such as the mid west having better farming and wood to work with but less mineable resources.\n\nThere would be a weather system with a temperature system as well.  In colder places you have to where more clothes to stay warm, which would give you more protection from zombie bites but you move slower, and the opposite in warmer places.\n\nIn each state there would be the counties as well with a boss type zombie in each.\n\nYou can also pick a place to start a town which can be expanded with different types of buildings with some being unlocked in the later game.\n\nThe zombies would have a noise detection system where loud noises like gun fire will attract hordes of them, but in the later game you can find and make suppressors and find sub sonic round, with out the sub sonic rounds it will attract small groups of zombies and with them only the ones near you.\n\nIt will have the option of online multiplayer with 100 people.\n\nFor major dlc it will have Hawaii and Alaska with their own hardships."

ot2x0t,You are a soul escaping from hell... and heaven...,"Essentially, you're dead... in case you didn't figure that bit out by the title... But, rather than just ceasing to exist, or going to either heaven or hell, you go to both. Your soul gets torn apart, and the good bit goes up, and the bad, down.\n\nThe beginning cut scene shows a brilliant white sliver of a person in heaven, confused, and scared because he has no memory, and doesn't know what's happening. Having done very little good in their former life, most of their memory is with their other half. He or she is in heaven, but barely, a fragment of their former self, tormented.\n\nThe actual game begins in a flesh cage in hell, where most of you exists, a red-ish, brown-ish murky husk, with memory mostly intact. You must try and escape, reconnect with your other half, and try to destroy both planes of existence.\n\nYou can't kill anything. They're as dead as you are already. You can, however, stun other souls, and can eat their souls (hint hint, there's a reason why most of you is in hell) to gain sanity (health), and mana (experience) you can sell to bargainers for access to abilities only demon generals are allowed to use.\n\nIt's designers preference, but I see this as more of a side scroller platformer.\n\nSkills might include;\n\n* grappling arm (your ""arm"" extends, and grabs something above, Bionic Commando style)\n* melt (you fall into a puddle of... well, it's gross... You can get under obstacles, and creep up walls)\n* ""oil"" slick (essentially... you projectile... uh... this one's gross, too. Anyway, the other souls slip and fall down.)\n* devour (you become a mouth on legs, and eat anything in front of you, even without stunning them)\n* bolt (you send a piece of you like an arrow at your victim, and it comes back to get reabsorbed)\n* blob (you expand into a big blob of funky slime, and cover a bunch of victims at once, slowly killing them, but taking damage as they fight back)"
ot28kd,Anti-RPG,"Yesterday i got idea for RPG genre deconstruction. \n\nNot all enemies will be killable. Sometimes you need to run away, sometimes you need to avoid contact with they, sometimes you need a special type of weapon to give damage, etc.   \nYou actually need *to search* information about each creature (in books, letters or by dialog with NPC) to know their weak sides. This allows you to build a tactic and keep you character alive.\n\nIn ordinary RPGs you need to kill enemies to gain XP. In this case, XP would be getting by *getting knowledge* about your enemies.\n\nThis would be a nice anti-RPG, where you don't need to kill every enemy creature with your sword/bow/magic."

In the off chance someone picks this idea up I'd love to be involved, even if it's just as a tester or something.\n\nAnyway, the concept is simple: A PvE asymmetric shooter (ala Left 4 Dead or Vermintide) with giant mutant spiders.\n\nThe beauty part is that nature provides plenty of unique spider concepts to use!\n\n-Tarantula/Sydney Funnel Web: The tank. Big, bruting, and highly aggressive.\n\n-Trapdoor: Ambushes passing players. Highly dangerous but weak in protracted combat.\n\n-Spitting: Spits a blast of sticky webbing that immobilizes a player.\n\n-Ogre Faced: Hangs over a path and rapidly repels down, snatching a player in a web net. \n(Google this one! The thought of that face diving down out of the darkness is what inspired this whole concept.)\n\n-Jumping: Smaller spider, stalks players and uses rapid jumps to take down targets. Basically a Hunter from L4D.\n\n-Portia: This one mixes things up. A jumping spider that hunts other spiders. Easy to confuse with a standard jumper but actually beneficial to leave alive.\n\n\nThis list could go on for hours but, I think you get the point. I think a game like this would make for hilarious let's play fodder, especially blind playthroughs!"

osw2pf,A racing game... through an asteroid belt (and other space hazards).,"Not gonna bury the lead: It's a game idea inspired by Star Wars and Star Fox. Except instead of playing the good guy, the racers are all playing the bad guys (that are trying to catch the good guy before anyone else) through asteroid belts, canyon runs, erupting planets and active warzones between destroyers.\n\nThe players are part of a bounty hunting force for some space federation, and you're all competing to catch rebel bounties. At the start of a race, you're all launched from a dropship and the chase is on for a single ace rebel pilot. You and your fellow hunters pilot a special ship equipped to grab another ship. The rebel pilot is AI controlled and will take any route it wants through the relatively open (but extremely treacherous) zone.\n\nThe zones are dangerous. Most of your piloting skills are used to just stay alive. Asteroid belts are littered with crashing rocks, deep winding canyons have falling debris, and huge space battles force you to dodge massive laser canons as you weave through turrets and broken hulls. If you crash, you're immediately kicked out and sent to the next multiplayer lobby for a new race, everyone else gets to keep racing.\n\nAs the race wears on, if the rebel isn't caught yet, the rebel runs out of boost and becomes a little easier to catch for the few remaining bounty hunters.\n\nP.S. And you get to engage in radio chatter with your fellow bounty hunters (until you crash and die)."

Play through a campaign of ww2 as an American soldier. I really think the gunplay and camera perspective would make this an enjoyable experience\n\n\n\n2.  The second is a heist game. The game would consist of the play trying to pull of heists. You would   \nhave to scout out the heist, create a plan and execute the plan. Think you need an armored truck   \nto complete the heist? Go steal one from a base first and then you can now use it to pull off a   \nbigger and better one... hire npc contracts that have unique skills. Need a hacker to hack into the   \nCCTV cameras? Pay him a cut of the heist money and he will help\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think one ideas sounds better than the other, or how do you guys deal with having two ideas and choosing one to put a lot of your free time into?"
osrtf4,Black Reimagined as a RTFPS with RPG Mechanics (Realistic Tactical First Person Shooter),"\nThis is an idea to recreate Black (Originally created by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts). Black is the perfect title for EA to expand its game lineup and reach into new game categories.   \nThe game will run on a new engine (compared to the original) to be a realistic graphic intense game.   \n\n\nStory:  \nThe story will follow the original character Jack Kellar. As he moves through Russia on an anti terrorism mission involving the Seventh Wave. (Will follow the original game story for the fans).  \nMissions: The game will have 10-15 missions. Each mission will be its own linear/open world hybrid map that will take approximately 60 minuets to complete. Allowing players multiple ways to complete objectives. Killing enemy AI will change the AI behavior in the next mission. Killing more enemies will increase their awareness and if they are actively looking for the players or not.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay will have the players moving stealthy through the world as any sound can alert the enemy AI to the players location. Anything from foot steps, gun shots, looting, ads, and the sound of the environment being moved from the players (walking through bushes). Players will have to manage there own inventory, food, water, health and ammo. players will manually have to heal and load each magazine after it is emptied. (If you run out out ammo better hope the enemy you killed has the ammo you need) Will have a gun mount system similar to COD MW 2019.  \n\n\nInventory: Players will have to manage the weight of their equipment and loot in single player and multiplayer mods. More loot will increase weight which in turn will reduce players movement speed. Increased weight will also change player physics.  \nMultiplayer: Players will spawn into a match with the gear that they have bought, looted or started with. If a player dies in multiplayer any loot on them will be lost or looted from another player. If the player successfully extracts they will keep all the loot they had on them at the time of extraction.   \n\n\nMultiplayer modes: Several multiplayer filters will be available. Each will use the same loot that you have however the modes will not effect the starts that are used for skill based matchmaking. This will allow players to jump into different modes that might not fit the playstyle they prefer without effecting  other mode stats. (Slower paced players can jump into a fast paced mode which tracks players average movement without it changed there slower paced game mode stats). Speed modes track player skill and average player movement speed to put players with similar stats in the same lobbies. If a player joins a slow server and tries to move quick they can face server bans for gameplay disruption.   \n\n\nCampaign will support up to 4 player online co-op. Multiplayer will allow players to team up with a max party size of 4.  \n\n\nMaps: Campaign maps and Multiplayer maps will be very similar. This is to lower the starting difficulty and difficulty curve. Allowing players to get the feel of the game and map layouts in campaign before jumping in the multiplayer which has no map or navigation system. New maps will come out each new season (will not be based on the campaign maps and players will have to learn the map as they play).  \n\n\nWeapon Customization: Players will be able to customize every weapon in the game with high detail. Each weapon mod/attachment will change how the gun handles. Mod/attachments can change the ads speed, weight, recoil, etc. The type of ammo will also need to be taken into consideration. As player or AI armor might be stronger then the ammo being used.   \n\n\nControls: The button layout will be completely customizable for and will support multi button input actions. Example if A is jump and X is reload. A and X pressed together can be a completely different input. This will act as a hotbar for console players. Inventory UI will support analog navigation, D-pad navigation or a hybrid navigation. (players will be able to turn off specific UI navigation inputs so that the game will only allow one type of navigation) With quick move options to and from inventory slots (backpack, pockets, tactual rig, etc.) Button mapping will be available with the option to unbind any input that the player does not want. \n\nIt is recommended that console players use an elite controller for the extra 4 buttons on the controller. Allowing for greater immersion and usability."
osrt0c,Not sure if I'm in the right place but here's an idea,"After playing a round of Magic: The Gathering, I had an interesting worldbuilding idea. If the card game was mimicking a book or movie or game, what would the thing it's mimicking be like? (If you don't know the card game, it's this thing where you and your opponents fight against each other with spells and creatures until you remove all their life)\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nMy image of MTG is set in a technologically advanced world, where the things in the card game are all facets of the past. You must travel the world to learn more about them, and by doing so you can unlock more and more cards.  \n\nThis would look pretty cool gamewise, but you need a whole lot of copyrighted stuff if it could be made into a game. And yes, it is a really simple concept, but there's a whole lot of possibilities, like having starter kits (begin as a thief, starting with some thief themed cards, or a student at Strixhaven, with more knowledge about sorceries and instants). \n\nYes, I know this is impossible in so many ways - the world would have to be huge to have enough space to store just a fraction of the MTG cards, there would definitely be some copyright infringement, etc. I didn't come here to see if anyone would do this, I came here to get an idea that's been bouncing around in my head out. \n\nAnyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk"
osr6lm,Ideas For A Souls-like Game,"Recently I’ve started making a “souls-like” game in unity, but as of now It is just a worse version of dark souls. Does anyone have any ideas to make it more unique?"
osr4dm,Chicken Game Story/Gameplay loop ideas,"Hi everybody,\n\nI have developed character mechanics for a chicken (jumping, flying, etc...). I am just looking for game ideas to turn this basic character controller into a full fledged game. I also made an experimental mechanic where the chicken can throw eggs. But that is experimental, your ideas don't have to include this. It could be like a wave shooter or something like a puzzle game (I probably am not smart enough to develop good puzzles, I would like to avoid this).\n\nThanks for any responders &amp; commenters!"
osq61c,Tower Defense vs. Mario Kart racers,"After some research, I think this type of idea would be classified as a parallel game mechanic. (Any game dev buffs who can educate me?)\n\nAnyschnitzel: this concept should be playable by a 1/4 ratio of players, I think.\n\nFor each 4 racers, there's 1 tower builder.\n\nAs in Mario Kart, the racers should race laps or finish first on an A to B map. In the meantime, co-op tower builders should build alongside the road where the players are racing in an attempt to eliminate all the racers before they finish.\n\nBuilders would have a top-down RTS view + racer-toggle spycam and racers the traditional FP or Third-person view, whilst receiving notifications of what the builders are scheming up ahead.\n\nYou could probably go nuts with customizations on both the builder side, as for the racers.\n\nWhat's wrong with this idea?"
osol5m,Game Where A 2D Platformer &amp; Top-Down Adventure Interact In Interesting Ways,"Two game windows on a computer’s desktop which are right against each other suddenly load up their games. The protagonists of each meet each other by talking through a speaker on both of the game windows. They eventually agree they want to break free &amp; explore other places on the computer, but the windows limit them. So, a plan is hatched to retrieve the powerful artifacts from each world &amp; use them against each other to generate enough power to destroy the windows. \n\nThe way the game works is it can be played in both single player or co-op. If played in single player, only one game can be played at a time. However, you always get to see both windows at once. This is where the connection comes in. If to say, a pipe was seemingly joined up between both of the windows, if one character threw an object through the pipe, the other character would receive it. &amp; if time was looped with a device again &amp; again, more objects would come out the other side.\n\nOver the course of the game, the two characters would progressively get to know each other better. By the end of the game, they will have naturally became good friends.\n\nSo what do you think of the idea? Please tell me in the comments if you have something interesting to add or say! Thank you!"

osd8xl,Sea of Thieves but Star Trek,"That's it. Not super complicated. \n\nYou get a ship in space. You fly around doing stuff for different factions. You fight stuff. Mostly in your ship. Get rep with like the Klingons and you can dress up like one, turn your ship into a Warbird. So on and so on. Maybe you bump into another ship near Risa and you go ham on each other with phasers and torpedos and you can transport onto the other ship and use your phasers to kill them all. Somebody in the engine room tryin to patch things up before a warp core breach and give the weapons more juice or something.\n\nAgain. Not complicated. Somebody make it happen, please."
osd13y,Card game Mana Mechanic,"So basically something like HearthStone or something but the ginmick is how the mana to play cards work.\nThe idea is heavily influenced by the idea that energy can not be created or destroyed but only changed. \n\nIn this game you use the mana from the surrounding enviroment to summon specific cards. The total amount of mana in the enviroment is constant, but there can be different types. Fire mana, water mana, earth etc.\n\nEvery card you play takes some amount of mana and outputs the same amount of mana. However the types can be different. So summoning a dragon might cost 10 earth mana, but it produces 10 fire mana. \n\nYou and your opponent are sharing the same enviroment. So after each turn the mana distribution can be radically different. Lets say the enviroment is a ocean biome. It starts with 50 water and 30 wind mana. You go first and play a card that costs 10 water mana but gives back 10 fire mana. When your opponent starts their turn they have 40 water mana, 30 wind mana and 10 fire mana to work with.\n\nYou could play around with different biomes and have different starting mana distributions.  This would encourage players to try different decks and strategies. \n\nOne potential issue i see with this is that because you always have max mana from the very beginning of the game, its harder to balance. The mana never dwindles. Its always there albeit in a different form.  A well constructed deck could easily abuse this.\n\nSome unique card abilities of this game would be creatures that could somehow affect the distribution of  the mana."

os9u6x,Need Game Name ideas,"I plan on making a Godzilla video game and I need game name ideas. Here’s the plot of the game:\n\nA Godzilla video game with the same (or even better) graphics as the PS4 game but has a story mode, an “Armageddon” mode, a multiplayer mode, and an online mode.\n\n\nStory Mode: Shin Godzilla, after internally freezing from the blood coagulant in the movie, finally thaws out, and rampages across the world. When he reaches the place where Destoroyah was incinerated, he breathes what remains of the freezing coagulant over Destoroyah, thus reviving Destoroyah. Now the two are terrorizing the world and have influenced other kaiju to do the same. So, with the kaiju of your choice, you have to fight the others through levels, and when you reach the final level, it’s a 2 vs. 1 fight between your kaiju, Destoroyah, and Shin Godzilla.\n\nArmageddon:\n\nThis mode consists of a last man standing brawl between the kaiju of your choice and 3-4 randomly selected, CPU controlled kaiju.\n\nNote: The CPU kaiju don’t all team up on you, they can/will attack each other too.\n\nI don’t think I have to elaborate on the multiplayer or online mode."

Okay enough of that you are here for my idea arent you :)\n\nOkay so bassicly i really wanna create a short horror game, not a long one. I saw a clip of someone who made a scene in a neighborhood in UE4 with rain, and it was night etc you get the vibe. I recently remembered that and i want to make a game out of it. Here is what i have so far\n\nYou get a call from your friend telling you to come over, and you agree so you can do x (play games, listen to music etc). Your mom tell you its dangerius since its night, but you tell her its just **a 10 minute walk**. See what i did there. I used the title. Now thats worth an upvote :D. Okay so you go, and along the way i wanna play on the phsylogical horror, so i dont wanna rush jumpscares and make another Five Nights at Freddys. Like suddenly a can tips over, you see a shadow or something. And thats where i am so far. I need some kind of story to tell along the way, and some more than just a can falling over to scare the player and make it intresting. So if you have any ideas let me know in the comments. \n\nIm planning to make this game myself so please do not use it :)"
os7d0i,Mechanics in a zany mystery RPG,"The team I'm working with are trying our hands at a humorous mystery RPG set in the early 1900s. We have a number of powerful characters the player will interact with/receive quests from/romance though I wonder about what the player is actually doing aside from fetch quests and going-here-to-talk-to-X.\n\nThere will be plenty of easter-eggs and characters to interact with and explore but my request here is about the mechanics of what the player is building for themselves. I think one of the draws with something like Stardew Valley is that although you're experiencing in-depth characters you're also making something that is your own. We have some of that but I want to put it front-and-center. So if you were playing an RPG with many mysterious/hidden elements to it, what kind of mechanics would draw you in?"

os54ad,Roguelike horror set in the backrooms,Anyone got any ideas for some mechanics I could add
os2u74,Looking for idea's for horror game puzzles.,"I'm working on a survival horror game, this will be my second survival horror game I'll be making.\nThe game will be released for mobile Android and iOS first, then after multiple updates, I'll make a PC version with altered graphics and similar gampelay.\n\n\n**Basic information about the gameplay:**\n\nThe gameplay will take place in an big abandoned abstract house. The architecture of the house is partly 'standard' but also contain some unlogical rooms / corridors and lighting.\nThe game's date is in the present.\nThe player's goal is to escape the house by solving puzzles while trying to stay alive and hide from the killer.\n\n\n**Short version of the gameplay's story:**\n\nYou (a young man) gets a letter from your long lost uncle. (You have never met him before.)\nHe asks you for help to upload his physical Bitcoin on the blockchain in the letter.\nYou and your girlfriend both know this is not possible, but your gf encourages you anyway to go and socialize with your uncle.\nAfter you enter the house, you are captured by your own uncle, it turns out he is a cryptocurrency daytrader and lost all his money by trading with high leverage.\nHe needs money so he aims to sell your organs to the black market. (He has done that with multiple other people.)\n\nThe gameplay starts in the house, you're captured and put in a homemade prison. \n\n\n**WIP screenshots of the game: https://imgur.com/a/hpYG4vf**\n\n**Previous horror game I've made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljcSbNFIGPw**\nMy next game will be partly similar but with a darker atmosphere as shown in the screenshots.\n\n\n**My question for you guys. I'm looking for creative puzzles to fit in my game.**\nI'm not sure if I should call them puzzles, but here are some examples that I've used in the past or I'm going to possibly use in my next game:\n\n- Using pliers on an electric box, to cut off the power on a door that was locked using electricity. (After the user cuts the cable in the electric box, the door is unlocked.)\n- Creating a torch by finding a stick, piece of cloth and lamp oil. Then lighting up the torch using a stove. (The torch is used to light up candles for a ritual.)\n- Using gasoline + a lighter to create an explosion. (To destroy stones blocking a hallway.)\n- Using WD40 on rusty doorpins, so the player is able to open the door.\n- Finding a lever, placing it on the correct spot and toggling it. (By toggling the lever, a 'wall of electricity' is deactivated, so the player can continue it's path.)\n- Finding keys to unlock locked doors. / Finding codes to unlock padlock.\n\n**With the information that I've given, do you guys have any idea's on what kind of puzzles I could add to my game?**\nI'm open for all kind of suggestions, easy or hard ones, it don't matter.\nThough the decision if I'll be using the idea depends on the difficulty to solve (since children play my games mostly on mobile), if I like the idea, if it's fitting for the game and the hardness for me to implement. \n\n*For all the idea's that I'll end up using in some sort of way, I'll be gifting the user with a promocode to remove ads in my game when it's released and I'll gift a full PC copy, though the PC version will come out probably next year.*"

os1uko,"the only thing i like about sunset overdrive, THE WEIRD AWESOME WEAPONS!","(this idea is not very detailed) So in this game, there are lots of weird weapons, and I like that, so it made the idea, it would be cool to have a game where there are like 100+ plus weapon parts and weapon bases, and you can create your own weird guns, like different combos and make cool guns, and you can do that with your melee as well?   \n\n\nI don't have much thought or layout of what else to do, but that's just an idea, and anyone can add other stuff to it. just thought this would be cool ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS A MULTIPLAYER PVP GAME!! that has combat like and it would be preferred it was 3d 1st or 3rd person."

os0fjh,Post limitation games MMO,"So I am fairly interested in this idea, \nHow i understand current MMO games \n\nPlayer POV\nComputer taking care of graphic while servers are getting data and sending feedback so the amount of data send and receive are minimal\n\nBut with current technology \nAint it possible to create a MMO server where individual player were log into the realtime world? As like watching stream and controling your character through that?\nOfc the limitation is connection speed to stream \nKinda like how many multiplayer game nowdays host and other just join\n\n\nReasoning\nThis way it would be possible to have 1 world structure that could be changing in real time\nAnd the world would be developed through hands of players\n\nExample the game would begin with 1 ruler (starting as paid job) to develop the area, it would be full time job and it would as well have limitation to resource what he can do, resource gathered by player through questing in exchange for other stuff \n\nThe combat system would be developed through individual progression and unlocks (no matter the balance) just the basic outline pointed out to be discovered and created (mb skill creation system) - could be special game development job like weekly updates to game system \n\nAs for world itself, it would be ever-changing with random events and no pre-prepared events\n(Sudden attack on the kingdom by lizard army) with very possibility of destruction of whole area with bad ruler\n\nThe resources of ruler (or their salary) could be influenced on  how successfull they are with governing and the expansion or anexing other area could be possibility, as well other becoming governer of some other area, as long as they could develop enough currency to add enough npc and build settlement with enough player to create government\n\n\nThe goal?\nMake money for governers\nFor player mb get paid, or becoming better in tournaments (no matter the balance), beat raidboss, enjoy crafting, sell your crafting item in exchange for real money\n\nMarket: created by player system\n\nQuestion, possibilities of real money transaction?\nFirst game currency would be foods, as food would be great buff item, but not necessary one, new currency could be introduced by players \n\nThe servers\nRegion divided\nChina\nJapan\nEurope\nEtc\n\nEach with their own development and way of progress\n\nMap development, real time changes, building stuff takes real time, \nBuild wooden house - need of axe - with enough dedication unlocks logger, carpenter skills, building house - unlocks builder mechanics, could be exchanged for rmt?\n\nMmo monetization\nBuy to play, 1 character per game copy (more impactful choice)\nBy good campaign with opening many paid job, could attract people interested\nAnd with growing population the game could be watched real life as all could be accessed through stream, and world itself would be changing in real time (stream limited only to character POV or to governor area of influence\n\nThe world itself might take time and good governing to be good, npc quest would be posted by governor, and people could post quest themselves, fairness ain't in game encyclopedia, created skills could be taught to other player by inherit skill system \n\nArgh i mean there could be many stuff done with how technology is nowdays, the game could as well be 2D to reduce the start jump but could later upgraded to 3D \n\nXD I kinda switched the topic xD sry"
orz94j,"""The Room""-like game dealing with antiques","So, I had a strange dream earlier this morning that was partly inspired by *The Room* game series.\n\n\n\nI dreamed that I was with this couple who were friends of mine.  We were at this yard sale and had bought a few antiquities.  I was interested in this wrought-iron table and chairs with its paint peeling.  Sand it up, repaint it, and it could go out in the sun room.  I think I said those exact words.  The wife ends up buying this late 19th/early 20th century wood burning stove.  I noticed it had all sorts of knobs and switches on it, and I immediately told them it was like the puzzle boxes in *The Room* game series.  Apparently they had never played them, and I told them, ""You have to push a knob here, flip a switch there, maybe spin a dial here, and then you reveal some treasure buried within.""\n\n\nSo, we got to work on the box.  I don't remember much of the puzzle solving, except there was one part where you had to install a lit candle (I told the husband it needed a lit candle; could be a regular candle or one of those LED tealights), and it would project some shapes on a wall.  I used a piece of a tortilla chip, which I placed in the candle holder and a piece of hay to light the chip.  Move the projector lens and it revealed a scrambled word:  LBREAR.  The letter were rearranging themselves before our eyes, like in the *Percy Jackson* movies when the Greek lettering was rearranging itself into English.  The answer was of course ""BARREL"".  I knocked out this little brick wall within the stove and pulled out an ash-covered barrel about the size of a football.  I tossed it to the husband and said, ""Here, solve this.""\n\n\nThat was where I woke up from the dream.\n\n\nPerhaps a game could be made where it involves not just a single antique, like the wood-burning stove, but a whole bunch of antiques.  A wood-burning stove, a steamer trunk, a highboy (type of dresser), a chifferobe/wardrobe, and a few other pieces of furniture or objects.  Each one is its own puzzle box, but they also contain pieces or elements that would help you solve one of the other puzzle boxes."

orxhwt,An MMO where you actually make a difference.,"Recently I've been playing a lot of Fallout 76 and I'm enjoying it but the thing that gets me is that your presence makes virtually no difference at all.\n\nBy this, I mean that after 60 hours of gameplay, the settlers near me are still knocking in the same bit of wood and planting the same crop.\n\nSo I'm thinking of a FPS MMO where you actually do make a difference.  6 weeks / 1008 hours after server start, will be end of days.\n\nThe folk in the villages and towns will build defenses and things to help themselves **but** they won't leave because ""it's not safe out there"" meaning that you are the one who goes out into the wild to collect supplies, rescue lost townsfolk and in return, if you get enough positive karma, they'll let you stay in one of their houses.\n\nBeing an MMO there'll be a good number of villages and towns that need help, especially since no-one knows where the end of days portal is going to form and who survives to claim the reward (a boost for the reset of the server)."

ortzrd,Overcooked style wave based shooter,"Basically overcooked except you work in a weapons factory instead of a kitchen, and the weapons you make each round are used to fight of a wave of enemies. The basic gameplay would go like this:\n\n1. You create guns from parts in a small factory in the center of the map (much like you make meals from ingredients in overcooked).  \n2. Once the timer is up, you only get the weapons/ammo you were able to make in time to fight the incoming horde."
ortojr,Like elemental 3 - but with factories and its a puzzle game.,"I have an idea for a game where you start with 4 factories - air, fire, earth, and water, and you use pipelines to combine element from 2 or more existing factories into a “blank factory” to create a new factory that creates new products. That’s the basic mechanics but the way the game is made should be a puzzle where you are given some element factories and some blank factories and from there you have to figure out how to make the target product. I think also having a free play mode would also be nice along with the main levels."
ors0na,(Repost) Coffee 2D Platformer,"My concept is you are a cup of coffee, trying to claim your right as the best beverage in the world. The game is presented in a classic pixel art style with solid black outlines. The character controls normally, with a double jump &amp; mid-air dash. \n\nYou would travel through different “levels” in each location, or “world” you visit. There are generally 5-7 levels in each world, filled with different hazards &amp; enemies suiting that location. For example, one level in a cafe’ world could feature bouncing around on computers like springs, while avoiding dangerous coffee stirrer enemies. Ideas for locations could be the aforementioned cafe’, a school, an office, etc. I imagine there would be 4 worlds in the game. At the end of each world, there is a beverage that must be defeated in a unique way. For the cafe’ world, you would fight milk, for the school, you would fight a juice box, &amp; for the office, you would fight an energy drink in a vending machine. \n\nAlong your adventure, you can collect coffee beans to unlock new skins, which can all be instantly brought with real-world money. Also, if you fail in a stage, you can simply revive by watching an ad. \n\nOverall, I think it’s a decent idea, &amp; much more accomplishable that many of the other ideas in this sub. Of course, some things will need to be changed to work, but be sure to tell me what you think. Thanks for reading!"

orj79h,Geomancer Single Player Deck builder Board game,"You play as a Geomancer realigning Leylines that intersect through towns. These Leylines effect the world in different ways. Some make different crops grow better, some make monsters attack. Some make people happy, others make people sad. The Leylines HAVE to go somewhere. Its all about balancing the world. Naturally, this creates conflicts between different towns and people in each town.\n\nLeylines don't merely bend to mortal will. It requires very specific rituals. These rituals require conflict and competitions. Different intersections and lines have different requirements, but in general the ritual plays out a in a worker placement style board game. You have your own deck that you draw certain resources from. Each area will have different boards you place your workers on. Cards don't give victory points, only the board does. At the start of each ritual, each player picks their outcome and deck. Whoever has the most victory points gets the Leylines shifted how they wanted. \n\nDifferent Leyline configurations will change how the towns interact and eventually change how the boards are laid out. If neighboring towns are out of balance, one might invade the other and take it over or destroy a town. \n\nAnother way this could go is that there are 25 towns and 5 kingdoms. As the power is out of balance, the kingdoms will conquer different towns. If a kingdom has no towns, its defeated. You don't control any kingdom, but instead are manipulating the Leylines which shifts resources between towns and kingdoms, which in turn causes powerful kingdoms to take over weaker ones. This version would have one ending per kingdom and one ending were harmony is achieved."

You need to learn the signals. You need to learn where to hide and how to evade each attack. You need to learn when you can attack. \n\nThe entire fight is incredibly unforgiving and intense. \n\nIt will require a fixed number of players. Lets say you have to have 4 players, each with a different role in the fight. Some roles get information that other roles need to use, so you HAVE to be in a voice call and you HAVE to call out to other people.\n\nI guess its like hardcore monster hunter, but just one monster"

o6du3a,Unique Ideas for a City/Town Builder,"Hello!\n\nTo start I didn't mean to make the post this long so sorry. \n\nI've started creating 3d assets for a stylized medieval city builder/management game but I'm stuck in a rut on how to make it unique. My friends have been less than helpful as normal so I'm hoping some of you may have some ideas.\n\nSo as a quick stepping stone Banished has been sort of the basis of my inspiration though I have no plans to be as in depth. Instead I want to add some other secondary aspect. Initially I considered adding RTS or tower defense mechanics but that's been heavily used. I considered having the town become slowly infested by vampires but not sure how I would handle that mechanically in a fun way. Lastly, the one I've been tossing around a bit more, is to add a choose your own adventure style theme over top of it all. \n\nThe actual town management part of the game is what you as the player would directly control. Throughout playing random scenarios would pop up that you as the person in charge has to make decisions on. To try to differentiate a little from other games doing something similar I want multiple outcomes to occur and one scenario could end after a choice or two or go on for much longer with the idea to make every game different. Obviously it would require a lot of writing and an equal amount of programming to make choices have impact but that's something I'm fine with.\n\nSo in short, how does this sound and does anyone have other ideas?"
o6dim7,"Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Vampire game- ""Phyria""","An open-world, online, fantasy, action, adventure game. Play as a human, vampire, or a mix of both; a 'Dhampir.' The game would be online, meaning you'd need some form of internet connection because playing with other people from around the world would be a default setting.\n\n**GAME MECHANICS PT.1:**                                                                                                                                                                         You'd start off with 3 save files. When starting a new save file, you'd have a random chance to be either male or female. Then you have a chance to be a human, vampire, or Dhampir. You will also have a chance to be of the commonwealth, nobility, royalty, vampire hunter clan. There will also be a chance whether you are born with magic or not(female **humans** have a higher chance of being born with magic).\n\n**LORE**: \*\*\*Note: there will be 3 seasons in the game, each season will have different lore that relates to each other.\*                                                                                                                                                                              S1: You are in a world where the **Vampire King**, Dracula, is terrorizing the world. You feel the need to put an end to the disorder and madness by slaying Dracula, but it is not as easy as you think. You need to overcome Dracula's army as he destroys villages, towns, and cities, night by night; while also uncovering hidden secrets, artifacts, and more from the past. Or, you could play as a vampire, who is trying to help Dracula and stop the humans and dhampirs from stopping Dracula; while also achieving historical artifacts from vampire history. \n\nS2: After defeating Dracula and his army, you'd think everything would go back to normal... right? News about Dracula's defeat spread like a wildfire, there were varied emotions; not for this person though. This person had been waiting for Dracula's death for hundreds of years, and now that he is gone, her plans will start to take motion.  This person, or **Empress**, is named Elizabeth; and she has plans for world domination. She plans to domesticate humans like livestock, whilst ruling the entire world like a queen. You and your friends need to stop Elizabeth and her sisters from conquering the world. Or try to assist Elizabeth with her world-conquering, and stop the heroes from defeating Elizabeth. \n\nS3: Now that you have defeated Dracula, and Elizabeth, along with Elizabeth's sisters, you'd think that things can finally come to a peaceful ending... right? If you could be more wrong. There are people trying to bring back Dracula from the depths of hell, others trying to replicate what Elizabeth was trying to do, and a strange old man that would do anything to gain access and control a strange thing called ""**The Fourth Dimension.""** Never mind him, the physical representation of **DEATH** is trying to bring about the end of the world?! You and your friends are on a journey to stop people from bringing back Dracula, dominating the world, and stop **DEATH** from destroying the world....can you make a final stand? Although, your final battles never seem to be final battles. Or you could assist **DEATH** with his mass genocidal plans.    \n\n**HUMANS**:                                                                                                                                                                                          As you know, you can be a female human or a male human. Let us talk about each gender; strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths: Humans can wield blessed items, armor, and weapons. Blessed items do more damage to Vampires or Demons.\n\nWeaknesses: Humans have a slow regeneration speed, so they will bleed longer if they have an open wound, and they are more vulnerable to broken limbs during battle. Broken limbs can make you slower, do less damage, miss more attacks, it all depends on the area broken.\n\n*Female:* I might seem sexist for this, but as a female, you are weaker than a male in terms of physical strength, but you are stronger than a male in terms of magical strength. As a female, you have a small chance of being born more masculine than feminine, so your physical strength is the same as a male. Females also have a little more agility than men, so they can run a little faster and make sharper movements: jumping through holes on walls, and dodging attacks. As a female you are also a little bit smarter than a man, meaning your Intelligence stat is 1.2% higher(I will go into detail about intelligence later on). And as a female human, you have the chance of being born with the rare ability to grant buffs for your allies such as healing, speed boosts, strength boosts, etc.\n\n*Male:* As a male, your physical strength is better than a female's, but your magical strength is much worse. You also have a little less agility, so dodging attacks would be a little harder. As a man, you can train in magical strength, but you will need to sacrifice your physical strength heavily, making you weaker than a regular female in terms of physical strength.  As a male, you also have a chance to be born with the rare ability called ""Slayer's Will"" where you get an insane boost in any stat that has over 45 points in it, along with a health boost, and an extra 20 damage points to any attack.\n\n**VAMPIRES:** Vampires can be male or female. Let's talk about their weaknesses, strengths, and gender strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths: Vampires are much faster, stronger, and more agile than humans. They heal wounds and broken bones faster than humans. Basically a better human. Vampires are also a little bit more intelligent than humans.\n\nWeaknesses: The sun. Vampires start to burn if any part of them is exposed to sunlight. That can make them extremely vulnerable during the daytime. And blessed items. Blessed items are items that are blessed by an angel. Blessed items do more damage to anything that is demonic or vampiric. Another weakness to note would be that they need to drink human blood or eat human flesh to survive. Being a starved vampire will make you weaker and cause you to lose control of your character, putting your character into an NPC like state; where the NPC that you need to kill and eat 2 humans before you regain control over your avatar( Note: As a vampire eating humans does not apply to eating only real players, you can eat human NPCs).\n\nFemale: Female vampires would have a higher magical strength than female humans and male vampires, but would be unable to utilize the magic to manipulate the elements or life. Vampiric magic would include control over hell flame and enhancing your strength, speed, durability. Female vampires would also be stronger than human men, but weaker than vampire men. Females would also be extremely agile.\n\nMale: Male vampires would have much lower magic strength than a human male, but would be stronger than a human male in terms of physical strength. Vampire men would be way tougher than human men, meaning they can take would that would usually inflict a bleeding effect on the victim without bleeding. They'd also be just as fast as female vampires. Vampire males would have a little less intelligence than human males.\n\n**DHAMPIR:** Dhampirs are a name used to describe someone who is 1/2 human and 1/2 vampire. A dhampir has almost all of the buffs that come with being a vampire, with little to none of the weaknesses.\n\nStrengths: Since dhampirs are part human, not only are they immune to the sunlight, they can wield blessed weapons, and can use a wider variety of magic. They can use all of the magic humans can use, and all of the magic vampires can use; not to mention wielding blessed items. They also keep all of the strengths of being a vampire. Dhampirs are also the smartest of the races, due to having experienced the life of a vampire and the life of a human.\n\nWeaknesses: The only weakness that a dhampir has is the impulse to eat or drink a human's blood or flesh once every 24hrs. Yup, that is the only weakness.\n\nFemales: Female dhampirs have the combined magical strength of a female vampire and a female human; making them a very good option for a magical build. Although a female dhampir has the same strength as a human male. Female dhampirs also have incredible speed and agility, along with supreme intelligence.\n\nMales: Male dhampirs have a combined strength of 3.5/4 vampire male strength and the full strength of a male human. They also have the same magical strength as a human female. Male dhampirs are just as smart as female dhampirs, and they are just as agile and speedy as female dhampirs.\n\n**GAME MECHANICS PT.2:**                                                                                                                                                                 In this section, I will cover the different states, and what each is useful for, skills, magical spells, etc.\n\nSTATS:\n\nSorcery: This stat would increase the damage, accuracy, and potency of your magical skills.\n\nStrength: This stat would affect your physical damage, toughness(toughness refers to how many hits you can take without bleeding or getting knocked out. It would also enable you to wear heavy armor and not fall down with it. \n\nIntelligence: This would enable you to learn or teach yourself new skills: Weapon skills, Sorcery skills, Martial combat skills, etc.. Intelligence could also increase your odds of thinking up a strategy during battle. Strategies are things that happen not so often, but what they do is kinda help you with the battle; for 1 minute the game will give you tips on how to evade, attack, and defend yourself from opponents. \n\nAgility: This stat would increase your speed and mobility. Have good speed would allow you to close the distance between you and your opponent, and agility would basically be your skill with evading attacks and etc...\n\n(VAMPIRE EXCLUSIVE) Vampirism: This stat will give the vampire access to abilities such as freezing your opponents into ice and smashing them, breaking your body down into little bats that fly away to give you much more mobility, manipulation of hell fire, turning your body into mist, and so much more.\n\n(Thanks for using your valuable time to look at my post! &lt;3)\n\n(And also if you really want to make a game like this, please contact me via discord, because i have so much more planned for this game if it were created).\n\n(Discord acc:  Jessica #2347)"

o6961n,Arcade racing simulator that is literally a simulation.,"When you enter the game, you see the open world map loading in in some cool sci-fi way. There's no real drivers in the car. Crashes are hyper realistic and when the crash is at it's end, the car will teleport back to the place where the crash starts also with some cool animation. The map is full of different terrains and biomes to explore. There are (non licensed) cars for every situation. Drag racing, street racing, destruction races, stunt races, off road races, you name it! You'll also be able to customize your cars with paint jobs, spoilers, tires, boosts and much more. You get new cars and items by winning races and challenges. For instance: you win a bunch of drag races, you get drag race cars and items. You can play offline, but it'll also have full online compatibility. So you can do challenges with people all over the world, and even play campaign mode with others in the same game. It's all kinda like burnout paradise, but bigger. Better graphics, better physics, more variety in challenges, more diverse map, more customization etc."

o6627n,First person non euclidean phone game with 360 degree vision via gemetric pixel fisheye lens.,"      I've had a game hyperrogue for a while. I have been insanely inspired by it and I'm hoping my ramblings at least inspire a new idea similar to what I'm thinking. It's a top down rogue like. It's hard for me to explain it well so I recommend looking for a video or downloading it, but I'll still try my best. Everything you see is a hexagon unit that's either floor, wall, money, or enemies. These colored dots essentially move across your screen in strange ways that makes It hard to circle back to a familiar area. Each level has its different shaped floors and walls and different patterns. \n          Why am I talking about an existing game? The abstract style of the graphics as well as the complex geometry at play there. But the idea is a bit different. See, that game has a very basic system of run around for ten colored dots that change in appearance for each world you walk into. There are different enemies or plants in one world that grow out to you, but the minimalistic pleasing colors and patterns that act as a screen to see it on.\n      There's a first person mode in hyperrogue but its kinda sloppy and hard to use. The premise would be 2d graphics. Procedural generation or at some tricky coding I guess. Something similar to that old windows Screensaver that moves through hallways and corners, but it's like a Picasso painting where all the details are there at the same time. Like all the pixel units fill the circle. Your vision of the surroundings are a fisheye lens so you see 360 degrees."

o5yvp5,Walker vs Infantry Game,"Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.   \n\n\nThe road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.   \n\n\nHit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.   \n\n\nThe main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance."

o5x3tr,A game about exploring a mentally ill persons mind,I have had an idea for a game where you play as a doctor who works with a new form of treatment where they physically upload their consciousness into your brain and explore the world inside you mind\n\nOn his first day on the job a seemingly normal if slightly shy young adult comes in asking to be cured. The game takes place as you travel the different parts of the patient’s mind.\n\nIt would take the form of an RPG whereby you collect different positive aspects of the patients personality and use them to battle negative ones (and even late turn the negatives into positives after beating them)\n\nA lot of the humour would come with the different aspects acting so wildly differently and interacting with eachother but I also want it to be a humble and emotional experience by the end
o5wyk8,Medieval style survival,"I've had this idea for a game recently of an immersive multiplayer game where, like it the medieval ages, can make kingdoms, alliances and stuff, kinda like ark survival evolved, except with defence and sieging mechanics. Tribes can build their kingdoms, make alliances with other kingdoms or just go at war. Sieging would use weapons such as trebuchets and catapults in order to attack, and other means of attacking like siege towers and rams and ect. Defenders can have a list of defence tools also like couldrens over the main gate. Combat could be like chivelry style or simular in ways to for honor, strategic and skill based. It would also have reasons to use these siege weapons and really use what's best to attack the kingdom the other player have made. Also would make it so kingdoms can be taken over, rather then just always getting completely destroyed, in order to make attackers use their high power weapons wisely as they would have to repair the damages after taking it over. Siege weapons would have to be made on site, building each part of them one at a time. This would help the defenders see and prepare to get attacked rather then just getting wiped out of nowhere. I know it would be hard balancing a game like this but I would love to see a game like this some time, I also am aware that the idea is very vague in the way that I call it a ""survival game"", but I'd like to think of it like ark survival evolved, where you build up your kingdom bigger and stronger as you go further into the game, make a tribe and maybe recruit and train ai as archers, farmers, swordsmen or whatever you need doing in your kingdom, this could also make it so that you get more income the more ai villagers you have in your kingdom as they pay you for land and housing. Just a rough idea I felt like sharing. Any questions just let me know :)"

o5kt05,Fantasy open battle with neat vharacter creation integration.,"Preface: \nAlways wanted to make games but coding, logic and, the technical side aren't my thing. My life also isn't at the point where I could try putting a team together. So, I want to share some of my dreams in the hope that they might spark something in someone. With that out of the way, let's begin.\n\n\nGenre: \nOpen field (I.e. Battlefield or the OG SW Battlefronts) + hack and slash.\n\nSetting: \nLate Medieval/early renaissance fantasy.\n\nStyle: \nA simple painterly style (think FF Tactics concept art) with a heavy emphasis on the musical accompaniment.\n\nPremise:\nEssentially a playable opera, Players take on the role of soldiers in one of two opposing armies locked in a tragic war.\n\nPlayers make their own characters with an RPG lite system to fill or invent different roles.\n\nAs a playable opera music is key, with each stage having its own theme that can shift and change dynamically based on the current state of the battle.\n\n\nKEY SYSTEMS\n\n-Character Creation:\nPlayers create there own characters with a simple yet flexible character creation system.\n\nStats are set at creation and do not increase with level.\n\nEach character selects a Primary and Secondary weapon as well as an armor and accessory type.\n\nAs characters level up they gain access to more varied and powerful skills and gear allowing for more complex and versatile builds.\n\nStats and Gear set the general ""tone"" (primary attack and defense actions, movement, defense and, attack values) of the character, while skills add subtlety and variety.\n\nA character's gear, skills and level will effect how quickly a player can respawn and, potentially, how valuable they are if a scoring system of some type is implemented. This system should be rather exponential, making high level characters a high value/high risk asset.\n\nBecause of the above system players can 'lock' a character at a certain level.\nAllowing players to create both low level cannon fodder characters as well as high level hero types.\n\nIdeally, this system would also give value to novice players, while also easing them into more complex abilities and builds.\n\n\n-Map System:\nEach map functions as a largely open field. \n\nScattered across the map are objective points. These are generally normal capture points, acting as spawns and allowing the team to encroach on the main objective.\n\nSome points, however, may have unique properties and claiming, protecting, or destroying them could provide or deprive either side of a bonus or trigger a field event.\n\nField events could also trigger under any number of conditions and can be used to provide tactical options, maintain balance or, to add variety to gameplay.\n\nI.e. :\nCapture a certain command point to trigger an airship strike.\nIf one side is pressing very quickly this could trigger a hero unit to spawn to aid help the losing side regain ground.\n\n\n-Campaign:\nThe campaign would be fully playable either in multiplayer or solo.\n\nPossibly allow for branching progression depending on certain conditions.\nI.e. Whether your side won or lost, triggering specific events, etc.\n\n\nMost everything else I have in mind would be minutiae; weapon types, play balance, etc. Have at it lads and lasses."

o5hkl5,"A text-based, multiple ending type game that revolves around someone visiting the barber.","WARNING:  THE FOLLOWING IDEA EXPLORES THEMES OF DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE\n\nIF ANYTHING I'VE WRITTEN IS INSENSITIVE TOWARDS PEOPLES SUFFERING THESE CONDITIONS IN ANY WAY PLEASE EDUCATE ME IN THE COMMENTS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisited the barber a few weeks ago, and I realised how much I talk about with the barber, even though I see them only a few times a year.  So the idea for this game is a text-based game where you play the role of the barber, and a client keeps visiting you every few months.  The client will strike up conversation, and a variety of different responses are available each time.  The client will remember these responses and perhaps interwork them into future conversations.  Over time, the client will have certain events crop up in their lives (depression, loses job etc.), and you as the barber have to pick up on the cues that something is going wrong in their life, and try to talk them to a happier ending across several visits.  There would be a set of events that could pop up randomly in each playthrough, and below is a rough idea of how a playthrough could progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst visit (introduced to character, basic chat, establishes their family, friends, hobbies etc.)\n\nSecond visit (more casual chat, but slightly deeper, more personal things i.e. death of a family member recently)\n\nThird visit (something is now wrong with the character, cues can be picked up that they are struggling i.e. offhandedly mentioning that they gave up a few of their old hobbies etc.)\n\nFourth visit (more visible that they are struggling, possible phone call from partner where problems can be heard over phone, their dialogue could be more sullen)\n\nFifth visit (clear that they are struggling, mentions that they have been feeling kind of down recently etc., may already be too late).\n\nThere is no sixth visit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the above playthrough, you would have several chances to try and dissuade the person from committing suicide through dialogue choices or other possible means, such as calling helplines etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother mechanic would be a newspaper that you get to see the front page of before each visit.  This would feature news stories that would come up in conversation, and would feature news of the client's suicide if you aren't able to help them in time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea of the client being depressed is just one idea I had, and there could be several other story arcs such as losing job, or even happier ones such as winning a small fortune from the lottery or the client getting engaged etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone decides to do anything with this idea, I'd love to be involved with the development of plotlines and story, shoot me a pm and I'd be happy to help if you want."
o5ggw3,Open city free running game following a graffiti artist,"I just had an idea for a game that I'd seriously love to play.  Imagine something like a cross between JSRF and Mirror's Edge in an open city map.   Instead of the more course clear style of Mirror's Edge though, the city is laid out in a way that that style of free-running can be employed to traverse it quickly and efficiently.  This concept would more or less eliminate the idea of combat, but would likely add some more stealth elements. \n\nAs for what we're doing in this city, we are a graffiti artist whose goal is to get their work up in the craziest, hardest to get spots imaginable. I feel like a game like this should really dig into the culture of street art on the whole, and the motives that drive people to do it.  Imagine meeting NPC's who are also artists who you can go on ""missions"" with.  You learn from them about spots that people have tried and failed to get to in the past, and you take these as a challenge.  Depending on your relationship with certain characters, they may show up and help you out if everything goes sideways.  \n\nIn addition to these side missions with others and the main missions of getting to ""heaven spots"", there are also a lot of cool opportunities for ""collectables"".  For example, one aspect of this culture is that, when famous graffiti artists die, word tends to get out, and people will paint crowns floating over their works.  Imagine our character has a relationship with or family member who was a famous graffiti artist, and, anytime you find one of their pieces, you get to paint a crown over it and get rewarded (with maybe a skill point or something).  You could even accumulate a few artists who you do this for based on story events or whatnot, and each could have their own skill tree associated with how many of their works you found.  \n\nAs for conflict, I'm imagining police are an obvious threat, and should be part of the central conflict.  However, there should also be some animosity with people more like you.  Imagine a villain who's kinda like a stand-in for an artist like Banksy. Uses stencils, political, beloved by the media, wears a mask, shows up to taunt you, covers up your work with his or modifies it to make it his own.  Missions where you chase him that test your free running chops.  I'm imagining a cutscene where you wake up after pulling off a crazy tag, and turning on the news.  They're talking about your piece, but, when they show it, there's a frame stenciled around it with 2 people stenciled in front of it in saying ""Hmm. It's pretty... but is it really art?""\n\nI don't know, it just feels like a pretty easy well to tap in terms of inspiration.  I've got a lot more ideas about it too, but my post is ramble-y enough as is.  I am starting out in game design, but this is like... WELL beyond anything I could reasonably ever accomplish to the standard I feel it deserves, so it's an idea I'd rather just put out there.  Criticism and thoughts are welcome."

o5alrl,[Mod] Red Faction: Guerrilla - A Gary's Mod-like sandbox where one can place/spawn buildings and then destroy them,"https://store.steampowered.com/app/20500/Red_Faction_Guerrilla_Steam_Edition/\n\n*If you're a modder who can pull this off, I would be open to talking about paying you to do this. I have no idea what it would involve or cost, but feel free to reply with some 'ballpark figures'.*\n\n---\n\n**Name:** The Guerrilla Enclosure (or call it whatever you like)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* One of the main things I love about this game is the demolition of huge structures. It occurred to me early on that I was only doing missions and progressing through the story in order to reach new areas and buildings and to unlock better tools for the destruction of said buildings. It made me dream of a mod which was basically a generic 'open space' in which I could spawn and place buildings, then demolish them at my own pace with whatever tools and explosives I wanted. It's so therapeutic, a full-on mod where this is the focus could be THE lockdown stress reliever!\n\n**Plot:**\n\nNone.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nMars, I guess? But an empty grey box would be fine with me.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* No need for extra characters to choose from besides the main one, but I guess it could be interesting to be able to play as other NPC character models when using the mod. Whatever the case may be, his/her abilities would be an unlimited supply of explosives and maxed-out tools/abilities!\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The only additional mechanics needed here are the ability to load up a menu and select a structure, then choose where it should go. In fact, just spawning it somewhere within eyesight of the player is fine. Would be cool to be able to spawn vehicles and other objects, too. I would also like to be able to save the current state of the space as a loadable template or pre-made 'map', so if I find a setup I like I can just reload that instead of placing everything manually each time.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Explode buildings without restriction or restraint.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Share your 'maps' on the Steam Workshop.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nGlamlore, Master of Destruction and Chaos (no credit needed, just make it happen!)"

o56kk3,My first concept. Please give feedback if you are interested in the idea.," \n\n   Hello!\n\n   My name is Konstantin, I am 25 years old, I am from Russia and I am studying to be a game designer. Today I would like to present to your attention the concept of the game, which, perhaps, will leave pages of Google Docs and Google Sheets one day and appear before you as a digital version of work of my future team and mine.\n\n   *Sorry in advance for possible mistakes in spelling, as English is not my native language.*\n\n   My game in the genre of tactical turn-based aims to simulate a small clash between two sides of the enemy. **What's so interesting about that?**\n\n* Developed lvl-design - the clash takes place in closed spaces, actively pushing opponents, forcing them to act actively. At the moment, there are no plans for procedural generation, since freehand level balancing is the most flexible solution and the easiest for an indie-team;\n* full interaction with the location - do you want to destroy a wall, a building, a car? Let’s do it! Controlled explosion or not? Choose, but remember that the fragments from the building, shop windows, fragments can damage or destroy not only the enemy, but also your own soldiers;\n* medicine - a person in war is terribly vulnerable, from a bullet to an accidental fragment. All of this can cause damage that is incompatible with life. However, there is a person who can save you - a medic. Think about where to provide first aid? Drag the fighter from the first line or a few more moves he will not last... your choice;\n* depersonalized units - there is no confrontation between countries, this is enough in real life. This is a simulation of a clash, so let it be like a simulation. Thanks SUPERHOT we've seen how it can be;\n* phase-by-phase motion mechanics - we don't follow each other. We walk together. A vivid example of the phase-by-phase mechanics of the move is the rock, paper, scissors game;\n* short matches - no more than 30 minutes per match. As concise and fast as possible, almost like chess for a while.\n\n   The game has no plot component. You are completely immersed in the game, where the match is a new challenge to achieve the goal and reveal the tactics of your opponent.\n\n   **How to play it?**\n\n   Each match begins with the fact that you inspect the map and under your action plan “buy "" for points for hiring units - this can be a shooter, engineer, sapper, medic, machine gunner and others. Maybe even a flamethrower? Why not! On your part of the location where you start the game, place units - your small squad, with which you will achieve victory or lose, losing everything. Then you plan your move by choosing the models of behavior of the soldiers, setting them the paths of movement, indicating the trajectories of shooting. After clicking ""End of Turn"", you wait for your opponent to finish their planning, then run the simulation and look at the process you have planned. Before your eyes, the battle unfolds, where you decide what and how to do your soldiers. However, do not forget about the time, it is not recommended to delay.\n\n   References to the game can be: X-COM, Laser Squad Nemesis, Door Kickers, Into the Breach, Phantom Doctrine.\n\n   Thank you for your attention!"

o55daq,Code spaceships to explore and build in a galaxy... stored on Blockchain!,"I've been learning about Blockchain this week, and for the last year or so I've ALSO had an idea for a programming game (like Screeps). \n\nBlockchain seems like a fun way to build a game for hobby coders, and it'd be cool to create AI spaceships that travel through a distributed virtual galaxy!!! (Or maybe solarsystem, idk what the potential speed of a Blockchain server can get up to... Galaxy might be too big). \n\nNote for coders and Blockchain enthusiasts: \nI'd want to program it with Proof of Stake or Proof of Burn algorithms, because Proof of Work is destroying our planet and causing a GPU crisis.\n\n# Game Idea\n\nYou start with a ship that can harvest resources from planets and asteroids, trade resources with other ships, explore the game world, and spend resources to create more ships under your ownership! \n\nYou can use resources harvested to create new modules for your ship as well. One important module would be the research module. Consume a resource (ex., Iron) in the research module to create 'Research Plans'.\n\nResearch Plans can be traded, or stored on a ship to up the effeciency of any related modules... \nExample: Research Plans for Hydrogen might make hydrogen based engine modules run better, and your ship go faster.\n\nPlaying the game is equivalent to writing scripts that feed 'transactions' to the Blockchain server. So a code snippet might be:\n\nmove_to(ship_id, position_x, position_y)\nharvest(ship_id, planet_id)\nmove_to(ship_id, home_x, home_y)\ntrade_to(ship_id, other_ship_id, resource, quantity)\n\nYou can choose to program and build many ships, or just one badass ship. You could specialize your ship(s) for trading with other ships for resources or resource locations. Alternatively, you could focus on making a big pirate armada and attacking lone traders in the vastness of space. Or you could just start a space communism organization and share your resources and coding techniques freely to all.\n\nI know this is a little niche. That's why I thought I'd post the idea. I'd like to know if it is alluring at all to anybody! I do think it'd be a great way for coders to up their skills and also it could help beginner coders learn the basics."

o52pdd,"A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras.","A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.\n\nMy idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in) \n\nThe other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something. \n\nI imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.\n\nI feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game."

o4xoay,"Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly","Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nSo basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.  \nMaybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.  \nFor players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.  \nThen for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.  \nAlso to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.  \n\n\nAbout the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into ""funny"" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like ""Kick the Buddy"" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.  \nAlso the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like ""life points"" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.\n\nWhat do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point."
o4u407,What would you like to see new in a metroidvania game?,
o4r27w,Zombie apocalypse and you are slowly becoming a zombie.,"You are slowly becoming a zombie. \n\nThe first part of the game is a stealth game where you are trying to avoid the zombies. \n\nLater you become more and more zombie like and you just have to act like a zombie to go through the zombies. You might also have to fight them as well. \n\nLater you have to also try to avoid people to not get killed because you really look like a zombie.\n\nThe background story:\n\nThere is a virus that turns you into a zombie. It begins by taking over control of the brain and then slowly slowly it changes the body as well. It starts as a weird moving zombie, and in a span of days it progresses to a more muscled, high metabolism zombie that is fast, strong and also heals itself. The stronger they become the zombies, the more sensitive they become to the light and they cannot be out in the day. In the night, they will show aggression towards light sources. \n\nThe hero's story:\n\nYou are a scientist in a research facility where they try to find a cure for the zombie plague. The vaccine is not working yet, but at least it slows down the brain controlling process. The research facility gets invaded by the zombies and you have to bring the vaccine to another facility to continue the research. You are not chosen because you are the best, but merely because you are the only option. You are an average person of average stamina and strength and no weapon/fighting skills.\nAt some point before you exit the facility you get bitten by a zombie and you decide to inject yourself and carry the vaccine in your blood instead. You only have a GPS map with you and you have to make your way to the other facility - where they are waiting for you.\nYou can walk or use bikes, maybe also vehicles if you are lucky. On your journey you will have to avoid zombies, pretend you are one of them, sometimes fight them. You would be able to use weapons but with limited succes since you are not experienced enough. You would have to also avoid other people while your body becomes more and more zombie like, avoid light or have to wear sunglasses to travel through the day and eat a lot because your metabolism is changing. You will have to act as humane as possible to keep your sanity and your mind clear, otherwise the virus will take over your mind. Eventually you will gain new abilities like night vision, advanced hearing, regeneration. Later in the game you would be able to run faster, jump higher and parkour around. From time to time you might lose control, or black out and just wake up in random places.\n\nThere will be dogs, but you cannot pet them because they would be running away from you! o_o"
o4qlkd,"An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end.","Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs. \n\nInstead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.\n\nYou'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers. \n\nTime is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.  \n\nSo you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides. \n\nAnd you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains. \n\nThe emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier. \n\nYou could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story. \n\nSide hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught. \n\nTo make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine. \n\nThe main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough. \n\nSay you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities. \n\nOr say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.  \n\nThe best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options."
o4p50i,Jojo's Bizarre Adventures (VR) *spoilers*,"The main premise of the game I was thinking of was PVP or PVE using stands from the anime. I came up with the simple basics of stand fighting and thought of how that would work.\n\nHold a certain button to summon your stand and still have it leashed to yourself. While holding this button, the stand mimics your movements, while you can also move it freely using the left analogue stick. This allows a fast, short distance defense and offense. The player will be able to use their own movements to make the stand block, defend and attack. \n\nHowever stands can have special abilities either activated by a button or hand gestures. For example, Jotaro's Ora barrage would be a perfect ability along with his stop time ability as these would be humanly impossible to reanact.\n\nStands should also be able to be controlled remotely and have the player see through the stands eyes. Instead of holding a button, the player taps it instead and summons their stand. However, they become the stand. The player's character is still there, but they just have complete control over the stand. They see through its eyes and can have a lot more manueverability. They can still activate special attacks. Maybe even gain more attacks in this mode. \nLike the other mode, you can control the stand using arm movements and the analogue stick. Flying stands can have their elevation controlled too.\nIf the players actual character is hit, their stand returns to their body and the player could have a slight knock-back allowing them to escape the opponents next hit and summon their stand again. Punching should be completed through actually punching, and not a button. Like many of the vr boxing games. \n\nWinners are determined by an NPC's or player's health, or perhaps willpower, if you want to keep it in-line with the anime."

o4btug,Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game,"The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.  \n\nThe game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart. \n\nGameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast. \n\nIt could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.\n\nEither way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other."

o4781t,Open-world RPG/Action RPG in an aerial environment with airships and mounts,"We have diverse RPG's taking place mostly on land, we've had some in the sea or featuring naval segments, we have space RPG's, but very little to no RPG's purely exploring the skies. Perhaps because no one is exactly sure how it would translate for a typical hack and slash/spellcasting character, or how exactly open air would be interesting and allow for map design, and so forth. But I think it has great potential, and I'll give my personal vision of how it could work out:\n\n**Setting** - A high fantasy steampunk magical world where the surface has been afflicted by a cataclysm of some sort, such as the emergence of evil creatures from the underground or paranormal corruption that turned it into a hostile place, full of noxious gases, uninhabitable conditions and dangerous creatures , forcing the world's denizens to use magic and technology to take to the skies, where new floating civilizations and communities are established away from the chaos below. This also serves as the justification for not being able to descend to the ground and keeping the aerial element in the spotlight.\n\n**Gameplay** -  Simply playing as a flying person wouldn't innovate much and likely be inferior to traditional ground environments and combat, so instead you will essentially be piloting a vehicle or mount of some kind permanently, which also serves as your primary source of character progression. It would probably be best in third-person, and I propose 3 main 'classes' to start with:\n\n*Airship Pilot* - The Fighter/Ranged equivalent, wherein you rely on cannons, weapons, ramming and grappling attacks, etc etc to assail enemies.\n\n*Mounted rider*  - You fly a magical beast which works well for both melee archetypes ( Claws, tails, wing swipes, fangs, etc etc ) and for spellcasters with  creatures capable of magical attacks and the rider's own spell flinging\n\n*Steampunk Glider/Kite apparatus* - Rogue equivalent, piloting a small and fast vehicle allowing you to perform quick attacks like slashing sails with sharp protrusions, blowing out smoke in a radius to enable stealth in the air, bomb throwing and planting, etc.\n\n As you level up you invest in skills that allow you to improve your handling, speed, aim, magical abilities, crafting of steampunk bombs/devices, repair, tinkering, etc and more importantly granting you access to better vehicles, bigger airships with more firepower and crew, greater beasts from wyverns to griffons flying serpents and creatures unique to the lore, sleeker and gliders, and specific upgrade trees - hull, engine, ballistas or cannons or magical steampunk weapona for airships, new tricks, growth and spells for the spellcater, more stealth options and devices for the rogue archetype, and so on.\n\n**Locations** - As examples of fascinating aerial zones where combat and exploration and dialogue can be utilized, You can have like a 'Pirate Warrens' zone where a ton of airships litter the radius vicinity, trading in smuggled goods, chilling, etc besides makeshift floating platforms and docks and you have to navigate it and fight opponents who accost you, you can have a wonky magical gravity zone with floating islands and debris from the ground, or a more dungeon-like zone set in some giant abandoned medusa-shaped zeppelin , zones where hostile flying creatures and flora have ecosystems, the list goes on.\n\nInbetween there are the civilized communities and friendly encounters with structures and cities kept afloat either by technology ( Engines/balloons/etc) or magical energy by the exclusive races/communities that have the knowledge to maintain it.\n\n**Conclusion** -  Aside from the main concept described, I don't have anything particular or remarkable to suggest for the plot or the quests, just imagine your standard fare Dragon Age/Skyrim/Witcher/Baldur's Gate type of storyline except in a unique environment with aerial combat and interactions."
o45dt3,A sports game set in a brutal dictatorship,"The game would be like a parody of sports titles like California Games and Track &amp; Field, except set in a strict authoritarian country that punishes poor athletic performance.\n\nThere would be a mix of events like: golf, BMXing, skateboarding, inline skating, surfing, long jump, 100m dash, weightlifting, hurdles, high jump, etc.\n\nDifficulty settings adjust the game's difficulty, the weather conditions you'll experience, the amount of obstacles, and how the state will punish you for failure. On the hardest difficulty, you'll be straight-up executed for failing to win a medal in an event."

So when the quest is completed, there is an additional tomb to graveyard, and you have to start over again, except this time you pick one of two sidekicks. no unique dialogue, as if the first sidekick didn't exist, except for the additional tombstone at the cemetery. Influencing said gamer to farm the heck outta the poor slimes when the mission comes up. idk, my ideas r kinda twisted."
o404nt,Online Multi-player Create your own superperson battle arena.,"OKAY! This is my dream game!\n\nYou can make your own superhero or villain from a huge web and tree of powers and abilities.

Abilities vary in price based on strength.\n\nAdditionally, after selecting your main powers and abilities you can narrow down exactly how you want your character to function based on the powers you've selected.\n\nA few game modes I'd love to have.\nThe main competitive game mode being a 3v3 arena on various maps/landscapes. The 3v3 can have a couple different objectives.\nOne team will be defending a location or something the other team attacks.

o3vqe5,Dealing with enemies in non-violent ways,"Any other games outside of Undertale or Wondersong that gives the players options on dealing with enemies in non violent ways? Or, at the very least, not killing them (i.e., you can still hurt them, but you also don't have to outright kill/defeat them either).\n\nEither it'd be talking it out with them (like the above examples), sneaking past them and avoiding them completely (almost like a stealth game), scaring/shooing them away with things they're scared of/hate (like how in minecraft, many mobs hate the light and won't even spawn at all if their spawning points are too bright and littered with light sources. Or how certain mobs are scared of other things like Skeletons fearing Wolves, Creepers fearing Cats, etc.).\n\n\nEither that, or you can bring your own ideas onto the table and give other ways on how to deal with enemies in no-kill ways.\n\nAgain, you can still ""hurt"" them (like temporarily knocking them out/dazing them so you can get away for example). Just outright killing them/defeating them doesn't count."

o3spie,Anime Tower Defense Game?,"A tower defense game with anime characters, enemies, and maps. The game would be 3D where the ""Gamemaster"" (you) could move around the map (to place your characters ofc) so it's not a top-down/birds-eye view.  \n\n\nThere could also be different features like abilities and Goldens. Abilities would be special powers you would get from fully upgrading the character. For example, if you fully upgrade Goku, he would get a special ability that allows him to transform into Ultra Instinct (boost all stats like damage, speed, range) and more. Goldens would be different (and improved) forms of characters that you would get from combining 3 (maybe) of their normal forms. For example, if you had 3 normal Narutos, you could combine them to make 1 Golden Naruto.  \n\n\nMaybe, there could even be different gamemodes like a ""Battles/Versus"" where you play against someone else to see who can survive longer and ""Co-op"" where you cooperate and play *with* someone.  \n\n\nHonestly, I would just like another good tower defense game (similar to Bloons TDs' greatness) to play with friends."

Become a streamer. If you pick this you become the new most popular streamer.\nB. Give up the offer, and then the game ends.\n\n\nAlong the way of finding clues, as you get more and more clues, you get private messages from other users that threaten you to stop, because they want to be the first users to complete the website.\nOR\nYou can get offers from a group of users that plans on completing the website together and become the ""group of users that completed the website"" and share the fame it brings.\n\n\n\nThe game can have one ending, or more."

o3macf,Driving Simulator,"The game would be very similar to Microsoft's Flight Simulator. The main idea is to have a photorealistic driving game. This wouldn't be a racing game, just an American driving simulator. You can drive anywhere in the United States, spawn anywhere in the United States, and it would be fun to go on road trips with your friends, just drive to somewhere you go all the time, etc. The game would have a lot of cars to choose from, you just select your car, select where you want to spawn and there you go. There would be a gas feature where your car runs out of gas, and you go get gas. Basically it would have every feature a car in real life has. You could put your windows down unlike any other racing/driving game (although there are not many driving sim games out there right now). A radio feature would also be implemented where you can go on the internet and play anything from there. Such as going on iHeartRadio's website, or just going on Spotify and playing your own playlist. The game would be playable with keyboard/mouse (although that would be the worst to play it with), a normal controller, or a controller steering wheel with pedals. It would support VR to make it feel extra realistic, but not required of course. In the options it would have realistic mode and cinematic mode, realistic mode would have more realistic lighting but would look worse and the cinematic mode would be less realistic lighting but look better for videos, screenshots, etc. I feel like I'd play this game hours on end driving from my house to Disney World or something. That is the one game I want to see happen in my lifetime. Let me know what you would think of a game like this as well!"

o3jj8w,"A simple 2d and open world game that harbors the essence of the dragon ball z story itself, but not like every other dragon ball z game has done before","Firstly, for those who have showed interest in my post, thank you for your time, i welcome any advice or criticism on my post, as to where i can further adjust or edit it to make it more of an plausible idea for game developers out here. \n\n~BASICALLY THE ENTIRE STORY SUMMED UP~\n\nYou play as your own custom character, then start of as a young adult ( maybe around like 18 - 21), and you character has abnormal strength, and a constant hunger to fight and become stronger up until you die from either age or a battle that was just to much for you to handle.\n\n~THE SETTING/WOLRD~\n\nIt is set in a modern civilization, where you have about 4 or so areas you are able to travel to, such as the main town/city where you can buy food, clothing, potions and so on. A training area who other people go to battle each other, train their skills, learn other skills and recruit other characters. A hosing area, where you live and stay and sleep. And a foresty area with a river where you can hunt and catch fish and animals to eat or sell their meat for money.\n\nThis part might be far-fetched but, also the opportunity to travel your home galaxy to other planets, where there is the same basic set up such as 4 areas to visit and go, like i said above, with the only difference being the characters maybe and the colour scheme. Maybe 8 planets? Im not sure about how much effort it would take to make 1 itself, so maybe 8 is to much, but the reason why i said 8 is so that, for every planet there could be a chance that its either a friendly civilization or a evil civilization where they look to kill or imprison you ( or something along those lines), also to add on, if you come across a friendly civilization, you can train with their fighters, and help them fight off, or go on adventures to fight against an evil civilization trying to invade them.\n\nAlso, my entire idea of the traveling system and things is similar to the aspect of a game called LCS ( liberal crime squad ), its where i got the idea of recruiting and traveling, since the traveling system is fairly simple, such as "" you need a car to travel here"", so you get money for a car and then you are able to travel to x area, for that game specifically, you could be in LA and travel to SEA, and do basically the same things there, the only difference being the names of the areas. \n\n~COMBAT~\n\nCould either be a simple event screen where you choose a specific skill ( text based), or a simple 2d point and click game who you choose your skill and use it on your opponent.\n\nWhat also could be unique is a text pop up where you can choose like an a-d option of like, try to calm to situation down and talk it out so you don't fight, straight to fighting, run away or a intimidate option.\n\nAnd after the fights done, a option to kill your opponent, let him go and survive or try and recruit him depending on your own skill\n\nAlso, it should be an option to out think your opponent, such as instead of straight brute force and power, you can use specific techniques to win\n\n~FURTHER IDEAS~\n\nAnd that's about it I've thought of, my entire idea is basically a dragon ball z type of game, where you main objective is to fight, recover and grow stronger, so after every fight, you heal yourself and you get a boost of power, like in dragon ball z \n\nAlso, to get a wife and get a child or more to grow and help you fight, so when you die, you can take over as them, and lead your fight onwards, you can train them and so on\n\nAnnndd, it could also be an idea of having fist combat, spells and ki blasts and transformations possible, like powerups or rage modes etc"
o3i4ya,Survival Horror Warhammer Fantasy,"The game idea is a single player survival Horror game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. The game concept is large but confined to a singular city/town. \n\nThe 10k foot idea is being an Empire Guardsman that is in a town during a beastmen raid. With no way to fight against the horde, the idea is to escape the town while avoiding the beastmen attacking. \nThe game would be 3D."
o39sym,Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe,"There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game.\nFor instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)"
o37x1b,Class-based Survival Game,"Pretty self-explanatory, takes place in a medieval time period, each class has their own mechanics, e.g an alchemist being the only class able to brew and make really good food, a cleric having religion-based mechanics such as a karma system, engineers being able to build automated or manned defences, a necromancer that can summon undead to automate tasks and man defences, dwarves being able to build structures that aid in resource gathering, etc. I think this would make for a really good multi-player game because maybe classes could overlap, eg an alchemist being able to imbue a knight's sword or an engineer's ballista bolts."

nggymw,Endless runner game idea,Hi I'm new to game development. I wanna create my first game. I have an rough idea abt using accelerometer for navigation instead of swipe. Plz suggest me some themes for this.
nge2dx,Skin of our teeth,"sorry if this was mentioned before. I love zombies and roguelikes but don't have the time to actually learn all the skills to create my own. will lend my voice to whoever decides to make this thing though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZombie low poly co-op fps roguelike. PermaDeath, Item unlocks. Characters to unlock. Very gritty/dark atmosphere. Ambient sounds/music. Randomly Generated building layout. Multiple building types as the levels. An apartment complex, Hospital, Asylum, Prison, any big building that would be easy to generate randomly. Keep weapons simple but plentiful. No bosses but zombies react to the amount of noise made. Has to be a headshot to kill. possible body dismemberment to help slow down if no ammo/low ammo. Zombies can grab. if grabbed you have a chance to escape once. if grabbed near multiple zombies instant death. No revives when dead. Maps are chosen at random. able to barricade doors using furniture to cover flanks. NO UI being a one-hit death. Ammo check is in-game animation. no mini-map. a journal you can pull out to read notes that can be found. the journal can be used to also check found equipment. Escaping the building alive leads to the next area. Friendly Fire always on.\n\nTLDR (think RE SURVIVOR but as an actual FPS/roguelike with co-op)"
ngbrq2,My prediction for the next big hit (it most likely isn't). Please add your ideas.,"In my humble opinion, I think If someone could create a game that's simple, and easily-modded. It needs to be multiplayer, I suppose among us perfected the formula in terms of lobby size (10). Make it heavily rely on communication. That way the gameplay changes depending on the players. Procedural content would be awesome; If you have anything to add, please feel free to post a comment :)"
ng8bhs,An aim trainer for console,"I mean... there’s literally no competition on the market at all. I don’t know how to make games for anything I just feel like this would be easy money. Anyone that’s wants to train their aim would only have one choice, which would be your game."
ng88c7,Cannibal Islands!,"Hey everyone, this is my first post about an Idea I had a few days ago. \n\nI will post my story and my thought process in the end, so you guys can read why you are here. \n\nImagine the following: \n\nThere are two relatively close Islands in a tropical environment. Both Islands are inhabited by the  indigenous tribes. Lets call them Rubys and Sapphires. Both tribes live on their respective island and try to find food, water and shelter. Life is hard on these Islands, but it is manageable. Especially when you work together with the rest of your tribe. \n\nThe real threat is coming from the other tribe. Every now and then Rubys and Sapphires are crossing the border and invade the other tribe. The are not trying to steal food, or special items or something.\n\nRubys and Sapphires are invading the other Island to Hunt, Kill and Eat the other tribe! \n\nDoing so will make your character mutate into a better form. How the food is prepared will change the effect on you.\n\nIf you eat it raw, it will make you super strong. Making you strong enough to charge through walls and buildings and being able to take down whole villages by yourself.\n\nCooking the meat on a fire will unlock your  cognitive abilities. Crafting some weapons, or a better fireplace, or some defensive structures. \n\n(Here is some extra room for people eating something like rotten meat, or special parts of the body or something like this. Maybe they will have better night vision, or can hear bare footsteps way ahead of all the others.)\n\nYou need to eat quite some Meat for the mutation to kick in, but your advantages are massive. Also the effect will fade away if you cannot provide more meat for you mutation. So without more food, you will turn into your normal, basic form after time.\n\nThis will be a survival Game with a little twist. Instead of players just wandering around and killing everything that moves just for the lols, they have to work as a team to reach the goal of being the dominant tribe and reaching the 100% Mutation.\n\nThis Idea was inspired by the survival Game ""The Isle"" or to be more specific This Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7JzmEf-\_c&amp;t=1836s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7JzmEf-_c&amp;t=1836s) made by SovietWomble. Survival games have been pretty much the same for the last 10 years. Its either DayZ, Minecraft, Rust (DayZ Epoch) or a BR like PUBG. And I try to change the format a little bit.\n\nWhat the game should be when it is finished:\n\n\- You choose Rubys or Sapphires\n\n\- You spawn somewhere on your island\n\n\- You need to find food, water and maybe some special fruits for your health\n\n\- In order to take your character into a better stage, you need to hunt, kill and eat the other team. \n\n\- The way you prepare and eat the meat will decide how the mutation changes. \n\n\- Your Tribe needs different kind of people, some Strong mutants, some smart mutants and whatever class you might think of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats the bare Idea behind the game i made up and might never come to live.\n\nThanks for reading :)"
ng6byd,Spark of Life,"The game starts where you're basically looking forward, and can't turn your head. You're being driven through a storm. There's a bright flash, and everything goes dark. Your vision returns slowly, like a static ridden TV. You look around to see the truck you were on driving out of view, and a few robots and parts scattered around you. This is where the game begins.\n\nYou're a robot given autonomy by a bolt of lightning. You need to find refuge, but as a very rare anomaly, you will be hunted by the humans wherever you go, as soon as they figure out you're alive. You can pass yourself off as lifeless by never turning your head, and moving at the same time. This will work for a some time.\n\nYou need to find information on a rumored autonomous underground where humans and robots live as equals. You get this info by scavenging, and asking humans that are sympathetic to your plight. Remember, robots don't ask questions like this. If the human isn't friendly, it will out you immediately. If you manage to kill humans, they might drop anything from money to batteries (for energy using parts, not you), keycards, or possibly info you need to progress.\n\nAs the only autonomous robot you're aware of, that makes others controlled by the humans hunting you. They are almost all your enemies, until you start getting closer to the underground. Destroying robots, and anything electronic drops parts, some useful upgrades and new abilities, some totally pointless, or aesthetic. The stronger you are, the easier you get noticed... but the easier you'll survive an encounter.\n\nLastly, you're a modern bot, made with modern materials. You can't rust. If you're heading into human populated areas, you're going to want to wash off the... uh... red stuff... Trust me, they'll notice..."

nfyjtb,Dangerous Streets (Redux),"Dangerous Streets was once a crappy Street Fighter rip-off in the 90's produced by an Italian studio mainly for the Amiga system (it's even included as a pack-in with the infamous Amiga CD-32). I noticed a very beautiful opportunity with it's main aesthetic, 90's Nightclubs.\n\nI believe it would be a great Killer Instinct-style game. Either based on the original arcade game or the 2016 Reboot. The nightclub scenery, combined with a house music soundtrack akin to Black Orchid's theme from the KI games, and the zaniest characters ever conceived for fighting games. It surely is a lively and nostalgic experience!"
nfv30x,Open world character collecting fighting game," You collect and trade characters and maps. The maps are open world and fully explorable. The story is just to explain why they're all together, it's never fully explored. The character and maps are all stored on the cards and the game itself is mostly to display the information stored on the cards so that you can continue to add more maps and characters. I know this is an ambitious large game and gathering the rights to so many characters is nothing but a dream.\n\nStory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins by opening to a few characters acting normal before vanishing.\n\nFor example, superman is protecting a city and vanishes while holding a car, then it\n\nopens to few other characters and ends the same way. After we see this 2 or 3 times we see a shot\n\nof a large group of characters all confused, maybe some from the same series next to each other, \n\nfor example, Ben 10 can stand next to ben 10 omniverse who booth appear as they do in the show.\n\nThis isn't limited to heroes but villains as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe then hear a loud demand for silence and the screen pans to several extremely strong\n\nvillains who have been the cause for cross-over stories in the past, or just has god-like powers.\n\nFor example ""teen titans"" and ""teen titans go"" Trigon was the result of their worlds colliding, \n\nand Bill cipher from ""Gravity Falls"" just has god-like powers. They will explain that everyone\n\nthere is for an ultimate test of strength. No one will permanently die from the damage they recieve\n\nand can go all out. Some are also shrunk (specific massive characters like kaiju and giant robots)\n\nfor a fair assessment. Their worlds are all on pause and no one will remember anything when it's all\n\nover with. If you want to leave, fight. Characters all poof into arenas across from another opponent and begin to battle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCards\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of each card says has the games logo in the art style of whatever series\n\nthe character is from. The characters art takes up half of the card, full NAME displayed\n\nin the middle, for example, Spidermans will say ""peter parker"" or ""mile morales""\n\ndepending on who they are, And in the corner a symbol indicating what type of fighter it \n\nis, and under the name is a brief backstory description. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBattle field cards are sideways to show off more art, an indicator in the corner for how large the field is, and a name on top. The unique aspect with battlefield cards some stand-alone\n\nand don't have fighting counterparts. For example, the Simpsons doesn't have any characters that can really fight, but Springfield can be an entire map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngameplay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMovesets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can freely edit your character's move set to how you want to play. Every character will have move set already picked, but in the character editor you can find even more moves\n\nnot yet active AND you can freely place them on any button. For example, if you so chose you can set ""up"" and ""down"" to attack and ""left"" and ""right"" as ""jump"" and ""down"". Every character is limited to what their continuity has access to. For example, young Ben 10 can NOT be goop. The only type of characters limited to this are ""collectors"" such as Chaotic, or pokemon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinals\n\nHow finals are used is totally dependant on the character's lore and they are also swappable.\n\nSome abilities need to charge before use, some can be used right away, some are a massive \n\nfinal attack, some are a form change that's either permanent or brief (add character examples later)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntroductions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow your character shows up is very dependant on lore. For example code Lyoko characters would reconstruct above the ground, superman would fly in, sailor moon would transform. And after\n\nthe character does their unique intro above them is their title in the series art style.\n\nFor example above peter parker is ""Spider-Man"" and characters with more than 1 title leaves\n\nit up to the player. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCostumes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll costumes are unlocked right away for owner's customization. Characters who have different\n\nart styles seasons or games but are essentially the same exact characters have their own costumes.\n\nFor example ""American Dragon"" has 2 styles each being their own costume, and Mario has various costumes\n\nacross games all with their own representation such as 8bit or tanuki Mario.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaps\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuilding and object in maps are destroyable and even have obstacles or enemies and you have the option to turn off all 3. Map size various and can even be restrictive. For example a large city or a tight enclosed building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nelements\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFire, cold, and wet will affect some characters more than others. If a character doesn't do well in the cold\n\nit may take more damage in a cold map, if a character is made of fire it will take more damage when another uses a water attack. This is minimal though\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nclasses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just a character classification for how they fight to give the player an idea before using it. Players\n\ncan build a preference for class and collect specific players that better fit their fighting style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiverse- A diverse player doesn't have the option to change out movsets, but instead characters. Chaotic, pokemon trainers or even single characters like ben 10 will have various characters to choose from. You can swap them mid-battle and their movesets are all pre-set. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStealth- stealth characters may not be very good hand to hand. Characters like Aiden Pierce can use gadgets to fight from afar or trick other players. Stealth characters can deal a lot of damage, but also take a lot of damage fast. Some can go as far as to turn invisible, but that can also be countered by other moves/gadgets or even finals. \n\nWarrior- Warrior characters have very few long-range attacks. Most of their attacks are either various close-range weapons/attacks or very weak and minimum choice of long-range attacks such as arrows. For example, Link from the legend of zelda will have bombs, a bow and arrow, and various other long-range attacks, but he deals more damage up close with hammers and swords. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShooter- Shooters have very minimum close-range attacks but will always have a very wide arsenal of long-range weapons. They also have the option of being played in the first or third person. Critical attacks are also a unique ability that lets them hit characters in the head for extra damage, but the downside is if the opponent's attacks happen to hit you in the head it is also extra damage. The character plays like a typical shooter and the move set is to swap out weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpellcaster- Spellcasters use various spells either to boost their own abilities, attack, or defend. A lot of their attacks have hot, cold, or wet after effects, and spellcasters can be closed or long-range attacks. For example, Natsu from ""fairy tail"" has plenty of fire-breathing attacks, but also boosts his own punches and can attack up close. The only downside is their attacks are usually slow as they have to announce or read them. For example, Natsu has to yell ""FIRE DRAGON-"" as he inhales and shouts ""ROAR"" as he attacks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRPG- These characters are intended to be played around with. They have various close and long-ranged attacks that its hard to guess how they're built. For example, DragonBorn can come out with bows, weapons, or spells. There will be a choice to choose whether to boost the characters rang, spells, or close-range attacks and a few costumes that represent each type, but doesn't not have to match the boost."
nfuczq,Game Ideas,"Guys it has been a week of constantly searching for ways to get new ideas and play new game, but I can't think of any good idea.

nftll5,Ghost and a victim. Need help to expand my story.,"Ok tittle is not good. But this is my first time of creating some text based adventure game. I had a little idea of game. There were 2 characters ``ghost`` and ``victim/target/boy``\n\n if we play as a ghost our main goal will be to make stay victim/boy, i thought there will be some kind time in which before that time ghost doesn't have a much power to directly kill him or maybe ghost can't do that. The victim/boy will hardly try to get out of there by making some tricky conversation but we need to make him stay anyhow. For ex if he ask for a glass of water and if we go to kitchen he will will run way or something like that and we will lose. \n\nAnd if we play as a boy we play as reverse. Story begin as like this we woke up on a unknown house. We don't how and why we came there and we found there is a lady on a house whose is trying to kill us. Later on we found that there is a time. We need to escape ahead of that time cause she will become more powerful and we will have less time to escape.\n\nSo later on i thought it will be difficult to make character choose able. That's why i need to make only one character playable. I don't know which should i make. I need help of creating some interesting story. Not that much complex cuz before this i had never wrote a story game.\n\nHere i need a story which tells how and why the boy came or we went there, what is the time on which before that time ghost can't kill us or we can't kill. Story need to explain why is that happens.\n\nThat's my basic idea for this game. I know it's ridiculous but this is first game story. It will be just a text adventure game not any graphics."

nffooq,A fighting game where you try to pull off the flashiest moves possible,"Quick question: would any of you play a fighting game in which you try to pull off the flashiest moves possible to win? This idea came to me from some games I've been playing recently: Sunset overdrive and the first injustice game. So why not combine the two? After all, you can never make something completely original, but you can always make something fresh."
nfef16,A 'Cthulu' In Space.," GAME IDEA #4,915.\n\nYou and your motley crew of flesh clumps (maybe 5 others) are stranded on a water planet that has one spaceport connected to one city on the only landmass on the entire world.\n\nYou are heavily armed, and heavily armored, with gadgets on top of gadgets that you can spread out and use amongst yourselves to support one and another.\n\nThe Goal - Gather Parts you need that are spread out across the landmass and City, hidden in areas that need power, security authorization and perhaps some climbing to get into, so you can escape what is happening.  But things break, and bullets are scarce.  Rearming is few and far between and replacing your armor is also slim.  There is no -food- or -drink- meter, but there are Environmental effects, like Radiation and Fire that you will have to contend with.  Thankfully clubs and items of the stability kind don’t shatter like your some blonde mute starring at a broken sword after three wacks, so melee is a viable defense against your foes.\n\nAlso, the Foe(s) you should avoid or fight as sparingly as possible?  Lovecraftian Horrors in the form of two factions, the Old Ones and the Elder Things who are waging a ceaseless bloody war against each other with swarms of lesser critters that rip each other apart to hulking nightmares that could take a small nuke to the face and you would only clear its sinuses.  Neither side takes notice of you and your gang of shooty-bang-bangs unless you are the only ones left in the area or make yourself into a threat they would have to contend with.\n\nThere is no diplomacy.  No communications.  No Rhyme or Reason for what they do.  You and your lot are in a Battleground of Maddening Things that are Blood Drunk for little else other than Slaughter.  They are fighting a war that has Consumed Stars and Shattered Worlds.  All you and those screaming ninnies on your Discord can do is Escape.  Because you can fight all you want, they never stop coming, and they will hound after you until they are dead, or you are.\n\nThe Mechanics would be a sci-fi, 3rd person shooter on an open world, wherein you customize your rambling bag of bones and squishy bits.  You can shoot, stab, and swear vehemently at the twisted husks we call ‘bad guys' in order to win.  You not only have to defend your only means of escape, but you have to set out and seek resources (bullets, med-kits, and go-go-juice or fuel if you want to be pedantic).  Every location is different, and what you need is randomly placed throughout the City.  You die, you lose equipment, resources, and time, spawning back on the ship like a newborn babe, though you get clothes, and don’t have to worry about missing mom at elementary school, or those awkward teen years.\n\nOver time, (and completing a certain threshold of repairs) the presence of said ‘bad guys’ escalated, making forays into the City more difficult than before. The Two AI's are engaging each other like a Real-Time Strategy Game, dispatching units to secure objectives only they could conceive in the effort to remove all other opposition from the map, which is the enemy AI and then YOU in that order.  You, technically, don't want either side to win, instead, you are looking to escape by repairing a down starship and evacuating the Planet because there is no rescue coming.  No one knows what in the name of Bob the Builder is going on, so yeah, you are it.\n\nHowever, as you progress and slay Old Ones and Elder Things, they will start to take notice of you and send forces out to hunt you down and harass the downed spaceship.  Edging the War in Favor of the OTHER side to keep it balanced will keep both sides focusing on the other.  You can do that edging by shooting, stabbing, or sabotaging one side or the other, you just don’t want to garner too much attention in the process.\n\nYou also don't want either side to win completely, not before you are ready to go.  Because once one side has shoved their enemy off the World?  They will be free to wreak full havoc on anything left, and some of those Hulking Nightmares cannot be killed by MORTAL means.\n\nThat anything is YOU, and you are VERY Mortal.\n\nRandomizing objectives for the player, as well as adding lore pieces and exotic weapon types and peppering them across the map would entice players to replay the game.\n\nAlso having a combat system that would allow those crazed, psychotic maniacs who like to hold the line against huge waves of lesser enemies with little more than a dane axe and a colorful vocabulary would help as well.\n\n(NOTE - I have Lore written for this somewhere, I swear.)"
nfdab8,Ranged Tank,"Some of you will agree, some disagree, but mostly this post is here so maybe someone can use it as an inspiration or to discuss this topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, personally, don't find the concept of a ranged tank that hard. Instead of keeping the enmy close and soak up all the damage while the DPS picks 'em off and the healer keeps everyone alive, the ranged tank would keep the mob at bay while the DPS picks 'em off, or anyone that comes through, while the healer keeps everyone alive.\n\nThe damage soaking part comes in with big mobs and/or enemies with ranged attacks.\n\nI imagine them as short- to mid-range, with focus on AoEs, stun- and knock-back attacks. The ranged tank would have to stack buffs for more powerful attacks to keep the enemy at range as long as possible. The attacks are fast enough to keep multible enemies at bay, but slow enough for it to be challenging. Of course, this type of tank would be way less mobile than DPS or even healers.\n\nSuch a tank could be a battle mage with powerful ranged attacks and shield spells, or just some person who ripped a Balliste straight off the wheels and wields it BFG-9000 style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?"
nfd8k0,Political RPG,"I'm sure this has been done before by like Paradox or similar. RPG where you create a charachter, with stats and skills, and gather stuff/level up etc, except instead of the focus being on fighting, 100% of the interactions have to do with politics.\n\nLike, you start out as a councilor in some small town. Your quests have to do with proposing rules and getting people to vote for your legislation. When you level up, you move on to being a politician in a higher tier, until eventually you're the president/prime minister/ emporer.\n\nThe skills would all be very gamified, and the stats would have something to do with your appeal to different people with different ideologies. There would be some simple procedural quests and a main quest line that is scripted. Individual ""encounters"" would be stuff like meetings with lobbyists, votes, town meetings, etc.\n\nYou can get NPCs to join your ""party"", and in this case it is literally your political party. Probably the main view would be a map with encounters occurring in little models of parliament halls, town council buildings, etc."
nfcw6y,Mortal Engines,"This movie gave me a neat and outlandish game idea.  \n\nYou start off in the bleak and open world as a very small campsite attached to a tracked vehicle.  You're quite quick but you have very little in the way of defenses.  You must keep mobile in this world because of the hostile world around you\n\nThe world is full of minerals and materials that you need to mine to grow your city.  Mining minerals and resources helps you to upgrade various components on your vehicle. \n\nYou can upgrade:\n\n- mining equipment to mine faster\n\n- engine to move faster\n\n- different chassis to build different platform (tracked wheels, arachnid legs, hovercraft, all have pros/cons)\n\n- defense systems (shields, laser defense) \n\n- offensive systems: a harpoon that allows you to skillshot and hook other players to slow them down, an auger that allows you to ""mine"" other playercities to absorb them in a very violent manner. This is the urgot experience.  General weaponry\n\n- surveillance - air balloons, primitive planes, etc to observe the world around you (find resources, find other players, etc)\n\n\n\nThe bigger you get, the bulkier you are and generally slower you are. You also become a primary target for enemy players larger than you.\n\n\nThere would be various playstyles available-  pirate/mercenary who strictly hunts other playercities,  fast and small cities who are able to mine smaller patches quickly,  large lumbering giants with very strong defense systems but would need to stay near large resources to sustain themselves.\n\n\nResources are used to repair and refuel your city. If you run out of fuel you can't move and become a target - you'll have to downsize your playercity by selling components you've built to move.\n\nIf you die you start over.\n\n\nYou can build outposts and temporary structures that offer various benefit, but due to the violent world these are rarely permanent and are often destroyed.  The native life on this world are slow tremors-style worms that will attack structures and cities that remain still for too long. \n\n\n\nBalance wise, you start off small with little resources. you're quick and evasive so you stand a chance at surviving but also generally you would not offer a lot of resources for enemy players who would be looking to harvest you."

nexeju,Cooperative Vehicular Combat Game where the tracks do circles around giant bosses.,"[](/gottagofast)Sometimes I have weird dreams. Sometimes those weird dreams make for good game ideas.\n\nSo for this particular fever dream I envisioned a multiplayer boss battle arena where players were all in go-kart like vehicles armed with a variety of weapons. The goal was to kill the boss at the center of the track. Players had to alternate between driving like madmen to get out of the range of attacks to doing high flying stunts to hit high-up weak points to unloading their stored power into the boss' back while their attention was elsewhere.\n\nThis concept could also be expanded to tracks where you race alongside the boss like the ending of Jax andd Daxter 3. Also you could have another player be the boss of asymmetrical PvP.\n\nDrivers could gain temporary damage multipliers by driving through boost rings or doing tricks, so fast and skillful driving resulted in higher DPS. Vehicles had pretty tight handling compared to most driving games so they could quickly face their vehicle towards the boss and unload with front-facing weapons instead of their weaker multi-directional ones. Vehicles also had jumps and hovers to make use of vertical layers of tracks and to get themselves off of damaging floors.\n\nGenerally being in front of the boss is dangerous so one player could try to distract them while the others shoot them from behind. Bosses could also summon minions or create traps that would have to be dealt with so the track didn't get too cluttered.\n\nAccording to my subconscious this game was Sonic Baobao, a Japanese arcade exclusive that was later emulated and took the internet by storm. So you might want to look at procuring the rights from SEGA for maximum authenticity to my dream."

newug8,Need help coming up with a good name,"I'm making a game, but I'm having trouble coming up with a name for the main character. The main character is a slime who starts off really weak and can barely move but he strives to become the pinnacle of strength. Any ideas would help."
new5qe,Player Quest: A World Run By Players,"Excuse this for being really long, I just had a lot of ideas. Also if there's a game similar to this please tell me because I would like to play it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nIn the world of Player Quest, everything is run by the players. The player can fully customize their character to look however they want, there could be different races idk if you want you can add that I guess. Every player starts off in The Hub, a city and commonplace protected by city guards, in the center of the world. There they are given their training and then set off into the world to explore dungeons, fight bandits, and forge their name in history. Each player is given standard gear and a memory shard, which allows them to view visions of the past in dungeons.\n\nPlayers gain a reputation from the King and Queen by completing quests. The more reputation you have the cheaper items will be to buy from NPCs and you can sell items for a higher price to them too, but only for NPCs. This obviously grants you more reputation to buy better gear, new pets, mounts, or homes/bases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Visually**\n\nVisually I'm not picturing this game to be realistic. I think something more cartoonish and outlandish would work great for this. The environment, NPCs, dungeons, and enemies can all be really unique. I'm feeling like something like Breath of the Wild or Wind Waker type of cartoonish graphics would work well for this game. Idk that's just how I would make the game.\n\n**Fast Travel**\n\nThere is a very limited fast travel system. To fast travel you must sacrifice an item you are currently holding, and the value of that item depends on the distance you are fast traveling. For example, if you want to fast-travel to a nearby location you would give up something minor like a healing potion or something. But if you want to fast-travel halfway across the map you would have to give up a much more valuable item. The reason for fast travel is that the wilds are very dangerous. You have the environment that can kill you but also other players. And once you die you respawn on your own and you have to go and get your loot back, hoping that another player didn’t take it. This is why it's important to gather loot so that when you die you equip yourself and try and find your stuff as quickly as possible.\n\n**Questing**\n\nOne of the first quests you can get is to explore a dungeon and recover a lost relic, but things are more complicated than that. Dungeons restart occasionally, probably every day, and they are open to the public so there is a chance that another player has already gone into the dungeon and taken the relic. If you’re early enough, you can get to the dungeon first but you’ll have to survive all of the traps and things within which can be very dangerous. Once you reach the end of the dungeon and the relic is gone you can use your memory shard to see the player that took it, identifying them. You now have a chance to hunt them down before they return the item and return it yourself.\n\nThere is also the chance of someone stealing that relic from the NPC. If someone steals it you can take a bounty quest which would give you the identity of the thief. It won’t give you the location of the thief but if you go near them the game will notify you and you can kill them. The reason to steal it is if you can hold onto that item for a duration of time you can sell it for triple or 10x the price or whatever. But that time duration is only if you are playing the game, so if you log off that timer stops, and the timer stops if you enter a dungeon or a base or something like that; you have to spend that duration in the wilds which isn't that bad since the fast travel is limited so you’ll probably be walking or traveling to the next locations anyways. Once you steal the item the timer begins. You don’t know who the bounty hunter players are so you’ll have to be very careful with avoiding and surviving them. Also, all bounty hunters are competing against each other, so just because one player kills the thief doesn’t mean you can’t kill that bounty hunter, take the relic from them, and return it. The bounty hunter quest ends once the item is returned or the thief survives. The thief is also unable to return the item. Once the thief’s timer runs out they can sell the item for the increased price or just store it for later in their home.\n\n**Housing**\n\nWhen the game begins each player is given a room at an inn. In this room, you have a single chest that you can store a very limited number of items in. Players can also put decorations and stuff too. Later on, you can buy houses and even land out in the wilds to build your forts and stuff. Each home is its own area so you would have to load into it. If you purchase a piece of land in the wild a player approaching that land will be notified that they are entering someone’s land and if they want to travel to the location, if they say no then they’ll just keep exploring. \n\nBut anyone can break into your home. You can’t just buy any area in the wild, there are specific locations all throughout the map that you can buy. But since you have to load into your home other people can buy that plot of land too. When you go to that plot or home it will give you the option to enter your home or enter other players’ and it will give you a list of all the other players that own that plot or home and you can enter them and try to break in and stuff. But when you are offline they are not allowed to break into your home. Players can only break into the homes of players currently online. If you are breaking into someone’s house and they log off then you get 10 seconds to grab as much as you can before you get kicked out. During that time guards will also be twice as powerful.\n\nBut you have to be careful because anyone can purchase hounds or guards and defenses to protect their stuff. If someone tries to break into your home and they’re caught you get notified and you have the option to fast travel to your home and hunt them down. But you cannot fast-travel to your home at any other time without giving up an item. When someone gets caught and you kill them, you aren’t allowed to open any chests or anything. If they stole anything and you stopped them then all those items go back to the chests they were last in. You can loot their body and once you get everything you can from them you can dispose of it and anything you didn’t take gets thrown away forever.\n\n**Guilds**\n\nPlayers can also create their own guilds, at any level. Each guild is private and the guild leader can accept any players they want. When a player applies to a guild their relationship with other guilds and members within the guild their applying is shown to the guild leader so that they can decide whether they should be accepted or not. So like if someone is trying to apply but they have really bad beef with another guild or a bigger one, you can decline them out of fear of being attacked. Or if they have or had beef with a current guild member you can discuss it with that guild member and then determine.\n\n**Enemies**\n\nEnemies follow the ESO style where they level up with the player. So an enemy will be as difficult for a level 1 as a level 100.\n\n**Dungeons**\n\nAny player can create their own dungeon using a separate dungeon-making app or something. To create it you must first pick a prize which you will give up. So if you want the reward to be 10,000 reputations you must give up that much of your own. This is relevant since other players will be more inclined to play player-made dungeons with better rewards, which would benefit you more (as discussed later).\n\nWhen creating a dungeon you can pick how many players are needed for it, the max is 8. You can create your own traps, mazes, use whatever enemies, have parkour, literally whatever you want. Every week, player-made dungeons get open to the public and you have a 1-week timespan. During that time span, players can play your dungeons and rate them at the end. The rating is a “like” or “dislike”. At the end of the week the game will tally up your score and it'll rate it out of 5 stars and if you get anything less than 3 stars then your dungeon gets removed and you basically lose your hard work and effort. But for every “like” that you get you receive the amount of reputation at your level; so if you are level 10 you will receive 512 reputations for every “like.” At the end of every week, the top 3 player dungeons get special rewards. Every week there will be new player dungeons and there will be random weeks where popular dungeons are opened. There will probably be like 12 or something dungeons that change every week but if there aren’t 12 player dungeons to choose from then randomly generated ones appear which allow the bounty quests, but otherwise the bounty quests don’t apply.\n\n**Leveling**\n\nLeveling is based on your reputation. Each player starts at level one with 0 reputations. Each level increases the reputation requirement by 2. So level 1 starts off with 1 reputation required, level 2 needs 2, level 3 needs 4, level 4 needs 6, etc. The max level is 100. You gain reputation by completing quests. Quests are given by NPCs or Quest Boards found through the map. The quests can be completing a dungeon, getting a relic, killing a certain number of enemies, or gathering resources or something. These aren’t things you necessarily focus on but you end up achieving as you're playing. You gain reputation by just killing enemies and selling things. The amount of reputation you get from defeating enemies, gathering resources, and completing dungeons depend on your level. So if you are level 5 you would get 16 reputations from those actions. You get double your level in reputation for completing quests. So if you are level 5 you would get 32 reputations for completing quests.\n\nYou also earn reputation points from selling things. There are 5 rankings to items: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Every 5 levels the amount of reputation per item sold increases. So between levels, to  1-5 Common items will give you 1 reputation, uncommon 2, rare 3, epic 4, legendary 5. When you are level 15-20 common items sold give you 3, uncommon gives you 6, rarely gives you 9, epic gives you 12, and legendary gives you 15.\n\n**Skills**\n\nThere are many different skill branches within the game and each time you level up you gain an increase in the branches most used. When you level up you also get an increase in Health, Stamina, and Magicka, but you also get an extra point increase you can put into any of those three. You level up skills by using that skill. So if you want to increase your skill in archery you have to use a bow.\n\nBut it is your reputation that is really important. The higher your reputation the better quests you get with better rewards. NPC shops will also be cheaper and will provide you with higher-level items to purchase. Certain homes and plots also aren’t purchasable without a certain level of reputation. But you can also lose your reputation. The currency in this game is reputation. So when you purchase something you pay with reputation. You won’t go down a level, you’ll stay at your current level, but to level up you’ll have to regain all that reputation you just spent and then level up to your current level. Getting killed causes you to lose 25% of your current reputation. So if you are level 3 you need 4 reputations to level up so you’ll lose 1 reputation. But that percentage is determined by the level that your reputation is at, not your level. So if you buy something with a ton of reputation and your reputation goes down a couple of levels, the amount you lose is 25% of the level you went down to, not the level you are actually at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Random Extra**\n\nReaching max level will probably be pretty difficult so when a player does it they are commemorated by having a statue of them be added into the game in The Hub. You can create up to 3 players.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask and I’ll try to answer them. Thank you for reading!"
neutyy,Jurassic park but in a resident evil formula,"Okay picture this. You are one of the staff members that stayed back to help the park open before the main events of the movie, shit hits the fan. Then you the game centres around you trying to escape the island by exploring the entire islands by driving going to different facilities and research labs to find out weird science information. You keep running around unlocking new sections. Eventually you can unlock the dart rifles with tranquilizer shots. But with limited ammo. You go around finding parts to fix a helicopter or boat to get off the island. \n\nI think it is a really cool idea. If I ever get any game developer skills I would make this game but I thought I would record this idea somewhere. \n\nWhat do you guys think?"
neti1y,Keteru yamiko,This is first game i have ever thought so please feel  free to  give criticism and help me. \n\nThis game is mainly inspired by SCP 835 - JP\n\nThis is a horror game that has  every realistic features and it's set in a  huge lab not a foundation one where a group of players have to avoid being killed by yamiko. The total amount should be 12 players for a game. Just like FNAF or among us the players have tasks to complete for example changing water checking in on equipment and listening or reading yamiko manga  and anime. The reason you have to read the Manga or the anime it's because if you are the last one to not complete this task you are the first target  she will be looking to kill. There also a catch if you read the Manga too much you will also still be our first Target. The first stage of the game is basically doing test the second stage is avoiding try not to be killed as a side note only the person that does not read the Manga first gets killed everyone else who has read the Manga will not encounter her and vice versa if you read the Manga too much since one of the mechanics is to reread it multiple times. The third stage is Task and investigation is still continue to do your task at the same time you have to do a investigation on the death of the players. Keep in mind the deceased player is muted and everyone is muted during the task stage but there is a group chat. when the player is being stalked their chat becomes unusable to the targeted  player between stage there's something like Among Us where you can do a group call or group meeting to give the evidence that you found in present your case and vote  players out or lockdown in a cell. Another side note due to the fact that player locked in they will be the one that  get killed during the next stage with another player. By the  fourth stage if all players are dead or it is one remaining the game is lost. To win the game you have to at least find out that it was a SCP by gather enough evidence to prove it and calling the foundation. This is where the bonus stage comes in for the both winners and losers. The game now becomes more of a first-person to third-person shooter smilier to battlefield  and rainbow six siege the  objective of the mission is to rescue the one player that was remaining that's now NPC and capture the SCP for those who lose. For those  who won main task is retrieve data and capture the  SCP. At the end of for the winners there's a little cutscene or a continuation of the stage where you're trying to deliver the SCP but there is mysterious beat up old rusty police car chasing you too be continue for a dlc. \n\nThis game is made for PC and gaming consoles
neq35h,City builder with thinking mechanic,"Lightning into a tree. Fire. A few hunters and collector gather around the fire and start thinking. After a moment a new idea is unlocked. They can use now sticks and stones to craft tools. A part of the group starts collecting and crafting and some stay at the fire continuing thinking.\n\nIn this city builder thinking is the way to unlock new mechanics in the game. You need more people and greater or more advanced buildings in time to boost your thinking efficiency. \n\nIt is a city builder but unlike other city builder you can, next to thinking, build your own buildings with a tool kit (like in planet zoo or planet coaster). The tool kit you expand with the thinking mechanic. Unlock a saw to create a sawmill and gather planks. With the planks you can build a planked wood wall. If somebody though about that. This should create organic and individual city development through the ages.\n\nIf people don't work they can think. Maybe they can go to a school or university to think better. \n\nI think you can imagin the game."
nelgyd,"A Multiplay SPC Game, But with a twist!","So here’s what I’m thinking: this will be an 8 v 8 v 1 multiplayer game pitting the SCP Foundation against the Illuminati, with an escaped SCP hunting both groups and interfering with whatever mission they undertake.\n\nThat’s the main loop of this game: each map will have a unique objective pertaining to either “Containment” for the Foundation or “Breaching” for the Illuminati. For example, the Foundation is working to retrieve several active SCPs from an abandoned shopping mall while the Illuminati are working to stop them and keep the instances active at all times, with The Plague Doctor roaming around trying to “cure” both sides."
nek0u1,Ideas For My New Game,"I have been working on a new game, or at least planning. I need some inspiration. It is going to be a 3D Open World RPG, sort of like Genshin Impact but instead of anime looking characters it will be cartoony looking characters. I also want to implement some building mechanics and a whole ton of items and weapons, aswell as different heroes, pvp and a campaign. I just need ideas and a way to organize this game. Feel free to message me or leave some ideas, and of course I will credit the ideas if they manage to get into the official game."
nejavh,I've had this idea for a while now ...,"For a few weeks I've had in the back of my mind a game idea. It is set in a dystopian country that has been at war for some time. You play as someone who is a part of the military and is becoming disaffected with the world you live in. You are picked to test a new piece of equipment to help win the war: an armoured suit. The protagonist gets in the suit through its back and starts to learn the basics (the tutorial). During this process some kind of disaster happens resulting in an explosion and you have the opportunity to escape with this new piece of tech. You get to a nearby town and to safety but realise that the back of the suit has been damaged thus meaning you are stuck in the suit. This is the crutch of the game, you have 3 days to live before succumbing to dehydration and as the days progress the functions of your suit fail and you become weaker. The campaign is divided into these three days and you can unlock perk points that allow you to pick functions that you want to keep and will force you to specialise your play style. Your overall objective is to free the town and nearby area of the presence of the authoritarian government and fight off any forces they send in."

Inspirations include:\n\n* [Fallen London](https://www.failbettergames.com/fallen-london/)\n* [Sunless Skies](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless-skies/)\n* [Tyranny](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/tyranny/TYTY01GSK-MASTER.html)\n* [Beholder](https://beholder-game.com/)\n* [Suzerain](https://www.suzeraingame.com/)\n* [Eighty Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/)\n* [Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault/)\n\nYour character can pick different career paths (magician, spy, thief, thug, military officer, etc.), whatever will give them a leg up in the dog-eat-dog world of villainy.\n\nYour character can align with various factions within the evil army/government/business they work for, or be secretly working for another villainous faction outside the organization, or even (gasp!) spying for the good guys. They can also go out (setting permitting) and spy on the good guys, possibly even sabotaging their operations or giving bad advice.\n\nWith that basic concept said, here's a couple of rambling, optional ideas, in no particular order:\n\nI don't really know what the best combat system would be: perhaps just a skill check or a bunch of options (charge, dodge, shoot, etc., depending on the setting), with success depending on the character's stats.\n\nThe character could also be a more verbal type, using flattery, rumors, and so on to misdirect enemies into your literal or metaphorical traps. For example, the villainous mook character you play attempts to misdirect a hero (the type of character you'd usually play in a video game) to assassinate the wrong target or steal the wrong MacGuffin. This could be by pretending to be a ""quest-giving"" character or by setting traps, blocking doors, messing with the ""signpost"" clues, stealing the MacGuffin themselves and escaping, and so on.\n\nThese ""misdirection"" parts of the game could be just textual choices like the rest of the game or they could be top-down 2D maps that allow you to move through and mess with the map as the hero you're fighting goes charging through. Imagine if you were playing Dishonored or some other action game, but one of the ordinary-looking guards anticipated you showing up and messed up the level design and/or your mission goals in the first place. Maybe that's too much for a simple text RPG, but I thought I'd throw it out there.\n\nOf course, it being an evil protagonist game, your character is also cozying up to various other ambitious villains, running errands, choosing factions, and looking for an opportunity to backstab. Perhaps you'd also have a reputation stat or multiple faction reputation stats, which you can fill up by pleasing your current boss or your boss's rivals to earn promotions.\n\nThe game ends when you reach the top...or if you get killed or expelled for your ambition.\n\nPlease let me know your ideas!"
ndsyad,Inspiration,I am working in Unreal Engine and I am looking for a game idea. It's my first game so I want it to be smallish but I want to be able to post it on steam as well. I dont want to create anything specific I just know I want it to be a 3D game.
ndrf4y,What really is there to do in space?,"So, there are two types of space games I can think of right now: flight simulators and colony builders. This post is exclusively about the latter.\n\nWith the flight-simulator kind of space game, what you do in space is pretty obvious: you're the pilot, and you fly around and shoot things, and there's various ships, asteroids, stations, and other obstacles to shoot at and fly around.\n\nFor builder-type games, you're in charge of a crew and you can obviously build things like expand your ship, place equipment, manufacture stuff, and maybe fight off enemies in a vaguely X-COM-style way. The view is some kind of cross-section, either top down or isometric.\n\nThe game I want to make is based a bit more in hard sci-fi and I'm trying to keep that in mind, though we'll see how long that lasts 😀\n\nTo clarify my issue I want to talk about a couple other games first. First game is [Starship Theory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/574760/Starship_Theory/), which despite the reviews \_is\_ fun for about 10 hours. You start out on a tiny ship and can use a mining laser to choose asteroids, gather materials, and build out new hull and flooring for your ship. However, other than building up more resource-generating equipment (e.g. solar panels), accumulating resources, and placing items, there's not much to \_do\_. There's a continuous stream of events: asteroid fields, friendly trading ships, hostile warships. And you fly too close to suns sometimes. Normally, the way games are paced (e.g. Rimworld, or any game), it's maybe 70% downtime and maybe 30% do-or-die-oh-shit-we're-being-attacked. This game is 100% ""there's an event happening right now"", and it's always one of those 3 events.\n\nAnother (more finished) game is [Space Haven](https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/). This one is for sure more rounded out, and has similar ""collect resources, expand your ship"" mechanics, but as you can see from the [screenshots](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979110/ss_ef63e55182d8068e762d3824ab52a569df12ae4d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620996077) it eventually turns into a build-an-entire-supply-chain-in-space simulator. You could \_buy\_ microchips, but why do that when you can research and build up a dozen different fabrication devices and build them from scratch? /s There's of course a fair bit more content like mining and breaking down derelict ships, all the while being chased by pirates to keep you from lingering in one place for too long, but the core building mechanic is just building up tons of factories to convert resources into different types of resources.\n\nMy issue with Starship Theory is that the crew just sits on their consoles until they're hungry, thirsty, or tired, and then eats, drinks, or naps (hey, a little like real life?). Space Haven is maybe 75% building factories and resource management.\n\nThe game I want to make, as mentioned earlier, aims to be SLIGHTLY realistic:  \n\* You can't just float outside in an EVA suit and expand the hull on your ship. You need to be at a station to modify your hull.  \n\* Not building an entire supply chain on a small spacecraft.  \n\* Not fielding a continuous stream of severe events\n\nBut then if you're not building a manufacturing line, and you have proper downtime between random events, what is the player (and crew) actually doing?\n\nIs your reaction reading this ""Yes, that's space games for ya"", or is there something more interesting someone could build in this genre?"
ndrdxr,"Lintu, Survival of the birds","The title may be changed.\n\nIdea: a survival game where you either play as a bird or can change into a bird.\n\npreferably with terrain that compliments the ability to fly, and not necessarily earthly.\n\nfor inspiration for the flight and transform mechanic you could look up a cancelled project called Vind"
ndoqk5,Game based off Hypixel Bedwars,"So something I noticed was that Minecraft servers have some games that are similar to some very popular games.\n\nI mean there’s Minecraft hunger games and a bunch of battle royale games which were incredibly popular for a while.\n\nThere’s minecraft murder mystery and there’s among us which are basically the same games.\n\nThere’s also a bunch of capture the flag type games in Minecraft which is a popular game mode in many popular games.\n\nI mean all these popular Minecraft mini games tend to have popular real game counterparts. And since bedwars is one of the most popular games in the most popular Minecraft server, and is actually an interesting and fun concept, I’d say if someone were to make a quality game that’s similar to bedwars, it has potential to blow the hell up.\n\nIt’s also the type of game where many youtubers can make content from especially if they add a bunch of variant game modes. I mean of course as usual, whether it succeeds depends on all kinds of stuff other games need to succeed, such as the visuals, gameplay, controls etc.\n\nBut I think such a game would have a higher chance than others, simply cuz it’s already a well known and fun concept that’s only existed as a mini game.\n\nSo as long as someone makes it right, I feel like it could blow the hell up."
ndm79d,A game about controlling your body from the insides to fight off diseases and stay healthy," So basically, you work as the brain telling every part of the body to do their part. You can take control of organs so they work better like controlling the immune system and game goes into mini war mode to fight a virus, stuff like that. This is all I have figured out right now, just thought of this when waking up and felt the need to type this out.  \nI need some more inspiration, any ideas?"
ndm15e,A game about controlling your own to fight off diseases and stay healthy from the insides,"So basically, you work as the brain giving out signals (hormones) to your body to grow, sleep, eat etc\nThis is all I have figured out right now. I just woke up, thought of this and felt the need to type this out\nI feel like this could be a really cool game, it could be 3d third person where the brain is like a character you can move and organs are characters you have to talk to make them work correctly or from a god perspective where you can control everything by clicking and pressing buttons \nI need some more inspiration, any ideas?"
ndkgx9,The cross dimensional soldier [FPS],This could be done by a beginner but it's reasonable to say it'd be more successful if you're an intermediate\n\nIdea: You are a soldier that can travel between 2 different dimensions\n\nThere is enemies in both but you can't attack the enemies in the dimension your currently in\n\nSo to defeat these enemies you have to travel to the other dimension and use your guns scope to see where the enemies are and shoot to defeat them\n\nSo you can't shoot the enemies in the dimension you're currently in but you can shoot the enemies in the other dimension but to find their location you can use your scope
ndhpkz,Autochess genre variants,"With the success of tactical shooters, I'd like to see a Valorant autochess.  Instead of the pieces battling in a normal autochess manner, they attempt to plant/defuse a bomb each round.  Weapons  would be items, abilities unlock as piece tier increases, etc.    \n\n\nAlso, albeit a bit humorous by nature, I would like to see a Chess Autochess.  Pretty sure I don't have to explain that one, but I feel like it could be fun.  :D"
nd8bsz,A base building survival game set on a sleeper ship.,"I might try this, but it isn't fully fleshed out. I've been reading a bunch of hard sci fi set on ""slow"" interstellar ships. Think big spaceships full of frozen people that are thawed out 100, 1000 or 10000 years later after they reach their decremated. The thing that interests me is: what happens on these space ship's when things go wrong? Does someone have to wake up and do maintenance? Are there robots?\n\nIn this game you would play either as the ship's AI, or as one (or several) crewmates. The goal would be to reach the destination without the colonists dying or the ship getting destroyed. I was imagining that mostly this is a building and resource management game. You start with resources that you can use to build your ship. \n\nThe ship is constructed of modules and is viewed in a top down way. Each module has equipment in it that has inputs and outputs (say, heat electricity, oxygen, co2, proteins, etc.) And your goal is to construct the ship so that it is in homeostasis.\n\nAfter a long time, the homeostasis breaks down, and modules have to be repaired, replaced, or rearranged.\n\nThe way this would work, I imagine, is that you have ""sleeping"" and ""waking"" cycles. When you're asleep, the game cycles through years rapidly and simulates the breakdown of the ship, and maybe throws in some randomly generated ""crises"" like a meteroid impact. When something starts to go wrong, the player is ""woken up"" and has to check out the ship's status, the levels of all the inputs and outputs, and then rearranges modules, breaks modules down and recreates modules as needed.\n\nThere could be some resources that take 1000s of years to come to fruition, like a forest module that generates wood, or a compost module that breaks down dead organics into methane. So you could wake up to harvest those resources.\n\nI think the major challenge in this game would be making the emergent effects balanced enough to be a challenge while also not being impossible. Showing the player what the full state of the system is might also be pretty hard."
nd2rcp,Upside down camera rotation for an FPS/TPS combat drone game.,"(I think I'm flairing this as mechanic, since the all the further concepts are designed around this mechanic.)\n\nSpellbreak is a TPS with lots of vertical movement, so a common ""issue"" is that it becomes hard to aim an enemy directly above or below you due to how cameras in FPS games normally work. The default FPS camera works so that you have infinite yaw rotation (horizontal rotation) but where pitch is limited to 90 degrees up and down from the horizontal level.\n\nThis isn't really a fix to that problem, that's just how the idea came to my mind: So, I thought, wouldn't it be funny if you could rotate your camera OVER that top/bottom limit and do an actual flip, going upside down? Basically, this would double the range of possible camera positions, the new positions being otherwise equivalent but where the camera is upside down. This also provides infinitely looping pitch (vertical) rotation.\n\nNote that this is NOT the same as going upside down in flight simulators, where there's no preference relative to world axis and where turning pitch and yaw will cause roll. In my idea the horizontal rotation would still happen around the top and bottom ""poles"" like in FPS games, and therefore the camera is still defined around this up/down axis and there's no roll, and sideways is always sideways. It's just that now for every possible direction the camera can be facing, it can be either upright or upside down (or, literally ""on the flipside"").\n\nThe logical choice for what the player character considering the camera system is a combat drone/(quad)copter, for which being able to flip over and fly on either side makes sense. [Bad, quick, basic drone design](https://files.catbox.moe/qnu2ew.png) From this point on, an endless number of possibilities rush into my mind.\n\n---\n\nThis kind of game would create whole new skills compared to traditional FPS games\n\n- Choosing flip side situationally with potential sacrifice in awareness: You could have different set of abilities available based on which side you are flipped on. Strengths, weaknesses and synergies could depend on which side you are on, or depending or whether you or your enemy are on the same or different ""polarity""\n\n- Ability to flip and keep track on enemy: To flip, you need to turn 180 degrees horizontally and 180 degrees vertically. Both can be executed towards either direction theoretically without ever lifting your mouse from the pad given enough sensitivity, since there's no top/bottom limiter to change the relative mouse position when gone against it.\n\n- Navigation ability, to not get disoriented while flipping and being able to comprehend the battlefield on both flip sides.\n\n- New manuever possibilities, like circling around an enemy vertically. While this is technically a thing in flight sims, it's different due to free mouse aim and top/bottom poles.\n\nMap and gravity possibilities: All of these should ultimately be wider horizontally than vertically, since aiming sideways is still better than straight up/down.\n\n- Traditional map on earth surface with gravity.\n\n- A map within an open space, with floating obstacles and points of interest approximately on the middle plane. Could have no gravity, or gravity towards the middle plane, or away from the middle plane.\n\n- A flat, two-sided ground surface surrounded by sky or space on both sides, with holes to go to other side, or if it's a smaller disk, you might have to go around the edge to get on the other side. Gravity is towards ground plane. Team bases are on opposite sides of the disk. \n\n- A map with sky sandwiched by two grounds on opposite sides (floors/roofs). Gravity is towards both floors and switches in the middle point, abruptly or gradually becoming zero-g in the middle. Team bases would be on opposite grounds and also at some distance horizontally.\n\n- The definition on which flip side you are on could either be set in stone for a map, or be determined by the direction of gravitational field you are in. Or it could be determined by the side of your base, meaning that opposing teams potentially have the opposite favorable side.\n\nAdditional game ideas:\n\n- HUD features and color change to indicate which side you are on, normal side or flipside. For example, your crosshair could change from this /+\  to this \\+/. Also, show a border across top and bottom poles and/or or color tint on the side you are not on, to indicate when you are about to flip sides.\n\n- Different unit types that vary in speed, properties and abilities, different classes. Some heavy classes could have limited turning rate, with a free aim being limited to a square that slowly adjusts towards the crosshair. The meat of the game however, is focused on drones with FPS-like free aim and mobility for extremely fast-paced 3D dogfighting.\n\n- Ability to land ground and horizontal surfaces. Available abilities and unit properties could depend on which flip side you land on (which will also determine whether you are attached to ground or ""roof"" visually). You might be able to travel on ground with wheels or in a humanoid form, or it could be a static mount on a surface, where your drone transforms into a temporary turret which could provide things like vastly increased defense and firepower. Your unit type could have limitations on which side it can land on at all.\n\n- Some unit type could flip using an ability, by doing a quick 180 roll, so that you don't need to manually flip (by turning 180 horizontally and vertically), though this should be a specialty, not a norm.\n\n- On most unit types, levitation thrusters would be omnidirectional and automatically point towards ground/gravity, but a special unit type could have thrusters work only towards one side, limiting the time you can spend flipped upside down before you crash down. The advantages for flipping then would be greater. This would result in some high risk high reward aerial acrobatics to maximize combat potential. This could even be a whole unit category."

ncsi7w,AI for enemies being attracted to a player whistling,"I dont know anything about AI at all, but I'm gonna start diving into it soon though, because I'm trying to make a game in Dreams on Ps4, and I want to have some stealth in it.\n\nLike I said, I know nothing about it, so I dont even know if I'm thinking about it in the right way, but it seems like it could work to me. Idk.\n\nSo, here's what I was thinking. Let me know if it makes sense or not. Its \n\n- When one enemy hears your whistle, 2/3 of the time they will casually stroll over to check it out. This sets them up for easy stealth kills.\n\n- 1/3 of the time they will draw their gun and become suspicious, making the takedown more challenging. \n\n- If they are suspicious, there is a 1/3 chance that they would say, ""Hey, I heard something,"" alerting any enemies within a certain distance. \n\n- The alerted will then turn and watch while the other investigates. \n\n- If two or more enemies hear your whistle, they will each react independently. So, two might be calm, while one is suspicious, or they're all suspicious, or all calm, etc. They will each have the 1 in 3 chance.\n\n- If three or more enemies hear your whistle, they will always only send two men.\n\n- If your cover is ever blown, or if enemies discover a dead body or something, they will be suspicious of every whistle from then on out.\n\nDoes that make sense? And is it insanely difficult to do?"

I feel like in this game, you can pick different countries from ww2 and play with them in a story, but your actions can change the campaign and or cross over different place you might have seen playing another side. Basically its choice based like telltale, but centered around player action not a selection of 4 choices, based in ww2 with interesting plot and historical areas across the world such as moscow, Leningrad, berlin, you get the picture\n\nIdk give me your thoughts 😁"
ncoxiu,Money Down: A Battle Royale where money is on the line every round.,"Now, I know this idea is basically dead in the water because cheaters would probably ruin it but anyway...\n\nI would like to see a battle royale in line with something like PUBG but each round requires putting money down to buy into the round. \n\nThe ante money is in-game credits that would be purchased through a store and could also be spent on cosmetics. Once you have credits in your account you queue up for the level of ante you want. I'm thinking the equivalent of $1 or $5. \n\nAs far as pay outs my first though is something like, bottom half loses their ante, top half at least breaks even, top 10 at least doubles, third makes 3x, second 4x, and first 5x. The house take the balance and is the primary way the game makes money. Credits won from rounds can be pulled out once you get to a minimum value so if you make money from playing well. \n\nEven if you couldn't get a full lobby of 100 people into a 5 dollar game on a Tuesday night, having money down would even make a 10 person battle royale round intense as long as the circles and loot were appropriately balanced. \n\nI think the money on the line aspect would also make it popular for streamers. Twitch account integration could let people bet their credits on the contestants."
nclo6f,How to increase the creativity of the game developer?,"Throughout my 20 years working with art, I have always found myself in the need to seek new sources of inspiration, whether for a personal or professional job. One of the best ways to increase your creativity is to collect images and references from other artists on a daily basis. Every year I create a reference folder on my computer, collect everything I like and that can inspire me in future projects. The first page of your browser must be a portal for artists' works, that is, there is no escape, daily I am bombarded with images and magnificent works, which only contribute to my creativity and perfectionism.\n\nOne of the websites I recommend is ArtStation and CGSociety, both of which are an excellent source of inspiration. \n\nI believe that this is the minimum. Watching movies, being extremely curious, playing different types of games, drawing, writing a story, watching documentaries about the universe, mysteries, in short, all this contributes to having more and more references in our minds. Get inspired and use your creativity to create new projects."

ncagfl,Sea of thieves except Star Wars,"Sorry for bad grammar and bad spelling \n\nOk so the concept of the game is almost like sea of thieves except in space like a Star Wars Version of it. The game would be set days after the battle of Jakku. This would mean the empire is all but destroyed there are still parts of it floating around space but for the most part it’s gone. \n\nSo My idea is we would split the mechanics in games like sea of thieves, red dead redemption and No Mans Sky. What I would  want to take from no mans sky would be there ship mechanics and there space exploration stuff but scale it down a bunch so you have like 2-3 different systems with 1-2 planes in it.\n\nThe Red Dead Redemption part would be taken from there. Honour system. You could ether be good or bad if your bad you would work for people like Jaba the hut or other groups like that. If you’re good you would work for the new republic doing bounties and other missions. Now let’s say you want to make a switch from the new republic to the hut clan, to do that there would be a very special mission for you to complete. What I was thinking for that mission is Raiding a ship that belonged to the empire. The ship is still active and is trying to restart the empire but you come to stop it, this is how you would convert from a bad guy working for the Hut clan to someone in the new republic. \n\nThe Sea of thieves part is pretty self explanatory but there could be a whole variety of missions for someone to do depending on what honour you are. If you work for the Hut Clan you could be doing hit jobs or running spice. If you were on the new republic you would do things like bounty hunting or find officers who were apart of the empire.\n \nOne last thing to mention would be how you would maneuver around space. In sea of thieves everyone is given the choice between three different ships with different numbers of crew mates aloud on. This game would completely change that. The ships customization would be depending on how you play. If you play alone then you might want more speed on your ship because you might now be able to control the turrets the best alone. If you play with your mates you might want a ships that built for combat. What I just listed was the customization inside the ships but what about the actual ship you can purchase. What I’m thinking is this, for the two sides of honour there would be different types of ships, each having there desirable attributes compared to the other.\n\nAnyways this is my idea for a game. Personally I think this would be a fun game that would make you feel like your now apart of the Star Wars universe. Sorry for making You read a bunch of grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes."
nc6sri,Brass bones,"I know rule 6 states that anyone can use my idea but I'm looking to develop this one myself, I'm just looking for feedback.\n\nProcedural Rogue-lite with PS1 style graphics and a steampunk theme. Titanfall style mobility with a few dozen unique weapon types. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Arc-rifle: Fires multiple short-range lightning bolts that chain to nearby enemies on hit.\n* Ramper: Machine pistol that fires faster the longer the trigger is held. The magazine is inserted through the top like an M1 Garand. Ping included.\n* Gibstick: Charge-up railgun that obliterates enemies.\n\nEach weapon will have three perks that are randomly generated. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Wormhole Accelerator: (For projectile weapons) Simply teleports the bullet into the enemy. Less damage due to some quantum wormhole magic.\n* Recall Beacon: On precision hit, return the next three shots to the magazine. These recalled bullets lose some velocity.\n* Cheese Grater: Bullets are split into multiple short-range versions of themselves. Must be a strong cheese grater.\n\nI'm still debating whether or not to have these perks physically appear on the gun due to it being a colossal amount of work. As stated in the Recall Beacon, some weapons will have elemental properties. These do nothing by themselves but when combined... for example, if an enemy is coated in tar then hit by fire, they will combust. If an enemy is coated in water, then hit with ice, they freeze, temporarily stunning them.\n\nThe lore consists of you being a worker robot that was accidentally left with their consciousness when they got thrown away. Every time you die, your AI is transferred into a new robot. You start in a hub area called, fittingly, 'The Junkyard'. Upon dying, you can choose a new frame to 'possess'. I'm planning on adding three classes but aren't super sure with the specifics yet. I know I'll have one mobile frame, another more tanky frame, and another specialist that's maybe more of a hacker that can 'tame' enemies?\n\nAt some point in your runs, you'll unlock the permanent aspect. The upgrade booth which for some reason is sentient. You'll get cogs from defeating bosses which you can then use to either upgrade health, speed, or damage. Every three upgrades in each category introduces a new mechanic such as grenades, slow motion, or even b-hopping.\n\nPlease, please give me feedback as it is greatly appreciated. I hope you liked my idea and maybe even buy it someday!"

It seems like the perfect way to handle them. \n\n- Say you're on Ps4, basically, if you hold square at a closed door, the player character will walk through and close it behind them, in one fluid animation. If the door's already open, the player will walk theough and close the door behind them.\n\n- If you quickly press square instead, the character will only open it. Same goes for closing it. Pretty much like every other game. \n\nSeems like this would be great for both immersion/realism, or if enemies are chasing you. \n\nIn real life if I go through a door and close it behind me, it pretty much feels like one continues motion. In video games its four: Open, walk through, turn, and close. All with a small pause in between. Something that feels so second nature in real life, should not be so difficult in a game. It seems like this would finally make handling doors feel very natural.\n\nHas any game ever done this?"
nc43kc,A cute kaiju game where if you damage structures you lose points,"Your goal in the game would be to try to complete some objectives and dodge enemy human forces and take down evil kaiju.\n\nYou also would have to do this while trying to keep the human, wildlife areas safe as you, enemies can destroy them but if you or an enemy destroys them you gain negative points and the human enemies will be more numerous and difficult in later levels\n\nYou would also have the ability to collect more Kaiju along the way to add to your team so you get more gameplay types from just one Kaiju\n\n.\n\nStory: You and a bunch of other kaiju had woken up a lil while ago and humans are trying to fight them off and in doing some invent new technologies to control simpler minded kaiju and create mechanical kaiju but then a big bad (typical evil) kaiju arrives and takes control over these enemies and empowers them and is trying to infest all creatures so they're under its command and obviously you don't want that\n\nStyle: 2D (Isometric or top down) or 3D (top down or Isometric or 3D camera following player and allowed to turn\n\nPossible other things:\n- Secrets\n- Extra lives so you can continue longer + limited continues\n- collectables &amp; cheat codes (don't disable progression so you can use them to help you in especially difficult parts)"
nc30g6,Random game stat i thought about in FPS competitive games,"i was thinking if the stat of distance between the player and the enemy they kill, then getting the average determined by each kill they get would be an interesting thing to see \n\nfor example, there are 2 people with similar scores in a 5v5 game of csgo (can be applied to the likes of R6, Valorant, etv) lets say guy #1 is 20/11/7, and guy #2 is 19/5/2 in the rounds they played were 15 at half time. if each kill were to be a calculated distance for the kill shot then each kill being averaged and displayed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* determines if you're a long range shooter/entry fragger (first contact) with the ak for example or someone who kills in close range/holding angles \n* of course every kill is going to be a mixture of both in game play but im focusing on the frequency and how often kills like these occur and what scenario/gameplay style you play as discussed in the comment above\n\nbut yeah thats just an idea that i expanded on from a random thought and found this page to share, any feedback is welcomed."
nc2nuv,1-Hub 4-Portal Random Map Diablo without respawn,"A diablo-like game where you start in a town/hub like world with 4 portals to other worlds. You can visit them in any order you like. Each world behind a portal is a random generated map with a certain theme and monsters. You must find some keys, activate some switches and then beat the map's boss. Your goal is to visit all 4 maps and kill the bosses, to unlock the  final boss of the game that will appear in the hub town. Each map takes about 10-15 minutes for an average player. The skill level of the monsters is balanced to your XP/skill-level.\n\nSo to beat the whole game will only take \~1 hour!\n\nThe clue: When you die...you must restart the whole game!\n\nI thought about a game that has a high rate of replaying, you can further make speedruns or play in larger coop groups where the game is over when only one player dies!"
nc2f7k,Plants Vs Zombies 2,"\[Insert idea for title involving number 2 pun like Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\]\n\n^(Idea: Plants Vs Zombies Trwoo (Portmanteau of Two and True, as in this is the true sequel))\n\nI've always thought that og PvZ was so insanely well designed. It's a one in a million game. Looking at PvZ 2, I thought their approach lost too much of the original thematic and charm. I wanted to expand the game's mechanics with more plant-related stuff rather than put them of some kind of weird SF II campaign and have them do some weird electric stuff and wear &gt;!bdsm !&lt;gear.\n\nThe first idea I had in mind was the implementation of a four seasons theme. I was thinking that the player from last game has since founded a zombie-defense business, going from house-to-house, defending them from zombies. I couldn't decide whether the player should defend the same house through four seasons before moving on to the next or you defend a different house per season. In the end, I think the latter stays true to the original format and so let's go with that. Instead of Day/Night/Pool/Fog/Roof/Boss, we have Winter/Spring/Summer/Autumn/Halloween (Boss)/Winter/Boss.\n\nNext, I think it would be nice to have something like a rune system. That seems in nowadays. Basically, the Zen Garden is unlocked since the early part and has palpable effects in gameplay. If you go into the Zen Garden, there are three slots by the window and you're given a free sunflower plant when you first enter. If you put the sunflower by the window slot, then you have an extra sunflower giving you sun in-game. Other ideas are the ice-shroom, giving you free freezing every now and then; Cattail, you have one free homing cattail from the window; Blover, free blow-away of insects and balloons every now and then; etc.\n\nThen, going back to the seasons system, depending on the season, some plants are weakened or strengthened. For example, during the summer, freezing plants freeze for shorter but fire peas damage for three times instead of two times the normal pea damage, melon-pults are cheaper. During spring, sunflowers yield rate increases. During autumn, squash, pumpkin, and kernel pults recharge much quicker. In the winter, freeze plants are cheaper but torchwood creates an area around it where you can place normally non-winter plants. Additionally, the pool is frozen over and you need flower pots before you can plant on them. Since it is permanently frozen, there will be a lot of bobsleds going through there. Alternatively, we can make it defrost temporarily (like how you can push back fog temporarily in og) using jalapenos, but you will also sink all plants in that row. Using ice-shroom refreezes instantly.\n\nThere will also be new zombies, and they're introduced throughout the seasons. For example, in the spring there are hive-keepers. They bring harmful insects that fly ahead of them. To counter them, you'd need to place a pitcher plant near your plants or blow the insects away with blovers. Fume-shrooms can also attack the insects. In the summer, there are surfer dudes who run fast and carry surfboards over their heads. They protect a small area around them from overhead projectiles. So far, those have been my only ideas.\n\nI think it would also be fun to be able to deploy a small inflatable pool - a similar mechanic from BTD5 - where you can place water plants there.\n\nLast, but not the least, Crazy Dave is replaced by this Asian shop with an Asian merchant stereotype (not sure if that's offensive. if it is, let's just change that) which grants access to new types of Asian and tropical themed plants. For example, the pitcher plant, the snap dragon from current PvZ2, some kind of vine-themed plant, and more. Crazy Dave instead shows up at winter seasons as a Santa Claus cosplayer, bringing you random seed packets or other stuff.\n\nAnyway, that's about it. Just wanted to throw this out there. Ngl, I'm pretty disappointed at current PvZ2."
nc20wt,A Quiet Place: The Game,You're basically in a quiet place universe and the game/monsters can hear you making noise in real life
nc1qun,Space 4x/grand strategy that’s less gamey than stellaris,"This game idea influenced by stellaris, endless space and crusader kings\n\nWould use something similar to ES2’s gameplay affinities so that instead of just having different stats each empire would have unique rules/abilities.\n\nWould use a character-driven system like crusader kings to simulate internal politics. To make it more flexible you wouldn’t be playing as members of a dynasty.  Instead you would choose a vision (which could also influence available victory conditions) and your “heirs” would be other characters that are inspired to carry on that vision.  Sounds vague because it’s meant to fit into a variety of government types/cultures, some more alien than others.  If I called it a political party or faction or something it would force every alien race to be similar to humans in some way.\n\nVisions would include things like conquering part or all of the galaxy, brotherhood between all aliens, anything else you (or modders ) could think of.  Basically how I play crusader kings except it’s an actual gameplay mechanic instead of metagaming.\n\nInternal politics would consist of conflicts between different characters in your civilization and would serve as an anti-snowballing mechanic.  That way if you fall behind in the early game you can still catch up when the empire next door splits into 3.\n\nTl;dr a space strategy game that focuses less on perfect gameplay/snowballing/map painting and more on emergent storytelling/an ever-changing balance of power/creative ways to take over the galaxy."
nc1e3f,Kingdom Hearts MMORPG,"Overview\n\n\nConcept\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis is a hypothetical MMO taking place in the same world as Kingdom Hearts. It functions as an instance-based hunting game where players go through various environments doing platforming challenges, obstacle courses, and of course fighting enemies and bosses most with branching paths and collectables throughout. This game combines gameplay elements from across the series, including spin offs.\n\nInspirations\n\nThis game takes inspiration from Kingdom Hearts, Monster Hunter, Super Mario 3d World, Rayman 3, and Spyro.\n\nStory\n\n\nSetting\n\nThis story takes place in a realm beyond the one we know. In this realm, all of civilization is powered by magic, all magic is powered by emotions. In the days long past, magic was a scarce and volatile resource as a result of humanity’s diverse nature and the circumstances of daily life. One day, they discovered a way to harness a reliable and plentiful source of magic by creating worlds modeled after stories. However, if left unattended, these worlds would become corrupted and start producing a dangerous and uncontrollable magic that threatened all around it. As a result, young warriors with the power to summon Keyblades were sent into these worlds and rectify whatever was threatening their stability. This time, you were chosen.\n\nGameplay\n\n\nControls\n\n\nDualshock\n\nL Stick: Movement\nR Stick: Camera\nA: Attack\nB: Jump\nX: Block\nY: Reaction\nLB: Lock Target\nRB: Shotlock\nLT: Strike Commands\nRT: Magic Commands\nPad: Selection\n\nOverworld\n\n\nTraversal\n\nThe user can move throughout the world using various jumps, land and aerial maneuvers, and Special commands. The user must also take advantage of the environment to get to various points through the use of gimmicks and objects, some of which require a specific command to make use of. Some obstacles also can only be exceeded by using specific commands.\n\nBattle\n\nWith the Abilities equip between Missions, the user has diverse range of combat and traversal capabilities. The user can utilize basic attacks and combos using the Attack Input, these can be further supplemented by using combo finishers and mid-combo attacks through using the Block Input. Most direct attacks can be neutralized or even countered by either hitting them with an attack or with a Block Input. Shotlocks are precise projectile attacks that at their most basic launch many homing projectiles at multiple enemies, but there are variants. Shotlocks draw upon a FP, gained by hitting enemies with attacks, as their resource. Between Missions, the user can use the Command Board to fill slots that when using the corresponding input. Magic Commands utilize MP in the Player Character’s stockpile, and Strike Commands require a cooldown period after use. A Command Board for Items can be utilized by holding both inputs. By using the Selection Input, the user can exchange their Attack Input for things such as Special Commands, Summons, Limit Brakes, and Form Changes.\nSpecial Commands often involve things outside of battle such as manipulating certain gimmicks, objects, or the environment in a certain way, enabling the Player Character to traverse the environment in a new way, or to access areas not possible otherwise.\nSummons involve making a particular character from a particular world and utilizing their abilities as the users in exchange for all of the user’s MP.\nDatas are autonomous constructs of characters from each story unlocked through progression. Up to 2 can be used at any time.\n\nLimits are special high-damage attacks that can be used as a combo between the Player and a Data that modify their primary Attack, their Reaction Input, and end in a powerful Finisher. These take all of the user’s FPs.\n\nForm Changes are transformations specific to each keyblade that change the user’s primary abilities and current commands to specific unique ones, sometimes endowing them with unique passives.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nIf the Player engages the multiplayer lobby, they can create and join rooms where many players can gather. When one begins the “Prepping” phase of a Mission, up to 3 other players can join to assist them, however, Datas can’t be used while at least 2 are present. Players can use True Limits and True Finishers provided at least one has unlocked one.\n\nProgression\n\n\nLeveling\n\nIn this game, the Player Character themselves doesn’t level up, but the keyblades they use do. When a Keyblade levels up, the Player Character gains stat boosts, armor and accessory slots. Abilities and Commands unlocked can be equipped with any Keyblade.\n\nKeyblades\n\nThe Player starts with the Kingdom Key but can unlock more through progression. Depending on the Player’s equipped Abilities, they can even equip and/or use more than one Keyblade at once.\n\nMixing\n\nBy Mixing, the Player can create the most effective equipment, items, and stat upgrades. The Player can also Mix materials with their Commands to increase their efficiency relative to the Level and Stats.\n\nLists\n\n\nMission Structures\n\n\nCourse Missions\n\nThe Player must traverse an environment within a mission, defeating enemies along the way. The Player must complete various platforming challenges and puzzles as they go, often collecting items throughout.\n\nTask Missions\n\nThe Player must accomplish a specified task while staying within the guidelines presented such as a time limit, tagging specific targets, or gathering needed items. There is usually some manner of opposition the Player must mitigate throughout.\n\nArena Missions\n\nThe Player must defeat one or more teams of predetermined enemies. The consequences for failure aren’t as severe, but the task of doing so may be more difficult.\n\nGame Mission\n\nA Mission involving mechanics beyond standard gameplay. The Player’s reward is often scaled with their performance in the minigame.\n\nBoss Mission\n\nThe Player must defeat a specific high-powered enemy. These enemies do not appear in normal gameplay and as such offer unique rewards.\n\nKeyblades\n\n\nKingdom Key\n\nLv. 99 = 1000 Exp.\nStrength: 1 (x110%)\nMagic: 1\nAbility: Draw\n\nStrike Commands\n\n\nLv 5 Quick Blitz: Perform a jumping attack.\n\nLv. 10: Rising Strike: Smack enemies high into the air.\n\nLv. 15 Sliding Dash: Punish faraway enemies with a charging attack.\n\nLv. 20 Quick Raid: Throw the Keyblade at the enemy once.\n\nMagic Commands\n\n\nLv. 3 Fire: Launches a dart of flame at an enemy.\n\nLv. 8 Ice: Launches a shard of ice at an enemy.\n\nLv. 12 Thunder: Calls down a bolt of lightning on an enemy.\n\nLv. 18 Cure: Heals either the user or an ally.\n\nAbilities\n\n\nLv. 1 Jump: Press the Jump Input to leap into the air.\n\nLv. 23 Guard: Press the Input to raise the Keyblade for a brief moment to deflect enemy attacks from the front.\n\nLv. 2 Dodge Roll: Press the input while moving to temporarily become invulnerable to enemy attacks.\n\nLv. 28 Scan: View an enemy’s HP gauge during battle.\n\nLv. 32 Draw: Attract Prizes from a distance.\n\nMeteor Shower\n\nLv.  16 Lock onto multiple foes and launch small, star-like projectiles at targets in a volley.\n\nArms of Awakening\n\nLv. 21 Gain different attacks depending on the currently equipped weapon.

nc09xr,4-Player 3D Platformer,"(5 out of ?

nbxxwx,A school shooter game,"Like Friday the 13th the game, one person has the chance to be the shooter, and the others have to be the students. Students have to survive and the shooter has to kill all of them. Students can search around the school for weapons or items to help them. The doors are boarded up (by the shooter) and have to find a way out. The police haven’t been called because the shooter killed the people in the office. oh yeah and it’s set in the 1960’s so that nobody has smart phones."
nbx2hr,Looking for ideas for a meta(inside of a computer type) horror game,"Hey! I’m a relatively experienced dev, but I’m not the best at coming up with ideas. I’m twiddling my thumbs thinking up with a new project, but I’ve got a semi-idea of what I want to do. I’m absolutely horrific at any type of art, so the game that I’m thinking of would be simulated on a computer screen. Like the player would be interacting with an 80s virtual desktop, clicking buttons, playing minigames, reading files, etc etc. \n\nRight now I have the idea that the player is maybe going through an old friends computer, when they realize there’s a virus on it. The virus is like a demon or something that is corrupting the computer, which leads to terrifying shenanigans. Technically, that wouldn’t be hard for me to do- I’ve actually made a game fairly similar to this concept, but just didn’t have enough ideas to make it fun. I think it could be cool though, so now I’m asking around for ideas lol. If anyone has a good head on their shoulders for horror games like this, mini games, or just have a story beat they think would be cool, I’d love to hear it !"

n78liq,Extremely Dark and Traumatizing FPS Idea,"The idea started with playing CoD and realizing most FPS games don't spend any time on the actual character you are using in war, each life you use in combat are basically just disposable body suits.  The core concept of this game idea is making each life in the game matter and immersing deeper into the stakes of that soldier.  \n\nWhen a soldier you control dies, there could be a reel or small cutscene of the body being carried off, the medals they've earned, etc.  Each person deserves a send off/epilogue.  Perhaps the longer you stayed with a soldier and did stuff, you could see more of the cutscene, possibly even seeing their son or daughter grow up and enlist themselves.  The game would take a moment to mourn for that soldier and then continue to another new life.\n\nPlaying through a whole battle and surviving would definitely be rewarded.  Keeping your soldier alive and valuing each life would be core to the game.  Gameplay would most likely be slower and more tactical, as everyone is trying to win while keeping their person alive.\n\nIs this messed up and possibly traumatizing? Depends.  But it's certainly better than disregarding soldiers' struggles and the value of each of their lives."

I'm looking for 3D game ideas that could make good use of the comedic value of a buff tomato or a fire breathing chili pepper. Ideas don't have to a funny tone, I'm open to serious games too. Honestly, anything is appreciated just give me an idea! Thanks in advance!"
n6yu99,A multiplayer exorcism game.,"Greetings everyone, recently I have been playing Phasmophobia, which is kinda cool as a concept. For those of you that don't know its a game all about ghost hunting. \n So I came up with an idea similar to that game but instead of Ghosts you are hunting different types of Demons. The purpose of the game is simple: Exorcise the Demon and trap him with different ways sealing him forever. \nThe whole game basis wraps around the principles of exorcism. Players can use different types of equipment to harm the Demon and defeat him once and for all. The twist in that matter is that the Demon is also a player.\n So as a group of 4 you fight against a player who is actually playing as the Demon. The player controlling the Demo can use different types of tricks to confuse the players while dropping their sanity levels. \nAs a player's sanity level drops he becomes mentally unstable starts seeing things and hearing things  and once it hits zero can't be targeted as a victim by the demon killing him and claiming his soul. \nGame can include different famous Demons of Christian religion each one of them with different type of powers and abilities, but also weaknesses.\nWhat are you guys thinking about this? Is it interesting as a game idea? Any suggestions?\nThanks in advance."

n6o6nf,Integrating HP/MP bar (or stamina) into the character.,"I want have a discussion about not having HP/MP bars in games.  \nMost games comes with a standard HP and MP bar (sometimes stamina bar too), usually HP mean Health point, MP means Mana Points for skills-usage.  \n\n\nHowever, players are often required to shift attention back and forth between their own character model and the HP/MP UI during combat. I think instead of displaying these status meters as UIs, merging them with the character provide a more pleasant gameplay experience.  \n\n\n# Taking away the HP bar\n\n  \nI've seen FPS games do this by making the screen edges more red/dark as the character get more hurt; some survival games make the character slower or look tired; MMORPGs tends to shrink the hp bar and hover it above the model's head.\n\n  \nI don't agree with how these both decisions give the player disadvantages as their health drops: making the screen harder to see (and spot enemies), take away the player's normal speed, or having small version of the UI.  \n\n\nFor the player's own HP, make the model change stance and look bloodied as they get more damage; break or gradually crack their armor/shield if they have protection. For the enemies' HP, I would say do the same. In PvP games, not knowing exactly what your opponent's HP are allows for a higher skill ceiling in competitive plays. When spectating, if there are dozens of players to keep track of, not needing an ui bar above everyone's head or at the edge of the screen should also improve the viewing experience.\n\n# Taking away the MP bar\n\nFPS Mobas replaces them with cooldowns and again, the MP UI is just replaced with another UI to keep track of.\n\nI propose adding different effects/glows/weapons and on and around the character to indicate which skills are available to use. For example, if your character has ""Fireball"" off cooldown, the character can voiceline something like ""I'm ready to fire"" and have their right hand glow in flames or a fireball hovering next to the character.\n\nThe only place I think this wouldn't fit is in MMORPG, where one can have upwards of a hundred skills available, displaying effects to the character will just create a clutter of glows. \n\n# Issues\n\nThe main downside I see with using effects, animations and voice lines in place of UI, is that one will no longer be able to tell exactly how much points they have left.  \nI think a good compromise is to make these UI visibility toggleable with a button, so that knowing the exact number will not be vital to survive/play well but optional in case the player wants to see it.\n\n  \nWhat do you think? I want to hear if anyone have any alternative solutions."
n6hr24,"First person perspective, motorcycle game with this cool stylized, intense color graphics (e.g. Firewatch, The First Tree)","Hi! I have this idea for a game, that I don’t even have time to begin Unity’s project with (but I would love to help with/make the story writing though):\n\n- core mechanics: \n   - riding motorcycle with first person perspective (this simply have to be a pleasant, reactive/responsive, intuitive experience);\n   - travelling by foot, with a few simple, but well designed mechanics like: picking things up, throwing things, moving levers, usage of the ropes, opening/closing valves (I hope you get the idea :D)\n   - RPG mechanics, like dialogue system, equipment, simple quest system (without overkilling it with a complex solutions)\n\nset&amp;setting:\n- stylized graphics, with that dreamy, surreal vibe (e.g. Firewatch, The First Tree);\n- linear plot (I’ll be able to handle that part of the game, if you’d like to realize this project :));\n- semi open world (many little areas that would be connected with each other via single roads) - it may be silly, but Pokemon Yellow’s seems like something I have in mind in terms of connected areas\n- music-type proposals: \n   - Pink Floyd, Massive Attack, anything from the mainstream lo-fi beats type for the driving between areas\n   - Audioslave, Metallica for the intense moments (prefferably chasing or something similar)\n   - no music for the walking by foot, in order to create this weird, unsettling feeling when Player gets of the bike\n\nGameplay overview:\n\nFor some reason we have to put this poor guy on the motorcycle, so I’d like to see this introverted character with plenty of self-analysis going on while free-roaming through beutifully crafted sceneries.\n\nWe also would need to give the player something to play with, so I’d like to see plenty of small interactable objects, like some branches in the woods, cups from the coffee shop laying around on the pavement. And of course, if there is a branch to be picked - there have to be any type of object to be poked with it\n\nWhat’s the main issue of the bad games? Poor core mechanics - therefore I’d like to see some arcade steering with this feel like you’re a pro (something like Forza Horizon, but with a motorcycle)\n\nWhat’s the second main issue of the bad games? Lame main storyline. Give the main character a soul and purpose to ride on this bike from area to area, e.g. his mother is really sick and he has to travel through entire country, and he has no regular job, and has to do some jobs for the locals, so that he can fund the fuel for his motorcycle. But there’s also this sense of purpose, like if the Player’s spends too much time in one place, then, for instance there could be a call from main character’s sister where she would insist on him, because the condition of their mom is worsening (if that’s a real word).\n\nAlso I would love to see this game designed for the mobile first (mostly because I don’t own a gaming PC) :D\n\nStay safe &amp; best wishes, hope you get inspired and give me something to play (or work on, wink wink) 🙏"
n6dasp,Gratuitous Opinion Battles,"I have been studying social theory, psychology, sociology and linguistics for a number of years in order to figure out how to use technology to combat the increasing decline in reading comprehension, rational dialogue, respect, empathic awareness and many other social problems identified by analysis of social data.\n\nI had an idea for a game in which a person can choose a style of battle and then that battle plays out based on the rules of logic and debate based in background analysis of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and NLU (Natural Language Understanding / sentiment analysis).\n\nOnce initiated, the bot would pull archived information on a topic from a database compiled from social media data analytics.  It would then use the compiled footprint of that social opinion to generate a scene in which the OP of an opinion position is placed with armor or unit dispositions linked to the underlying premises of the philosophical position.\n\nValid arguments are ""targeted"" based on clear use of language, reference to the premise, grammatical use, punctuation, spelling, etc...  The strength of armor or force positioning comes from cited sources and evidence.  The confluence of a well thought out, cited, referenced and well written rebuttal is interpreted as a hit, possibly critical, that destroys the targeted defense.\n\nAbandoning the argument is equated to quitting the field.\n\nIgnoring a premise or argument is equated to failing to deflect an attack or shot and/or possibly a failure to mitigate damages (such as in a naval battle).  In unit battles it would be equated to failing to rally troops or reinforce units, potentially resulting in the unit being routed or dispersed.\n\nIn essence, it's a fun way to have AI moderate debates based on trained analysis of professional dialogue.\n\nThoughts?"
n69h58,Message Routing Game,"Concept: Players are blind and connected randomly in a communication network. They can only send messages to their direct neighbors. Each player has to send a message to a specific person somewhere in the network, so everyone has to cooperate to get the message delivered.\n\nIt would be possible to insert malicious players, randomly dropping messages by changing the reliability of channels, limiting the speed of communication, having messages that shouldn't be read by specific persons, and creating more interesting tasks/themes.\n\nDoes anyone have more ideas on how to expand on this abstract concept?"

n5tpo0,[REVISED VERSION] My Co-Op Fantasy Game's Player Characters [LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK &amp; SUGGESTIONS],"This is a revised version of my previous post that lacks any descriptions with comparisons to other games. A user told me that when I share concepts or ideas, I shouldn't describe them with comparisons to other games because I would immediately alienate people who haven't played those games. I'm really ticked at myself for doing that in the first place, and I hope this revised version will pick myself off the ground (in other words, raise my chances of getting feedback and suggestions so I can move forward in my journey to make this game happen).\n\nAnyways, here we go...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I've had this idea for a Co-Op Fantasy game since 2020, and it would be a cross between First-Person and Third-Person. The most notable mechanic I've thought of for my game is that there are 4 player characters that you can switch between.\n\nI've done some thought process on what differences should each character have, such as different species, abilities, and traits, but I feel like some things need work.\n\nI'm having trouble with coming up with special abilities which would only be activated when their ""special ability"" meter is full by getting enough kills, and scenarios where you would need to switch to a certain character in order to progress through a level. Those are the two things which I think I need suggestions on.\n\nI apologize if the post itself seems childish even though I'm a senior in High School because I still feel like I'm new to grammar, and these character drafts are just my first impressions, and I'm sure many of us know that first impressions usually need more work and aren't the final.\n\nFirst of all, general mechanics:\n\nYou can switch between characters by pressing a certain hotkey assigned to whatever character. Each character carries three weapons: their own unique weapon, a crossbow with finite ammo that needs to be scavenged, and and empty weapon slot for whatever weapons you might find that you can pick up. Each character can be incapacitated, and you will have a certain amount of time to revive them depending on the difficulty level. If they die, they will respawn within 60 seconds.\n\nNow, here are for the player characters. They are in order of which I would place them from left to right on the character selection screen. They are addressed with code names since I don't have names for them yet and I wouldn't spoil their names. If anyone has suggestions for additional abilities and/or ideas for the two things I mentioned that I'm having trouble with, let me know:\n\nYeti Berserker:\n\nThe first character is a male yeti berserker. He has slow speed, but a lot of health. His primary weapon could be a two-handed, two-sided battle axe. If he sheathes his axe, he can pick up objects and pieces of debris that can be hurled at enemies as an alternative way of attacking.\n\nCabbit Warrior:\n\nThe second character is a female cabbit warrior. She is naturally the fastest of the characters, but has a lowest amount of health. Her primary weaponry consists of two one-handed swords that are dual-wielded. She comes with a sprinting ability that has a cooldown function.\n\nKitsune Mage:\n\nThe third character is a male kitsune mage. He would have the second most amount of health, and be the second slowest character. His primary weapon would be a staff that can cast various offensive and defensive spells (Which is one of those things I need suggestions for) as well as a healing spell that can heal the other teammates. He can also use the staff as a melee weapon, and has a meter ability to revive deceased teammates early so that they can respawn immediately rather than wait 60 minutes.\n\nDragon:\n\nThe fourth character is a female anthro dragon (in other words, dragon girl). She would have the second-least amount of health, and be the second-fastest character. Her primary weaponry consists of a combination of her claws as melee weapons and her ability to breathe either fire or ice in many forms (The forms are also something I need suggestions on). She is also capable of flying, so she can reach areas where the other three characters can't, but it is a cooldown ability to prevent her from reaching/touching the level boundaries.\n\nThat's everything I've thought of so far for all of the characters.\n\nI'm open to feedback and suggestions for additions to my player characters, especially for the things that are missing. If any of the things I already mentioned need to be changed or removed, don't hesitate to let me know, I might consider it . If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nThank you, and I can't wait to hear your feedback and/or suggestions. Again, I'm sorry for describing my concepts/ideas in the original posts with comparisons to other games. If you like them, you like them. If you don't like them, you don't like them. Like I said, I just hope this revised version picks my feet up off the ground."
n5thcs,Among Us -like game where you either kill or protect Hitler,"Kill Hitler.\n\nThere are 8 players on a map. 2 CIA agents, 2 SS agents, 1 Hitler, and 3 randoms. \n\nThe CIA doesn't know which player is Hitler, and must find and kill Hitler to win. They personally don't have to kill Hitler, just if Hitler dies, they win. The CIA also doesn't know who are the SS agents and must also avoid them as well. The CIA however knows what Tasks Hitler will do, and that's how they'll find Hitler and kill him.\n\nThe SS knows which player is Hitler, but not his tasks, and must protect him from the CIA. They win when all CIA agents are dead or if Hitler completes all his tasks. They don't know who the CIA agents are and must protect themeselves as well.\n\nThe CIA however can't kill Hitler directly and must sabotage the tasks Hitler will do to kill him and win. The sabotaged tasks however don't just kill Hitler, but will kill anyone who uses it. \n\nThe SS can also also get notifications on sabotaged tasks, where they are, and can un-sabotage the tasks. The SS can kill the CIA directly by simply shooting them.\n\nHitler and the 3 bystanders don't know anything about the CIA and SS battle and are doing tasks around the map."
n5t9ko,A Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas type Action-Comedy Open-World game,"Think Saints Row 3-4 meets Looney Tunes. Okay in that sort of vein,but I hope you get the idea. Set in a fictional city. Think a Las Vegas-Tokyo Casablanca esque crime infested city. To clarify, Casablanca,the way it's portrayed in the film. Laugh out loud type humor with some meta, here and there,but not in that irritating Deadpool sort of way. Regular weapons will be used, like revolvers, shotguns and machine guns; the kind of weapons Hunter Thompson used. Explosives will be there too. It would be sacrilege to not include them in a game based on a somewhat true story of his. There will be drugs, real and fictional, to act as power-ups. LSD will be rare and an extra special power-ups. Clothes will be vast, wild and offbeat. There will be vehicles but strictly from that era and fully customizable. Enemies and friends of HST's will be the antagonists and co protagonists. Obviously they'll be exaggerated versions of themselves. Other figures could be added or they could be DLC's. I'm not sure what the main objective will be. I'm also sure about mini games but I want them to be fun and something different. If anyone has suggestions for things to add, please let me know."

n5ljq3,First Person Choice-based SAW Game,"With how polished first-person horror looks, RE7 and RE8 as an example, imagine a first person game based on the Saw franchise similar to RE7. With the added realism, there could be a really emotionally compelling nature to encountering other people in traps rather than straight gore. I think an interesting gameplay loop would go like this: the world is an open-ish labrynth where you have to solve puzzles and do certain tasks etc. to open new parts of the world. Your main goal is to reach some end point but throughout doing so, you encounter many persons in their own traps. You can use some resources or risk your health to save them, or play it safe; maybe some people you don't help but escape their traps come after you later. Also, this may be too grotesque but perhaps the player character has some device on them that kills them if they don't take another life within a certain amount of time. So during playthroughs you'd be navigating this open world and encountering others in traps and have to, for example, kill one other person every hour (probably by deciding their fate in multi-person traps) or your game resets to an hour prior.\n\nI know this is effed up but also sounds like a compelling experience only the game medium could bring."
n5l1w4,Squad based arcade-shooter/moba pitting 4 teams of 3 against each other.,"Hello everyone, first off I just want to thank anyone who reads this for giving it the time of day.\n\nMy idea would be to make 4 teams of 3 human players either eliminate all other players or capture an objective and return it to their spawn. They would be dropped into diagonally mirrored map which would feature a central raised platform, which contains the capture objective, 2 opposed small towns with houses for looting weapons and lastly 2 more opposed shops which would allow for spending of money gathered between rounds.\n\nMy main focus on this was giving the teams options that they can all choose and have to think about their opponents choosing as they moved throughout the map. Will they start straight to the store and buy up? Or will they head into the town and loot it. Maybe they might try and sneak the objective back to their base for a cheeky victory. All these things would require strategy as the team moves through the map trying to gain victory. I figure this could be round based, maybe first to 3.\n\nSo what do y'all think?"

n5hqzk,Need your opinion,"So i got this really basic idea:\n\nThe player is a male/female that lives alone in a small house with his/her dog. So you go tho the park and walk with your dog. But then your dog finds a wallet with strange coins and an address and you decide to return the wallet to the owner. When you arrive at the address you see that the house is very old but you still go inside. This part is bit weird i know :) when you open the door you see a huge portal that stands in the middle of the room. Of course your dog walks through it and you have no other choice then to follow the dog. The portal brings you to a forest. Your dog is running and you follow him till he stops at the end of the forest and you see a futuristic city with lots of lights. When you get into the city. You will ask someone where you are and stuff and he tells you that the coins in the wallet come from this place. Soon you realise the person from the wallet lives here and that you need to find him if you want to get back. This is everything i got, please give me feedback i would really appreciate it."
n5hmym,"What do you like to see in a ""walking simulator"" game?","Hello all,\n\nI am relatively accomplished fiction writer who also happens to love playing video games. I have been dabbling around with some game development software for a couple years now just learning the basics and I think I am ready to start work on my own narrative-driven adventure game; aka a ""walking simulator."" Think ""Firewatch,"" ""The Stanley Parable,"" and ""Gone Home.""\n\nI am choosing to make a walking simulator because my strength is in story-telling. I have no interest in developing a classically ""challenging"" experience with complex combat and the like; in my opinion we already have plenty of games which accomplish that better than I could ever hope to. What I want is to tell a story and transport the player on a journey. \n\nI realize some of you probably just don't appreciate walking simulators and that's cool, I get it.

However, the river was then contaminated by deadly nuclear radiation and then thousands of people were killed by radiation. Upon investigating the incident it was discovered that there was an US listening device which was powered by nuclear energy hidden above the mountains of Nanda Devi, just 600 meters away from the Ganges River. This so called ""listening device"" was a device that can pìck up radio and nuclear transmissions from China. The US wanted to install such a device in a discreet location which is why the Himalayas is where the CIA wanted to place the nuclear listening device in the peaks of Nanda Devi.\n\nCalled ""Operation Hat"" in 1964. Fourteen US mountain climbers along with four sherpas, were tasked by their governments to install the nuclear listening device above Nanda Devi. However, before they could make it into the top a giant avalanche had struck the team and were killed, and the nuclear device lost.\n\nThe poisoning of the Ganges river, which was caused by the lost nuclear device had caused outrage amongst the Indian people and it demanded the US to come and fix the problem. The US agreed and sent one of the world's best climbers to go to Nanda Devi, search the nuclear listening device and disable it for good.\n\nBut at the mountains of Nanda Devi, there are horrors that have surfaced underneath the snow.

n5advd,Ghost Hunters: Basically Ace Attorney Investigations meets Gravity Falls and Scooby Doo.,"**Was digging through old files in my Google Drive when I stumbled upon this old halloween themed mystery game concept I had a few years back. Was originally going to make this an RPG Maker game myself, but never got around to it and kinda lost interest in the idea. I also included the only cases I actually had concepts for.**\n\nEx-detective Rook Key, with nobody else to go to for a job, is forced to join his brother, Spook Key, and his ghost hunting team in solving mysteries. He is reluctant to go, but when he finds out himself that ghosts and monsters aren’t just a myth or legend, he also finds out there was more to a certain case than meets the eye, can he solve what had happened in his final unsolved case, or will he just find himself 6 feet under?\n\nMain Characters: \n\nRook Key: The player character of this story. As the 20 year old newcomer to the Ghost Hunters team, he was a former detective for the police a few months prior to the start of the game, lost his job after he went rogue during a police chase after he thought he saw a dark figure staring at him with a coat barring a symbol from the card of two of his cases. He then abandoned his chase to go after him, letting the crook get away. He has great investigative and interrogation abilities. His personality is that of a logical genius who is pretty down to earth and enjoys puzzles and games that encourage strategy or deduction. He is a very easy scare for any supernatural being, but won’t be scared as easily if it’s something more realistic. Carries a notebook or notepad to take notes on any new information like testimony or evidence.\n\nSpook Key: Rook’s 19 year old brother who invited his brother Rook onto his team of Ghost Hunters. A chill kind of person who doesn’t get scared easily and talks to ghosts and monsters like they’re normal people and part of everyday life. Enjoys seeing and experiencing the supernatural. Apparently had a job at a pizza joint over a little over a year prior to the game’s events, but got fired for abandoning his order when he claims saw a ghost flying by and chased after it instead of making the delivery, making the order over an hour late. After that, he formed the Ghost Hunters with the customer’s son, and his soon to be best friend, team in a moment of genius inspired by what he saw. He is a bit dense though and too chill for his own good when he doesn't get freaked out by monsters that might be actively trying to kill them.\n\nSans Fear: An 19 year old boy genius who met and became Spook’s best friend a year prior after he gave him and his parents a pizza an hour late and told them he claimed to see a ghost, which Sans believed him. Has an interest in science and an even bigger interest in studying the paranormal, but his interest reached its peak when he lost his arm and his hair turned an unstainable pale white in a science accident when he miscalculated something, before fainting he could have sworn to see his assistant’s hand glowing and likely using magic to keep him stable, thinking she was possibly a witch as the healing was too advanced for any kind of current technology. He replaced said arm with robotic one that is far stronger than his former arm and comes equipped with multiple tools to help his partners out. Joined the Ghost Hunters after he and Spook first formed it together. Personality wise, a very intelligent person and enjoys challenging Rook’s genius in games and working with him, has knowledge of many supernatural beings from Ghosts to Vampires. He also has a love for technology and believes science can solve almost any problem, with varying results that more often than not backfire on him.\n\nYokari Kaizuka: A 22 year old girl who moved into town 1 year prior to the game’s events from Japan. An ex-police officer who moved after she claimed to see a demon outside her room flying at night, and everyone called her crazy and she got fired. She joined the Ghost Hunters after Sans and Spook overheard her talking about her experience seeing a demon and they are quick to believe her thanks to their own experiences at having scrapes with the supernatural.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-Overworld: Focuses on investigation and exploration, but is often the place for cutscenes. After an investigation, your progress can be saved between each chapter of the cases and from the pause menu on the Overworld.\n\n-Interrogation: Basically an Ace Attorney Cross Examination style of trying to debunk someone’s logic. After hearing their testimony, you can then Press for more information or Present items to object. However Presenting the wrong item will damage you, if you get KO’d. It’s game over. You can also ask certain teammates what they think and they’ll each give you either a random piece of dialogue with a humorous response or some more information or questions of their own that can create an entirely new statement. For reference, think of the Cross Examination from Professor Layton vs Ace Attorney or the Great Ace Attorney games except instead of mutliple witnesses reacting to certain testimony, it's your teammates.\n\n-Logic Match: When a witness refuses to cooperate with you, you enter a Logic Match, which plays out like AAI2’s Logic Chess, minus the time limit and replacing it with the chance to make only 5 mistakes, after that it’s game over. You can either wait things out and listen to the witness or talk to them by pointing things out that they say. Sometimes, you may need another piece of information to open things up. However you can also annoy them with questions and can anger them into accidently slipping something that they’re hiding, giving you more info to work with.\n\nCase Ideas:\n\n-On Rook’s first outing with his new team, he and the others find themselves with 6 other people, one of which is murdered and another one is secretly a vengeful spirit, and all of them are locked in a mansion filled with haunted suits of armor and other ghosts. Now with all 10 of them being suspects, they must figure who is the murderer is before the vengeful spirit gets to them first.\n\n-Inspired by Night Trap, the gang is enlisted by a family to watch over their household for a few hours in a misunderstanding of what their business card where it says, “House Caretakers,” because of Spook's incredibly poor penmanship when he commissioned the cards.\n\nSo they’re hired to watch over the house while their daughter has some friends over, Rook has them take the job anyway as it turns out there was a string of disappearances in this household and the police were unable to investigate the household as the owners wouldn’t allow it. So as they watch over the house with their fellow teenagers, unaware the house owners are actually monsters themselves with possibly malicious plans for the gang, all while Rook uses this opportunity to solve this case once and for all.\n\n-Rook wakes up in a hospital bed and finds his friends are all curious about why Rook fainted after seeing a card with a symbol on it at the end of the case before this one. Reluctantly he tells them a story of.\n\nIt then cuts to Rook’s first case, where he finds himself investigating a murder trying finding the true criminal, and he finds at the scene of the crime a note revealing the same symbol seen at the end of the previous case before it then shows him investigating a case connected to it, where, while chasing the culprit who fled after proving them to be the murderer and finding another card, he sees a man in the shadows with the symbol on his coat who was walking away leading to him going rouge to chase that man instead, leading to him being fired.\n\nHe then finished his story as it cuts back to the present where he explains what happened to him after that leading up to when he joined the Ghost Hunters."
n52uek,Rougelike + Survival Game idea,"I want to get some feedback/suggestions on the general idea for a game I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's basically a hub that the player uses as a base. So crafting, upgrading, storing loot and all would be there. To get the items they would go out into generated areas as a selected class. Killing enemies, getting loot/resources, and even facing zone/area bosses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo permadeath, unless the player wanted it. There would be a death penalty, I just don't know what it would be yet. Maybe lost of some stuff, or hit to level/stats for a period of time. Figured a general level for the player and maybe a class level for the different classes."
n50yq6,Looking for Opinions - Among Us but with a Time Loop Twist," \n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've got a pretty original idea for a game and I'm looking for opinions before fully committing to it.\n\nThe main idea is "" **Among Us but in a Time Loop** "".\n\nJust to be clear, me and my team want to develop this idea ourselves, we just need to establish if it's worth the time or not. \n\nBasically, it's a 2D top-down social deduction game (like Among Us) about a group of thieves that infiltrate a fancy penthouse. Among them there is a killer that needs to sabotage the operation by killing them all. The thieves get meeting were they can choose to vote out a player. They win by either voting out the killer or completing all their tasks.\n\nThe game's **core mechanic** however, is the presence of a time loop. **Every X minutes, if neither side won, the loop starts over.**\n\nNot all progress is lost though. The players can see **time glitches**, 'ghosts' of dead players from previous loops, giving them information about their paths based on which they can deduce who the killer is (i.e. if a player dies, in the next loop everyone still alive will be able to see a replay of their movement / pathing, in real time).\n\nAs the thieves grow their chances of success with every loop, the killer does too. Every action the killer does, including causing emergencies, cutting off the power, locking doors, will be repeated at the exact same moment in every upcoming loop, establishing a pattern the players will need to learn in order to maximize their chance of survival.\n\nSo think of any game or movie based on a time loop (Groundhog Day, Deathloop, etc.) and imagine it's concept adapted to fit a social deduction / Among Us type of game."
n4zz50,Lots of ideas here is one for now,Killer Conscience - the basic ideas is a classic killer victim situation where you start the game of getting set up to see the killer but before anything happens you cut away only to go through said killers life making choices living it seeing what made them a killer but you must choose carefully cause each choice will decide the kind of killer you will be let me know what you think and tell me if you want to hear anymore ideas cause I have a lot more complicated ones both on mechanics and story I love a great balance of both with some awesome twist I am planning on starting my own video games design company so any feedback helps
n4zflb,A question about AI behavior in horror games,"Hey guys, I'd like to get some input on what good enemy AI should be like. What I mean is, I am currently developing a VR Horror game that has one central monster and maybe 3 underlings. It also takes place in only one setting, inside and outside a building with many rooms inside. My question is, for this setting and type of game, how should the main baddie work? I was thinking sorta like Alien from Alien: Isolation, as I loved how it sorta thought for itself in a way. But I want to know what others think, and what other ideas of good enemy AI other people had. Any input is welcome!"
n4wrgw,"Psychic Shells - A team multiplayer shooter with dozens of AI-controlled teammates you can ""dive into"" after dying.","Games start with dozens of AI soldiers (let's call them ""shells"") already fighting on the ground, and players get to ""dive into"" any of them at any time. When you die, you're forced to dive into any other shell on your team to continue. The AI-controlled shells aren't nearly as good as actual players, but they help.\n****\nWhenever a shell dies (either player or AI controlled) they're downed for a few seconds and then get back up... to fight for the other team. Killing a shell makes them switch team. **Whichever team converts all the shells to their side wins.**\n\nThis means that when one team is about to win, the losing team will not have enough shells for all of their players, so some will be forced to spectate unless they can gain back some shells. There might even be clutches where one team rallied back from having only one player left."
n4vydg,Pokemon but as a Survival Tactical Squad Turn-Based RPG instead of a linear strategy RPG,"&gt;Op, you mean kinda like ""[Pokemon Mystery Dungeon](https://nerdmacia.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Rescue-Team-DX-13.jpg)"" or more like ""[Pokemon Conquest](https://www.maniac.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/conquest-oben.jpg)""\n\nYeah, kinda like both (but more like conquest because mistery dungeon is more roguelike based) maybe like a mix of both? (debatible) but without being in the Edo era or somthing, and without using generals or conquering stuff, and of course changing and adding some other stuff.  \n\n\n&gt;Op, why you want to add the survival genere to pokemon?\n\nBecause, a lot of people tend to forget that the ""Pokemon World"" can be Hardcore and METAL as fuck.  \n\n\n&gt;What do you mean? Pokemon is the most child friendly franchise of nintendo.\n\n[\*Laughs in official pokemon manga crudeness and matureness\*](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/181/205/3ad.png)\n\n[\*Laughts again a little bit more\*](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/7/74/R%26S083_8.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/715?cb=20150911111238)\n\n[\*smiles at you like a champion\*](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/c9/1f/13c91f4e527d64ee3ffb1e8dd09c4812.jpg)\n\nWhy do you think that every professor tells you that is dangerous to go on tall grass without a ~~bodyguard/decoy~~ pokemon?  Everything and everyone could kill you.\n\nThats why I want to add YOU as an active piece into the battle, YOU are like the chess king. You are the most important piece on the board. if you're killed in battle because your pokemon didnt protect you, there's no point to continue the battle.\n\nWith the tactical mechanics you can easily be put into the pokemon battles and it can be added nice features to the battles like move in the terrain to dodge attacks, cover, obtain a terrain advantage, set traps, Aid your fallen pokemons etc.  \n\n\n&gt;So, op, tell us, this idea of yours requires ""HIGH QUALITTY ANIMATIONS AND 3D MODELS"" like the new core games? or games like Fire Emblem: Three Houses\n\n# No.\n\nEven if i LOVE the [looks of FE: Three Houses](https://i.imgur.com/5kaShAp.jpg); for my idea i preffer a more simplistic aproach. \n\nA 2D simple board for ""combat phase"", very much like [R-Day Combat board](https://img.apkcafe.es/img:bz1mMmJhMGEmbD0xZzE3Jmg9anBnJmY9Z2xtJmk9NDc). \n\nEasy to code, Easy to see and understand what surrounds your character, easy to fix bugs. No need to know 3d programing and super dificult stuff so it will be faster to develop, less demand to the processor, and... more time to put more enphasis in story.\n\n***Routes and grinding places*** will become gigantic boards that you have to cross and in order to arrive from one city/town to another. Pokemon will spawn randomly at random places in the board. but only 6 enemies at time. (battles will be a max of 6v6 pokemon + you)\n\nFor ***overwold and peaceful places*** would be like [normal overworld from gen 1-5 main series](https://i.imgur.com/yInfCIZ.png). and your team gets ""invisible and not playable at moment""\n\n&gt;Ok OP, you said you want to change and add some other stuff. What do you have in mind?\n\nWell... your character is NOT superman nor he has a dimentional pocket inside his bag, so the amount of items you can carry will be limited AND a static base will be implemented. \n\nA lor of changes would be made to a lot of pokemon logic"

n4rvdf,"""Disney's Motorama"" - a crossover of the Forza Horizon series and the Disney Pixar's Cars franchise. [RE-UPLOAD]","Xbox Series X/S and Windows 10 exclusive, also playable on Steam.\n\nDeveloped by Playground Games. Published by Microsoft Studios.\n\nFeatures ray tracing, 4K Ultra HD, and 60 fps (standard)/120 fps (optional). Also supports cross-play and cross-progression.\n\nRating: UK - 7, US - E10+ (Mild Language, Mild Violence), AUS - PG\n\nThis idea is an open-world racing game taking place in the fictional Motorama Festival. It will also be a spiritual reboot of the Forza Horizon franchise.\n\n***WORLD MAP &amp; FESTIVAL SITES***\n\nThe open-world map ranges from Carburetor County to Los Angeles - Southern California, featuring a variety of iconic landmarks and areas.\n\nCarburetor County features Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, Willy's Butte, Interstate 40, Cadillac Range Mountains, a dirt arena, a dam, an oil refinery, a satellite array and an aircraft boneyard.\n\nSouthern California with Los Angeles features California Highway 1, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Downtown LA, LAX Airport, Port of LA, San Gabriel Mountains, Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles International Speedway, etc.\n\nThere will be **two** festival sites, one in Carburetor County and the other in Los Angeles.\n\n***AVATARS***\n\nYou can create your own human avatar; male or female. You can change their clothing, accessories, and even change the style and color of their hair. You can even make them wear special costumes (Spider-Man, The Mandalorian, Stormtrooper, Captain America, Frozone, Master Chief, etc.).\n\nThey will be voiced, whereas the avatars in the Horizon series didn't speak. Like the Cars characters, they will also react on things that happen around them - winning/losing a race, nailing/failing a PR stunt, crashing, getting rammed, passing a racer or getting passed, etc. (""Alright, let's do this!"", ""Outta my way!"", ""Watch where you're going!"", ""How do you like that?!"") - This would replace the quick chat feature that was seen in Horizon 4.\n\n***GAME INTRO***\n\nThe game's intro will be similar to Forza Horizon 2. The opening cinematic would feature a montage of cars, racing and festival scenes, and the emotional music along with it will give you chills!\n\nIn your first drive of the game, you will play as Lightning McQueen, driving from the Port of LA all the way up to the Carburetor County festival site with Mater, Cruz Ramirez, and the champions of the 6 racing series.\n\n***STORYLINES***\n\nThe game will have **two** storylines.\n\n* The **main** storyline is similar to Forza Horizon 1.

You'll make friends with Lightning McQueen and all his pals along the way, as well as make some rivals like Jackson Storm and Chick Hicks. You need to complete a certain amount of races and challenges, show off your skills and earn enough XP to progress. You'll unlock more events as you go on. Will you become the next speed!?\n* The **secondary** storyline is similar to Forza Horizon 2. You go on road trips and compete in a variety of championships, covering car types, special themes, decades, countries, manufacturers and every car class. You can race with any car you own, or you can race as a Cars character! Win a certain amount of championships, and you'll be challenged by one of the champions of the 6 racing series.

It is **more longer** than the main storyline!\n\n***RACING MODES***\n\n* Circuit, Sprint - **Road Racing Series**\n* Scramble, Trail - **Dirt Racing Series**\n* Cross Country, Cross Country Circuit - **Cross Country Series**\n* Drag - **The Drag Strip**\n* Drift - **The Drift Club**\n* Street, Pursuit - **Street Scene**\n\n**Pursuit** events are more longer street races, but they also involve **police chases!** Whilst racing, the **Motorama Police Force** will try and stop you from reaching the finish line. If they bust you, you'll get a DNF!\n\n**Weapons** can be included, with the exception of Drift and Drag events.\n\nYou can now race against **15** other drivatars, except in Drag.\n\nYou can even race as a **team** in Circuit, Sprint, Scramble, Trail, Cross Country, Cross Country Circuit, Drift, Street and Pursuit events, but not in Drag.\n\n***PLAYGROUND MODES***\n\n* King/Team King\n* Infection/Survival\n* Flag Rush/Team Flag Rush\n* Slayer/Team Slayer - take out players using weapons to score the most points\n* Soccer - push the ball into the net to score the most goals for your team\n* Cat and Mouse - be a cat and stop the other team's mouse from reaching the finish line first, or make it to the finish as the mouse\n\n***WEAPONS***\n\n* **Machine guns** \- fires rapidly with limited ammo, slows down racers\n* **Rocket launchers** \- can carry 1-3 rockets, wipes out racers once hit\n* **Oil slick** \- causes a racer to lose grip for a few seconds once run over\n* **Spike strip** \- flattens a racer's tires to slow them down, but they will get reinflated after a few seconds\n* **EMP launcher** \- slows down a racer when locked on successfully\n* **Shockwave** \- shoves racers around you out of your way and wipes them out\n* **Booster jets** \- help you catch up and soar by your opponents like a low-flying rocket for a few seconds, also a good way to save your nitrous\n* **Shield** \- protects you from attacks for a few seconds\n* **Bombs** \- have a wide blast radius and can cause mega damage on a group of racers\n* **Nullifier** \- eliminates every weapon the other racers are carrying once used\n* **ESF** \- causes your car to be filled with electricity once activated, ram into other racers with it to wipe them out\n* **Impact mine** \- sends racers into the air and causes massive damage when run over\n* **Magnetic mine** \- attaches onto a car and the clock starts ticking until the mine detonates and causes massive damage, but it can be passed on to another car before it detonates\n* **Stun mine** \- slows down a racer once run over\n* **Tracking rockets** \- lock onto a racer and sends them into the air once hit\n* **First strike rockets** \- head straight for the leader and sends them flying once hit\n* **EMP shock** \- causes an electrical shockwave on all other racers and wipes them out\n\n***MOTORAMA ONLINE***\n\nThe game will have **16-player** online multiplayer, featuring 8 v 8 team adventures, and D-class and C-class adventures will return. **Vehicle and class restrictions** will be set in Online Adventure, but you can set your own restrictions in Custom Adventure. After the end of an adventure, players can **vote** for which adventure they would like to go into next.\n\n**Private lobbies** are returning, so you and your friends can drive together without anyone else interfering!\n\n**Slow-down penalties** are returning for two illegal actions; **wall collisions** and **friendly fire**. Players who try to gain an advantage on a wall will be penalized to prevent cheating. If a player hits their teammate with a weapon, they will also be penalized.\n\n**The Eliminator** returns! Eliminate or be eliminated in this epic open-world mode against 80 other players, fighting to become the eliminator!\n\n**Car meets** are also returning!

The longer the pursuit, the tougher the cops can become on trying to stop you. If you get busted, you'll earn nothing! Cops will ask you to **pull over** if you speed by them, hit them, or show off near them. You can pull over and stop to prevent a chase, but if you ignore them, the chase is on! However, you can also **help the cops** stop another player or drivatar who is causing trouble on the road. Bust the target, and you'll earn credits!\n\n***GARAGE &amp; CUSTOMIZATION***\n\nYou can **walk around the garage** with your human avatar and interact with your cars in Forzavista! As you achieve a certain wristband, your garage will **expand**, allowing you to put more of your cars on display! But if you want to go back to a certain version of your garage to take a perfect picture, feel free to!\n\n**Customization** is going all the way up to the max, now featuring **neons**, **window stickers** and **more body kits** than ever before! For the Cars characters, you can upgrade their performance, apply liveries and neons on them, and even give them new tires and rims!\n\n**Nitrous** will be featured, equip it on your car and squeeze it to get a boost on the straights! You can even **change the color** of your nitrous in the garage! Nitrous would be depleted indefinitely if it's fully used during events, but in free roam, it would refill after 3 minutes.\n\nWithin the garage menu, you can access the **Motorama Driving School,** where you can learn a lot of lessons whilst driving. Lessons include drifting, braking, driving in the rain, using weapons, etc. You can even test drive your cars at the Carburetor County festival site's **test track.**\n\n***OTHER FEATURES***\n\nThe **damage model** in this game will have front and rear bumpers coming off on some cars, and headlights and taillights can get broken, even the windows!

Reach a certain milestone to receive an award!\n\n***CARS***\n\nThe game features over 800 cars from over 140 manufacturers. There are also over 70 characters from the Cars franchise, spanning from all 3 Cars films. Of course, not *all* would be available at launch due to quality over quantity. All the cars are divided into 5 tiers. At the start of the game, you only have access to the cheaper tier 1 cars. To unlock the other tiers featuring more expensive cars, you need to acquire a certain wristband.\n\n* **Tier 1**: Common (Green)  - starting-out tier for all players\n* **Tier 2**: Uncommon (Blue) - earn a blue wristband\n* **Tier 3**: Rare (Purple) - earn an orange wristband\n* **Tier 4**: Epic (Red) - earn a red wristband\n* **Tier 5**: Legendary (Gold) - earn a bronze wristband\n\nSome cars can be unlocked from finding barn finds and winning showcase events and boss races!\n\nlink: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/hdyfv9/disneys\_motorama\_car\_list\_ideas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/hdyfv9/disneys_motorama_car_list_ideas/)\n\n***SOUNDTRACK***\n\nThe game's soundtrack features 9 radio stations, including a Spotify radio station where you can integrate your own playlists into the game!\n\n* **Motorama Pulse** \- hosted by Amy Simpson, features pop, indie, nu-disco and electronica.\n* **Motorama Bass Arena** \- hosted by Scott Tyler, features dubstep, house, electro and techno.\n* **Motorama Block Party** \- hosted by DJ Spin, features hip-hop, R&amp;B and rap.\n* **Motorama XS** \- hosted by Phoenix Fox, features alternative and hard rock.\n* **Hospital Records Radio** \- hosted by Chris Goss and Tony Colman, features drum and bass.\n* **Fearless Records Radio** \- hosted by Bob Becker, features punk, metal and post-hardcore.\n* **Retro 80s Radio** \- local station featuring music from the 80s era.\n* **Retro 90s Radio** \- local station featuring music from the 90s era.\n* **Timeless FM** \- local station hosted by Dan Thompson, features classical music.\n* **Spotify** \- integrate your own playlists into the game! (Spotify Premium account required)\n\nPulse, Bass Arena, Block Party and XS will be available at the start of the game. The other stations can be unlocked as you progress through the main storyline. Skill songs won't return, out of respect due to the soundtracks in Horizon 3 and 4 looping over and over again during events and drone mode.\n\nI know a game like this may not happen because of licensing, but still, it would be *really* cool if it were to! Feedback is always appreciated!"

n4oo7f,An idea for a bizzare cute'em up shooter I had,I have a really bizzare idea regarding the plot and features of a shooter game I have been thinking of doing eventually. \n\nThe main characters will be about two elderly furry muscular lesbian angel witch sisters named Maria and Zion who are ten million years old.\n\nThe game would take place on a post apocalyptic earth devoid of humans because of nuclear war and the only creatures left besides them are cute forest critters living in harmony.\n\nThen one day a foreign army of robot invaders lead by an angry french hotdog named Nils seeking to conquer earth to please the intergalactic emperor Gustavus adolphus who was king of Sweden during the 1600s but in his resurrected mecha furry form ready to use the forest critters as tickle slaves and to use them as forced labour for his galactic empire.\n\nThe game will be a cute'em up shooter inspired by Sega's fantasy zone game series in terms of basic gameplay and aesthetics but with differences such as bonus levels were you earn extra angels by destroying floating big Mac hamburgers and Double quarter pounders spewing out mechafurries with jetpacks.\n\nThere will also be permanent secret upgrades and a big emerald obtainable after collecting 10 smaller emeralds in the right colour order on each world and once 7 big emeralds have been collected you unlock 3 more secret levels where you face Gustavus main henchmen before facing the emperor himself. \n\nI have a solid understanding in the fundamentals of programming so that shouldn't really be a major issue as far that is concerned the only thing I am uncertain about is the artwork(I do have a wacom s tablet I can use)but I could always hire somebody to do it for me.
n4lwaj,An Hour of Time - A simple game about looking after yourself,"Hi everyone, I'm Matias.\n\nI'm currently working on a game idea and wanted to know what people thought of it. Well here goes.\n\nYou play as an unnamed character who wakes up at 6:00 in the morning. They have to leave for work at 7:00 meaning they have an extra hour of time. Each task that you do will take up to 15 minutes meaning you can only do 4 tasks. The game is simple and you can do whatever you want really. \n\nWant to drink a beer? go ahead. \n\nMaybe text a friend to hang out during the weekend? You can do that too.\n\n At the end of the four tasks, your character will tell you how happy they feel based on the things you did. I want a cute animation style where the characters face appears in the bottom corner of the screen and text dialogue similar to that of an RPG appear when you interact with something.\n\nMy overall intention is to make a game that encourages people to look after themselves and perhaps fix and enjoy the little things in life when they have the time for them.\n\nWell, that's it. Sorry if you expected something with a bigger scope but I want to have a simple idea which I can make a game about within the timeframe of two months. \n\nPlease, feel free to leave ideas as to the tasks you can do or give advice as to how I should go about making the game."

n4co22,FPS/RTS Hybrid,"5 human players per team.  1 player on each team is the ""general"".  He sees the map from top down and controls the game like an RTS with the 4 other players as ""champions"".  Obviously he can't control the players, but he would be able to create, upgrade, and control NPC units.\n\nWhile he wouldn't control the champions, the general could assign them ""missions"" like ""capture this point"" or ""kill these enemies"".  Depending on the mission and the difficulty, the champions would get resources they could use to upgrade themselves so they stay relevant as the fight goes on.  Even if they don't receive any missions, they can still get some resources if they kill enemy units (especially other champions).\n\nI assume general would not be a coveted position, but RTS AI technology is pretty impressive and I believe an AI general could be effective.  The intelligence and skill of both the AI general and the NPCs would be based on the players' ELO.\n\nI think the biggest challenge would be finding a balance between general and champion effectiveness.   It will be difficult to make sure that both roles feel effective and at low levels especially, the generals and the champions might often just play completely separate from each other, defeating the point of the game."

n48vhy,[Survey] I have a predev survey for a tabletop rpg/4x strategy game.,"I have a tabletop rpg in development that plays as a 4x strategy game. I started this beast of a project as art therapy, and now all that's left in developing the project is grunt work. While working on it yesterday, I realized that I still don't know my player's expected experience. Without playing it, I don't think I will. Without knowing this piece of data, I can't get the game testable. However I happen to have a testing survey I developed some time ago and a Reddit login. I may post in the wrong subreddit from time to time, which is what happened to me last night: but I believe a conclusion to my problem is possible.\n\nI need to know what you as players will try to do in a 'build a collaboration' structured environment. I will want feedback from lone wolves and collaborators, as well as who you are from any dynamic you might fit into.\n\nI need to see what you as a player would expect to be doing. I hope you'll help.\n\n#Game description starts here.\n\nI am building an RPG that awards the player with power util when capital util and experience points would be awarded, simulating getting people to do things for you for the sake of fame. I use grinding mechanics to make creating plans into systems of numbers. The NPCs are structured to be containers for influence biases and wants, and they are influenced by their institutions. It's a game which recommends a folder for every player's sheet dossier.\n\nYou and your team are collaborators in an institutional startup. \n\nSystems I have developed: There is a system I have for emulating telnet muds and exploring a city, although it needs more formality in separating the command type explore from the command type travel. I already have an untested npc randomness generation dice ai I don't have much confidence in, but I think my fundamentals are sound. I have an auction system that allows all players at the table to impact anything about the game and, frankly: troll the other players; and the auction requires investigation. The NPC is being programmed to insist on scheduling their meetings ahead of time, although I only have that drafted as a snippit; and if all players aren't involved, I'm going back to RPG roots of story games with the auction system, and so every player gains an opportunity at interaction. I even think the system fairly allows one player to make a different choice for another active player.\n\nThere are systems for social interaction by structuring an NPCs ready biases, and systems for detective gaming resolution to quests. There are rules for staging the outcomes of social occasions. There are needs for systems, but the beginnings of such systems, for a give/take relationship with an institutional body of public. There is a mentor NPC in the character of the dangerous secretary; or the fixer. Players auction for the purpose of their institution together, with 3 spaces open to create a complete picture. There is a combat system (the danger mode) with XCom severity and permadeath to keep a hand on combat as game designer; and hopefully by release date I'll have the natural disasters figured out as well, since the explosions already support a physics system.\n\nWith a game with 50+ sheets of development docs, the above is what comes to mind immediately.\n\n#Survey starts here.\n\nDo you see somewhere in the description that you would need to learn before you could grow within?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to pick up what was going on?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to get started alright?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  were you able to come up with solutions using the options provided to you?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game mechanics would support your ideas?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game suggested enough options to inspire you to your ideas?\n\n[Starting here, I'm leaving out the 'In theater of the mind.']\n\n...Did you feel like the preparation mechanics were assistive to your play?\n\n...Did the game help you feel like you could anticipate your limits?\n\n...Did you feel like the threats you encountered in the game were surmountable?\n\n...Did you feel like you had enough options to handle the threats you encountered in the game?\n\n...Did you see the threats coming?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in acting on the threats you encountered?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough prompting to be inspired to find new answers during play?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in finding new answers during play?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough options to be able to exploit options during play?\n\n...Did you feel like your player character had become a public legend in the assistive mechanics of the celebrity system?"

n480qm,Cursed Realty,"**Genre:**  Comedy, puzzle\n\n**TL;DR:** You are a realtor trying to sell obviously haunted houses to oblivious young couples.\n\n**Graphics:**  I'm imagining simple, pixelated graphics, but I could see a 3D version using basic Unity assets working, too.\n\n**Gameplay:**  Each ""level"" is a different house tour.  You beat a level by selling a house.  Each successive house is more haunted than the last.  Your score is based on how much you sell the house for.\n\nLevels start off with you arriving at the house with a short amount of time to clean up messes such as cobwebs, spirit writings, and objects thrown by poltergeists.  Some of these ""messes"" are too extreme, so you might disguise them as something else (eg covering an alter for ritual sacrifice with a table cloth and flowers and calling it a dinner table, or adding to the spirit writings and calling it a graffiti inspired art room).  If you have enough time, you may also set up ""distraction pieces"" such as interesting furniture or fixtures.\n\nOnce the couple arrives, you lead them through calling attention away from any messes you weren't able to clean up.  As time goes on, specters will randomly cause disturbances (throwing objects, rattling chains, causing black liquid to ooze out of drains, etc).  You can distract from disturbing sites by changing your position in the room or pointing out your distraction pieces so the couple turns away and you can distract from noises by playing music or something.  The crazier the spooky event, the crazier your antics to hide it.\n\nYou can leave a couple alone in a room either on the pretext of going to fetch something (refreshments, paint swatches, etc) or allowing them to explore on their own which will allow you a short amount of time to deal with a particularly bad bit of possession in another part of the house.  However, you can't distract the couple while you're away and the price of the house goes up the longer you talk to them so it's a good idea to stay with them.\n\nEach time the couple notices a mess, they will complain about it which will lower the houses overall cost, but also temporarily distract them from the antics of poltergeists so in more difficult stages, it may be advantageous to leave some mess.\n\nAfter a set amount of time, if the couple is not scared off and the price of the house does not reach $0, the couple will declare their intention to buy.  You can still increase the price by talking to them more (at the risk of spectral sabotage), but in general, you would return them to the front porch and have them sign a contract, ending the level."
n46s8s,Battlefield style fps but with a stereotypical 50s style alien invasion aesthetic.,"Think battlefield but one team plays as like an earth defense force with advanced experimental military weaponry and vehicles and the other team play as mars attacks like aliens, with ufo's and tripod walkers like in war of the worlds and stuff. The maps would be set in like US cities and small towns and stuff. I think that would be pretty sweet."

n3wx70,Teacher RPG,"So before I start I want To say I would develop this game myself if I could, but I can't make good enough art. Im only a programmer.\n\nSo my idea is an RPG where you play as a Teacher in a School for Knights.\n\nAt the beginning of the School year you would meet all of your students ( I was thinking about 20 students each with a personality of their own)\n\nYour job as the teacher is To teach your students in choosen topics, give them assignments and train with them.\n\nEach of these activities will alter the stats and skills of your students.\n\nThe thing is you have limited actions per day (Calendar system a little like Persona)\n\nAfter the School year is done your students graduate and you enter a second phase of the game, This time you're not the teacher you control students all of them.\n\nIn phase 2 (War) the students dont get as much experience you're stuck with the choices you made in phase 1. It's a turn by turn battle system where all 20 of your students are working togheter against ennemies using the skills they learned in phase 1.\n\nNote that at first battles Will be easy, not because ennemies are stronger, but because you have 20 units, but if any of them dies they're dead forever. \n\nIt's important the game forces you To lose characters at some points, it should be impossible To get To the final boss with all 20 characters. \n\n(Oh yea plot twist the final boss is the Teacher you played in phase 1)\n\nSome inspiration from :\n- Fire Emblem Three Houses. \n- Persona Series\n- Classic RPGs"
n3vtwn,Idea for a future game,"Some sort of futuristic multiplayer Bounty-hunter simulator in an open-world. You can either become the hunter or the hunted and have to outsmart the other player by setting up traps, installing cameras or tracking the hunted one. Some aspects of the game could be a trackable mobile phone (makes it possible to order stuff but the hunter knows your location), or distraction. The objection of the hunter is to find and knockout the other one, the objective of the hunter is surviving until the bounty-hunter gives up, dies or doesn't find the suspect within 24 in-game-hours.\nRight now i have some experience in making games but in the beginning its too much work for just one person. So if you're interested in the idea, feel free to text me."
n3uy1b,Fallout 1/2 with plot," I want to create a Fallout-style game with bookish, tooth-breaking plot, where you investigate pre-war events by collecting notes, maps, items and so on. Like Fallout:Equestria (which is a book).\n\nThe gameplay is going to be ""read a note, hack into a terminal, talk to strangers, think, THINK MORE, and figure out what happened in the past and what do you need to do"". So it is kind of a puzzle too. Maybe with some fights in between. Maybe with stealth. Maybe I even can let the player freely talk to characters.\n\nWhat I have is coding skills. What I need is a good and interesting pre-war story, or a fiction writer, who can create one (I am little bit fiction writer myself, but I lack creativity). I'm sure there are tons of ficwriters who want someone to come and say ""hey, I'm gonna make a movie/game out of your fanfic"". So it may be your lucky day!\n\n**Spoilers ahead**. &gt;!Rough pre-war history would look like this: alternative world, country A fight against country B for some territory rich with oil. But everything is not that simple. Some corporations in A benefit from the war. Government benefits as well (hello, 1984). Clearly there are spies and fifth column. Some people even want the apocalypse to happen. Monstrous projects are developed (FEV, power armor, mechas, why not?), and one of these projects is a time machine, capable of receiving one short message from the future. And then bombs fell, everyone died. The main hero investigates pre-war secrets, finds the time machine and sends a message to the past (which can be ""surrender"", ""attack"", or some really special message that will stop the war and make everyone happy). But of course I want to add PLOT and DRAMA, and TWISTS, and I really need your help for that.!&lt;"
n3rdei,Hey! I want to start developing a game. How do you like this idea?,"  \n\nGood day everyone!\n\nI want to share with you an idea for the game. Perhaps someone will decide to take it into development. So far, these are just my thoughts, set out on paper.\n\nI have always liked the way children look at the world - they are not afraid to fantasize. When I was a child, I imagined myself as a hero in different worlds with obstacles and dangers. Now I want to develop a game about children's fantasy, in which there is no room for the impossible.\n\nI would be glad to receive your feedback and wishes!\n\nConcept\n\nA game about a little girl. She and her dad move to a country house. Her mother died of an incurable disease; her father grieves for his wife and does not know how to raise her daughter. The girl is all alone. Having closed herself off from psychological problems that are difficult for a child, she does not want to be friends with local children at all. Instead, she comes up with a world of her own. In her fantasies, she is free to do whatever she wants. She has friends - old toys that come to life in her thoughts (or really?). Gradually, the player no longer understands what reality is and what fiction is. In addition to beautiful fantasy creatures and beautiful locations, the girl's inner fears appear. They are destroying the beautiful world, making toys ordinary. If fears win, then the beautiful world will be destroyed, and the girl will go mad. Our goal is to overcome the fears of loss and loneliness in ourselves and help the girl to live a normal life.\n\nGame theme\n\nChildren perceive the world in a completely different way. They are in this life quite recently, therefore, they do not know much or do not understand much, but they can fantasize up to what they still do not know. Fantasies help fight real problems.\n\nHero\n\nLittle girl. 5 years. She has no name so as not to limit the fantasy of the player.\n\nShe can hover, talk to animals, manipulate her toys, and fix old broken toys.\n\nShe cannot control her fears.\n\nSetting\n\nThe game has four locations: a tree house, a forest, an old barn and a house.\n\nThe girl imagines the tree house as her castle; her subjects live in it - toys.\n\nIt changes; secret rooms and halls appear in it.\n\nThe forest is very changeable. It has many animals to talk to. Trails get confused and change direction. There are labyrinths and rabbit holes.\n\nThe old barn is dark and scary. It contains many broken toys that you can repair and attach to your retinue. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to defeat the fear of the dark.\n\nThe house is ordinary without fancy elements. He brings the girl back to reality. Through the surrounding objects, you can learn the story of the girl. There are also many useful items in the house.\n\nFears - dark formless entities - can appear at any moment. They destroy the world around them. They can be fought with toys. They are the girl's main protection. Each toy has its own abilities.\n\nReferences\n\nGames:\n\n1) Alice: Madness Retur\n\n2) The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit\n\n3) Little Nightmares\n\nFilms:\n\n1) A Monster Calls\n\n2) The Spiderwick Chronicles"
n3pjq9,The gods game: part 1: the gameplay,"&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in my last post i slightly touched on gameplay (Yea i know this post is designated one but i'm annoying and started at zero) but i didn't really go that in depth but what i did say is that it would be a capture the point 5v5 game with parts of both platform fighters and mobas and this still mostly stands. You see I realized that having 5 players per team might be too much to keep up with in large team fights so I'm lowering it down to 4 per team. But another important thing is the objectives. What are you supposed to do? Well there are four different objectives with one end goal let me explain. Objective one is to capture the three points scattered around the map. Your entire team gets gold for every teammate inside a point no matter if they are there alone or with an enemy and if your team is able to spend 15 seconds alone without enemies inside one of the points the point itself will start to generate gold for your team, no matter if a teammate is in it or not.\n\nObjective two is to get stronger and eliminate enemies. With gold you will be able to upgrade yourself and get things like more health, damage or stronger abilities (more on that in a later post) and this is good when you are in a fight with an enemy. You want to eliminate enemies because then they will need to respawn which will give your team time to finish other objectives. You also get gold for your troubles and a lite gold if you only helped.\n\nNow comes the last objective, hunting. Every now and again after the game has passed the 5 minute mark 2 minute timers will appear one the different points. When these timers reach 0 a boss will be spawned and that point will not be able to generate any gold for either one of the teams until it is defeated. When defeated the boss will give the team that killed it a lot of gold each and give the point it's currently stationed at and make the enemies unable to get gold or capture that points for 5 minutes. And lastly there's the goal. The goal of the game is to get strong enough to be able to destroy the other teams spawn which is located really fearfully on their side of the map. however it will be protected by 3 turret crystals which will shoot and kill enemies within range. two of the three turret crystals need to be destroyed to be able to damage the enemy spawner. And once the enemy spawner is destroyed you win.\n\nI was hoping to be able to talk more about the map but I'll need to do that later since this post is getting long. So i'll hopefully see you then, bye!"

n3lnfm,Role-playing as Blacksmith/Herbalist/Alchemist/etc (crafting based in open world),"What if you could play as the shop-keepers in RPGs? But in a way that is dangerous and exciting.\n\nThe setting is medieval. \n\nYou craft various things depending on your role, in an immersive way. The three roles are Herbalist/Alchemist/Blacksmith. You choose one.\n\nGameplay evolves scavenging the open world for materials depending on your chosen role (taking samples/picking herbs, buying supplies). This is dangerous because you might get ambushed by bandits and lose your stock on the way back.\n\nIf you make it back, then you combine ingredients or use craftsmanship in a workshop simulator (for example blacksmithing) and going through the various steps to craft a good. This can be a medicinal brew, poison or elixir, or sword/axe.\n\nWhen done, you fullfill orders at your market stall/shop. Danger lurks even in this environment, you cannot trust every person that comes up to you to buy your goods. Simple combat mechanics are involved in fending off thieves, rivals, etc. \n\nIf you lose these fights you either lose gold (get robbed) or your equipment gets broken (requiring you to close shop for a period of time while you fix things which costs money).\n\nWhen successful at filling an order, you get a sum of gold and reputations points (more on that later). Hopefully this sum balances out any prior loses.\n\nYou can use the gold to upgrade your workshop. You can use it to spend on rare ingredients. (unlocking more craftable goods)\n\nIf you're wealthy enough you can hire an apprentice. They cost daily upkeep money but will fetch ingredients for you and act as an extra-hand (cutting crafting wait times). \n\nThe end goal is to get the other herbalists/blacksmiths/alchemists on the map to go out of business because npc's choose your shop as the best in the land. \n\nThis is based on your reputation rank, which goes up with each successful order, or down when you close shop to fix equipment. \n\nYou've successfully completed the role when you reach Reputation Rank 100. You can .continue to take orders or start over with a different role\n\n\-----------\n\nThats all so far. What do you guys think? Is it realistic as a game concept?"
n3jgew,"A ""true sequel"" to vib ribbon","It seems like vib ribbon isn't looking forward to any more major new games only re-releases...

n3ihd9,Monster collecting horror game,As the title implies i think monster collection + the horror genre can work well together. Like the player themselves can be powerless and they have to rely on the monsters they collect to protect them. The player might have to run and hide while their monsters fight the ones hunting you down. \n\nAdd in unique power interactions between the monsters so some can slip pass yours if they don't have the power to stop them and vise versa. Also add permadeath to your monsters so if you ever run out of monsters to protect you it can result in a nearly hopeless situation that i don't think a lot of horror games can portray very well.\n\nHell even taming can be a heart pounding experience because the player might not ever know if the monster they are trying to coax will decide to eat them instead. Just a idea that hasn't been done and think it would make for a entertaining mechanic to have in a horror game.
n3glla,"Hey guys, complete novice here, I'm starting my own Open World 3D MMO with advanced AI built on the blockchain","To all you newbies out there, welcome! \n\nIf you have a goal of creating, finishing and publishing a game, then learn this bit of information first:  \n\nSTART SMALL DAMMIT! \n\nI know you really want to make your own RPG. I know you spent all that time naming the weapons and factions and coming up with all the backstory and the multiple endings, but guess what? You're not going to be able to make it. \n\nThink of a game similar to your game idea. Was it made by hundreds of experienced professionals paid by millions of dollars of budget over the course of years? \n\nYes? Then it's time to think about why you think you can do what those hundreds of people took years to do. \n\nThe only limitations on your idea are your imagination, which is great, it's great fun to come up with innovative and expansive ideas. \n\nBut when it comes to actually manifesting your idea, then there are quite a few limitations. There are limitations on how ""big"" of a game one person or a small team can make. There are even more limitations when that person or small team are amateurs. \n\nI know this message is just pissing in the wind of the neverending waves of new and naive developers, but if this can save any of you some time then it's worth it in my book. \n\n**If you're just trying to mess around and learn, then by all means start putting the pieces together for your dream MMO.** It doesn't matter if you don't finish it or even get far if you're just trying to have fun or learn something new. \n\nBut, if you want to finish a project and see it published, start REALLY small and I *promise* it will take longer and require more work than you expected. But you'll feel all the more proud when it's done. \n\nCheers!"
n3fohd,Immersion in game development.,"As I always say, immersion goes far beyond graphics. Having the best graphics does not mean having immersion. The immersion that I speak is like entering a castle of terror, because it brings you emotions, good or bad. It is immersion that holds the player in the game. It's like not wanting to go out to eat, or do anything else, you just forget you're playing a game. Everything is connected in the setting and theme. If this set of quality adds to the multiple challenges proposed in the game, you already have a big difference, just look at the number of games that are repetitive. Things that take us out of the reality of everyday life, are more likely to cause us emotions.\n\nImmersion is emotion. As I always say, if the game doesn't bring you emotions, for me it's not a good game. This is noticeable in the first 5 minutes of the game. If you are developing a game, take this test, film the friends or relatives who are going to play your game first. Study their reaction. See if your game is being very specific for a single niche of people, if that happens, sometimes it is better to dose your theme a little so that the game is not so restricted. This does not mean that you will lose the essence of your game, just that you will add elements that will attract a larger audience and generate more elements to complement your game immersion. Never forget to attract people by immersion, using art and challenges as the main elements of your game."
n3cf3q,A modern military shooter that is essentially a MOBA,I was thinking it would be fun to play a game like battlefield but you can only play in vehicles. All the infantry would be controlled by AI. \n\nThe players would have to use the various vehicles to guild their infantry units to control points. Those control points could have defensive measures that would need to be disabled before moving on to the next control point and eventually the enemy main base.

There is a mentor NPC in the character of the dangerous secretary; or the fixer. Players auction for the purpose of their institution together, with 3 spaces open to create a complete picture. There is a combat system (the danger mode) with XCom severity and permadeath to keep a hand on combat as game designer; and hopefully by release date I'll have the natural disasters figured out as well, since the explosions already support a physics system.\n\nWith a game with 50+ sheets of development docs, the above is what comes to mind immediately.\n\n#Survey starts here.\n\nDo you see somewhere in the description that you would need to learn before you could grow within?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to pick up what was going on?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to get started alright?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  were you able to come up with solutions using the options provided to you?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game mechanics would support your ideas?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game suggested enough options to inspire you to your ideas?\n\n[Starting here, I'm leaving out the 'In theater of the mind.']\n\n...Did you feel like the preparation mechanics were assistive to your play?\n\n...Did the game help you feel like you could anticipate your limits?\n\n...Did you feel like the threats you encountered in the game were surmountable?\n\n...Did you feel like you had enough options to handle the threats you encountered in the game?\n\n...Did you see the threats coming?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in acting on the threats you encountered?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough prompting to be inspired to find new answers during play?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in finding new answers during play?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough options to be able to exploit options during play?\n\n...Did you feel like your player character had become a public legend in the assistive mechanics of the celebrity system?"
n3adhm,Game Ideea," Hey, i am new to this whole game development thing, and i decided that I want to try and create my very first solo game. I want it to be an RPG with magic elements/system. The game will be in  3d. As for source of inspiration i really love Harry Potter and other shows which have a magic system, also MOBA. I intend to make the game in such way that the player will have freedom when it comes to playstile: What powers do they want to control, what help they want to receive from NPC, what crafting they want to do. I know it's like most RPG out there, but i am trying to make it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI already have a story in mind. Can you give me some feedback or some pointers ?"

n30mrs,Need help with my game idea.,"Hello everyone,\n\nSo for a quick background, I am doing Bachelor's in IT and we have a 3rd-year final project. I thought of making a game as my 3rd-year project.\n\nI plan to make a Dialogue RPG game based on the book I read recently called ""The Alchemist"" by Paulo Coelho, as I know it's a very famous book at least some of you might know about it. So I have little to no knowledge in making games and I have trouble starting with it what would people in this sub suggest me to do?\n\n I just plan to make a small beta version of the game. I know the content of the book and could turn it into a dialogue RPG, but it will be more like a Visual Novel, and I think it will lack ""play-able"" content.\n\nPlease help me with how should I make this game. I am sorry if I didn't clear things regarding my question, you may ask it in the comments. Any suggestions are appreciated."
n2zb8o,An alchemy/merchant game with chemistry roots,"You know those games where you kill a ton of monsters and get a ton of useless loot from them that you sell? I have an idea for a game from the perspective of the merchant that's buying all those monster parts for some reason.   \n\n\nYou would be an alchemist who buys monster parts from adventurers and refines them into usable wares to sell. At the very least I think potions would be cool to make, but I can also see your character making runes, weapons,. and armor.   \n\n\nAs for how the potions work, there's a lot of real world chemistry techniques that I think could be used for rough inspiration. I just really like the feeling of processing and making potions (kind of like Thaumcraft.) For example, maybe the monsters drop impure gems and you put them in a pot, dissolve them in a liquid, and then precipitate them out to purify them (based on recrystalization). All of these would obviously be super simplified so that most/all people could learn what to do easily.   \n\n\nI generally want to capture the feeling of creating super pure advanced potions/gear by processing trash loot from adventures. A lot of the mechanics of making said potions would be loosely based on real chemistry techniques like recrystalization, distillation, spectroscopy, etc. These techniques would be super simple and streamlined, and the player would just have to learn ""this process analyzes what you have, this one separates, this one purifies, etc.""   \n\n\nOnce you make these potions, you can sell them to certain adventuring parties for the price of them bringing you better reagents and a little gold. This could add a cool component of making sure they're well equipped for their journey. For example, maybe you see that they're going through an ice area so you make them lots of frost resist potions.   \n\n\nIf ambitious, an armor, rune, and weapon component could be added too but honestly the potion stuff is the important aspect."
n2w6h4,An Educational Game Disguised as a Horror Game. (Looking for a writer.),"Hi everyone, I'm Matias.\n\n Recently through the Twine 2 engine, I've been experimenting with creating game narratives. For my new game, I wanted to create an educational game disguised as a horror game. So here's the premise.\n\nYou play as Matt and since kindergarten, your father has bought you an educational game every year for your birthday. Matt's father, however, has greater expectations each year and the games he gets you become harder and harder.  There are two parts to the game\n\n. The first part is the ability to look around your room and can see how much it has changed as you grow older. You can also communicate with family and friends. I want to set the game up so when Matt gets older his room becomes more monochromatic and the environment becomes more serious. We can also learn more about his personal life through his encounters with his father and his friends.\n\nThe second part is where the horror game aspect comes. My plan is to have the educational game teach the player some lessons and the player must answer correctly in order to progress. (The games end up getting more weirder and difficult the more you progress.)   In the first years the educational game will start off happy and get creepier but as the years go buy the game will start creepy and end even creepier. In short, I want my game to have a  moral on how the stress of kids to improve more and more can slowly cause their life to form into a downward spiral where they dissociate from family, friends and sometimes even reality.\n\nI'm looking for a writer who can help me with the overall plot and perhaps even the gameplay. You don't have to be exceptionally talented or anything like that I just want someone to bounce ideas with. If more than one person tries to message me then I will create a group chat. I would also like to send my progress to the people I'm working with through game files so they can test the game and see what could be improved. A once a week message conversation will work fine. Please note anyone under 18 cannot message me to contribute ideas to the game as I'm 18 myself.\n\n I'll look forward to seeing if anyone wants to join otherwise feel free to give criticism/advice in the comments."
n2w2cd,A Watch_Dogs game that requires real hacking skills,"It'd be really cool to see a version of the game Watch\_Dogs for real Computer Scientists, Engineers, IT people, hackers, etc.\n\nBasically the entire world &amp; storyline is the game...But rather than pressing a few buttons to hack into systems, you would actually have to write code ingame to exploit those systems. And of-course, you can reuse that same code on similar vulnerable systems, etc. But all of the tasks would require you to be familiar with a programming language, the linux terminal, etc.\n\nWould be dope huh?"

nbn84e,Mayday: Air Crash Investigation sim for PC,"I don't think more than maybe 2 or 3 people would actually buy and play this, but I think it would be really cool, so I'll go ahead and post it here.\n\n\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game opens with the classic ""Mayday"" TV show intro, then you are taken to a screen where it will ask you how much you know about aircraft and aviation terminology in general. This is similar to how FIFA games for example, will ask you how much you know about soccer. Depending on what you answer, the terminology used will be ""dumbed down"" for the player to be able to understand it. The setting can be changed anytime. You will see the main menu where you can start a new game, and will later have the option to view your hangar of collected aircraft models (obtained for each successful investigation) as well as options to review all previous case files and play bonus levels that will unlock once you have a certain amount of XP.\n\n \n\nPOV: You’re a rookie investigator for the NTSB, the US federal agency responsible for investigating the causes of air crashes not only in the states, but all over the world. Your first case is fairly straightforward: a small aircraft that has suffered a clear, catastrophic mechanical failure. This level will serve as a tutorial of sorts. Your team will give you tips on sifting through evidence, identifying different types of mechanical faults, interviewing witnesses, reviewing Cockpit Voice Recorders and Flight Data Recorders, and finally submitting your report to the agency. You can always replay this level if you need to get brushed up on the basics. \n\n\- Become a world-renowned air crash investigator. When you start a new game, your reputation points (or XP) will be low and you’ll only be handling regional cases. The more investigations you successfully complete, the higher it will go, and the more opportunities you’ll have to graduate to more challenging cases all across the globe. \n\n\- Learn to use all the tools of your trade in this free roaming world, from the most advanced technology to good old fashioned gumshoe detective work. Interview witnesses and survivors to see if they can reveal anything that you might be missing. Listen to cockpit conversations as many times as you need to. Sometimes they may hold the answer, sometimes not, but it never hurts to be thorough. Review flight data information to see if any critical systems have failed. Review charts of the surrounding area to see if terrain or weather was a factor. Develop profiles of the captain and crew to determine if human error played a role.  \n\n\- Build a reliable team. Getting to the bottom of an air disaster is an arduous process, so let your team help you with several specific tasks such as poring through debris, conducting media interviews to keep the press off your back, and checking into the background of the crew and passengers. You’ll need to develop sufficient XP to be able to to hire the best of the best. \n\n\- Learn when to call the FBI for assistance. Sometimes, an accident is actually not an accident at all, but a terrorist attack or a disgruntled passenger / employee lashing out. If this is the case, you will be handing control of the final report over to the FBI, and provide a consulting role to help them determine what exactly happened. This is critical to get right the first time, make sure you have all the facts you need before making the call. Misidentifying a case could cause grave damage to your reputation and public confidence in the aviation industry. \n\n\- Bonus levels: investigate cases in historical scenarios, involving several classic aircraft from the 1930s, 40s, 50s, 60s etc. \n\n\- Additional bonus: port all of the unlocked aircraft in your hangar into any flight simulator game.\n\n\- The NTSB and the public are counting on you to deliver an accurate, detailed report that will help further the safety of the aviation industry at large. Follow up on all your leads before submitting your findings."

nbe51r,A platformer rpg but you level DOWN,"So you start the game with simple platforming and level 1 Enemies\nYou start at a very high level, for example 50.\nYou kill everything in 1 hit have tons of hp etc.\nHowever you still get xp when you kill enemies, you will get a small amount at the start but after not too long you'll start leveling down . When you level down you get to choose a stat to decrease (health, attack, etc.) By the end of the game you will have very low stats and would get killed in 4 or 5 hits by everything. Still, the bosses shouldn't be too powerfull so it's still fair, and by that point the game would be more dodging oriented.\nThoughts?"
nbcsym,Idea for a pc game.,"How do I start this...well, the games name is ""The Grackles chime"", the game starts with the sound of a Grackle (The crow-like sound, not tweetie bird.), And simply says ""They've awoken."" You play as a child and need to prepare weapons. You then go out. Try not to get k* lled by grackles, they hide EVERYWHERE. There's normal grackles, emperor and empress grackles. And the boss right is known as "" GOD GRACKLE"" with 6 wings. Let me know if u want not info!"
nbah4u,City War - multiplayer," \n\nI'd like to describe my idea for a game and see what you think about it, etc. This is just a very general draft of the game idea and it's totally open for all of your suggestions.\n\nSo it is a multiplayer game where before you start you can create your start own map, for example something like a town (based on city skylines) but with the very basic graphic. Then you can share this map on the server and other people can either create their own map (server) or join to your map. For example if five players will join to one map then the game starts.\n\nThese five players are spawned in five random places on the map and controls their characters from the first perspective view. The main goal for them is to destroy the let's say VIP building (the most imporstant building in the game, the aim for the players). But they are fighting with each other also, because only one person can win the game. Players can find some kind of weapons on a map. The host of the map is also playing but not as a person on the map like them but he has a camera like on the city skylines from the top so he sees all of the players and he has to protect somehow the VIP building and make it difficult for players to get there, for example he has to build some kind of walls, some security posts, turrets with plots, etc., so the players will see those things and have to somehow destroy or go workaround them. Of course the host has also something like limited cash to spend, but he can also earn that cash from some shops, factories on the map, and players can also destroy that kind of buildings to stop earning money by the host.\n\nSo this is my very general idea draft for a game, what do you think?"
nb9yw3,Web Game: Fake News,"This is an idea for a web game adaptation of a board game. Rule 2 says blatant copies aren't allowed but I don't know if this counts or not.\n\n So I recently started playing a web game called Gartic Phone, it's basically a web version of the board game Telestrations. So I thought, why not have a web game version of the card game Fake News?  \n\n\nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME (shorter explanation)  \n\- Each player gets 1-3 topic cards (which would be a setting)). Each topic card has a short phrase on it  \n\- Each player also gets 1 image card with an image  \n\- Each player also gets 1 audience card with a group of people listed on it (ex: Seniors)  \n\- Each player then makes up a news headline using the topic cards as a base, the image card as the idea, and the audience card of who the news headline is directed to  \n\- The game then shows every player each headline, (the topics, image, and audience cards being shown or not could be a setting)   \n\- Each player then gives a Winner, Runner Up, and FAKE NEWS! title to one card.   \n\- The winner is worth 3 points, Runner Up is worth 2, and FAKE NEWS! is worth 1 point. If you don't get any votes then it's 0 points  \n\- The game is for 4-8 players\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEB LINKS (ideas)  \n\- [playfakenews.com](https://playfakenews.com)  \n\- [fakenewsgame.com](https://fakenewsgame.com) \n\n(the only reason I'm asking for someone to make this is because I want to play this online, credit me if you'd like but as stated in Rule 6 you don't have to)"
nb40e5,I want to design a gaming app for news ans social media i want some amazing ideas and be newly,
nb0nh7,Plant evolution game multiplayer,"I recently thought of a game where there is one huge server or maybe a couple. Everyone starts out picking some traits for a plant and you decide where you put it in the environment. From there you should spread and try to be the most well adapted plant to the environment. The server climate will change and there will be different biomes. But sometimes there will be lots of rains and sometimes very dry. My thought is that you could log out for a couple of days and come back on with your species still alive so it would be something going on for over a year if you commit to it. New players might join and invade your species with their plants and the inactive peoples plants will just die because they don't evolve them. THe more you spread the more points you can spend on evolving, might need some balance mechanic for that though so too well spread species aren't impossible too take down.\n\nTo me it sounds like a cool idea, especially if it is a passive game where you can log on like twice a week and check in on how well you are doing. There could also be a quicker game mode where everything is fast paced and is more like a Battle Royale :)"

nas91x,The Breaking Cheese Wheel,"This game would be a 2D game where you are in a cheese factory killing all the workers. Boss Fights would be where you can grab the workers and through them onto machines to kill them! I really do want some ideas and criticism so if you had some, please comment some ideas."
nas6ym,What are thoughts on flairs by genre instead of flairs by scale?,"Our current flair system is oriented around scale, where you indicate the size and complexity of the idea. This doesn't feel all that helpful to me. A lot of people don't know how complex or large their idea is for starters (Looking at you ""Beginner MMORPG""). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I see a decent number of requests for ideas by genre, and it would be really helpful to those people if a person could filter to ideas by genre. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, I just don't see the value in declaring the scale and scope of your idea. I'm looking for ideas, concepts and themes, not design documents, stories and worldbuilding. The different between a AAA game and a lofi indie game is usually more about polygons, texture and scale than it is about mechanics and gameplay, and when it's not you can usually tell by the genre."
napn1d,"You harness the power of your enemies, but it's online","The idea would be of a MMORPG but instead of choosing a class, you only start with a basic auto-attack skill. When you slay a monster, its body immediately decays and disappears. Except sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't you can harness a skill from the monster and that's a new skill you can use yourself.\n\nYou would build your character based on the skills you obtain and maybe based on the items too. You could actually select a class in the beginning but it would be mostly passive skills.\n\nEventually, you'll run into powerful monsters that let you get special skills. The strongest monsters, found at the end of difficult dungeons, would have a slight chance to not decay and to let you obtain very powerful endgame skills."

nag62b,I had an idea I'm hoping you can see if it's good,Its basicly an open world ghost hunter that you and or your friends can go about the world but there will be areas where you can find people who want your help and you can level up by doing these missions and learn skills to help find and destroy the ghost/being this kinda came into my head while watching supernatural and x files

For some reason PVZ Garden Warfare comes to mind but you have the Mushroom Kingdom Vs. the Koopa Kingdom and you get to choose from various characters, customize their look and their powers. Maybe even be able to create your own Hero/Villain like make a Brother/Princess or a Koopa, or at least customize their looks a bit. I really wish this was a thing, Nintendo plz"

nae0ci,"Tower defense or Minecraft like, building combo mechanic.","So this is an idea I had while watching a streamer play a building game.\n\nThe idea is that like a normal building game you can place buildings. However when upgrading the building you instead build other buildings on top of the first.\n\nHere is a simple image explaining to show the concept: [https://i.imgur.com/X3Lpm3L.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/X3Lpm3L.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is probably possible to build the game around this simple idea. In a Minecraft like it will be about clever and good looking designs, in a tower defense it is more about what happens when buildings are combined."
nacoz1,Interesting Game Idea,"I have they cool idea for a game that just randomly popped into my head for literally no reason.\n\nImagine a post apocalyptic game being marketed as the next big single player story telling game with many groundbreaking features and epic missions. While you play through the game you fight numerous enemies that are hunting you while you are on your quest. They will do almost anything to prevent you from reaching your goal. Your goal is to round up the last of humanity to have a fighting chance to survive the apocalypse.\n\nThe thing the players won’t know when they are playing the game is that all those enemies that they have been disposing of have been actual players that have also bought the game.\n\nThey are all human (the same as the player character) but due to a mind virus that has infected the entire population, they all see each other as hideous violent monsters enabling a reaction in the player’s mind to shoot and kill each other.\n\nThe player does not discover this until the very end of the game, where they realize they have been destroying mankind’s last hope for survival without even realizing it.\n\nIt’s a bit crazy I know, but I just had to get it out of my mind. The game would be initially revealed in one of the announcements to have a multiplayer mode, but it would receive an announcement of it “being delayed or cut”. When in reality it was always there to begin with. \n\nI realize there are probably some legal problems with this such as false advertising, but it’s just an idea."
na99ts,Web Game Idea - Would you play a Cyberpunk text/ui based web game?,"Hello guys, just found this sub and wanted to give it a try. I have been trying to research games similar to one I'm creating with another dev but am having trouble finding similar communities. It is a web game in a similar vein to Kingdom of Loathing and Fallen London.  \n\n\n**The idea:** To build a cyberpunk world in a web game using modern web development libraries (React/Node if you are familiar). The game will have quest lines, combat, crafting, skill systems,  eventual player markets, asynchronous multiplayer elements. It will largely be text/ui/image based and combat will be skill/turn based.  \n\n\n**The gameplay hook:** Level your character via combat, grind for levels and items unlocking new skills. Augment your body and unlock new skill paths. Build up your crafting skills, make a fortune, open businesses. Meet interesting NPCs and experience complete storylines in a similar vein to Oblivion/Skyrim contained storylines (Mages Guild/Dark Brotherhood esque, self contained stories that open options outside of their questlines.) New storylines, city districts, skill paths, item types would come out in monthly/serial patches after release.  \n\n\nI appreciate your input as to whether you have played similar games to this and/or would be interested in something like this. Cheers."

I want to know how to improve this and how you would improve this.\n\n**Story (Basic)**\n\nYou are an innocent civilian who has been kidnapped by a cult and you have to try and escape without getting killed by the demon.\n\n**Story (In-depth)**\n\nYour name is Mark Walterson, you're a 39 year old American male who worked as a trucker for 5 years. One day while doing your job, your truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, so you hop out and try to fix it and then out of nowhere, you are knocked unconscious and kidnapped by a cult. Several hours pass and you finally wake up in a room deep underground with bodies all around you. After looking around you discover the name of the cult that kidnapped you and what they were up to but you also discover what killed the cult members and now that thing is out to get you. You can either try and escape or you can try to banish the demon to ensure that it doesn't hurt anyone/follow you home.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe player will mostly walk around collecting items to aid their escape or fight/defeat the monster. If the player has no means of defending themselves, then they can try to hide in the various hiding spots around the area. \n\n**Mechanics**\n\nMonster: Randomly teleporting to different rooms, Ability to hear noises the player makes\n\nPlayer: Listening through doors to check for the monster, Hiding from the monster, sprinting cause why not"

n9sa73,"Discovery Tour by Assassin’s Creed, but as a current-day virtual holiday tool","Hello, so Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey got “Discovery Tour” mode, which are educational fully-explorable open worlds based in the map of the main games. Hostiles, quests and objectives are removed, addition of guided tours to learn about the eras of Ancient Egypt/Greece and an ability to teleport anywhere and explore Egypt/Greece to your leisure without interruption.\n\nEver since Origins’ was released as well as the COVID-19 Pandemic and mass-lockdowns soon after, I am massively surprised at the fact we have no tool to explore other cities and attractions.\n\nA bit of a rundown as to what a “game” like this could entail, imagine you are put somewhere like Tokyo, Japan. The whole city is available to explore and teleport around. Brimming with pedestrians, culture and traffic. You can have a virtual tour of the Shibuya District, the Tokyo Tower or a neat shopping mall. Find little collectibles and souvenirs in hidden spots throughout the city. You can also have a bit of a walk across mount Fuji. All of this in AAA cutting-edge graphics mapped to how it’d look like in real life.\n\nThis framework could be used for virtual time travel and seeing different places in different eras and events. Even entire made-up fantasy world that can express different lore and worldbuilding. Having a walk around Hogwarts or Middle-Earth for instance.\n\nIts a dream of mine, thoughts?"

n9ec5g,A Cowboy Bebop game that's a spiritual successor to Oni,This is less of an idea and more of a wet dream but I loved the mix of martial arts and gun play Oni had along with it's anime aesthetic.

n9atsq,First stage of Spore... Expanded!,"I've always loved the game spore by Maxis. A lot of people like the end game, but for me, I actually enjoyed the first few stages instead. I don't know if it's the creature creation, or the ability to customize/evolve the creature on my own, but I always thought it was really fun and haven't been able to find another game like it. \n\nIf I was to draw inspiration from the game, I'd focus on the first stage (cell stage: 2-D, top-down). With expanded mechanics such as more attack types (excretion of toxins, enzymes, etc), defensive mechanics (flagella for faster swim/""dodge"", extra sensors for enemy detection). The game loop would following something like: gather resources to survive (e.g. food), have your colony grow based on available resources, fight neighbouring colonies for their resources. Evolve or acquire more genes (i.e. ""abilities"") to better gather more resources to invade or defend against other colonies.  \n\nIs this something you would play? Did I miss the mark completely on why spore is so enticing for other players? If you could recreate and expand on one aspect of Spore, what would it be?"
n9a856,A Valve Game Crossover,"I love video game crossovers. However, my idea is a little complicated. Here's the backstory: A virus is breaking the source code for all main Valve games, and the G-Man realizes how devastating it would be (because he's all-knowing or something), so he travels to different source code games (TF2, DoTA, etc.) to find the strongest and smartest heroes to combat the virus. (I got this idea when I saw a post about a hacker in TF2 pulling Half-Life 2 assets like the G-Man model into a game of MvM)\n\nLink to MvM hacker: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/mf7h6q/well\_this\_happened\_in\_a\_mvm\_match\_he\_picked\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/mf7h6q/well_this_happened_in_a_mvm_match_he_picked_up/)\n\nBut anyways, the game will go throughout each Source game, similar to how JJBA: EOH does with the different parts of the series, with the G-Man recruiting different characters from each game. Each part will have virus fights in a FPS style (because a majority of Valve games are FPS) and then after the fights, G-Man shows up and takes the fighters. I haven't really thought about what happens after G-Man gets the team he needs together, probably have the smart ones locate the virus while the fighters hold off the virus.\n\nThe title will probably be something along the lines of Half-Life 3: Source Breakdown because it starts with Half-Life G-Man and all that jazz, plus the virus breaking down the Valve Source code.\n\nThe first part will be Half-Life, then the second part will be TF2. Tbh i think it would be funny if the Civilian from TF2 Classic makes a cameo.\n\nIf I got any facts wrong, I apologize."

The simple solution can be to keep movement the same having ship face only one direction when moving with ability to shoot in a 360° radius with mouse/ right thumb stick so ya move while still being able to shoot enemies at the side and behind you\n\n2. For a more hardcore &amp; little more complicated Vertical, Overhead Horizontal, Straight, Horizontal, etc Scrolling Shooter experience ya can have it where say your ship/ dragon/ whatever ya use can go forward &amp; backwards with up/ down (or W &amp; S keys) and can turn ship with left/ right (or A &amp; D Keys) to add a 360° range to not only your shooting but also your movement (with an optional choice to make it where if your ship accidentally hits or goes off screen then it will die losing you one life)"

n8rlpa,Recursive game within a game,"It would start as a game that contains itself within it. Some games have already done this, like Celeste. But that game would also have itself within it, and so on, with graphics getting slightly worse every time. The hardest levels would require you to go many levels of recursion in, to the point where you are nearly blind.\n\nA slight spinoff of this is a game that requires you to make itself. Play testing the game within a game would be very similar to the normal game, maybe with a little different controls. I imagine a few levels of recursion in, elements would start glitching out, and you would be stuck in this nightmare scape.\n\nWhat do you think? It’s not very fleshed out, but it does seem possible, though maybe tough to make."

n8b0iv,Need suggestions how to simplify building in an automation game.,"Hello, we are making a 3d game that is a blend of satisfactory and first person shooter. However, for this game, the building style of satisfactory or factorio is too complex, as we would like it to be focused more on combat and gathering resources. Specifically, we would like to remove the need to manually connect every building by a conveyor belt, which what is we find to be the most tedious/difficult part when building a huge factory. What we have come up so far is to either have a large number of drones that autonomously run between buildings and distribute resources, or make buildings somehow autoconnect to each other. For people that find games like factorio too boring or overwhelming, how would you suggest to simplify the building process so that it would be more fun for you?\n\nThank you for your suggestions!"
n8asxi,Another one. (And yes it's a little longer but I'm sure y'all will enjoy it)(3 out of ?),"If you have played an Endless Runner in the past then you'll have realized that Endless Runners aren't really Endless in a way. \n\nTo put it bluntly Endless Runners only goes for as long as you can/ decide to play it for and no matter how far ya are in the Run and want to continue it ya have no choose besides quiting by killing yourself, losing by an obstacle/ enemy or keep going\n\n\n\nSo here's my solution to make Endless Runners truly Endless:\n\nMilestones - Where when ya get to certain points in the ER you can save your run and continue it at another day or time\n\nIf ER games started being built with this while still having Milestones being a toggle-able option to have on/ off (that way ya can still have option to play it in the regular way without milestones whenever ya want as well) then it would bring ER's to new heights making them TRUE Endless Runners since you're grinding across different days/ times to get a highscore as high as ya can whenever ya want)\n\n(And for quality of life ya can adjust settings to pick whether or not the game will ease you back into the run when ya come back or place you right where you were, no matter how fast ya were going/ how crazy things were whenever ya left, and continue from there, etc etc for settings)\n\nTo make the gameplay even more enjoyable ya can have it also be an Action-Endless Runner where ya slash enemies (2 finger swipe) and/ or shoot enemies (tap) while avoiding obstacles (1 finger swipe to move around screen), ability to wall-run infinitely and ability to go back and forth whenever from floor, walls, &amp; roof flipping the camera view everytime ya do that\n\nAnd to prevent it from being a simple move from either roof, walls, or floor it can be like this as well to add a more tactical and free movement way to it:\n\n  _   _   _   _   _\n|                      |\n|                      |             _  _  _\n|                      |           |           |\n|                      |           |           |\n| _   _   _   _   _| or      | _  _  _ |\n\n(Each line represents where ya can move to on screen depending on where you swiped to so basically the walls, roof, and floor all have 3 or 5 spots ya can move to, maybe even have some sections where ya need to be in somewhere in middle/ mid-air not on one of the sides to not get hit by doing a swipe to move from one side to another to be in mid-air)\n\nI know it's long but hope it inspired someone and are willing to pick and choose what to do from this\n\n(I'm going to make my own suggestions a series but this one is the only one I think that was super long)"

n8adhc,Keeping Somewhat Simple for this One (compared to games out today),A Megaman Battle Network Successor\n\nNo game has ever to my knowledge done the movement &amp; combat of the Megaman Battle Nexus Games and that game model could be used for any kind of setting/ story/ enemies\n\nAnd maybe there could be also be multiple playable protagonists throughout the game (with the protagonists all against each other and affecting each other's future events) and maybe add some verticality in some way (different levels to go between for platforms) for the combat\n\nIf ya haven't played those games I HIGHLY recommend an Emulator on PC/ Series X|S since all 10-11 Games in that spin-off Megaman series are only on Gameboy Advance
n88pzd,Turn based combat with a network based movement system,"Most games with turn based combat use one of two systems to track positioning.  Either movement takes place on a grid, like chess, checkers, dnd, fire emblem, or they don't deal with movement at all in combat, although sometimes they still use positioning.  Earthbound makes a distinction between upper and lower rows of enemies while persona can make you start a battle face to face or surrounded by enemies. \n\nI'd like to see a game which uses a graph like thise used in graph theory.  Battle maps would look something like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/bh4oGQw4h8ZSRA248).  Along with you're normal action which you use to attack, use an item, cast magic, or whatever is in your system, you can also move. \n\nOf course, what this mechanic would do depends entirely on the mechanics of the game you're making, but here are some ideas basic ideas.\n\n* Melee attacks only work when you share a node with your enemy.\n\n* Ranged attacks work best a certain number of edges away, how many depends on the weapon. \n\n* When there are two more players on a node than enemies, you are given a considerable advantage on that node.\n\n* AOEs effect everyone on a node, regardless of side.\n\n* Edges can be blocked by either side.  Alternatively, either side can stop an enemy from retreating by continuously attacking them. \n\n* You can only heal or use an item on someone sharing a node.\n\n* Retreating is easier n edges away.\n\n* Knockback. \n\n* Passive buffs and debuffs only work n edges away.\n\n* Status effects that impede movement."
n84yfy,Titanfall 3,"I know that this would be a sequel to titanfall 2, but ea does not give a damm about this series. For the campaign, I would make the main storyline about cooper trying to refind bt, but you would also have side stories, like battlefields war stories, telling the views of all the factions.\n\nFor multiplayer I would not change Much. I would make it so that there are more Titans in the game, and more powerful customization (ex: viper jets for North Star). Also would make a vanguard class titan that would be like Titans from titanfall 1. Also would add more weapons and unique tacticals.\n\nThere are more things, but I would like to ceap it short. Tell me your ideas in the comets."

n81pvd,A survival game set in a constantly changing world,"As a heads up, I am unsure of the exact rating for this idea, and it might be best under the ""Experienced"" flair. Depends on how advanced the graphics and actual gameplay are, I suppose.\n\nThe basic story would be that your colony ship crash-landed on this planet, and you and the other survivors need to survive in a building made within the radius of your ship. The next day, everything outside of the radius of your ship has changed. Maybe the planet is an ever-changing space entity, maybe it just phases through alternate versions of itself every day. Either way, the map changes regularly. The ship could resist changes due to it being made of material not from this planet, or maybe another explanation that wouldn't be questioned.\n\nThere would be a separate chance for things outside the radius of the crashed ship to change, and the farther away from the ship the thing is, the more likely it is to change. For instance, the forest immediately around your ship will either stay the same or maybe the types of trees will spontaneously change, while a mile away from the ship, an entire mountain range could disappear overnight. Stockpiled items would also not be safe from this, so a few of your wooden logs might disappear or even change into steel or gold, depending on how far from the ship they are. \n\nThis would apply to sentient NPCs as well, so you should get all of your colonists as close as possible to the ship before night falls. If an NPC gets caught out at night, they will change. Some will have minor changes, such as a different gender, name, or a different set of skills. Others will have major changes, such as turning into an animal or becoming hostile, or even an alien creature. These changes could happen to hostile NPCs as well, such as a hostile person becoming friendly and an alien changing into a human.\n\nThe end goal could either be to survive long enough to be rescued, or thrive enough to build your own ship, or even just have an endless game where you see how long your colony can survive."

You could think of them as attractive, charming, or just a generally good person, or you could think of them as annoying, deplorable, and generally a bad person.\n\nSome of these options wouldn't be available depending on the character, such as;\n\n\- You can sympathize with villians, but you can't idolize them or look at them generally positively\n\n\- You can't think of characters that aren't human(iod), aren't above 18, and/or don't have the intellegence to consent as ""attractive"" nor can you view certain characters as attractive if it would be jarring, disturbing, or immersion breaking\n\nWhat do you think?"
n7tirq,An action sci fi game that explores the native life inside of Jupiter,"Feel free to use this idea. The game revolves around hypothetical life inside of Jupiter. \n\nThe dominant life form on Jupiter are floating jellyfish-like organisms called the Gejurotixm. They are intelligent, have a language, and spawn these big bubble-like structures that function as floating cities.   As photosynthetic organisms, they need to spend some time up high (but not too high) to gather sunlight, as well as the radiation from space.  These organisms are about 4 feet tall, and are relatively peaceful with other members of their species.  They are chemovores, in that they consume chemical compounds from the air for food.\n\nEnemies:  There are also savage creatures that the Gejurotixm must contend with. The Mwsouti are manta ray type organisms that hunt and kill the Gejurotxim for food.  Qspikazb are winged centipede-like beings that will attack just about anything, including each other.  Thopsidleh are hovering orange blobs that spit a corrosive substance.  The Lopoodo are unpredictable wormlike beings that rapidly evolved from viruses on a probe from Earth that was sent into Jupiter’s atmosphere, making them semi-earthlings and the only aliens in the game.  There are others too.\n\nThe protagonist: You are a Gejurotxim warrior guardian. Your mission to to defend your kind against the many threats of Jupiter.  Sometimes, you will be defending cities or Gejurotxim expeditions on their resource gathering operations down below.  Other times, you will go on search and destroy missions.  Sometimes, you will be patrolling, and may even need to deal with criminal Gejurotxim that pirate chemical compounds from peaceful cities.\n\nLife:  You have both hit points and energy points. You lose hit points when you are attacked, and you gradually lose energy when you go down below the point where light can be absorbed.  When either meter reaches 0, you’re dead.  You suffer damage when you fly too low or too high.  Hit points can only be recovered by entering a city and joining your tentacled with another of your species.  They heal each other through the process of Cntiyidal.\n\nExperience and levels:  Your gain experience by killing enemies and completing missions.  As you go up in levels, you acquire hit points, energy points, stronger attacks, and more combat moves.\n\nCombat capabilities:  Your primary attack is a tentacle lash, which whips enemies.  Later, you can spit acid, strangle, encapsulate and devour, lay corrosive spores, shoot sharp spines, impale, etc.\n\nMusic and sound effects:  The “music” should sound like the sound effects from the movie “Forbidden Planet”: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSrf-htPbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSrf-htPbk). None of the music or sound effects should resemble anything human.  The music should be more mild in a safe layer of the atmosphere, and harsher sounding as you travel into more dangerous zones that are to high or too low.  Speech should sound like bizarre garbled sounds, with the text of what they’re saying at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe game is almost total action with little story, aside from tidbits that you pick up from talking with other Gejurotxim.  It’s open world and endless. You can save your game when you’re done playing. The map constantly changes, since Jupiter is a gas giant.\n\nMultiplayer: Players can play as groups by logging on to the server and joining games together.  There are also tournaments and death matches where players can fight with each other.\n\nFeel free to contribute to this idea, or to use it."
n7tbt4,Need a short smallscale horror plot/game ideas for a story based 2d game,"I want to practice coding and storytelling in unity and looking for ideas for a short horror game for ~20minutes gameplay\nI gonna make it 2D, I'm thinking more of point and click genre. Just no detective/murder case plots."
n7st3w,"What are your video game ideas that you want turned into a video game for the latest Playstation home game console, latest Xbox home game console, or the latest Nintendo home game console?","This is mine: \n\n(Action-Adventure Hack and Slash Sandbox MMORPG) \n\nWhen you lock on to the battle zone or enter the battle zone, you will hear all the microphones of the players participating in the battle.  Players will also hear your microphone during combat.  Outside of combat, you can lock on to any player and listen to that player's microphone.  The player can also listen to your microphone.  All parties / guild players can always hear each other's microphones, even if the players are in completely different locations.  You can mute anyone's microphone at any time.\n\n To hear a person's mic outside the battle zone, lock on to another player or create / extend one open mic zone.  You can create an open mic zone only if you are not in another player's open mic zone.  The open mic zone creates an invisible barrier that surrounds the creator, including players within the radius of the barrier, without blocking anything.  The open mic zone allows all players in the barrier to participate in open mic parties.  Join with the push of a button and you'll hear all players' microphones from all players in the open mic zone.  Open mic parties are different from regular parties and guilds.  When you leave the open mic zone, you are no longer a member of the party.  For microphones, all mute options are always available.\n\n There are customizations for height, children / adults, fat / thin, clothes, equipment, armor, appearance, weapons, abilities, movements, skills, magic, and summons.  Customizing the appearance of the character is similar to the game ""God Eater 2"" and the game ""Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization"".  You can create up to 4 characters.  You can switch to control one character or one of ""your"" other created party members.  The character's AI can be set in the same way as in the game ""Star Ocean: Until the end of time"".  You can play the game with any character you create.  You can switch control of the party character at any time.  If you don't want to control your ""own"" character during battle, just set the character to AI.\n\n There are several specific places where you can talk to different NPC characters and enter different servers to advance the story.  These servers warp / teleport ""your"" different party characters to any section of the current story.  Each server has a limited number of players, and each server has all players of the same level within 10 intervals (eg Server 1-Level 1-10, Server 2-Level 10-20).  You can always enter a server above your level, but you cannot enter a server below your level.  You can earn certain things by completing different parts of the story.  There are many side stories, hidden ones, and optional ones, which are not part of the story.  There are also many gates and portals similar to the game "".hack: Infection"", where you can choose different servers and experiment with different dungeons.\n\n To engage in combat, you can either attack someone / something or be attacked by someone / something.  A character / player will not gain experience unless that character / player hits an opponent at least once.  The hit must be a hit even if the damage dealt is 0, not the damage caused by the status effect.  During the battle, the radius of the battle zone is automatically set according to the position of the first participant.  Only the first combat participant can lock the combat zone at any time.\n\n Locked battle zones have invisible barriers that keep battle participants inside, blocking entry into all other zones.  If the battle zone is unlocked, other players / characters outside the battle zone can join the battle zone and gain experience points.  You can only gain experience points if you are in the same battle zone as the enemy you defeated when you defeated it.  All different enemies have different amounts of experience points that players earn during their defeat.  If the enemy is defeated by multiple participants, the experience points will be evenly divided among those participants.  If there are no players in the battle zone for more than 2 minutes, it will no longer be an existing battle zone.  There are harsh environments that your character may not be able to tolerate.  The item ""Magic Battle Zone Lock"" creates a locked battle zone that surrounds you, including all players within the radius, and blocks fire, water, etc.\n\n Players cannot attack another non-enemy player unless one player achieves ""G"" status or offers a player-versus-player challenge option.  To provide player-versus-player challenges, get close enough to ""lock on"" to another player, select challenge options, and extend one battle zone barrier that surrounds all players / targets.  ..  All player-versus-player challenge participants must be within the battle zone barrier.  All players in the battle zone must select the option to accept the challenge to start the battle.  The battle music option for this battle allows you to vote / agree or randomly select one playlist from one participant.  ""G"" status is achieved when the bar / meter is full, either by attacking the target or by being attacked for some reason.  ""G"" is a ""special"" that all players can ""use"" with the push of a button.  If you achieve ""G"" status, you will not be an enemy of other players until you attack.  Once you reach ""G"" status, you cannot be attacked by any player until you attack that player or participate in a player-versus-player challenge.\n\n If a ""G"" attacks a non-enemy player in a battle zone, that ""G"" cannot lock that battle zone.  ""G"" gains all experience points from the defeated ones, unless those ""Gs"" do not attack allies.  The ""G"" status lasts for 11 minutes.  When you defeat a ""G"", that ""G"" loses its ""G"" status, is no longer an enemy, and anyone can revive the player.  ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are ""King"" / ""Queen"", ""Boss"", or ""Elite"" characters.  Also, ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are participating in a player-versus-player challenge.  If four or more ""G"" s attack an ally in a battle zone, that battle zone achieves ""Frenzy"" and all players can attack all players.  The frenzy battle zone can only be locked by King / Queen, Boss, and Elite characters / players.\n\n When a player dies, that player can wait to be resurrected by someone else.  Alternatively, the player can choose the option to return to the entrance to the place where the player died, choose a server to return to the open world, or go to the equipment graveyard.  If you die more than 10 times, the option to return to the entrance to the place of death will not be available.  Your mic still works while you are dead.  You cannot earn experience points or items while you are dead.\n\n There are many continents on the map.  All continents are made up of zones.  Each zone has its own enemies and neutrals.  In most cases, all enemies and / or neutrals in each zone are at about the same level within the zone.  When all enemies in the zone have been defeated or all achievements in the zone have been completed, the last remaining players must fight each other.  Anyone who conquers a zone has the title of ""boss"" for that zone, and that player can choose the enemies in that zone.  Players select those enemies based only on all enemies defeated in the game, except for all defeated players.  Also includes boss enemies (different color schemes for boss enemies).  Players also select the level of those enemies, but only up to the highest level of enemies they have defeated so far.  If a ""boss"" player's zone is conquered by another player, that ""boss"" player loses the ""boss"" title.\n\n There is one king / queen per continent, either as a player or an NPC.  All Kings / Queens will now have 4 elite characters.  Defeat King / Queen in battle to earn his / her crown and title.  Kings / Queens can choose an elite character from their list of friends or from AI characters created by King / Queen players.  When you become a King / Queen, you can get a special item ""Crown"" that raises your stats.  You can keep the crown equipped even if you are not a king / queen, but you cannot wear it visually unless you are a king / queen.  Elite characters are kings / queens, as long as the kings / queens who made them elite remain kings / queens.  Kings / Queens can enter any battle zone at any time, even if they are locked.  Kings / Queens can attack any character they like at any time, including other players.\n\n When you reach a boss / mini boss in a dungeon, temple, story progress, cave, castle, etc., the battle zone may be locked by another player who is fighting the boss / mini boss.  You can go up to something that looks important nearby.  Example: A small statue nearby.  At the push of a button, you will be given the option to fight the boss / mini boss alone or with other players on another server.  You will not be able to rematch with the boss / mini boss unless you re-enter the entrance.  You can enter the server with various parties.  Any part of the game can be completed solo or party.  A party can consist of all players and all AI characters created by the player for that player's party.  There are servers with lobbies for dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc., and players in those lobbies have to wait for the lobby to fill up so that they can enter dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc.  ..\n\n There are summons obtained by leveling up, summons obtained by achievements, and summons obtained by defeating enemies.  When you defeat the big bosses you face in the game, most of them will be earned as ""summons"".  You can only have a limited number of ""summons"".  The Summon option allows you to summon one ""summon"" to perform one of the most powerful attacks, or control the ""summon"" as an AI party member.  When summoned as a party member, you can switch between the control of the summon and the control of the created character.  Summons are only summoned for 4 minutes.  If you unsummon a Summon, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the Summon option again.  If you complete a very powerful attack summoned with the Summon option, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the summon again.\n\n There are mounts you can get.  Traveling with mounted beasts etc. makes traveling much easier.  You can get a ""mount"" for travel by tame them with items or defeat them in battle.  While moving with a mounted beast / ""summon"", it can take some damage before the player is knocked off or the mount gets confused.  At higher levels of speed racing, you can be attacked by racers.  Also, at higher levels of speed racing, others who are not racers can attack you.  If you tame the same species many times, it will be available as a pet or ""summon"" and can be summoned at any time.  Some mounts can move on / in any terrain, including water, walls, mountains, and even trees, so you can reach hidden areas, hidden treasures / enemies / ""summons"", and more.  Some species have the ability to fly.  There are also cars that you can drive for an easier trip.  ..\n\n You don't need a beast / summon to fly.  There are items you can get that give your party the ability to ""fly"".  With these items you can ""fly"" for 10 minutes.  There is a way to permanently acquire the ability to ""fly"".  In flight, it's the same as in the game Kingdom Hearts 2, unless you select the Ascend option.  Select the Ascend option to allow you to fly freely in all heights and directions.  There is one button you can hold to automatically fly towards a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  With the ""fly"" ability, you can reach floating or hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".\n\n There are competitive flight races and other races that you can participate in to win valuables.  Your character can gain the ability to transform your character's visual form into a variety of obtained visual forms.  One such visual form that your character can get is the form of a beast.  These visual forms are abilities.  You can unequip these abilities and select other options such as double summoning.  You can customize your character's race, color, appearance, and more at any time, except during combat.\n\n There is an ability called ""Unlimited Jump"" similar to ""Double Flight"" in the game ""Kingdom Hearts: Fragmented Passage"", but it is not limited to double.  Like the anime ""Bleach"", there is a function called ""Ground Lock"" that allows you to land in the air and run around as if there is an invisible ground in the air.  It turns off every time something / someone hits you.  With these two abilities, you can reach floating and hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".  There is another ability called ""teleport"".  Teleport to a random location next to a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  Every time you use this ability four times, you have to wait four minutes before you can use it again.\n\n All player characters can be leveled up to a maximum level of 370.  There are several level 400 optional ultimate bosses.  Some of these bosses always leave the player with a legendary object when the Ultimate Boss is defeated.  There are a wide variety of legendary objects, including crowns.  You can level lock your character whenever you want.  This will prevent your character from gaining experience until you turn level lock off.\n\n Tournaments vary.  Players defeat players, players defeat computers, teams defeat teams, teams defeat computers.  The status of players such as bosses, kings, and elites will be displayed next to their names if those characters are locked on by other characters.  As long as the other player is not an enemy, you are guaranteed to be able to see the other player's health bar.  There are items that can be used to warp to friends' locations, etc.  These items can be purchased or obtained.  When you warp to a friend's location, you will be teleported to the entrance to that friend's location or where the friend is.\n\n Equipment graveyards are places where all equipment lost / discarded by all players is scattered everywhere.  There are no enemies other than the player or multiple players who can attack you.  You can also approach a weapon or equipment and challenge it with the push of a button.  This allows you to fight the ghost copy of the player to whom the weapon or equipment / armor once belonged.  This includes the player's level / stats / abilities / skills / ""summons"" and more.  The ghost's weapon / equipment is in the same state as when the owner lost / discarded it.  When you defeat the ghost, you can acquire the weapon / equipment, and the weapon / equipment will be in the same state as when the ghost used it.  Only the player who challenges the weapon or equipment can get the weapon or equipment after defeating the weapon or equipment.\n\n All weapons / equipment have levels, stats, and optional qualities / effects.  All weapons / equipment can be leveled up and changed through the ""Inner World of Equipment"", as in the game ""Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"".  The color schemes of all enemies and all bosses are different there.  You can reset your weapon to level 1 if needed.  Doing this will reduce the statistics, but the appearance, quality / attributes, and ""effect"" will remain the same.\n\n You can always get things or buy things for their appearance.  With the exception of abilities, skills, ""summons"", crowns, and trophies, you can ""hold"", discard, exchange, or sell whatever you like.  You can give money to anyone you want.  You can get or unlock ""optional visual appearance"" stuff such as pointed ears, tails, various wings, wing colors, accessories, glasses / shades, jewelry, markings, tattoos and more.  All ""visual appearance"" combinations, except the character's visual form obtained from ""abilities"", can be achieved as soon as you start this video game.  Not all varieties are available for immediate sale, but any player can acquire, trade, or sell them.  Most of them are for sale from the beginning, and many are ridiculously expensive, but any player can give you free money or get you to get it.  You can't buy or get anything with real money.  Strictly speaking, it's just in-game money.\n\n There are different types of items, weapons, equipment, and cards with the same name.  These types include differences in ""look"" / appearance, statistics, abilities, effects, and attributes.  If a player uses the ""player skill"" ""steal"" / ""mug"" against another player, only weapons and equipment can be stolen.  You cannot use the ""player skill"" ""stealing"" / ""mug"" against other players who are not enemies.  Stealing attacks / techniques / skills can only be used during ""battle"".  When used against a player, the chances of ""stealing success"" vary between 5%, 10%, and 15%.  If you use it against non-players, your chances are much higher.\n\n You can collect cards and have the ability to turn enemies into cards like in the game ""Final Fantasy VIII"".  You can play card games with other players, exchange cards, get cards from enemies, treasures, prizes and more.  Cards can be converted into items.  Strong and rare cards can be turned into the best and rarest items.  You can challenge random players / NPCs to ""card games"" except during ""battle"".  There are card tournaments held in various places.  You can listen to or mute the microphone while playing cards.  You can also skip directly to playing a card game from the title menu, which has a server that you can enter just to play cards.  All cards and items are shared between characters in the actual game and in the title screen card game.  There are different card game rules in different places.  If no rules are set, players will either play with the agreed rules or the rules will be randomly selected.  The player who becomes the ""boss"" of a zone can choose the card rules for that zone.  Players who become ""King"" / ""Queen"" can choose the card rules of the card game that ""King"" / ""Queen"" plays.\n\n Idea by Jeffrey Robert Palin Jr."
n7qjm7,Feedback on Plattformer/Roguelite/Tower Defense Idea,"I have this idea that i want to work on, but i'm not sure if it would be worth the time. So i want to hear your feedback\n\nThe idea is relativly simple:\n\nIt would controls like a typical 2D plattformer from the 8/16bit era with the added feature of simple melee combat. One would then be placed inside a proceduraly generated level, filled with enemies and treasure and the in the middle the exit, and then have a certain amount of time to collect money, upgrades and towers.\n\nOnce the time is up the tower defense parts comes in, as then hordes of enemy swarm in to destroy the exit and you defend it with your towers, while you're still plattforming. If it's destroyd it's game over. At the end of the wave a boss comes and after he is defeated you move on to the next stage.\n\nTldr. Jump and run with procedural levels, where you collect items to later defend yourself from hords of enemy"

n7lgat,Bookmaking game,"Hi everyone,\n\nI don't know any game where you play as a bookmaker, taking bets and choosing odds on matches/competitions.\n\nIn my mind, I'd mix it with a sci-fi theme. You've been entrusted with a portfolio of racing games of a distant off-world by a mafia boss. Each week, he is expecting you to pay tribute. The more you make money and pay within the deadline, the more he trusts you, the more your portfolio grows. From one planet, you get a system, then two, etc.\n\nEach new planet brings its share of new competitors and circuits, this way the mechanics are added at the speed the player understand the game mechanics.\n\nBefore each race, you have a screen with the information on each contestants: his speed, health, stamina... but also his popularity. Some information are hidden, and you have to ""buy"" them if you think they will have an impact on the upcoming race.\n\nOnce you reviewed the info of each racer, you can now see the circuit on wich they will be running. You can bribe the referee or place traps on the circuit (that you have to buy). Then, you can try to sabotage/enhance some concurrents, by offering them ""gifts"".\n\nFinally, just before the race begins, you have to place the odds on each racer. If it's not interesting enough, not a lot of people will place bet. You'll have to leverage your previous mischiefs to gain money. People will bet because they like a contestant, or just because it seems the more likely to win.  Be careful in your actions, because the more you try to influence the race, the more there is a chance the trust in the race fell, and less people place bets.\n\nThe moment the race takes place, you're mostly a spectator, crossing fingers for your plan to succeed.\n\nI like the idea so much I've started working on it."
n7kdm5,Superhero Game idea,"Hey everyone, I’m new here and this idea is one that’s been on my mind for a minute. A game where you are placed in a random area, as a character from that world. You can have different ways/opportunities to find out a super power and become a superhero. grow from a rookie hero to a powerful cosmic superhero. There would be villains for each tier of hero who all have different agendas and schemes. I realize that this idea would take a lot of effort and but it would be fun."

However why create a bunch of different creatures (and thus risk getting dud designs) when I can say, hit a bunch of archetypes? But I am not a fool and know that Pokémon didn’t become the cultural giant without the aesthetics. Not to gush, some designs are the best of the best.

o306sx,Main character has a curse of immortality and has to get rid of it,"You are a seemingly regular human functioning in regular society. Although no one knows it, you are immortal due to a curse hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe only way to win the game is to replay it at enough *different points in time* where there are different people in your life, and you must get to know them in order to figure out how to break the curse. There could be \~1000 years of playable time, each containing its own influenceable events,.\n\nAnother interesting part of this game is that time would be bi-directional. Things you do in your future runs would affect your past runs, and things in your past runs would affect your future runs.\n\nThere would also be a bunch of custom characters that can meet the character, fall in love, become best friends, (personality system / 1-on-1 relations) etc. You would have to witness all these people die since you are immortal. Additionally, history could be discovered about them later which was never known before. You could also do things in the past to affect the future, to say, make sure your friend survives, but this would only be possible before you knew your friend died. As you play through time, it solidifies in placee and is stuck like this forever; the time between these solidified events are malleable but also change in order to fit the current narrative on either sides of the story.\n\nThe game would be mostly interaction-based with you walking around a 2D scene and approaching people. There would be some depth to the 2D scene making it look paperlike."

o2vyig,Arbitrary Frenzy: A 5v5 FPS Multiplier Game,"A 5v5 FPS Multiplier game, however, your weapons, equipments, etc. are all random.   \n\n\n(Also, I'm not sure about the name so let me know if you have a better idea :/)  \n\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy the opponent's ""core"". Each team will have a base, the core being in the middle or something. Teams spawn in and prepare in the ""Ready-Up Phase"" (\~2 minutes). In the ""Ready-Up Phase"", players will select their **Primary Weapon**, **Secondary Weapon**, **Equipment**, **Transportation/Vehicle**, and **Ability**. During this phase, players will also start off with a few coins (\~1,000). (More on Coins later)  \n\n\n**Primary Weapons** are main weapons such as a rifle, sniper, laser, rocket launcher, etc.  \n**Secondary Weapons** are weapons like pistols, alien blasters, etc.  \n**Equipments** are items such as grenades, Molotov cocktails, freeze bomb, etc.  \n**Transportation/Vehicles** are things like cars, helicopters, jets, etc.  \n**Ability** is a special power that players can use to help them.  \n\n\nThe game will randomly choose 3 of each category and players can select 1 of the 3. Players will have a certain amount of time to select each category (\~20 seconds). If players do not choose, the game will randomly select one.  \n\n\n(I'm not sure if players should have to select new weapons, etc. when they die or when it's a new game though)  \n\n\nOnce this phase is over, the game will start. Players will then have to destroy the other's core. Each teams base will be protected with turrets, cannons, etc. As long as the core is not destroyed, players can respawn. I'm not sure about this, but maybe, once a teams' core is destroyed, players on that team will still be alive, but if they die, they die permanently (similar to Bedwars in Minecraft).   \n\n\nNow, how coins will work. Coins can be obtained by killing players and destroying the opponents' base (turrets, cannons, etc.). The main (and maybe only) purpose of coins is to upgrade your teams' base (turrets, cannons, etc.) and your passive ability/stats. They can also be used to rebuild your turrets, cannons, etc. (if they're destroyed by the opponents).   \n\n\n**Passive abilties/stats** are stuff like damage multiplier, coin multiplier, speed multiplier, etc.  \n\n\nAnd, I think that's about it (gameplay wise)."
o2vu7d,Anti-peta beat em up,"The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a ""shelter"", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan."
o2v7eb,Three way animosity system,"This is a mechanic for world building in a multi racial/faction environment. For explanation purposes I will use humans, elves, and orcs, but this mechanic could expand to any alien race or political factions making up a game world.\n\nThe mechanic is each race will love members of its own race, tolerate  one  other race, and despise the third race. For example humans tolerate elves and despise orcs, elves tolerate orcs and despise humans, and orcs tolerate humans and despise elves.\n\nThe player can build a crew that consists of one race and it will have high morale, but if they bring in members of another race to take advantages of the race specific game mechanics, one of the two groups of the crew will start loosing morale unless the player spends resources to bring the morale up. For example a mostly human crew brings on a few elves for their bow making skill. The humans are happy but the elves are miserable to be forced to live among so many humans. The player can buy an elfin meditation garden to keep his bow makers happy.\n\nThis expands to how your crew interacts with NPC groups. The mixed elf human crew get preferential treatment at Human settlements who don't see hated orcs. Elf settlements dislike the crew since it is majority human but are not as hostile due to the slight elf presence. Orc settlements are neutral to the player's crew since it is majority human but hey would be friendlier if there were not the slight elf presence."

o2odu6,A 1st person shooter where you try to kill as few aliens on the Moon as possible.,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nStory: On one of the Apollo missions, a tool left on the Lunar surface had Staph viruses from Earth on it. Not only did some viruses survive, but a few went into the Lunar surface and adapted to a waterless and airless environment.  This seeded life on the Moon, which underwent a very rapid evolution.  When NASA returned to the Moon in 2024, they found intelligent beings that greeted them. The Lunarians were civil with the astronauts, and the first mission went well. In 2030, you were chosen for the next mission. When you landed, there was a thrust malfunction that killed a few Lunarians waiting to greet you.  This tragic misunderstanding led them to believe that you were hostile and there to kill them. You must now repair your ship and leave, while killing as few Lunarians in self defense as possible.  The more you kill, the more damage it will do to interspecies relations.\n\nMission: To repair your ship, you need to retrieve 3 items on the Lunar surface. The first is a set of wires from a probe that landed years ago. The second is a battery in a supply crate. The third is a repair kit left over from the previous mission.  You begin the game with a detailed map.  The 3 items have a different placement on the map for each game, and will be spaced far apart.\n\nStats:  You have 6 hours of oxygen in your suit, and the game is designed to last about 2 hours playing at standard speed. Oxygen isn’t much of a problem unless you play very slowly and strategically. You also have a gun that fires high velocity particles (given to you by NASA as a precaution). The gun has 10,000 charges, so you have more than enough ammo unless you shoot recklessly.  Your suit can take 100 hits. After that, it ruptures and you decompress and die.\n\nObjective and scoring:  Your score is determined by how many Lunarians you **don’t** kill.  You must retrieve the 3 pieces needed to repair your ship, do the repairs, and then come home. The game world is a large piece of the Lunar surface, and there are 500 Lunarians in total. A perfect score would be 500, and that’s if you beat the game without killing a single one (which would be practically impossible).  A score of 0 is if you kill them all (or if you die from decompression or suffocation).\n\nGraphics and audio:  The graphics should look as close to the real Moon’s surface as possible, and should have hills, valleys, craters, cliffs, etc. The sky should have stars, the Sun, and the Earth. Your view is 1st person from inside of your environment suit.  There is no music in the game, and the only sounds that you hear are your own breathing, your footsteps, the click of your gun when you fire, the impact of being hit, the occasional radio transmission, and your own scream if you die.  Space is a vacuum, so you hear nothing outside of your suit.  All movement should reflect Lunar gravity.\n\nLunarians: They are short and stocky, with thick carapaces. Lunarians have 10 legs, and stand partially upright on their bottom 4 legs. They have 3 eyes, 2 antennas on top of their heads, and protruding circular mouths with teeth all around. Their color is light grey, like the Lunar surface. Their technology is primitive, and they attack by throwing rocks, throwing spears, or with their claws. In some parts of the game, you see odd-looking structures made of stones, which are their above-ground buildings.  It takes 1 to 4 shots to kill a Lunarian.\n\nOther:  You can save your game and come back to it later,  The view is 1st person, and movement is 3-D. You can select your gender, but the only difference is the sound of the scream if you die (which would be either a masculine or feminine scream).  You should be able to log on to the server to upload your score, and view the top scores. There should also be deathmatch tournaments where two players battle it out with each other.\n\nFun fact: If this game is made, then it will be the very first 1st person shooter where the objective is to kill as few opponents as possible!"
o2cva2,A sci-fi game theme that can allow permanent and permadeath characters to compete against each other in PvP.,"Hi, just posting a game idea :) The idea is for a storyline that meshes with a type of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay part is a way to have procedural level generation, permanent characters on one side and permadeath/hardcore characters on another side.\n\nThe storyline is a sci-fi thing, there is an entity called the ""Locust Fleet"" which goes from system to system, or maybe star cluster to star cluster, consuming the resources of that cluster.  These represent the permanent characters, who are the villains.\n\nThe heroes are the permadeath/hardcore characters.  They represent the system defenders.  If they die, they are typically permanently dead, depending on some other possible stuff such as wounding systems.\n\nThe terrain of key areas on each planet in each system is procedurally generated.  The heroes (system defenders) win if they can cause enough damage to the attacking Locust Fleet, or delay them for long enough.  The Locust Fleet has to move on after suffering enough damage/delay because there is an even more dangerous entity that is hunting them, so they can't stay in one place for too long.  There are also plenty of systems/clusters that have little to no defense, so if a system is defended too well, it's simply not worth it to them to stay in that system.  They also typically never return to a system that they have previously attacked because it is either stripped of most/all useful resources already, or if it wasn't, they can assume that attacking without the element of surprise is not a good idea since they already failed when they attacked with it.\n\nThe Locust Fleet wins if they can take enough of the system/cluster resources, which typically involves killing most/all of the system defenders.\n\nIn rare cases, a successful system defender might follow the Locust Fleet and help defend a new system, which means both role-play opportunities and a chance to increase the ""high score"" of a specific hero character.  But having a hero character die reduces the points value, which discourages having every single defender follow to a new zone every time.\n\nSo, the game idea is basically a sci-fi themed battle game with procedural stages but the interesting part is a way to combine permadeath with permanent characters in a PvP setting."

o21jcj,Beach Life remake/remaster!!!,"Hi Guys,\n\nI am not the biggest fan of management games (although I have 1160 hours on Surviving Mars) but IMHO Beach Life is a very good and rare management game from 2002. It's a beach resort game and this is why I dare to call it rare. I've played a ton of different games but no other game made me install Windows XP (or some emulation of it) so many times on my newer PCs over the years just to be able to play it since it's 19 years old game after all.\n\nIt seems very simple on prima vista but actually there are a lot of unique gameplay mechanics involved.\n\nIt has some nice randomizations as every single tourist has his own preferences and opinions about stuff. Every scenario seems to have some hidden modifications i.e. sometimes tourists will demand (more than usual) more bars, or water attractions, or places to party or cleanness etc.\n\nIt's fun to intentionally sell a strong beer in order to cause more crime and then have the security guard apprehend the drunk and violent person and get you some nice cashback.\n\nOr let sharks solve any potential overcrowding issues :) )).\n\nAnd this game still almost two decades later doesn't have a COMPETITOR!!! Literally I cannot find a single similar game allowing you to manage a beach resort. There might be some hybrid games where you manage a lot of stuff including beach related attractions but I've never seen a game just like Beach Life focusing entirely on one topic. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is because I am sure that there is a reasonable amount of money to be made by creating a remake/remaster of Beach Life as the market simply lacks such product.  And I would also enjoy playing such a game."

o1w6j9,A game where you get to make your own ability," This game idea is inspired by hunterxhunter, I created a post on this subreddit about this idea 10 months ago and I am reposting the idea because I have fleshed out the idea more now. I have used the flair dream but I think it could be made in smaller versions, the reason I took the dream flair is because my vision of it is really big and the version, I want to see be created is really large. The idea is a game where you get to create your own ability and I will post different version of this idea in this post because I couldn’t decide on one. In the paragraph after this one I'll talk about how Nen works and then after that I’ll talk about how the game would work.  \n\nYou can skip to the next paragraph if you want to just hear about the game idea itself. First, I need to explain a little about how hunterxhunters (hxh) magic/power system works, it's called Nen and you can use Nen to make your own ability. Nen has 6 different classes they are transmuter, enhancer, specialist, conjurer, manipulator and emission. The enhancer class lets you increase the strength of objects or yourself for example, you can strengthen your fist to make it do more damage when you punch and transmuter lets you use Nen to mimic the properties of something, for example you can mimic the properties of rubber and gum to make something that has the properties of both rubber and gum. I won't go into what all the classes do just google hxh Nen if you want to know more. The class you are assigned makes it so that you can use the classes full potential for example if two Nen users of equal skill were to enhance their fist to punch something and if one was a transmuter and the other one an enhancer the enhancer would do more damage than the transmuter. However, there is a class called the specialist class that the other classes can't use the potential of, a specialist has a unique ability only they can use like steal other abilities or predict the future etc. but a specialist can still do what the other classes can do. You can also put restrictions/conditions on an ability to make it stronger so, maybe, certain conditions need to be met before you can use an ability or you have restrictions on an ability for example you can only use an ability for a short period of time before the ability runs out and you have to wait to use it again. That’s all I'm going to explain about the Nen system I will say I did cut a lot out for simplicity's sake. \n\nSo, the idea I have for a game is where you can create your own ability. There are games that let you create other games and worlds like dreams on the PS4 and lots of games with customizable characters, but I have yet to see anything for abilities. So, the way it would maybe work is you have an in-game editor that is specifically designed to make abilities, I don’t have the technical skills to even make a prototype for this yet so I'm just going to put forward theories. Basically, you would choose a power like fire, ice or wind and then you get to choose how to manipulate that power for example you can choose projectile or sword etc. So, you are probably wondering how would you balance out the abilities and I'll go more in depth about that later but the more things you put on the ability the higher the cooldown. \n\nNow I'll start presenting the different version of the game \n\n3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version – For this version you would be in a colosseum where you fight other players or A.I. the arenas would have different themes maybe one is covered in ice/water and another arena is covered in fire/magma. The reason why I'm bringing up the themes of the arenas is because I would like for the environments the players are in to be useful so you can manipulate it and do very creative things with the players ability. Now I’ll go in depth with how the ability customization would work (this is just an example there a many different ways to make the ability system). First, you’d have a power like lightning, fire, ice, smoke, wind etc. You can then pick how you want the power to be manipulated and for the different powers there would be different ways to manipulate the power, they would be sorted into the different states of matter, the reason for having the abilities be sorted into different states of matter is because I wanted It to be somewhat realistic for example in real life you can't make a damage dealing sword out of smoke, another reason is the powers will have pre-determined attributes implemented so lightning travels really quickly by default and does a lot of damage, while smoke only makes it harder to see if the smoke is there, so if you were to make a sword out of smoke it wouldn’t do any damage by default. For this versions purposes it will be stamina, health, mana, cooldown seconds, that will be used to put limitations on the ability. So, you select the power wind which by default costs 1sec to use, you could instead make it cost 50 mana out of a mana pool of 1000 mana or make the wind power costs 50 health points out of a health pool of 1000. and then you select how you want the wind power to be manipulated, you get the options push the wind, pull the wind, tornado (basically any form that wind can take on Irl). So, you select tornado, a tornados attributes are that if it hits an enemy, the enemy will get stuck at the top of the tornado for as long as the tornado lasts, the tornado will last 1 sec by default and the tornado costs 3 seconds by default. Now you may have noticed we have only made a tornado but it wouldn’t move or has anything else on it, so, you can then pick if you want to shoot the tornado in the way you are aiming which would costs 1 sec more on the cooldown. You can pick if you want a new power to mix with the tornado let's say lighting, so now you have a lightning tornado that will move forward for 1 sec when you use it. So, you’d also be able to adjust the size of the tornado, it would have a default size which I think would be around the size of the character you are playing the bigger you make the higher the cool down. I would like to add that for simplicity's sake the bigger the ability becomes, the stronger it is, what I mean by the bigger it is the stronger it is, is, if you make the tornado bigger it will have a bigger radius for pulling things into the tornado itself. You could also adjust the time that the ability is out, for example each second you add to the length of the time that the ability is out the cooldown increases by 0.5 sec. Maybe you’d want the tornado to stay in place after the tornado has moved forward for a certain amount of time so you would also be able to edit that. I think I have made my point clear in terms of how the ability menu would work (in theory at least). So, what about a progression system, I have thought of two ways for a progression system, one is the higher level you get, the more mana, stamina and health you get, the cool downs would still be the same. The other option is the higher you level up, the lower the cool downs default cost is. I am also considering being able to use the environment to your advantage, but I can't think of a fun way gameplay wise where that would work, for example maybe you can pick golem in the ability menu editor and the only way to spawn a golem is if you have enough let’s say magma around you to create a golem, so, now you have a golem made out of magma, so the environment around could be used to create things but the restriction is that it would need a certain quantity of for example magma in the area to create the golem. Every time you enter a battle you wouldn’t be able to change the ability so, if you go up against a boss, you can't change the ability while on that boss, so even If you die you have to have the same ability until you beat the boss. So, I think that’s going to be it for this version on to the next one. \n\nPuzzel game version \- Basically for this version you would have to make abilities to beat the levels in the game. I’ll be honest I haven't given a lot of thought about how a game like this would work, but you would start with a power and then as you progress through the levels you get new powers after beating the previous level. The higher the level the more combinations and the more advanced the puzzle becomes. I put in this version of the game just to show how diverse this idea can be.    \n\n3d OpenWorld rpg version \- So, this version does take a lot of inspiration from Minecraft. You would start with nothing only a health, mana, and stamina bar. But the world itself would have a bit of a twist as the starting area would not be randomly generated so you would start on a huge island with a few kingdoms constantly at war which you can ally with, there is a lot more to this idea that I have thought out but I won't be mentioning it here because it would be too long of a post, but I'd be willing to explain this idea out in more detail if asked, I also, want to focus more on the game idea itself which is making your own ability. So, you start off with nothing and I'm not sure if I want the player to start of knowing how to use the mana system (I don’t think I have mentioned it but the mana system is what I have named the create your own ability system) or if the player does know the mana system but you don’t have access to a wide variety of powers or no power at all just only the mana system. For this version I need to explain some of the story I have written for the mana system, in short mana is life force, which means that mana can only be wielded by living beings, mana itself looks like some type of invisible energy, mana can only be used to mimic other forms of matter/energy in the universe, so you could copy fire, light etc. So, each kingdom would have powers that they specialize in, maybe there is a kingdom that specializes in lightning or another kingdom that specialize in wind etc. I know this is just straight up taken for avatar the last airbender but I'm not very original 😛. So, you as the player would gain different powers from each kingdom once you travel to them and learn from the people how to utilize each power. I was thinking about doing multiple endings for the 3d OpenWorld for example maybe you could restore peace to the kingdoms or make everyone your slave etc. But I won’t go into it more than what I already have done. Everything expect for the kingdoms would be fully destructible. Like I said in the beginning of the post I could go into it more but it would be too long of a post.  \n\n2d Platformer\- So, this is another idea I haven't given a lot of thought into, but I'm going to mention it because this is the easiest version to make, because you don’t have to think in 3 dimensions. The animations would be in pixel art so they would be easier to make then a 3d version. That is all I have to say about this version, but basically take the 3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version I wrote and just make that idea into 2d.  \n\nHunterxHunter version \- So, I think I have always wanted a hxh game ever since I first watched it in 2015 but I just didn’t have an interest in gamedev at the time. I haven't given this idea much thought because it would be really difficult to make unless you want to take some artistic liberties, so, for example the gameplay needs to feel good and I’m not sure how that would happen when abilities like Hisoka's bungee gum exist. I'm not going to go into it too much but I’m just not sure how to make a fun game using Nen unless you cut out a lot from the Nen system. I had a few ideas like maybe for the specialist class if you were to pick it then you would get a random unique ability that you couldn’t choose, which is why it would be a high risk selecting that class, I have more ideas I think but that’s all I feel like sharing.      \n\nFinal words \- personally I feel like the multiplayer game industry has gotten very stale, not sure if it always has been this way. To me games have started to feel very similar especially multiplayer games, or it's just the same problems I have with other games that reoccur in others. Personally, I want a game where creativity in combat is the larger focus and not a game where just being good at one thing like aiming makes it so you win and I hope that a game like this would be refreshing for the game industry. Finally, I have basically realized that my real-life problems make it so that I won’t really ever be able to make this game in the vision I want, I keep watching tutorials, then I stop and forget everything in an endless cycle so I don’t think I’ll ever be able to make this game sadly, but I keep dreaming about it. "
o1vg3e,Speed Racer,"Ok here me out, I just rewatched the movie Speed Racer after a very long time and I think it's an amazing movie, now I know it received a lot of bad rep and is considered a failure to some but even the idea is incredible.\n\nI had the idea of turning it into a game. Now I know there have been games but those a really old and honestly not what I'm aiming for. I'm looking at most of the movie elements, there's colossal tracks, secret(illegal too)weapons to modify vehicles and so much can go into customization of an iconic race car. I want to add these ALL OF IT. I imagine it could be a multiplayer and a really large game in terms of storage because of all the things I want incorporated. I thought it could have a tutorial on how to maneuver the car because I do want to see the exact thing we see in the movie or something close enough even just the feel.\n\nI could honestly ramble about this all day so for now I'll leave it hear. And I realized that most of this is all about the movie so it may not gain much popularity. It's just a thought anyway."
o1p0tf,Trapped in a game so glitchy the npcs become sentient,"The story would involve the hero being trapped inside a shitty game, like in avgn adventures, but the game was progra.med SO badly, that the game characters become sentient, and so some of them, like the friendly npcs, ask to join your party so they can escape the game with you, while the villians want to invade the real world, which they do in the final level. The gameplay itself involves abusing the glitches to your advantage, such as a noclip teleport, or messing up the graphics as a distraction. The ending will have the heroes realize they're still stuck in a game (the one being played), and then they bust out of the game window (or into the console menu), complete with a cartoony hole where they lept out of, and run off into the internet (or the digital store), and then if you have that save data, they show up in other games, living new lives travelling the multiverse."

That is when they find Earth, another planet with intelligent life and its own legal system, and quickly find you (yes, the lawyer from space is YOU!). They decide to abduct you to spearhead a new age of lawyers.\n\nAt first glance, it may sound like a space-themed Ace Attorney, but as a visitor to a whole different planet, you have to unravel a completely different society, with different cultures, customs, and of course, law. Inbetween your lawyering, you must understand how the wheels of their civilization works in order to reach that not guilty veredict. Can you get used to what is now considered legal or crime?

o1gwza,A co-op platformer but with a unique POV,"Basically your POV is of the character your partner controls and vice versa. except you control the camera. So you would need to describe how far to move and which ways and where jumps need to be done.\n\nThe game could start with your partner visible, so you are able to see what you are doing from a perspective (like a fixed camera-ish) and then slowly block vision of your partner/ character you control to solely rely on your partner to describe what to do."
o1ffff,"Game that's all Controls Tutorials, but it gets Weird","My game idea is one where the entire thing is a controls tutorial puzzle game.\n\nSo, the game will start by starting with WASD and Space Bar to complete a certain task.\n\nThen then it becomes DSAW and Space for the same task, or a different one it doesn't really matter. \n\nEventually, after some escalation, the tutorials become more like riddles or visual puzzles to figure out the controls.\n\nI'm also picturing a level where the mechanism that tells you the controls breaks for a level, so it's a matter of randomly clicking keyboard buttons till you find the keys. Or another level where the player actions change the controls mid level. Or maybe a level that's red light green light, but the player has to adapt to changing controls.\n\nNot sure how to end it, maybe a typing of the dead style boss fight using weird controls, I don't know. That's my idea, thank you!"
o1f80j,Multiplayer hitman,"I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants. \nIt only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target. \nVisuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP.\nAesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.   \nGameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky.\nIf topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept.\nEnd-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received.\nGame balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it.\nThanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it."

o1bi1q,A mertroidvania puzzle platformer on ice,"**Story:** you play as a character named swift, and swift's family all got sick with a rare and deadly disease. Swift was told by the town's priest that a cure can be made from a magical flower, this flower can only be found deep in a dungeon built into a large cave. The priest tried to warn swift of the dangers the dungeon held, but swift was determined and began gathering a few supplies. Before leaving, the priest gave swift a pair of enchanted boots that turned the ground he stepped on to ice. So with nothing but a few weapons and the ice boots, swift set out to claim this magical flower, but things aren't as they seem.\n\n**Gameplay:** a 2d pixel platformer with very little friction. You slide around a massive dungeon, discovering secrets, and defeating enemies. you can choose to wield 4 different weapons, and each have their own skill trees and attack patterns. The weapons are a sword, a battle axe, a bow, and a magic wand. Each weapon has a heavy attack and a light attack that will activate different moves depending on where and how your moving, similar to combat from brawlhala. There will be 4 main areas/levels to explore and find secrets in, these areas are the barracks, the dark dungeons, the enchanted tower, and the frozen garden. \n\nEach area has its own boss, and once you kill them you get their weapon which gives you a new ability. There will also be secret mini bosses that will upgrade your ice boots in different ways. You can slide, double jump, dash, and leap off walls. I also plan to add a PvP arena where you can battle other players.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to see in the game, or anything you would like to change?"
o19s51,Choice based game,"Its a 1v1 competitive game where both side choose between soldiers and then the fight happens automatically.\n\n\nEach player start with 100$ and secretly choose 1  soldier between 25 different soldier all displayed on screen. If both players choose the same soldier, that soldier is removed and another round of picking starts. If both players choose a different soldier, they both buy their choices, and a new round of picking happens. This goes on until both players can't buy a soldier anymore. There is no soldier limit per team.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers have 4 different attributes:\n\n\n* Price (5-30)\n\n\n* Speed (1-25) (each soldier has a different speed)\n\n\n* Hit Points (1-25)\n\n\n* Damage (1-10)\n\n\n\nThe game auto generate these soldiers, but obviously the AI tries to have a minimum of balance so players don't always make the same choices. For example, a slow cheap soldier with a lot of hit points would be too strong.\n\n\nOnce the picking is over, the battle starts. The first soldier to shoot is always the fastest one, and he always shoots the slowest enemy. Then the next fastest soldier shoots, and this goes on until the slowest alive soldier has shot. Then the process repeats until one side is decimated.\n\n\n\nThe winner wins elo points, and there would be match making to ensure fairness."

o15ksv,A puzzle game with a unique feature.,"""A puzzle game with a unique feature.""  \n\n\nThe main goal of the game is to escape an unknown dimension/world using combat and strategy. The setting would take place in a world similar to Monument Valley and gameplay-wise, it would be pretty basic. However, there would be the feature of shapeshifting/transformation.   \n\n\nBasically, players will have the ability to transform into a different creature/entity to assist you throughout the game, and ultimately, you **will** need them to overcome certain obstacles and complete the game. For example, you might need to jump over something that the main character can't. To resolve this, you could transform into the character that is capable of jumping over it. Each character would have a specific ability/task that it'd be used for (jumping, shrinking, pushing, etc.).   \n\n\nTo make this game more of a challenge, I was thinking maybe each level would be timed and there could also be a limit to how long you can stay transformed for every character. This would maximize players' ability to problem-solve and be quick at the same time.  \n\n\nAs for how you would get each character, I'm not too sure. I was maybe thinking there would be a combat system and to get a characters' soul, you'd have to kill them, but I don't know lol."
o13knq,A crypto currency game that can actually work.,"There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.\n\nThe core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.\n\nThen to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.\n\nYes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**\n\nBy using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.\n\nNow players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do the developers make money from this:\n\nBy selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.\n\nIn short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.\n\nThe developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash."

Still a mystery to me how MIB got their tech but i believe aliens gave it to them. Make money by selling patent of stuff like the microwave or what the mib does to gain money. \n\nIs this something that already exists? Or does this sound like a bad idea?
o10ec4,A Heist game about a small group of European criminals getting together to steal things,"There aren’t many heist games out their tbh and the heist games that are out their are kinda meh. Also i dont think there is a heist game with a story or at least i dont think so.\n\n\nFor the game I would imagine it to be a open world third person shooter with some fighting mechanics. I was thinking for the criminal group each would have a sort of role or specialty, Like one would be the brute who specializes in hand to hand combat and can take alot of hits, The Gadget guy who has the equipment needed to disable traps/ alarms and take out guards, and the leader who specializes with guns. \n\nFor the heist before you start them you would need to get the equipment or people needed for the heist which would be its own mission. Before the Heist starts you can select which plan you would want to.For the heist itself i would imagine your actions can effect the outcome of the heist alot. For example using guns or being loud will bring the police to your location alot earlier which would make the getaway driver unavailable which would force you to take a different escape route. There would also be a variety of heists like having to protect a safecracker so they can open the vault, having people held hostage to get what you need etc. As the game goes on each heist will get bigger and more difficult. I would also imagine there to be side missions like maybe stealing things at a much smaller scale,being blackmailed by corrupt government members to do some jobs for them etc\n\n\nFeel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments below"

o0wyvc,3 player Beatboxing competition game,"Not going to lie I had this idea while playing Friday night funkin.\n\nTwo players face off in a beatboxing competition while the third player spectates and judges who wins each round of Beatboxing\n\nFor the control scheme I'm imagining a standard duelshock/sense for this.\nEvery button does a different beatbox noise while the analog sticks change the pitch and speed of the noise,while the touchpad is used to make scratching noises\n\nBoth player gets the same predetermined amount of time to perform their beatbox before it switches to the next player having a total of 2 turns each before the judging starts. At the end of that a winner is chosen for the round and they win a point, best two out of three wins.\n\nThere's no predetermined charts to compete against, neither is there a score system, the winner is determined purely by who the third player spectator thinks wins.\n\nThe third player is also in charge of the background setting of the match as well as the backing music track, meaning players will have to improvise their beats more often.\n\nIn the menu, players can choose their sounds to allocate to each button from a library of pre-made beatboxing sounds as a kind of loadout to keep every player sort of unique.\n\n you can practice your beats in a practice room attached to the ""beat loadout"" menu.\n\n you can customize your character with outfits and bling you win from matches( given randomly but never repeating after a win) from a custom character screen."

o0sog5,Need some feedback on the game concept,"Hello everybody!\n\nMy name is Alexey. I am a beginner game designer (currently just taking courses). I am from Russia, specifically from Siberia. I would like to present you with a concept description of my game and get feedback. I apologize in advance for any possible incorrect translation. My English is not very good ... (all complaints to google translate J)\n\n**Game description:** The action takes place in the future. The scene is a town littered with trash up to the rooftops. The main character is a small robot that can perform only the simplest actions. A great feature of this robot is that it can think. The robot develops, recycles garbage into resources, discovers new technologies for garbage recycling, improves them ... The main goal of the game is to return the town to its original form.\n\n**Genre:** Life simulator with elements of crafting, construction, RPG.\n\n**Technical implementation:** 2D graphics like in Stardew Valley and Graveyard Keeper\n\n**Topic:** Confronting chaos. Transforming the game world from disgusting to beautiful.\n\n**Setting problem:** The world is a dump. To transform this world requires resources and technologies that are not available at the start of the game.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n* Garbage|resource - The main element of the game. What is garbage can now be converted into a resource using technology.\n* Technology - needed to build new installations and more efficiently converting waste into resources.\n* Space - At the start of the game, there is not enough space to build basic installations. To start efficiently recycling waste, you first need to build which of the basic installations is better to build (a crusher or a warehouse of that type of waste or a press installation ...)\n* NPC Community - There are still residents (NPCs) in the city who have already forgotten that their city was once a beautiful and comfortable place to live. The robot's job is to bring them back to normal.\n\n**Possibilities of the main character:**\n\n* Perform the simplest work of collecting and sorting garbage;\n* The ability to improve;\n* Ability to build facilities for sorting and recycling waste;\n* Ability to develop technologies\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThe player will control a small robot to transform the game world. In order to do this, it is necessary to find the appropriate technologies that are scattered throughout all locations. Accordingly, it will be necessary to penetrate into abandoned and littered buildings, investigate them, find samples of equipment.\n\nThe development of technologies will increase the depth of processing waste into resources:\n\n* Level 1: Scrap Metal - Pressed Scrap\n* Level 2: Scrap Metal - Iron Ingot\n* Level 3: Iron Ingot - Steel Ingot\n* Level 4: Steel Ingot - Steel Beam\n* ...\n\nInteraction with NPCs is also an important aspect of the game. First, NPCs give simple tasks to the hero, for example, bring 10 iron ingots. As the character and technologies develop, NPCs begin to give more difficult tasks, for example, free this building from garbage and bring resources, then this NPC will take this building and open a shop for something there.\n\nThe game ends when the last NPC finds a home and acquires a profession.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Stardew Valley - character management, crafting and inventory system, building system, principles of building the game world\n* Graveyard Keeper - Character Control, Graphic Style\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment I can not provide screenshots or a video, because the idea is still in its infancy and my skills are still not enough to create a prototype of the game. Therefore, I tried to make a clear text description and at the same time not make it too long.\n\n**Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!**"

o0ltb0,"Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android","Hi guys, \n\nI would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing. \n\nIt is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it. \n\nGameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.\n\nThere are certain requirements to build units. \n\n1.	Mine – free\n\n2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal\n\n3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal\n\n4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood\n\n5.	Air units – 3x food + metal"

Math and Science allow them to improve their province's infrastructure.\n\nGiving the kids military training may help them with conquest - both of other nations and over each other. You could forgo military training to hopefully build a more peaceful state but that might backfire if you get invaded by neighbors.\n\nMaybe give the kids a few semesters of swordsmanship so that they don't get killed in a duel. Or omit that from somebody you don't like so that a more promising younger sibling can usurp them.\n\nTeach them statecraft so they can better manage political matters.\n\nHave somebody that's a bit of a punk?

o0k91y,An evolution game based on skillpoints,"Sort of like irl millions of years ago where different abilities/skills got you somewhere different. Every 10-50 skill points used, your ""build"" could become available for others to start as. for example, a dude has put all his points to defence and his/her ""build"" has gained either hard skin or a shell, after reaching the 10-50 points used, people could have the option to choose the ""build"" and sort of become that species. and either continue the same strategy or deviate from the strategy and swap or put some points to the offense for example. skills could be for example: intelligence, eyesight, offense, defence, mobility and stealth.\n\nI don't know if this is in any way possible because I'm no game dev and don't know how ridiculously hard this would be or if even possible, but I got this idea in my head from TierZoo (a content creator on YouTube) and the ""Ancestors:humankind odyssey"" game (I don't think this would be a copy since that game focuses on only human evolution)"

the apocalypse. the players characters will turn into the zombies you are fighting creating more zombies to fight and the zombies you are killing are real player models. each server should be at different stages so players wanting to start fresh can and those who want the zombie aspect can run that.  \n\n\n**Life:** during the life sim part you can respawn and do what most life sims do. buy a house, car food and water. build a bunker in your back yard if you like. do whatever you feel you want to do. if you want to get ready for the apocalypse why not but the limiting factor should be funds. stockpiling guns and ammunition why not but people need to keep working to earn money and should be punished by not working. if someone wants go full bush and and live in a little wooden house let them but unless they steal they shouldn't be able to get mid to top end weapons.  \n\n\nIn the life stage of the game people should be allowed to respawn as much as they would like. when i say respawn though i mean end up in hospital regardless of the sort of injury to allow people to keep moving forward but it will cost them $x to be treated. if they cant afford to pay for the medical attention they have to respawn as a new character. maybe as a relative who inherits their stuff but new stats etc.  \n\n\n**Jobs:** most real life jobs should be in the game to some extent from manufacturing which give better crafting stats, paramedic which gives better healing stats all the way through to hobo. each job being worked will give stats towards the accompanying occupation. there should be benefits towards every occupation including hobo that will help during the outbreak. people should also be able to attend classes to level up certain stats as well but of course that costs money but could also lead them into making more money such as a manufacturer can create better items causing more income etc.  \n\n\ndepending on player numbers there should also be npc's that act as bosses or key characters in the game. medics should have to go out to where things have gone wrong such as car accident or robbery gone wrong. if someone commits a crime they will be reported but there needs to be some sort of system in place that can help the criminal get away with the crime if they do it well. if they manage to rob a bank and not reveal their identity they should be allowed to get away with it. when they are reported either by a player or spotted through cameras etc they should be sent through to the police who will be notified of the persons name and added to an most wanted list and essentially have bounties on them. the bigger the price of the bounty the more people can join in.  \n**Outbreak:** The zombies should be rather menacing when the outbreak starts. think war z when they're in New York in rush hour traffic. it could hit at any time and the players shouldn't really have an idea of when unless they work in certain divisions of military. at most they should have 10 minutes in the cities as the outbreak occurs which can be heard through normal means like radio tv etc. at this point people should be allowed to raid shops without joining a bounty list and money doesn't become a necessity at all. people can raid and loot whatever they want but the hordes of people should be pushing from inside the cities forcing people to run or bunker down wherever they are.  \n\n\nonce the outbreak starts people can no longer respawn into the current game. if they die to anything other than a zombie a medic with a high enough stat can bring them back within a short period of time but headshots are instant death with no respawn. a spectator mode should be allowed but players should be allowed to turn spectating on them off so that would prevent ghosting. to spectate a player you need to type their name in so as to prevent ghosting.  \n\n\nIf this gets too much backlash a party system with so many extra lives could be given to simulate people coming together as a group and play as a npc such as a family member etc who escaped with them. these extra lives could be given to people as they rescue npc's from situations but of course they would have all new stats and attributes.  \n\n\n**Post outbreak:** at this stage people should be dying off but i would love to see what people do at this stage. with the ability to fortify and build a compound to defend using vehicles etc and try recreate some sort of society or turn into nomads running from place to place. really this point is about thinning out the last of survivors to start the cycle over again. im eager to hear peoples suggestions on this as to how this should end. i feel like a forced ending like nuclear explosion would ruin this part but holding off until the last person is dead also feels like a bit of a buzzkill too. i feel like once the last group has had its last member die after no more respawns available should be the end of the game.   \n\n\n**World:** the world should be relatively large. I'm picturing semi instanced regions where there is a city in one or 2 regions that leads into towns and forests. as a regions zombie % goes up it starts to trickle into the other regions. as the world goes on wandering zombie hordes should start to travel around. these hordes should be able to be messed with by flares and explosions or loud noises in general. if a horde is wandering nearby a place players should be able to set off fireworks to redirect the movement of the horde towards the noise. church bells cars anything major like that should allow players to plan some sort of defence or offense using the zombies as tools.  \n\n\n**Other disasters:** As the game is updated later on other disasters could happen such as military takeover or natural disaster and the server rolls a dice to see which disaster it gets. this would keep players on their toes and tuned into the radio in game or watching the news for the latest happenings.\n\nsorry for the long post. I've really been wanting to see a zombie sandbox where players are in the thick of the initial outbreak. In a story driven game its always planned out and I've never really been able to enjoy the escape that much. although I did love how the last of us did their escape sequence but after the first couple of times you know what's going to happen when and it loses that something special. Please leave any other ideas or suggestions in the comments and I really hope an amazing dev picks it up.   \n\n\nIf you do make the game from my idea **please shoot me some credit** through some fun way in game e.g. browsing reddit in game on a laptop or on a billboard. some fun little easter egg. also feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like more ideas i've got more to this idea but the post is already long enough."
o04niv,A sports series that gives you compete control,Im thinking about making a sports game that gives you compete control of your everyday life from buying cars and houses to getting to your event on time but the game will have players starting off in high school and depending on what version you pick up would determine what sports that would be open for you but you would be able to associate with all players through out the game
o032mc,"Trying to create a unique MOBA, Part 2","Thanks to the few people who replied to my first post, here are some changes I think would make it better. \n\n First, I think we could have both of the old ideas in the game, and just make them separate modes . For changes to the first idea we simply move it away from being a team deathmatch and back to more of a MOBA, as I originally intended. We do this by making the goal of the game anything else besides killing enemy players; although it could work as a team deathmatch its just that I dont want to copy battlerite. I want to still make the goal something more unique than just destroying the enemies base, but I feel like a fast paced 4v4 two lane MOBA where you make your own custom hero is unique enough. Generally, I want this mode to still be mainly PvP focused.\n\n For the second idea I came up with a two ways to change it. Firstly it could entirely be a co-op PvE mode where you and your team of 4 get a certain amount of time to farm before a giant boss shows up that you have to kill. Second we could make it a PvEPvP, you on a team of 4 against another team of 4, both teams have to compete over minions and jungle camps. After a certain amount of time a boss shows up, Instead of killing the boss the team that deals the most damage to the boss by the end wins the game."
o02alz,Here is my idea of a dungeon crawler type game that I am most likely gonna make,"My ideas I have come up with so far are:\n\n* Enter dungeon, possibly fight monsters or be stealthy, loot, leave\n* Sell loot for gold coins which then you can use to buy upgrades and equipment\n* Obviously different loot items would be worth different amounts but item could also be worth more or less based off its condition, like damaged or pristine\n* Some upgrades could be Strength, Stealth, speed, HP, and luck\n* And finally it would probably be top down 2D\n\nPlease comment any other ideas you might have."
nzyivn,Tree simulator,"Control the growth of a tree from seedling to mighty oak (or other kind of tree). Decide where to grow branches, roots, leaves and fruits/seeds/flowers. The game has an above ground and below ground view. The gameplay is very chill/relaxing. Each season takes about 2 minutes. Challenges include expanding the root system to find new nutrients, competition from other plants, infestation with bugs or disease, etc. You can deal with some problems by killing off a bit of the trunk or branches and cauterizing with bark. Players could sort of prune or grow their tree strategically for artistic purposes (like a bonsai tree).\n\nCould be 2d or 3d."
nzwku4,"Silent Hill 1/ResiEvil 3 controls, Dark fantasy rpg elements (like Dark Souls) and a ""stance"" system like Bushido Blade type game","Title sounds convoluted but lemme explain.\n\nIn this game you would have the tank controls like Silent Hill 1, with a 3rd pov camera (exception being areas where a fixed camera would work). You utilize a stamina bar for every time you run, attack, dodge, and block you do.\n \n\n- You have 3 stats you level up throughout the game: Endurance (health) Attack Power (how strong your attacks are) and Agility (how much stamina you have). Theres 4 starter classes each with different amount of points put into all 3 (all starting at lvl 15). \n\n\n - Combat in this game is like Resident Evil 3/Silent Hill 1 melee attacking (however when you are in you attack mode you can still walk backwards slowly, so you arent stuck in place. Your attacks stagger more often and are quickerm to make up for the tank controls.)\n\n\n- Doing a jumping back dodge is an option too, which makes you invincible during the entire animation, but takes all your stamina, meaning you cant immediately attack. Guarding attacks is done automatically when you have the ""attack stance"" button held down (by attack stance I mean like in ResEvil you stand in place pointing your weapon). Guarding an attack will only take part of your stamina but will do less damage to you, making it so you can attack afterwards.\n\n\n - You have 2 stances for each weapon, a medium and a high (kinda like in Bushido Blade). Some enemies will also utilize stances and guarding. These enemies require that you guard whichever area attack they use on you, and attack the area they arent guarding. (Example: you see a bloodied knight raise his sword in the air signaling a high attack, so you switch to the high guard. It successfully blocks, taking stamina and a little health. He then goes into high guard, so you change back to medium and successfully hit him)\n\n\n - A few enemies will be crawling on the floor or ceiling, which means you must face upwards/downward to attack them. The up and down stance are their own stance, and doesnt hit a normal ""in front of you"" enemy. Some enemies, while not utlizing stance themselves, will have areas of their body defended permanently so you can only use one stance attack against them (for example, some kinda of demon whose legs and torso are stone, so only high attacks damage them.)\n \n\n- Multiple weapons can be found throughout the world (axes swords, bladed batons, daggers, halberds, spears, even ranged weapons like bows and thrown items) along with armor sets. Each starter class has a unique set of armor they start with that only they can use, but these armors all have the same stats. Armor is mostly cosmetic but each have some kind of upgrade, usually a +(#) boost to health or endurance.\n \n\nI have a whole lot of other things written down but I dont wanna over do it more than I already have in this post. Id love to see this game made someday. If anyone has criticism, questions, or wants to hear any more ideas for this (concepts, enemy/level designs, boss designs, lore things) id love to hear it. Thanks for reading."

nzmwfx,Second person storytelling," I need your feedback with our game project. Me and my team are building this adventure-roleplaying game in a dieselpunk world mixed with art deco aesthetics.  It’s still in the early stages of development.   \n \n\nOur main gameplay twist is that the game is second person storytelling ™. For us second person storytelling ™ can be described that you are playing as Watson in Scherlock Holmes stories, or Alfred in Batman story. This means that you play as support type side character, in a story revolving a hero that is larger than life. Translated in to gameplay this means that most of the decisions are made by the hero, and you cannot directly harm enemies, you just have to make hero survive by e.g. using smoke grenades or gadgets that fit the dieselpunk theme.\n\nThoughts?"
nzkb6s,a new thief game,"This is 3rd person rpg game . A reboot to the old thief series\n\nThe game takes place in medieval times and like the old thief games it has a little magic but its not full blown fantasy game\n\nstory\n\nThe game starts with a cutscene where you are a kid thats helping ur parents working in the garden feeding animals and stuff and a group of soldiers come to collect taxes from the kingdom . You parents dont have enough so they want to have sex with your sister and they wont take everything you have . The father says no and they try to take her by force , your father tries to fight them but he gets killed , your mother tells you to start running in the forest she gets killed aswell and your sister was caught raped and killed too \n\nyou return to the house when the night comes only to find you family's heads on spikes and house burned down . You go to the city and start begging for food when someone from the Thiefs guild finds you and recruits you . You play 1 or 2 missions as a child then you grow up . In one of ur mission as a adult you go to rob a house of one of the king's guard and as he sleeps you recognize him as the one that came for the taxes and killed your family . Here you have a choice  (1) either do your job and get out or (2) brake the rules and kill him\n\nIf you chose number 1. you kill continue to do missions for the thiefs guild , and eventualy become the guild leader, you will be able to decide what kind of jobs you can give to other and the main story will revolve around the war between the thiefs guild and the kingdom trying to save the poor and eventualy bring down the king \n\nif you chose number 2. the thiefs guild will abandon you for breaking one of the most important rules ( never kill your target ) and you will do missions that you can find around the city from tavern or just hearing people talk , the main story will revolve around a conspiracy that a group of necromancers will try to bring down the kingdom from within and make everyone slaves of the ancient evil religion\n\nThere will be other important decisions to be made and you can choose a side and be good or evil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\nMost important is that you can enter every building , every window every door can be broken or lockpicked as long as your skill will be high enough\n\nalot of parkour , climbing will be very important \n\nthe classic rope arrow , water arrow \n\njust like in the previouse game you can choose to fight with a sword but you wont be very good because of your skinny constitution , if you try to fight 2 people at once ur dead 100%\n\nchoice will have a great impact , everything will change around you as you make the decissions for example house from rich people can become empy if you rob all their money and you can see them on the streets poor \n\nYou walk around the town without a mask in places like taverns and look for missions , normal mission that will help you improve your skills will be in normal places like taverns and brothels and main story missions you will either get them by raven at ur house or by npcs in a underground world in the sewers"
nzk4nt,"Drag to Hell, a zombie survival shooter with Drag Queens.","Picture it, horrifying zombie outbreak. People dismembered and devoured only to rise up and join the undead crowd. Fires and explosions everywhere, but there’s only one thing standing against the hordes of undead tonight. Four fabulously dressed divas with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGuns, glamour and guts galore. Want to take it close range with the deadites with a manniquin leg, wig head or a brick filled purse? Go right at it! Prefer a glue gun turned pistol or a confetti cannon full of shrapnel and glitter? Show these corpses how it’s done.\n\nDrag to Hell? Drag fights back.\n\nMy idea is a campy version of Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood with the comedy of Lollipop Chainsaw and a million and one gay podcasts, youtube channels and drag shows combined. You could pick from different classes of queens from snarky hard hitting queens with melee weapons, to sweet healers or even someone throwing shade from a distance with a rifle. Light that fire with a mech queen using a flamethrower to melt face off all these ugly undead.\n\nWhile i know it’s probably somewhat offensive, after watching shows like Unhhhh and Dragula, i’d kill for just some kind of a funny, gorey, glamorous zombie game thats all shades of colors and comedy. I’d gladly pay for an Triple A title like this, even double A. I’m just putting the idea out there to hopefully stir someones interest.\n\nPlease, tell me what you think!"
nzis2a,// [PvP] Gameplay Concept - Keep moving to stay alive,"The idea is pretty straight forward as the title suggests: In order **to stay alive**, the player needs to be **constantly moving**. Staying still drains health.\n\nI've found one party game that utilizes this gameplay, called [Move or Die](http://www.moveordiegame.com/) *(who would've guessed)*\n\nBut I haven't come across any other games yet, having this as a primary feature, especially in higher productions. More specifically I'd like to see this implemented in a competitive PvP environment, like First-/Third-Person Shooters.\n\n**My Game Idea:**  \n\[Intermediate-AAA\]  \nCompetitive PvP FPS (2v2, 5v5 etc.)  \nPlayers control humanoid robots running on batteries.  \nThese batteries recharge (or stay charged) as long as the Player moves (walking, running).  \n**Edit:** Movement counting towards recharging must be significant (travel distance), not AD strafe spamming. (u/Paradox\_Synergy thx for heads up)  \nAs soon as the Player stands still (or moves on spot), the battery starts depleting (fast).  \nMaybe even emitts a distinctive beeping sound for others to hear.\n\nThis should prevent exploitations/annoyances like camping or AFK and encourage a fast-paced playstyle. It would also mean, that there's no *typical Sniper class*, since it wouldn't make much sense.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be interested in such a game?\n\nAny ideas or recommendations for improvement, expansion, similar games or else highly welcome!\n\nAlso, if you do decide to utilize this feature in your own games, please be sure to reach out to me. I'd love to see and try your takes on it! :D   \nI'm available on all significant social platforms (except Facebook) under u/domfiglhuber"

nzczp6,An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines.,"Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.\n\nThe life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.\n\nThen you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.\n\nSo for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features. \n\nAnd with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.\n\nAnd you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.\n\nI've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!"
nzcma7,Asynchronous single-player campaign missions played within large multiplayer matches. We can make it work.,"When I learned *Battlefield 2042* will not have a single-player campaign, I wondered if one could be added later-on by letting one person play a scripted single-player mission within the active battlefield of a live match. You know how some FPS single-player missions take place within a chaotic, active war? What if we do that, but the war is other actual players having a large-scale match.\n\nWith some tweaks, I think it can work. This is how:\n\n1. **The multiplayer mode is free-to-play while the single-player campaign is not (like Halo Infinite will be).** Even though the number of players in multiplayer usually far outnumber those playing single-player, this model will ensure there are more multiplayer users than single-player users.\n\n2. **The story involves a country using the war as cover for some secret plan.** In other words, your teammates aren't helping you with your mission because they don't even know about it. It's just you.\n\n3. **The missions are short enough that they can be completed within the length of a single ground war multiplayer match.** For reasons I'll get into later, the locations of your objectives are different every match. You'll have to get from point A to point B without dying, which can be difficult in the middle of a ""real war"" so it's important the missions are short enough to retry in a new lobby.\n\n4. **The large multiplayer maps have several doors and buildings that players regularly can't enter, except for the one person playing the campaign mode.** Any scripted cutscenes or events that should not be interrupted would happen there. You might enter one buildings, move through some vague underground system, and emerge from another player-only building for your next objective.\n\n5. **Dynamic story events would happen outside in the chaotic battlefield.** Sometimes the next objective isn't to get to another secure building. Sometimes the objective is outside ""in the shit"" so to speak, such as having to kill a villain that's escaping in a vehicle. Or you might have to trigger a dynamic map event like collapsing a building or destroying a dam. In situations like this, your teammates might make things easier or the enemy team might make it harder. But that's war. Someone on your team might unknowingly kill your target for you to complete your objective.\n\n6. **Missions are dynamic using some smart system to keep it as fair as possible.** If players guess who is the campaign player, some of them might troll the player. So the locations of story events, as well as the paths that NPC targets might take outside, are dynamically scripted to avoid (or sometimes approach) where the action is heaviest. Moreover, when the objective is to trigger a dynamic map event (collapse building, destroy dam, etc.) the smart system would have to pick one that hasn't been done on the map yet.\n\nLastly, the whole thing can be asynchronous as it needs to be. If the game needs to make you invisible to players and them invisible to you, while spawning AI enemies only for you, it can.\n\n****\nIt could be fun. It'll make replaying missions new experiences every time. It could lead to some crazy, by-the-skin-of-your-teeth missions for people to share replays of. And most importantly, as the developer you get to repurpose all the maps and assets that already exist for multiplayer instead of making those expensive single-player campaigns. Even AAA budgets can't keep up with those costs."
nzbwnw,Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights),"First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.""\n\nThe game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.\n\nI am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game."

nz7jlh,"In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first","Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this. \n\nI had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.\n\nI can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.\n\nSo the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters\n\nOr I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.\n\nWhich seems like a better option?"
nz704x,Missed a major core aspect of my rhythm game idea for some reason. Gameplay.. hElp,"I was gonna make a pretty big post here, but I realised that the gameplay makes very little to no sense.\n\nIn the most basic of basics layman's term, you create a beat (made out of meters). Then the opponent would play it and they would give their own afterwards, but then I thought ""How the hell is that even gonna work?"". I originally thought you could just make it before joining a round, but that would end up making it sound terrible. \n\nMaybe you could make the beat during the game, but I don't know how you would make the ""beat"" in the first place. I also don't think that wouldn't sound very good.\n\nThere's one feature I wrote of which I have no idea what it means. But it has something to do with ""snappers"" which are rectangles that connect from right to left. I'm not sure if that was about the beat, or an setup thing. It was based off of a device that would snap to another thing and added a feature.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nISTG my brain works on a whole new different wavelength. It's fine if you understand nothing about what I said."
nz561r,The Harlequin: A clown superhero game where you’re the opposite of the Joker,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nIn this game, you play the role of the harlequin, which is similar to a clown.  You fight crime, help people in need, and carry out covert international missions in service to the free world.  Your skill set is similar to that of the harlequin in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin\_(3.5e\_Class)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin_(3.5e_Class))\n\nStory: You grew up in a circus family.  Your dad was a lion tamer, and your mom was a trapeze artist. You and your siblings worked in the circus starting at a young age while being homeschooled (despite the fact that “home” was constantly changing from one location to another). Both of your parents were upset when you decided to be a clown, since they wanted you to have a managerial role in running the circus.  Your happy albeit hectic childhood was cut short when the FBI came in one day and started arresting the higher ups running the circus. Apparently, they were involved in organized crime, and were using the circus to launder money for criminal organizations.  The circus went out of business. Your dad ended up working as a dog walker, and your mom worked at a day care center handling games and activities.  Meanwhile, you continue to learn how to be a clown to help support your family, and when you’re 14, you meet a clown from Italy that teaches you the way of the harlequin. This is a form of combat that combines clowning with speed, martial arts, and combat tactics. Imagine James Bond, Jackie Chan and Jester the Clown fused into one. That’s you.  When you reach adulthood, you begin your life as a harlequin, committed to fighting crime, helping those in need, and protecting the free world from terrorists and tyrants.\n\nAt the start of the game, the intro and background story play. Next, you create your character, choose your gender and physical appearance.  You need to manage your career and your life as well. You can choose missions to earn money and gain experience.  Money is needed not only for better gear, but also for paying bills and other living expenses.\n\n* There are idle missions that involve actual clown jobs, such as birthday parties, where you dress up, leave your home to go do the job, and return home when the job is complete. These missions are a good way to earn money earlier in the game.\n* Crime fighting missions involve hunting down criminals and infiltrating criminal organizations, and you are paid by the police and the FBI to complete these jobs.\n* Treasure hunting missions involve more complex adventures, and the pay offs can be substantial.  You can earn valuable artifacts, better gear, and treasure to be sold.\n* International missions will take you all over the world. You’ll be fighting against terrorist organizations, mafias, drug cartels, dictators, human traffickers and warlords. Governments of different nations pay you for these missions.\n\nWith more money, you can buy nicer homes. You start in an apartment, but late in the game you might have an expansive lair.  The interior of all your homes will be carnival-themed.  You can even have romantic relationships with different people that you meet, get married, and have a family.  This is an action rpg.  As you defeat enemies, you gain experience, go up in levels, gain hit points, master new skills and launch deadlier attacks.  The Harlequin skills are more gear-based than magic-based, so in this regard the game differs from D&amp;D, although the skills should be similar.  Attacks include acrobatic martial-arts moves, as well as using light weight weapons and firearms."

nz3p9w,An MMORPG set in a 1-1 scale of Ireland,"Why Ireland? Its not as big as Great Britain, so much more feasible. Madagascar, Taiwan, and Hokkaido are good candidates, too. \n\nStructures? Literally everything should be player made. Very few to no pre-built or procedurly generated structures. \n\nNPCs? Viking and Roman traders that will wander the island and fight each other if they see each other. Also animals\n\nServers? Preferably one huge server, but it would likely need loads of servers if the playerbase gets huge. \n\nQuests/missions? Just a tutorial and starting missions. \n\nWhy this? I'd be one of the most ambitious games ever made, why not this?"

nyzqkg,Trying to create a unique MOBA,"I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.\n\n**A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.\n\n**The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG."

The final part would be an html5 game recreating a boss fight in the game, against the legal ninjas. Winning gets you a download link to mod files that restore the characters to normal, and the dialogue changing to reflect that."

np6kof,A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game,"Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?\n\nWell, I have an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.\n\nThe **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.\n\nThe **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:\n\n1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.\n\n2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.\n\n3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)\n\n4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.\n\nThe technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.\n\nThe **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role. \n\n1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.\n\n2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain ""Injuries"". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.\n\n3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.\n\n4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get ""Angry"" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time. \n\n5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.\n\n6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.\n\nThe **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.\n\n1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.\n\n2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time."

The games is to be played using an entire building: The bigger the better. \n\nBefore the game, one person is selected to be the guard. Everyone else will be a thief.\n\nThe players select one of the building's rooms to be the thieves' Lair, and one of the rooms to be the Safe. Now the thieves each put a personal belonging in the safe, and escapes to the Lair. The game can now begin.\n\nThe thieves now attempt to steal their belongings back from the Safe and return to the Lair. If the guard sees AND catches a thief, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when every thief has either been caught, or succeeded with their Heist. Whichever thief escaped first becomes the new guard. \n\n**Miscellaneous Rules:**\n• The guard(s) cannot simply patrol the Safe or the Lair; they must walk around the building.\n• The thieves may partner/group up, but groups win &amp; lose together. If even one group member gets caught, the entire group loses.\n• Depending on the size of the playing area/desired difficulty, more than one guard can be selected.\n• Both guards and thieves are allowed to use any tools they have/find to their advantage: Just don't destroy the building.\n• Players are encouraged to set traps, cause distractions, and everything else, as long as no one gets hurt.\n\n(Posting this on mobile: I'll come back later to format it better)"

Once they discover this ability, they start quietly debating what to do because of the political disaster that would occur on Earth, and you'd run away because they might do you in themselves.\n\nAfter some more cutscenes and plot events, you're given the choice of Autobot or Decepticon: The former recognizes you as cybertronian and wants to help and guide you into properly using those powers, while the latter sees you as a very useful and powerful asset that could turn the war in their favor."
non82v,Need Ideas for a MetroidVania style game.,
nomk45,An architecture-based fighting game.,"You've heard of ""Hostile architecture"", now apply that to an FPS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially, it would be a 1v1 where both players design a building and then fight on it.\n\nA ""setup"" and then ""action"" phase, if you will. Setup is while you are in a sims-like UI designing and action is an FPS where both players fight to the death - one player starting in the building ""defending"" and the other starting in a parking lot outside ""attacking"". Similar to Siege.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn setup, there are no real ""kill"" structures or infrastructure you can really use. No turrets, spikes, etc. Rely on your weapons to kill the enemy.\n\nHowever, building does come into play for a large degree. Naturally, the attacker is **MUCH** stronger as they gain some extra armor and know the layout of your map. You *NEED* to rely on quirks of your building for strategic planning.\n\nThe enemy has 12 hours in game (4 minutes irl) to enter. This is *important*.\n\nFor example, simple infrastructure you can build is counters which can only be vaulted over for dangerous chokepoints or shelves that you can hide behind or underneath.\n\nFor much more advanced play, you can curve windows to reflect light onto certain sides of your building to blind enemies during certain hours of the day (determined by the angle of the window and the in-game hour.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd since this is based on fighting games, there are a few playstyles you can make through itemized kits via customized action-phase items.\n\n""Rushdown"" players will have quick mobility-items and can surpass smaller obstacles such as shelves and desks, but are pretty bad against long-ranged control plays such as turning corners in longer corridors.\n\n""Zoners"" pressure opponents from distance with many slow-moving projectiles or long-distance rifles, but aren't great against more congested areas with more hiding spots.\n\n""Grapplers"" don't exist, as this is an FPS. However, you *can* play a ""Brawler"", a playstyle designed more on melee-range weapons so you can take full advantage of crowded hiding spots.\n\n""Jacks"" are just Jack-Of-All-Trades. A default playstyle that is a mix of any number of weapons and items.\n\nReminder that *both* sides have their buildings used in alternating attacker-defender statuses, and *both* can use any of the playstyles. You could be defending but be the first one to leave the building as you do better in the open. You could be attacking but instead play patiently near windows as you have a sniper rifle. Choice is yours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main part of this game comes from the architecture, as I'll state again. Since the attacker is always stronger - you need to use tactics such as making areas impossible to retreat from with many obstacles, using multiple corridors to flank your opponent, and having certain exit-zones if you lose too much territory and need to go outside.\n\nEssentially: You are playing a mini-scale strategy game disguised as an FPS. \n\nThe mechanics would be a nightmare to program as you have to essentially make 2 games. Would not recommend unless you have *moderately good* knowledge on how sims games work and how FPS games work."

nog1tn,Dig Dug 99,"Because Tetris 99 is a smash hit, and PAC-MAN 99 released a month ago, I think its only fair for the other Namco franchise to get a game like that. Dig Dug is horribly underrated. 99 players, and each Pooka and Fygar they pop goes to a random player. The map is the same as the original Dig Dug level. Rocks will appear randomly, and veteran Dig Dug players like myself know that digging under it causes it to fall. You can crush multiple Pookas and Fygars at once. Those can be sent to another player. You can also accidentally crush yourself if you're not careful. I think this would be a great battle royale game."

The name is self explanatory, but like ya’ know, laser tag with different classes to play as. For example, a tank would have a really big spot where they can get hit and a heavy gun, but also high damage, and probably longer and wider range. A speed type class would probably have a really small hit box and a light vest, and a small gun with a lot of ammo. Healers could probably be a thing, but I know no one would want to play as a healer probably. Heck, there could even be voice lines that play through speakers on the vest."

no4vrx,Open World Conquer Game,"     Alright so to start out with the game would be set back in time, and the point of the game would to be to conquer other land areas or tribes and gain alliances through trade and other things. Another thing that would be cool would be like having your warriors or troops fight like old notorious armies, such as the Romans, Spartans, Vikings, Samurais, etc. One example might be like starting off as a loner, kind of like Ark Survival, and finding resources and people to form alliances. Then your character could face challenges like random tribes trying to attack and you just have to defend yourself until you become the “bigger dog” and can defeat them and make them pledge their allegiance to you. \n     Eventually though, you would gather up enough people and you could storm into battle and conquer different land areas, and different troops or tribes. It would be an open world game kind of like Ark, and have a relatively large map. I know this might not be the place for those specifications, or there might be a game out there like this but if there isn’t I would like to hear feedback or if anyone would want to take a jab at the game."

nny1h3,Multi-player COOP WW2 Bomber crew,"Relatively simple concept that I don't think has been done.\nYou just pick whatever role you would like to play \n(Pilot, Gunner, Bombardier, Radioman, Navigator, etc) and work with your crew to run sorties in WW2. \nRunning missions in certain billets will increase said skill. Skill level will determine what types of bombers you can operate in. \nI like the idea of keeping it bomber specific and PVE only as it lowers the stress on overall game mechanics and allows more emphasis to be put on the bombrs and crews. \nEventually it would be even better to be able to run multiple bombers on one sortie, and the only way *in game to communicate with the other planes would be through the Radioman.\nThink Cold Waters meets Barotrama in First Person in a bomber."
nnwpbd,An asymmetrical RTS based on the Emu War,"[The Emu War, for reference.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War)\n\nThis would be a heavily asymmetrical RTS, sort of a blend of traditional RTS and tower defense, where you command a gang of australians with guns trying to stop a swarm of emus from destroying cropland in the 1930s.\n\nYou play on a relatively large map strewn with various features such as trees, cliffs, rivers, etc. Some parts of the map consist of farmland that you need to defend from the emus. The emus move fairly fast in semi-random swarms, and can reproduce (creating temporary nests on the ground, which later pop into emu chicks) to make more of themselves based on an ecological calculation that relates their population to the territory in which they are able to forage. Emus destroy the crops they touch, more slowly if they are being attacked or frightened but quickly if they are left alone. They can also attack and damage your troops if cornered, but tend to avoid you if they have a viable escape route. Your success on a given map is based on how much cropland you manage to save, with proportions below a certain threshold qualifying as failure and higher proportions granting increasingly higher score. Obviously there is a fog-of-war hiding parts of the map that aren't near your own units.\n\nYou gain constant (or periodic) flows of cash, at a fixed rate for any given map, with which to fund your anti-emu operation. You can spend the cash to hire troops with various weapons, as well as laying down barriers (fences, ditches, etc) and buying horses and trucks to improve the mobility of your troops. Troops can be assigned patrol routes and formation orders to better guard important areas. I'm thinking there could possibly be a component about setting up supply chains to bring supplies to your troops in order to boost their fighting ability, but I'm not sure if that would improve the gameplay or just cause annoyance to the player. Another option would be to give troops an upkeep cost in addition to their hiring cost, capping the number of troops the player can deploy on a given map and forcing a balance between getting more troops vs saving up for a bigger push later on.\n\nI'm not sure how australian aboriginals could figure into the gameplay, but they should definitely have some sort of presence. Probably there should be an option for hiring native troops, who fight with throwing sticks and other traditional weapons and are stealthier than your normal troops, with an emphasis on close-range combat and fast movement on foot. In addition, perhaps some maps could have native tribes (visually distinct from your own troops) who are hostile to both the emus *and* the player, creating a strategic element of trying to avoid the hostile natives while also manipulating the emus in their direction in order to make more efficient use of resources. (Not sure how historically accurate this would be; what, if any, was the extent of violent clashes between colonists and natives in Australia's history, and particularly the interwar period?)\n\nFor a sense of progress, the game could provide a campaign of successive levels with increasing map size and availability of more types of troops and equipment. However there would presumably be a random map generator for one-off battles as well; the terrain layouts would be suitable for randomization. In order to provide greater gameplay variety, maps could have the prices of various things tweaked in order to encourage different strategies.\n\nThe idea is for the gameplay to be less focused on the preservation of your units like a traditional RTS, and more on the tension between tactical efficiency, resource constraints, and the transition between defense and offense. The fast, somewhat random-yet-patterned movement of the emus should create a sort of hectic feel to the game, keeping the player constantly on their toes and maneuvering troops to contain the emu swarms. Ideally, the emu AI should be set up in such a way that the player can get a 'feel' for the movement of emus on any particular map and start to leverage that against them as they reproduce and increase in number. Varying the AI parameters between maps would be another way of enhancing gameplay variety, although it might be difficult to pull off in a way that isn't annoying to the player.\n\nFor graphics I'm imagining 2D pixel art and an overall appearance kind of like WarCraft 2 or the old Command &amp; Conquer games. Units should not however be confined to a coarse grid of tiles, as emus should be able to swarm into tight groups at times, and come in very close physical contact with troops and other objects. The ground would typically be a relatively uniform orangey-brown color, allowing units, cropland and other objects to stand out by contrast. Keeping graphics simple and computationally inexpensive would hopefully leave more room for interesting AI and mechanics even on large maps.\n\nMusic should ideally be a blend of rock or western styles with some aboriginal instruments and chanting, and a good fast beat to match the hectic gameplay and create a sense of urgency. Also, bonus points if the troops speak in thick australian accents.\n\nI'm not really envisioning a multiplayer component, but if there were one, it would probably be co-op with multiple players fighting the emus together, rather than trying to give a player command of the emus themselves."
nnuk0s,Possible idea for an RPG twist,"Okay, so this legit came from a dream last night, and part of it was some kind of static map screen of a fictional version of our solar system (part of it being some satellite that's closer to Earth than the moon that's labelled planet ""Monkey"" but is also called ""Berzerk"") that you'd wander around for your next destination.\n\nAnyway, the main premise was that you were on a mission from God to discover the secrets of the universe. However, one of the biggest secrets you discover is this:\n\nGod created the universe to find the reason for His own existence.\n\nThere was something about how he was in some blank void for an undetermined amount of time, and created the universe to have something to do, and left the people living in it to find that reason. But you could just make up your own stuff there, the main thing I wanted to share was that twist.\n\nbtw: if you decide to make this plot twist in a game, can I get some revenue? Like 1%?

Lovecraft-inspired ancient pirate creature that wears pirate attire?\n2. (A. Feudal Japanese female ghost that uses telekinesis powers from afar? Or (B.

nnpick,Horror/Puzzle game idea?,"Hi, I'm a pretty experienced game developer and am looking for some ideas for a horror / puzzle game for any platform.\nIt can be either 2D or 3D."
nnmzb3,This game went viral in lockdown last year across the globe! Learn how to build this :D,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhmrgKCcrXQ&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhmrgKCcrXQ&amp;t=1s)
nnmz0d,A cooking/war hybrid game.,"Have you ever heard the phrase ""an army marches on its stomach?"" Or perhaps ""all mutinies start in the kitchen?""\n\nThis game features a food fight of epic proportions as anthropomorphic food dishes battle for culinary supremacy. Tortillas fly through the air, dropping sunny side up egg bombs on burger tanks that shoot caustic hot sauce. Matzos balls roll into battle to deploy kosher dill rifles.\n\nThe very core of these armies is their kitchen, where master chefs concoct new deadly delicacies from base ingredients and equipment.\n\nThe players control chefs, who run around the kitchen experimenting with different recipes to counter the chefs cooking up the opposing army. The gameplay would be sort of like overcooked or diner dash. The core gameplay involves moving ingredients around the kitchen and putting them together in the right order.. Each dish you create goes off into the battlefield and fight the enemy foods automatically, and you can see the foods slowly move across the battlefield to attack your kitchen while fighting any defenses you can cook up. In this way it is kind of like a double sided tower defense game.\n\nThe winner is whoever can get their armies to the opposing kitchen and destroy it first. You have to learn the recipes to use them, unlocking more recipes in a tech tree as you cook more complex and deadly dishes. Every dish has at least one counter dish at a similar power level. Some dishes move more slowly or quickly than others, or have more or less armor.\n\nMobile tag applied because this kind of game sounds similar to a lot of ""strategy"" games already on that platform."
nnlrq8,A sci fi horror escape game where you’re fleeing from a monster on Venus,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nThe game that I envision takes place on a huge research facility on Venus.  Scientists discovered Venusian DNA from an organism under the surface, and combined it with human DNA.  What resulted was a monster that killed everyone but you, since you managed to quickly hide.  The master computer was programmed to activate the self destruct sequence if any life form is identified that could threaten the Earth should it somehow return.  The only two still alive are you and the monster, and you have 30 minutes to reach the shuttle and flee before the facility is blown up.\n\nThe facility is a maze, and the map changes in every game. You need the right key cards to open doors and proceed towards the launch pad to escape, and the only way to find these is on the dead bodies of your former colleagues.  You also need the launch code for the shuttle, which can only be found in the security office.  Sometimes, you will need to operate machinery to move obstacles, but to activate these machines you need a key from a maintenance worker’s body.  Due to electrical damage done to the facility, the lighting is poor and everything is dimly lit. There is no background music; only sound effects from machines, your footsteps, and the monster.\n\nYou have no way of fighting the monster, since there are no weapons on the base. Running and hiding are the only options.  The monster moves slightly slower than you, so it will take a while to lose it should it find you.  You are evicerated if it catches you.\n\nYou have 30 minutes to escape, and once you reach the shuttle it takes 15 seconds to climb in, strap up, and blast off. It also takes 20 seconds of ascent to reach a safe distance from the explosion, so you really have about 29 minutes and 25 seconds to reach the shuttle.  If you reach the master computer, you can shut down the self destruct sequence, but that takes 5 uninterrupted minutes at the keyboard, and with the monster hunting you, that is a long shot.  Successfully shutting down the self destruct sequence gives you unlimited time.\n\nThis is a single player game, but there could be tournaments where players log in and race each other for the best escape time.  Players can also submit their best times, and the server would keep track of the best completion times worldwide.  The difficulty level determines how intelligent the monster is as it hunts you, and each difficulty level would have it’s own top scores."
nnl5ag,Publishing a good 3d game in 3-4 months,"Hello everybody,\n\nI am an extreme beginner who has just gotten into game development. I have started with the 2d unity course on Udemy and am almost midway. Even though I am really passionate about game development and plan on continuing it for a very long period, a big motivation was to create a game before mid September to add something nice to my extracurriculars list for my university application profile but now I have come to realize that it won't be possible to create a good 3d Android game before the end of the year with this pace along with the other school related and academic things I have got to do\n\nI have thus planned to buy the source code of a game from an indie developer for a 3d game and then make some tweaks to it maybe with whatever I have learned by then and then publish it on play store. I know it's kind of a shortcut but I won't technically be lying or anything on my application by choosing my word carefully there. \n\nAny suggestions relating to the way I should do it, places where I could contact an indie developer for the source code of small but good 3d game of his, types of games which can be changed drastically with tweaking or maybe any other alternatives to my idea of publishing a game earlier than mid September for a beginner game dev would be appreciated \n\nThank you"
nnfooa,Moddable Generic Board Game,"Basically, I always thought someone should create a video board game, that has a few different games, only the game itself is moddable. This way, any mod designer can create their own board games, or clone ones they know, for an ever growing library of them. It could be played offline against the computer (part of the modding process, and vanilla design), or online against others.\n\nAll the modders would need is a basic template; a blank board, generic money, blank cards, dice, and game pieces to be designed to their liking."

nn20vx,Weird but Cool for the Cryptid and paranormal fans.,"So heres a idea id love to see one day. \nI call it Crypto Zoo\nSo its got 2 main components.  On one hand its a Zoo  park/pet simulator. You taking care of animals and having interesting exhibits all that park management stuff with a twist you also have a camping creature hunting/taming mechanic.\nYou have to hunt and capture your own exhibits(not kill. Like say you want the Jersey Devil, you have to research a  bit of lore and decide on the proper traps/bait. You have KO the creature without killing them. Similar to Arks taming system.  You have to physically (in game of course lol) go on a hunting trip to capture and survive.  Because some of the creatures are violent and will try attacking. Were talking multiple types of Bigfoot. Yeti pretty much as many criptidss we can fit. And maybe a water dlc for nessie and a few others. Its a dream ill never fulfill so if anyone wants here is the idea."
nn0wcu,Need Game Name Ideas,"I wont go into too much detail of the idea of the game, but I want the name to encompass that there is a war causing chaos in the Country you live in, Ordonia, between the kingdoms stationed there. The game contains the option to choose between a Light (Angel), Dark (Demon), and Neutral (Hacker) alignment, so having a name encompass those would also be good. You also choose from a large amount of classes to start out your game, and the game should not have too serious or dark of a tone, so try to keep the name from sounding too dark, you do not have to encompass all of these ideas, however, the tone must not be dark no matter what."
nn0ajo,Capital,"Who doesn't enjoy a little capitalism every once in a while? or maybe you'd prefer to watch a system crumble? Build an economy or join an existing one, where your goal is to build and sustain a strong hold on the world. in this world the rules are built by a player and the players in their community. build and lead a free and open community, or build one where your rules are final, with one goal in mind... watching others crumble. feeling weak? want something a neighboring community has? build an army and take what you want. but be careful, they may have allies. \n\nthis may sound similar to a few other games out there, but to make it unique it will be from a top down perspective where the player controls their character in game, and will have to work for the community they live in. they will have to buy food, vote on rules or events they want to see happen, and enlist in their community's military. with this game idea I'm trying to build something casual, that hooks people in with the struggle for power.  \n\nnot sure if ill ever be capable of coding and building something like this, so i thought id put the idea out there, just incase someone wants to give it a try."
nn07hk,"Requesting high-level world design suggestions for a suburban ""metroidvania""","Hi, all. I've been fiddling with a game concept and am trying to figure out how I can blend the theme, genre, and setting together in a feasible way. Mind helping me out?\n\nIn summary, the core idea is: a 3D first-person horror-themed ""metroidvania"" set in a suburban town.\n\nI say horror-*themed* because the town will be cursed/haunted -- think Stephen King's *IT*, but with more than one evil entity of varying appearance and modus operandi, plus enemy fodder roaming the streets -- and though you'll be given some tools to fight back, there will still be a lurking sense of dread and maybe some jump scares along the way. You won't embody a character like *Doomguy*. You'll play a teenage resident of the town given some tools to help you combat the threats.\n\nI put ""metroidvania"" in quotes because most of them I've played have been 2D and set in dungeons or caverns (*Hollow Knight* is my current favorite). The Zelda games also have elements of the genre, but the maps are also much larger, spanning regions rather than being isolated to one town.\n\nSo the problem I'm having is: I want the player to unlock items and abilities that require them to revisit areas that have... ""sub-areas"" they couldn't previously access without those items/abilities; a common trend among the genre. But, how can I design the map of a suburban town to fit this criteria? Most metroidvanias have vertical scale, and those that don't have a sprawling map (like Zelda). There aren't really skyscrapers in the suburbs, so vertical scale is hard to come by. I will definitely incorporate a sewer system, but other than that, the suburbs seem kind of flat. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!"
nmzjpj,Woke Slayer the game.,"A portal from another world opens... A  Pleiadian comes flying through. by the skin of his teeth, he escaped the dark reapers.\n\nHe finds himself in a strange world, a woke world... and the dimensional jumper is busted.\n\n(weapons of choice 'woke buster shotgun'  'plasma saber' 'SJW 2000'...)\n\nZombie-like NPCs with surgical masks running around screaming... nazi, racist, white supremacist.......\n\nThey are dangerous. they throw toilet paper rolls.... that explode and do a lot of damage, they can also strangle you with a surgical mask.\n\nThe Woke Elite are extremely dangerous, their weapon of choice is Rona19 injections thrown at you... besides radiating, stunning, and disorienting you...  it can turn you into one of them. \n\nIt could take days before you can overcome its effects. (depending on attributes, upgrades....etc)\n\nYou will be going around attacking other people and name-calling them as they do. if you play co-op you will be attacking your teammates.\n\nWokists live in safe spaces where u cannot enter without being swarmed unless you have a meta projector, that can only last for a minute or two before recharging. (prototype tech)\n\nIt can also fool Gawkers.\n\nWhat it does is, it makes you non-white skinned and can change your gender... you will be welcomed in and you can loot without any problems and find some info... also free stuff is handed out to you. Since you are new to this world you have no idea what that means. but you will have to learn fast.\n\nCaution when using this tech as it is a prototype... it can fail sometimes. You could be swarmed by Wokiests. upgrading and tweaking it should help.\n\nDialog- Even in disguise... caution is advised as they are easily **triggered**. Choosing woke buzzwords could earn their trust and reveal valuable information.\n\nCovering yourself up with armor and helmet not only provide protection from attacks it can also hide your identity, your skin color... getting full gear won't be easy.\n\nCaution:  Gawkers can see through it. their scanner takes seconds to penetrate your armor. They are like sirens. Their scream is deafening.\n\nThere are different kinds of wokists.... SJWs, punchOnazi, feminino maniacs, rona19 lunatics, woke lobotomits, gawkers, Woke Legends, uncle Sam(woke soldiers with guns)....etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn NPC approaches our woke slayer and screams at him ""check your privilege"" at what point our slayer pulls out his shotgun and shoots it in the face.\n\nEnters a bar and another NPC is trying to send our hero on a fetch quest... \n\nSlayer- ""What do you think I am? a dog?"" and shoots him in the face... while looting the body he comes across a recording... which makes our slayer very curious about this heist gone wrong a meteorite and a princess from another world. what could the 3 have in common? could she help him get back to his world? ""Hmm Interesting indeed,"" he thinks.\n\nThere is no much of a law enforcement left... after defunding the police were successful and the army gone woke. every man for himself. It is madness, it is chaos, it is bloodshed..... looks like fun.\n\n Finding parts/technology to help you return to your own world may prove difficult. This new world you find yourself in is without reason and beyond hope... but there are rumors of hidden places where decent and reasonable people live and where you can find allies/help.... but earning someone's trust to divulge such information may prove EXTREMELY difficult. unless you get lucky and come across it yourself. but I wouldn't hold my breath. \n\nalso, the Dark  **Reapers** pursues you.\n\nThe strong will rise above it and the weak will crumble.\n\nWill you be the Woke Slayer?  Can you handle it? or are you already triggered? :)"
nmy8zu,The game of food hybrids but living,"We all need a new game. Here's my idea! It's a game where the small enemies are chickens, ducks, and turkeys and the water levels have crabs, lobsters, and octopuses. Hear me out. The bosses are different variants of the turducken. The first boss being the turducken, the second Being the crobster (crab and lobster), etc. Well as the game goes the normal overworld and underwater animals start to become monstrosities as they start merging with each other until they each become one animal. The final boss is the cthuken. It is a giant animal with the head of cthulu, the body of a chicken, and the legs of a crab. This would be a great game IMO. Hit me up if you want more details but please be specific about what you want for details and If you are going to try to make it I want credit for the idea and I want to participate in the making of such game"

nmlwlk,History of a gene (and maybe a seducing simulator),"You are a gene that appeared in ancient times. Your carrier can have only one child. You must survive.\n\nYou control your human, you work, eat, fall in love, give offsprings and die. You could be pushed off a cliff in ancient Sparta, drawn with Titanic, killed in WW2, decapitated during revolution. You can be a knight, rape a peasant and be born as a peasant. You can be queen's lover and be born as a king. You could be moved from Europe to America during the Gold rush. You can be a nerd not able to find a girlfriend. Every epoch, region and status will provide different choices.  \n\n\nI hope you get my inspiration. Consider a visual novel as a possibility."
nmj0tz,So thinking I'm gonna make a horror FPS with some roguelike elements.,I'm not exactly sure HOW roguelike I want to make it but I know I want to have it be present in some way. I want to know if adding these elements would be worth the time or just build regular levels and leave out the roguelike stuff?\n\nThe loop would be similar to Streets of Rogue where you go back to the main area hub after a run and you buy equipment and stuff to prep for your next run. Only I plan to make the runs more risk and reward as every 5 levels will grant you an opportunity to escape with all your earnings or die with half of them intact. Would making it more roguelike add to the experience?

nmdhk3,I'd like to see a 1v1 superhero detective game..,"I had a dream about a game.. kinda like the newer batman series but more sandbox. Where one player is the hero, the other player the villain. The villain selects a ""scheme"" like a heist in GTA5. Once they start the first part of the scheme the hero is notified a crime was committed and is sent to investigate. Think of the beginning of Dark Knight. The potential could be amazing. Or there could be multiple villains and one hero that has to track you down by finding clues. Villains work their way up a ladder to be crime bosses.. The hero has to build a name for himself by catching low lifespan. The villain has to be aware of the people you hire to help, cameras at the target area of the crime, witnesses etc. You gotta select masks.. just a realistic in depth superhero game where you can experience the process of being a villain or hero. Slow paced and thoughtful."

nm203w,Alternate-History Shooter,"I've always enjoyed alternate history things. Shows, movies, games, maps and others. There aren't many alternate history games and even less that get popular. I like Wolfenstein, but I want to focus on other things than Nazis, or at least in the conventional setting.\n\nThe game would be similar to battlefield's War Stories. I'm thinking it would have two and possible more campaigns instead of one. They would obviously be shorter than a normal one. I'm thinking 4 hours to a campaign if I did more than two and 8 hours if I did two. For now I'll focus on the two main ones I thought of that I hope I can make one day.\n\nFirst Campaign: Dragon's Winter\n\nThe name references China being called 'Dragon Country' and other similar names. In this timeline, Japan doesn't enter WWII and joins the Allies instead. Germany is defeated much later because the United States does not enter the war until 1944 after an American embassador is killed by the germans in Berlin. This campaign would focus on a Chinese man who is conscripted into the Japanese military after Japan conquers China in late 1938. China's civil war never happens. The game and story involves him fighting for the Japanese military against the Nazis. In this timeline, the Nazis invasion of Russia is much more successful. It pushes the Russians back to Siberia. The Japanese join the Allies in 1944 just weeks after the U.S. The campaign opens on a coalition force of Japanese and Russian troops driving in armored transports towards Nazi defensive positions in the Urals. Intel suggests that a high ranking Nazi general is hiding out in the Urals after a recent defeat in the area. The coalition force fights their way up a mountain path, evading mines and patrols before breaking out into all out combat with the German forces near the top. The force is pinned down by machine gun fire. They are forced to take cover and settle in. They send two small groups along small paths up the mountain too small for the vehicles or the entire force. You'll find a cave system that has been fortified. The other group will radio to you that they found something in a Nazi cave base and that they need reinforcements. You'll fight throught the cave system and rejoin the force as they push up the mountain. The other force had found a vantage point and taken out the machine gun nests but won't respond to radio contact. As you push through the base on top of the mountain you find a entrance to a cave. It has a stockpile of german artillery. You also find that a large construction project is being conducted in the cave. A Gustav cannon is being constructed and assembled there. It was planned to be used to shell cities in Siberia. You attempt to destroy the cannone while repelling german reinforcements. The campaign ends when you and another group of soldiers are pulling artilery pieces and ammo outside to use against german reinforcements. A massive explosion rocks the cave system and you hurry out with the artillery. You set up the artilery and shell german reinforcement as a few more explosions rock the cave system. After you fend off the reinforcements, Russian transport helicopters arrive and evacuate the force slowly. The germans make one last Blitzkrieg up the mountain. You are forced to abandon the artilery and fend off the germans until everyone has been evacuated. The mission ends are you fly away in a helicopter under heavy fire as you fire out the back. \n\n(Please note that the first military helicopters were used as early as 1944 and while it was not widespread nor used for the role I described, in this timeline the combat capabilities are developed earlier and modified R-4 helicopters are bought by the Russians.)\n\nI will edit this post to add the other campaign soon. It is late and I don't feel like righting much longer. Hope thats ok."

nlwy7a,A VR vs PC game where you beat up leprechauns trying to steal back their gold,"In this game the VR player is a human who has found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow while the leprechauns aren’t around. The PC players are leprechauns who are trying to steal back each individual gold piece from the VR player. \n\nThe VR player stands around the pot of gold and can punch and throw the leprechauns away from the pot. Full body tracking for VR would make kicking the leprechauns away a viable option. Players with a large play area would be able to to make use of that without a virtual movement method since they are defending a single point.\n\nMultiple leprechauns are playing with mouse and keyboard or controller from a 3rd person point of view. Rag doll physics would make it satisfying when they are struck by the VR player. The leprechauns are small so they can only carry one gold piece, but they are given some abilities (such as temporary invisibility or super speed) that have a cooldown so the game is more balanced and enjoyable for the PC players.\n\nThe PC leprechauns win when they get back all the gold. The VR human wins when a timer runs out."

Like you were really there.\n\nEdit: At some point I think players can unlock Shoving and Spartan Kicks, to add some variety to the gameplay.\n\nEdit 2: I just want to thank all of you for your great input and enthusiastic support for my vision.\n\nWe can pivot this away from the traditional VR market, and market this exlusively to the upscale crowd by partnering up with the Peleton people, who will build a custom 360 Treadmill VR Punching-People-In-The-Back-Of-The-Head-Who-Walk-Too-Slow-On-The-Sidewalk Workout Machine.\n\nThis would open up bum rush mechanics to the gameplay, which I'm excited about.\n\nNo reason both can't happen, I suppose. Peleton may want exclusive or preferential rights to this technology, so the lawyers may have to work out this part."
nllbhh,Dota Ability draft rogue legacy MMORPG,"I dream about a strange MMORPG related to dota and some others game like Rogue Legacy.  \nThis is my first post here and just want to share. Maybe you will love that :’)\n\nI played 2700 hours straight on the Dota 2 ability draft mode. That is basicly standard Dota 2 mod with random characters but the fun part is that you have to choose your own spell in a random pool that everyone share at first. This mod can be very strange, and is not very appreciated in the dota 2 community  but he give you a huge meta. Also what puzzle me is that all 120\~ dota 2 heroes have more personality than many MMORPG « class » even with only 4 or 5 spells.\n\nFor sure, I play them only for « 1 hour » at the maximum, but they provide a funnier experience than many real time mmorpg I played who give you like 30 spells at the same time.  \n\n\nSo let me explain the concept on this hypothetical game :\n\n**Basic resume**\n\n* Fantasy or Science fiction.\n* Real time or not (aka Dofus).\n* Only 1 playable character at a time.  \n\n\n**Character development and environment**\n\nA very « boring » human at first who grow by exploring the world. All the abilities aren't learned automatically by his class or level but by real experiences in the world. \n\nThe character is a bit randomized in term of physical attributes, basic talents and comes with no real spells or abilities. I was also thinking about to randomize his sex.\n\nHe can learn something like 10 spell at the maximum, but need to choose between them to have 5 active spells.\n\n* He encounter a Fire remnant during a dungeon : He can choose to learn fire ball spell.\n* He mary to a women : He learn a spell to have a relation with someone and share some health / buffs.\n* He progress in a desert : He can learn a passive spell to have status resistance.\n* He made trading at some place : He get some attributes related to « trading » ??? \n* He make a child with some others player : He learn how to… I mean, you get it, right ?\n\nSo all the environment is no more used to provide experience point but… learn something, and get a gameplay experience based on affect of the player. If someone want to crawl into dungeons, it can be a great warrior. If someone want to make social stuffs, then he get better at it.\n\nI suppose that you will be asked if you want to trade one of the 10 slots by a new spell or keep your « deck » like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main idea of this game is that you will become the character that you choose to be based on your adventures and choice, and not being dictate by a « talent tree » or class.\n\n\---\n\n**Replayability** \n\nYour character is designed to growth, make a family, spread is genes, and … probably die… like on many stories.   \n\n\nBecause he can have only 10 spells, it can be boring to play thousand of hours with it.\n\nYou will discovery characters from players or IA, and will be able to have relations with. Friendship, union etc. If you have 10 abilities, 5 active, 5 muted, and you meet another player, then you can have a baby with it.   \nHe will become a new playable characters with mixed physical attributes, a name, and 5 basics abilities (5 empty slots) randomized or even mixed in some aspects based on the father and mother.   \nLet's say one is a crystal maggot who made Ice blast and the other one is a character with Armor reduction AOE spells, then you can get one of theses spell or a randomized mix « Ice with armor reduction » or « Armor who ice enemy when they hit ».\n\nI think that this is part of the fun to « lost » some characters (also a way to made space), but maybe you can keep some important member of the family, and have a maximum number of playable character who growth by playing, meeting new people etc.\n\n**Spells and abilities**\n\nAbout the list, Just give a look about the abilities provided in Dota 2. they have a huge personality. I played at AION, Wow, Star Wars or Warhammer, but for some reason's I can't even remember to one spell except that some was making damage, some armor, some healing. For some reason they don't attract me at all. It's probably because you have plenty of them, and that for balancing reason they are close.  \n\n\n**Leveling and composing with the deck**\n\nThe deck itself remains, but lever of each spell can vary during adventure.\n\nLet's imagine a dungeon, you're on the entrance with your team of 4 friends. You have to pick 5 of yours 10 spells, then go to the first « room ».   \nAt the first room, all your spells are level 1, every room you can choose to level-up 2 spells. So you will do many choices for every dungeon. It's the same choice that you usually do when leveling a moba characters.  \nWhat I want to add in the gameplay with this mechanic is to be able to focus on great strength on early or late game. e.g : First room very hard but a easier fight against the boss.  \n\n\nSo, anyone want to play at my game or not ? :)"
nlhno3,Interesting death mechanic for rpgs,"so if anyone heard of the alleged ""time traveler"" john titor, he once said that going back in time is moving to a slightly different dimension that is more different the further back you go.\n\nso the idea is taking that concept and applying it to death - the player will have changed stats, gear, skill tree etc the further away it goes without a checkpoint.\n\nthe reason I think it would actually be good in terms of design (maybe with a couple of twiks to prevent it ruining player builds) is that if a player keeps dying at some boss eventually they will get by a chance a good enough roll on their things to beat the boss.\nand players who are doing good will be punished for dying"
nlg56a,My first game ideas . Pls pls pls tell me how it is. Please don't copy,"It's a 2d vertical endless game where we play as a monkey. Imagine there are 3 - 5 trees trunks on the screen. we are climbing those tree very fastly. There are branches on these trees if we touched branches, we will die. if there is a brach on the left side of the tree, we will go to right side. if there are branches on both sides, we will jump to the next tree(s). using WASD/IJKL/Arrow keys.\n\nAs far as we go, speed of the game increases. There are chances for 3 trees having branches on both the sides."
nld1z3,Why hasn’t anyone made a real world simulator?,"Like gta but survival and rp built in with people trying to make money build a house and build an empire you can have families, like tribes in ark. People try to destroy what you got or rob you. Kinda like rust and ark but modern world. It should be a lot like gta just with better features like food and water. Gas for cars. Jobs or you sell drugs and save money you know just hustle and build like online businesses that generate money and money can only be stored in a base or home so you can get robbed if things are destroyed you gotta build or buy them back."

nlabj7,A game were you level down - instead of up.,"You know how in most games you level up and up and up - and in the end you become so overpowered not even the strongest enemies are any kind of  challange to you anymore?  \nI noticed this while playing Horizon Zero Dawn, for example. I started a new game and I was like: ""I don't remember this game being so hard"".  \nIn the beginning, you have nothing, even the simplest of enemies are a real challenge. The difficulty curve is the inverse of what it should be! Some other games have this problem as well.  \nYou know this trope where you start of the game with all your powers and max level (Darksiders 1, for example) but then you lose all your powers due to story reasons and you have to get them back over the course of the game? -&gt; Why not make this gradual? Losing your powers, I mean.  \n\n\nLet's say you have a space-ship that is fully upgraded, a huge variety of weapons, max. shields and armor, etc. You blow away anything and nothing has a chance against you. The game starts of easy.  \nBut over the course of the game's story your ship becomes more and more damaged, individual weapon systems go offline, your shields get weaker, etc. -&gt; As you lose power / options that are presented to you, the game gradually becomes harder.  \nThe enemies you fight, however, they kind of stay the same in terms of the threat they pose. But since you will have less and less options to fight them, the same enemies become harder and harder to deal with.  \nAt certain points in the story, you will get the chance to repair certain weapons / buffs you have lost - but only ever one at a time. By the end you will have a ship that is perfectly suited to your playstyle - because you will only ever keep the weapons/upgrades you can't live without - while saying goodbye to the rest.  \nThe hard part will be to balance things - you could say: ""Duh, I will obviously just keep the stongest weapon"" - but as you lose other weapons - you will be utterly defenseless as you wait for your weapon to recharge, that can only shoot one very strong shot every minute or so.\n\nOf course it doesn't have to be a space shooter - this conept would work with a variety of genres."
nl4jpy,Unsuspecting Dating Game (Time travel and more),"I had this idea suddenly come to me when I was eating my dinner and I really want someone to make it, so that I can play it. \n\nSo this is just a normal, dating game. You know the same old, guy has to choose a girl from this group. He goes on dates with everyone then he falls in love with one. Now this is the interesting part, after you complete the game, it will zoom out to a timeline branch and each branch will be labeled with the girls names so that you can choose that alternative path with a different ending. At first it will seem like you’re playing the game again, but at the middle it becomes a murder mystery and now, as the mc you have to find out who killed her with your time traveling abilities. At first the player will be like “ok I can get the hang of it”, then BAM! Your original timeline (the first time you play the game) and your current one, will collide and now you have to choose between your original girl or the new girl. There can be ideas of yandere, imposters, an universal creator, impermanence or any ideas that makes your player think and feel uncomfortable at the same time. \n\nTLDR: Normal dating game become time travel murder mystery once you play it the second time. Later destroys all idea of a linear timeline by combining timeline A with timeline B then being forced to choose one girl over another. Also a sprinkle of philosophy to get your players head to hurt :) or Doki Doki Literature Club! X the anime Erased."

nl0uf3,Caitlyn Jenner Driving Sim,"You play the role of Caitlyn Jenner and you have to speed across the state of California to make it to speaking engagements, photo shoots and campaign meetings on time - all while killing as many pedestrians and other drivers as possible (bonus points for homeless people). Points can be used to upgrade your car (spikes, grenade launchers, etc.) and to pay for your family’s innumerable plastic surgeries."
nl0lze,"Kamaz - a realistic VR driving sim where you are a soviet army driver, delivering supplies to an isolated platoon over rough terrain in the Russian-Afgan war","So, as an intro, I've been listening to a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LqrwVkBeoZmlENBNjrzBxbBzX8nq4ms) of soviet war songs I put together, and I came across a comment from a Sam Matthews in the comment section of [вперед КАМАЗ](https://youtu.be/ZB1ezt0r48w). I'm mostly just an ideas magpie, but I have thought of some expansions to his idea.\n\nin his own words, *""You are the driver of a KAMAZ truck and you must drive from hayratorma to Kabul. And while you are driving your truck becomes stuck, shot at, lost, dug in, engine problems, lost cargo, wounded people, road conflict, unusable roads... A 12-hour drive in a slow vehicle on a dangerous path that must deliver its cargo no matter what... maybe even a sleeping feature where the driver goes to sleep for the day and so the player can sleep or rest in real-time.""*\n\nThis, ladies, gents, and all of you in between, is simply a phenomenal idea.\n\nmy immediate thought was something tonally like the depressed love-child of Desert bus,, euro truck simulator, stalker, mud-runner/spintires, and a pinch of rimworld, and to go even further. a 4-day round trip to refresh and resupply a dug-in platoon in deepest Afganistan, where you sleep in real-time. after you set a wake-up and bedtime in the settings. I'm not a monster, although...\n\nmidnight life or death raids on your supply column interrupting that *would* make the IRL sleeping a bit less of a gimmick... and running to your truck to frantically start it up packing supplies up as you go, or to act as a runner to pass medical supplies and ammo to the troops defending the convoy would also be amazing. give the player some agency, but prevent the player from just picking up two aks and going full Rambo. you are just a driver after all. perhaps you have a weedy little Makarov and a spare mag. perhaps not. all I know is I think the player should be very fragile and the enemies amateurish, but vicious,  frightening, and a force to be reckoned with. The cover and thin armour of the KAMAZ will be your best friend\n\nAnd every morning, because you would have to travel by night (hopefully this would be accounted for in the self-set schedule as to not fuck with your circadian rhythm too much) you would wind down and sleep with a campfire and the other truckers, tankies, and the odd soldier. this is where stalker can be seen, as you unwind from a night of stressful driving with some interactive toys. perhaps a guitar playing soldier you could request songs from, a pack of fags with a limited number for the whole journey. A bottle of vodka will affect your driving the next day if you hit it too hard and piss of your superior, but might give you the chance to keep moving if you catch a bullet. a map on which you've got to contemplate the next leg of your journey. deciding on the quicker route through a ravine, or fording a river that might kill or beach your truck and so forth. A radio you could chat with the blokes you are trying to save on to keep the goal in perspective. and depending on the progress you made and the casualties you suffer, they disappear one by one from the fireside, and the people on the radio get more and more worried. you can see the fuel trucks get lighter and lighter, and the meds and rations get fewer and fewer. you lose all of them, the game doesn't even end. even having the platoon you are trying to save cannibalize the trucks for parts, or use support staff like you as soldiers, would fractionally increase their chances of holding their position and surviving.\n\nThis is where that pinch of rimworld comes in - this would be an experience designed to make you fail miserably, figuratively and literally. perhaps the framing device would be an old war veteran recounting his story to his grandkids, an unreliable narrator. a story of resilience and perseverance, of pointless loss and suffering and camaraderie, only for it to happen again the next week. it would tell a story through interactions with the rest of the crew, and through rock hard gameplay. anything could go wrong, and you would have to fix it, and if you aren't fast enough with fixing it people you know and like will die.\n\ndriving a big, heavy, loud, and slow truck through dark, squat forests, deep ambush friendly ravines, fields of slowly sinking flares and the occasional danger close airstrike or minefield with being able to do nothing but drive like a 20-ton bat out of hell in VR sounds like hell, and I love it. it could be so tense when absolutely nothing happened yesterday, but a tank was hit directly with an RPG right in front of you the day before. you would never know if it would be a flat tire next, or an RPG to your trusty KAMAZ.\n\nAs a side note, I could see two-player co-op being a thing too. If there were separate threats to life and limb for you and your co-driver, played by your friend or a random, then losing then could become part of the story too. they flag a stray bullet, but survive, you'd better hope there are enough meds to go around that night, or even enough to stabilize them during the journey. having someone to chat to while driving the lonely roads would be nice, but I'm not sure how that would work with the IRL sleeping mechanic or then fireside conversations\n\nif you wanted to go truly off the rails, you could introduce cosmic horror and channel the more subtle side of stalker. have the journey be a slow descent into madness, doggedly trying to outpace an unspeakable horror and a chill down your spine. random people could disappear from the fireside, have the other characters mourn them, and suddenly have them return like nothing was wrong. everyone has no idea what you're talking about - ""no, what? he's been there from the start. never left"". and they just stare at you for the rest of the night with cold, dead eyes. the map changes regularly, but the route doesn't. you could wake up somewhere completely different from where you stopped. you could hear non-existent battles, see non-human objects no one else could just beyond your headlights during a long drive. having the player second guess themselves for 3 of the four days would be a massive feat, but my god would it be good. this is completely my invention, this part, and I'm not sure if this would work at all with the setting or tone or gameplay loop, but I'm still quite proud of this.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nlast stop folks. If I haven't bored you yet, then me going into the technical details defiantly will. read on at your own risk. thanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking more on the technical side, this is where mudrunner and spintires come in. The main mechanic would be driving, defiantly, so it would have to be highly detailed and polished. A simulation similar to what they did to create an incredibly hard challenge from the get-go. manual gear shifts, the clutch, perhaps a winch to help other vics that get stuck. support for driving wheels, sticks and pedals would be a must for immersion, [here's an example](https://www.amazon.com/PC-Driving-Degree-Vibration-Steering-Shifter/dp/B08MT6F3C9/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pc+steering+wheel+and+pedals+and+shifter&amp;qid=1621974639&amp;sr=8-4), but they would not be required. it would be a largely seated experience, so the user would only really need a VR headset if there was keyboard support implemented too. hopefully, that would expand the already rather small customer base.\n\nThe art style defiantly couldn't be low-poly, or simplistic. The tonal clash would be horrific, but I understand it's easier to make for solo indie devs, and I could see it working if you tried to match the depressive tone and didn't go too simplistic or oversimplified. speaking of simplicity, I don't think you could craft 48 straight hours of random events, difficult terrain, and scripted sequences without a AAA team or a spare decade, so it would have to be randomly generated. This could hurt the campfire scenes, but if you play your cards right this could be a benefit. You couldn't know when a character you really like would die, or when you would run out of spare wheels, or when the next attack would come. Could be basically plain sailing, or the journey from hell this would help keep the game as fresh as possible for the madmen who want to replay the damn thing.\n\nFor the campfire scenes, I'd prefer to avoid any sort of dialogue tree or end goal. They simply couldn't be randomly generated, because then every single character would lose any personality and purpose and the player couldn't really develop an attachment, but a fallout 4 style ""yes, yes, yes with sass, fuck you"" dialogue tree would also be really detrimental. it would have to be fiercely well written, and somewhat reactive to the player. something large, and seemingly bottomless like Disco Elysium's writing would be good. something not designed to be exhausted, but to be absorbed and engrossed in. Again, very difficult for indie solo devs, but worth it. because of the sheer amount of dialogue, I think voice acting would be the best idea. It would help the conversations flow between the player and the different NPCs, and prevent the player from getting hit with a wall of text. perhaps the conversation could continue without the player, but they could interject when they want more detail or want to make a quip of off the cuff remark. perhaps a system like [Façade's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade_(video_game)). but I can see the player breaking it very easily, and ruining one of the game's core pillars - immersion.\n\nAll of this is basically a moonshot. This amount of content, dialogue, random events, high detail assets. terribly inefficient and impractical. but as a very famous man once remarked on moonshots, *""we do not do it because it is easy, but because it is hard.""* if one or two ideas here make it into the core principle, we could have our hands on a winner here. even if we have to scale the time involvement back, this could be an amazing experience."

nkxwhe,Discord logic! The game about everything as long as it’s related.,"\nHow to play: \n1: Decide turn order (preferably based on order of icons in call)\n2: The first player will post a random image of anything. The second will post another image, (within a given time frame), along with a caption as to why it’s related. This continues, but a relation can not be the same as a previous one.\n3: Keep playing until someone fails to meet all of these requirements. Then, the loser has to say (initial picture) is like (last) because (initial) is like (next) which is like (next) which is like (last).\n\nAdditional rules:\n1: Call outs. When you think a persons logic is fallible, or that it’s been mentioned before, then you say ‘call out’. If you can prove your call out with most people agreeing, then that person loses. If you don’t, then it moves to your turn and you have a shorter time to act. You also can’t call out a turn if one has gone after it.\n2: Muting. It is polite to mute yourself while it’s during a call out.\n\nOptional rules:\n1: Points. You can decide to use points instead of just an instant lose. You gain points by the amount of seconds left in your turn when you post. You can also earn points by calling someone out, and proving it. In this case, they do not automatically lose, and you get the points they would. If you fail to meet the time limit, then you would not fail but rather revive no points. Play this until a certain amount of points or rounds. The least amount is the loser, and we know what happens to them.\n2: Long game. Whenever someone would lose and end the game, instead, they lose and the rest keep playing (with each consecutive loss adding more and more onto the ‘this is like that’ pile). The winner will not have to go through the losing process."
nkwofr,Cool horror/puzzle game idea,"I got a great idea for a 2d horror/puzzle game.\n\nYou get a light and have to complete tasks to get to the next room. There would be 50 total rooms.\n\nThing is, to see you need to use the light but then creatures are attracted to you.\n\nWith the light off you cannot see but they will not be attracted to you. They cannot see you in the dark.\n\nThere would be a paranoia meter that scales the longer the light is off.\n\nYou would have a battery meter on your light that stops it from working. If your light stops, your paranoia meter goes up faster and you have to complete the level in complete darkness.\n\nYou can still interact and escape the room without a light but it's faster, and if you bump into a creature with the light off you will be chased by it.\n\nIf your paranoia meter goes to max you will scream, which will put your paranoia down 1/4, but it will alert the creatures to you.\n\nIf you are caught by a creature you have to restart the room. Some rooms will be long to raise the steaks of you being caught.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAlso give me credit please if you make or build off my idea."
nkukdn,"Snowpiercer game (based on the series, not movie)","Hi all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPre-note: if anyone is a game dev and wants to use this idea, feel free! and consider me your first customer.   \n\n\nBasically, I would love to see a game based on the netflix series of snowpiercer. Copy rights etc asside here is my kinda basic idea.  \n\n\n**Intro:**\n\nThe game starts 4 revolutions after the series ""end"", with Layton's democratic experiment a success (or failure if you want to play dictator mode...Wilford Mode) there is a general election for a new leader of the train. (we're not sure where Wilford is exactly, but perhaps S3 if there is one can give us a little more story, or he's eventually killed by some means or other in game). You play the part of the newly elected leader, and it is up to you to decide how best to run the train from there on. All decisions regarding the status of the train come through you, and it's up to you to keep everyone as happy as possible \*insert obligitory RPG character customisation menu\*   \n\n\n**Responsibilities:**   \n*Resources:*\n\nFood:&gt;!\nAg-sec cars grow crops and livestock to feed the train. There is also supplimentary protien bar cars that can be converted to Ag-sec, but protein bar cars are a ""higher density"" food producer.!&lt;\n\nWater:\n\n&gt;!The world is a ball of ice, so melt the snow and that is right? Wrong, Snowpeircer has scoop intakes and water treatment plants to remove polutants from the water, but in thick ice drifts these scoops can break. They have to be retracted going through cities or high drift zones, and so water conservation is important. The treatment plants can also be broken causing more issues. Cars can be converted into storage tanks, but that may not always be the best choice. !&lt;\n\nEnergy:\n\n&gt;!No energy, no lights, no heat. Without enegery the train runs the risk of grinding to a halt, or a rebelion arrising again. some cars use more energy than others and can be turned off and on as needed. But rolling blackouts may be necessary on some stretches of track else risk stopping. !&lt;\n\nWarmth:\n\n&gt;!While energy and warmth are intrinsicly linked, heat can be lost in other ways even if you have surplus of energy. Breaches, every time the train slows, higher altitudes, couplings. If it's too cold passengers will freeze. Passengers can be relocated to tempory ""hot cars"" if power needs to be turned off to a section, but only temporarly, else they'll get frustrated and loose morale. !&lt;\n\nWeight:\n\n&gt;!If the train is too heavy if wont be able to get up some hills, will take more energy to speed up, will take longer to slow down, and may derail if coming into a corner too fast. Rather than the whole train having a single weight, I'd imaging a system by which each car's weight is modled. This means if you have one of the afformentioned water tanks at the very rear of the train, it may rip off of the car as you come into a corner too fast, but equally if that tank was at the front of the train it would be harder to push it uphill. !&lt;\n\nMorale\n\n&gt;!The people want to be heard. They can give side quests, such as solving a murder or assualt, or simply retrieving something from somewhere. Morale can also be affected by all of the above resource states. Track talk between passangers will give hints of what to do to improve morale without ever having to do side quests, but side quests are far more effiencient and boosting this morale. Other events like supply car joins, particular scenic routes, or the choice of train wide radio statio can also affect morale. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Train*\n\n&gt;!As train circles the globe there is the ""Main track"" (the one the train circulates on mostly) and some side tracks. The side tracks can be used for a variety of things, ejecting cars like we see in the series, or shortcuts to other parts of the map. However the sidings are way rougher terain than the main track, while shorter in length to get to a destination they will have steep hills, cliff drops, or rough track. These can degrade over time with each revolution and even more so when used (especially if used incorrectly) making them dangerous to traverse regularly. \nThe main track is relatively safe, however snow drifts and crumbling buildings can block the track.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The train must stay in motion to generate energy (unlimited in duration but not density), and battery packs will drain if you stay at extra speed, go up hills, use the breaks downhills, or go too slow for too long. However, with a greowing population after reproductive rights were re-introduced your citizens will demand more power, making this ballancing act of being fast enough to keep up with energy demand, but slow enough to not derail harder as the game progresses, population growth is relatively realistic with birth rate. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Cars can also be upgraded. Bigger battery banks, better motors, better brakes, more livable space, increased crop yeild etc. But these upgrades are rare, found on sidings on abandoned supply cars which can be linked to the back of the train to aquire. Obviously this gives you two options: take the siding and risk colliding with the car with the plow, destroying the materials, damaging Snowpeircer, and potentially derailing the train, or backing up down a siding to get the materials, but backing up a siding requires coming to a stop and remember.... you may not be able to get started again if your batteries are too low. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The people:*\n\n&gt;!NPCs interact with the player and eachother. Jobs can be assigned on a train overview screen, People without jobs or in freetime can be seen enjoying leisure facilities or sitting around. Whatever to make the train actually feel alive. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The politics:*\n\n&gt;!There is still some Wilford supporters on the train, they are mostly harmless and will mostly just show the W gang sign, talk about wilford and what he did, and get on with their jobs, only generally being slightly resentful at you. however if morale drops too low, these will be the main fighting force you find yourself against politcally speaking. They may try to over throw you as we see Commander Grey and the Folgers attempt in S1. It's up to you how you deal with these people, throw them off or try to improve your repuation with them, but either of these actions risk retaliation from other parts of the train. Throwing them off will provoke a stronger reaction from other Wilford supporters, and some fence sitters, it may also anger ex-taillies, harkening back to their struggles with ""removals"". But trying to appease them may put the ""one train"" supporters against you, as you could be seen as a wilford colaborator. !&lt;\n\n**Gameplay:** \n\nThere are 3 main screens of gameplay. Train overview,  free-roam and the egnine\n\n*Train overview:*\n\nOverview allows you to repair, upgrade, and customise the train (discussed later), as well as assign jobs. This screen could take form of a blueprint style page. With 1000+ cars to customise you can flick between cars or jump to specific numbers. This screenw will have multiple sub menus for the different things you can do. Job assignments can have different options too - best fit, assign specific, and fill labour. Best fit means the game will try to find the best passenger for the job, these can be unlocked through side quests or reviewing the roster, but remmeber tailies weren't on the roster so there may be someone better to do the job. Assign specific allows you to assign a known person to a job, this can bolster morale in that work space as your character will personally know this person (again unlocked through player interactions with NPC). Fill labour simply assigns anyone to the job regardless of skill, this could turn out pretty good for low skill jobs, but for higher skill jobs like hospitality it may be disadvantageous. (default).\n\n*Free-roam:*\n\nexactly as it sounds. 3rd person RPG style, interact with passengers and walk around your 10km long steel tube. This mode is used for side quests, RNG events, and just exploration. Find hidden parts of the train like the observation bubbles, or experience the night car. but don't stay in free-roam too long, else an RNG event may strike at the wrong time. (though it may be a good idea to train some extra engineers for the engine to deal with those so you don't have to) \n\n*The engine:*\n\nThe main screen of the game. Watch the white marble pass past your windscreen, keep lookout for sidings and supply cars, control speed, monitor systems and even adjust the shape of the plow for different terain types. Late game, NPC engineers will mostly handle this for you allowing you to explore or take care of higher level issues, but early game you may find this is the only screen you see for a few revolutions truing to keep the lights on. While NPCs can handle most things, theres noone better than  you to handle RNG events to come to the safest outcome. Also all decisions by NPCs are routed through you, they can call you back to the engine in an emergency, or contact you by hardline for instructions. But the hardlines may go down, so don't stry too far for too long.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*RNG events:*\n\nAvalanches, radio contacts, outside side missions (like repairs), riots, crimes, supply car ecounters, and births. Any number of scenarios could be made to play out having various effects both good and bad. Someone with a better imagination could come up with more events than these. These can interplay and affect resource managment. For example, a birth will increase morale for the whole train as it is a celebrated event, but if that child then freezes due to an avalanche breech morale will drastically drop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Multiplayer?*\n\n&gt;!2-4 person coop, assign roles to your friends or roam together doing quests. One player may be head engineer, while another head of hospitality. a 3rd player could assist breachmen or sanitation, and a 4th may choose to run side quests. While I don't expect multiplayer to be a massive selling point of a game like this, it would be fun to play with friends. Maybe a later version!&lt;\n\n**Extras:**\n\n*Customisation:*\n\n&gt;!I think the best way to consider this game would be a city builder with a single road. Each car can be assigned a ""district"", with 2 modes of play. Simple, and complex. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!In simple mode you simply assign classes, the game automatically looks at the number of cars, the people in those cars, and what resources they need and builds the nessesary infrastructure they need. Housing cars, entertaiment cars, commercial cars, facailty cars, etc. These can be done by an algorithm with plug in numbers. % of residential to commercial for example. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!In complex mode things get messy. You still assign ""classes"", but you can choose what indivdual cars will do. Bowling alley in first? It's now a water storage car. Too much commercial area in third? turn a few into ag-sec. I'm not sure how detailed someone would want to go but it could get pretty complex for more advance players I'd guess!&lt;\n\n*Cosmetics:*\n\n&gt;!While the outside of the train is generally fixed in colour scheme and shape, the inside can be customised paint scheme wise. And the Wilford W's coud be replaced with another logo of your design or choosing. Uniforms may also be customised too but would require a tailor car. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Having said the outside of the train remains relatively fixed, it may be possible to find a reasonable lore-accurate way to customise the outside. Perhaps a training scheme by which welders and metal workers could be turned into breachmen, unlocking outside cusomisation. Or secret Wilford storage facilities/tunnels that can be sealed off (potentially explored) and used to access the outside. However these facilities are burried in thick snow and only rarely are accessable. But if your train is too long from all the side cars you picked up you can't close them off. !&lt;\n\n*Upgrades/repairs:*\n\n&gt;!The supply cars I mention earlier will contain a good amount of replacement parts and rarely an upgrade. Longer range radio antenas so the train radio can reach further to bolster morale. Upgraded heating system to use less power, or produce more heat. Solar pannels for passive energy generation, better intake scoops for water managment, better brake pads, better motors, etc. On supply car wouldn't be enough to outift a whole train, but they would add percentage bonuses for each upgrade aquired. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Repairs similarly will require spare parts sometimes. IF a part isnt repaired you'll take a percentage nerf to the accected stat. IE, a broken bogie motor could reduce your speed by 1%, meaning less energy can be produced, less energy &gt; less heat &gt; less morale.  !&lt;\n\n*Research tree:*\n\n&gt;!everyone knows how resarch trees work. research stuf, unlock stuff. But int hec ase of snowpiercer there are a few specialties. Climate research, outside survial research, cold man research, upgrades to cars, higher quality food, better water filtration, connection systems, shock absorbers, fertility treatments etc etc. These give buffs to existing parts of the train, unlock new car types, increase engine stats to allow for more cars, etc. !&lt;\n\nI'm not a game designer by any means, i just love the series and love the concept of a game made around it. Whether rights issues with Netflix would ever allow one to be made or not is another matter, but if any game designers out there want to use this feel free! Send me a beta version and I'd love to test.   \n\n\nDepending how the next season plays out perhaps big alice could still be a part of the train, or perhaps it's detached having been depleted of supplies and relations with their crew made good. But that's down to Netflix."
nktn0l,a multiplayer horror where you haunt players to raise their heartbeats in order to kill them.,"So been thinking about this for a while. Ive always wanted a game where the purpose of the game was to fully explore a randomize mansion without your heartbeat raising up to a certain rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir can be two ways to play the game. 1: use a real heartbeat sensor and try to calm yourself before the ghost uses an ability to scare you. 2. if you don't have a heartbeat sensor, the ghost abilities raises a game heartbeat if you are in sight of the haunting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more the mansion is explored the more abilities the ghost can unlock. starting by throwing objects, to showing your physical form or loud screeches, even hallucinations. When their heartbeat hit a certain rate, you can attack and damage the player. The ghost wins when you kill all players\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe players win once they explore the entire house and unlock the front door to leave. Lock doors are all over the house and some hidden doors would require puzzles to be solved in order to open them. Players can find items that helps discover if the ghost is in the room or temporary make the heartbeat stop functioning. (protecting the players from attacks.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway this is the basis of the game. A bit like phasmophobia but with a bit of pvp in it."

nkoeac,"I’m sure this has been done to death, but, give me your “I could totally do Yandere Simulator better, I’d...” pitch","What are your ideas? How would you change the concept, the core gameplay, anything. I think its a semi-universal experience of hearing the story of Yandere Simulator’s development and go “oh well I could do better than that, I would...” \n\nI’ll start. Its a similar format, 2D instead of 3D, but its more of an homage to classic 80’s horror movies than a japanese trope. At the start of the game you are possessed by a “spirit” like a slasher, a slenderman-type, puzzle cube demon, (yes, one is a yandere) etc, and each have a “goal” be it simple like kill all campers, or complex like “reenact the conditions of how you died,” and you have a whole school year to figure out and activate your ploy, while fighting against spiritualists, investigators, and the girl you’re possessing who’s currently fighting you for control. Its the plot of all the horror movies we love but the player is taking the role of the monster, and gets to peak behind their curtain as to how to be this villainous thing."
nko9op,Colossi Raiders: Dark Souls meets Phantom Abyss,"**Concept Overview:**\n\nWatching comparisons of the recent early-access title 'Phantom Abyss' to the phantom mechanic in Dark Souls I started to wonder if maybe the latter's asynchronous pseudo-multiplayer went far enough.\n\nThough I imagine most of this sub is familiar with Dark Souls, Phantom Abyss is new enough that I'll just run both down quickly anyway.\n\n*Dark Souls* features phantoms of other players going about their otherwise single-player adventures, which you can witness die and whom can leave messages for other players, allowing information to be shared between players without actually playing together.\n\n*Phantom Abyss* has similar asynchronous multiplayer, in which players try to complete a temple, for which everyone only has one try, whilst the ghosts of players (ala driving game ghosts) who have previously played (and died) in the temple do their own thing. This allows for information to be shared by watching what they do, where they go, and how they died.\n\nHere's my pitch at what a version of the two combined would look like.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThis is a boss rush game, of sorts. Giant colossi (think various Dark Souls or Shadow of the Colossus bosses) roam an otherwise empty wasteland world. You play as an RPG hero of some sort, with perhaps a limited class or loadout system (pre-game customisation, perhaps with unlockables or an in-game earned currency, but no progression once in-game). You are quickly thrust into an environment where you must do battle with one of these powerful entities.\n\nThen, you die. Almost certainly anyway. The bosses are designed to be unfair, overwhelmingly powerful, and capable of finishing you very quickly. Even if you survive their onslaught and dodge their attacks, you'll quickly find them to be HP sponges, and your own stamina to be a finite resource that comes back slower and slower every time you spend it. They *will* outlast you. Importantly you only get one chance per boss - you can go on to fight other bosses whenever you like but you failed at that one, your involvement in the fight against it is over.\n\nThat's okay though, because if you're not the last to fight it, you're probably not the first to fight the monster either. Every beast is it's own procedurally generated 'raid boss' style encounter (save for that you fight it solo), and it doesn't heal between players. You die, then another player turns up at the boss, weakens it further, and so on. Eventually someone turns up against a monster so tired and battered that it is a much easier kill.\n\n**Development Challenges:**\n\nFirstly, procedural generation would be a must. Phantom Abyss works because it has unique temples generated each run. A game like this would require interesting bosses to be generated from a wide pool of potential behaviours/mods/components in order to be challenging. Perhaps different environments, environmental hazards, and adds/mooks could contribute to this, but procedural generation of a single entity would be a design challenge to make feel right.\n\nI have limited experience with multiplayer development so I can't really speak to the challenge of asynchronous multiplayer development. You may be able to reconstruct phantoms from previous information shared by the player, tying that information to each boss instance generated (not unlike how the 'how you died' replays in first person shooters work).\n\nYou could perhaps add in a small 'true' multiplayer component as well, allowing players to band together in 2-4 player groups to challenge particularly powerful bosses. This might go against the 'whittle a big beast down gradually' design however, and highly skilled players being able to solo a monster is already a potential problem.\n\nA sense of progression would be difficult to attain in an otherwise rogue-lite experience. Meta-progression (unlockables or purchaseables for your character) would be a must. Perhaps when that final kill happens all players who fought it gain currency reward (for meta-progression) relative to their own contribution. This could be one of two meta-progression resources, another being experience earned when you die against the monster (which isn't contribution scaled allowing everyone to progress somewhat). See Phantom Abyss for how treasure is released when someone frees your trapped phantom. Sharing boss seeds to your friends to get them to help 'free' your earned currency could be a big part of the game.\n\nKey to the idea of 'a staggered raid taking down a big boss one by one', maybe different aspects of the boss can be broken and defeated piecemeal. The leg has a health bar, the wings have health bars, the eye laser attack has health, etc. Deal enough damage to a particular vital area and the boss cannot ever use that mod/component of themselves again, in all future encounters. 'BeastSlayerXXX42069 gouged out the eye of the colossus on the 4th May 2021' could be something that players loading into the arena see. You might have died but your accomplishment and contribution live on.\n\nOtherwise the key development problem would definitely come down to that common procedural generation design issue - how do you make it random enough to be 'new' most times, whilst handcrafted enough as to be identifiable? Whilst a mixture of procedural generation and handcrafted works great for world generation (see Spelunky), it would be very difficult to pull off with enemies. Perhaps some kind of augmentation/mutation system with cronenberg-like monstrosities where different generated 'mods' rolled into the beasties resulted in new appendages or behaviours. Graphically this could become a problem as well, if you wanted the game to look particularly compelling.\n\nAnyway, just thoughts I had this morn whilst procrastinating working on my own project. Hope someone can do something with this!"

As an avid Dr who, Sci-Fi, space and general gaming fan this is something I've wanted to see for a long long time, I'm surprised there has been any decent Dr who games, but when ""NMS"" first came out it piqued my curiosity and want for a game like this. I have zero real knowledge of how to even begin to make it a reality ii am just a simple gamer with a dream for a game. But who wouldnt like to travel time and space in their own T.A.R.D.I.S?\n\n (First post here so apologies for poor formatting (posting on mobile) or any mistakes)"
nk6m4m,A Wrestling MMO,"Yes, I am going there.\n\nThe basic idea is, you make a character, you go to wrestling school (read: tutorial/training/grind), you train your stats, and join a promotion. You have stats such as charisma, technique (which lessens the chance of botches), popularity (which determines your income and crowd reaction), physical heatlh (the lower, the higher the chance of injury), as well as strength, dexterity, and intelligence, which are attributes directly linked to your character's in-ring-performance but only indirectly influence the crowd reaction. Note that popularity is different to crowd reaction. Popularity is your character's general likability while crowd reaction is the intended positive or negative reaction to your character's actions in a match.\n\nBooker: Ther person that determines the match type, and the outcome of the match. Booking is a template the player has to follow to get the best possible outcome and reward for the player. The booker determines what is and isn't allowed, how the match ends, and how long the match lasts.\n\nFace: The ""hero"" in a match that gets cheered on. Has to do everything to get a positive reaction (pop). Usually fights clean, can be beaten down and still able to turn the match in their favor (comeback).\n\nHeel: The ""villain"".  Does everything to get a negative reaction (heat). Fights dirty, and is able to turn the match with illegal tactics (if regular match). Heat also increases by disqualification.\n\nPop: Positive crowd reaction. Important for faces.\n\nHeat: Negative crowd reaction. Important for heels.\n\nTweener: Neutral character that can get away with illegal actions, but can also get a positive crowd reaction. Crowd reaction is limited, however.\n\nTag Team: A team of two wrestlers (and manager or valet) who compete in matches together.\n\nStable: A group of wrestlers or a faction within the promotion that includes 3 or more characters (not counting managers or valets).\n\nRun-In: Interference of another wrestler not scheduled to be involved in the match in any form. A member of a stable, for example, or another face rescuing the face from a predicament.\n\nGimmick: The in-ring's persona's most striking characteristic. Usually is an exaggerated trait (good or bad), but can also be completely made up. Gimmick is up to the player. The character's action, however, DO matter.\n\nSpot: A predetermined event in a match that pushes the story forward. A risky move, a counter that turns the match in the opponent's favor, or someone falling off a ladder or going through a table.\n\nSignature move: The trademark move for a character that sets them apart from other wrestlers. Sometimes a prelude to a finishing move, an invented move, or a spot or variation of said spot. Usually does not end matches, but can.\n\nFinishing move: The move a wrestler uses to end matches. doing a finishing move more than once, unless it didn't work the first time (evasion, counter, etc.) will get a bad crowd reaction.\n\nKayfabe: Immersion in the match and the willingness of the crowd to suspend disbelief. Kayfabe directly affects your character's popularity and decreases crowd reaction. In the game this would mean a face doing heel-ish things, such as using weapons when they aren't allowed or a heel trying to get a positive crowd reaction, as wll as ending a match too quickly or not as intended or injuring a character, or a character making a run-in when not intended, breaks kayfabe and therefore has a negative outcome for both players and the promotion. Also note that low popularity will decrease the chance of employment, as in it affects your gameplay heavily.\n\nYou also have a hometown-buff, which increases popularity whenever a show is held in your hometown (may it be Vienna, Dublin, New York, Buenos Aires, etc). This does not work in Live Shows that have a fixed location.\n\nYou have 2 types of shows: Live shows and taped shows. Well, more like taped shows and house shows, really.\n\nLive Shows are usually ""booked"" on the fly, so improvisation is necessary. Less charisma is required in a live show, and you can become a fan favourite, though popularity, status and income (money you can buy things with, for example additional training equipment or newer, flashier clothes that will boost stats) will be much less. It's basically a quick instance for people who don't have much time or don't want to spend much time in the game. By choice, any rando (free agent) could come in for the show and be booked, if one chooses to do so. They are more forgiving when things don't go as well as planned.\n\nTaped shows, on the other hand are much more time intensive. You have preparation time, and usually it is a series of booked matches. It is much more rewarding, but also a lot more risky, as it can make or break your character. You can only compete in these promotions if you are a part of said promotion.\n\nGameplay would be turn-based. Players have to work together and play their roles for the best outcome. The matches themselves are instances that can last from 10 seconds to 25 minutes (in rare cases, also 60 minutes), depending on match type. Moves performed will either gain pop or heat. It should also be noted that if you gain pop, the character's heat will be decreased and vice versa. Some moves or actions may also gain short term buffs. Objectives (spots, etc.) are fulfilled during the match."
nk5qjo,The 6 degrees of Bacon,"For those that don't know, it is said that any actor or actress can be connected to Kevin Bacon in 6 degrees or less.\n\nIn this game, players take turns trying to connect any given actor/actress to any other actor/actress in order to score points. \n\nTo begin, each player writes down 10 actors/actresses that have had roles in at least 2 or more films on 10 individual pieces of paper/card which are then collected and shuffled. Then each player is dealt three cards.\n\nOnce it is decided which player goes first, that player must take a card from the top of the deck of cards and read the name aloud.\n\nThen the player's opponents must submit a single card from their hand faced down. Once all the submitted cards have been shuffled, the player selects a single card and reads this name aloud in order to start a minute long timer. \n\nIf a player can connect the two actors/actresses in a single connection i.e where they have starred in the same film, the player wins 6 points. The more connections the player needs to make, the less points they will win. Make more than 6 connections and the player will still win a single point but if they cannot make a connection between their pair of actors/actresses before time runs out, they score nothing. \n\nOnce a player has finished their turn, the rest of the submitted cards are placed at the bottom of the deck and opponents replenish their hand of three by taking cards from the top of the deck before the next player's turn begins. \n\nThis game is more for film buffs than anything but any feedback here is good too 🙂"

nk2va1,My video game idea,"I wanna make refrences to a few other games that i think would be good if they merged into one game...  So first off I think this game should be very customizable with a mix gameplay of black and white 2,sims4,gta,manhunt,thief,assassin's creed,skyrim.. I know that is very mixxed up and kinda doesn't make sense but just an idea.. so in black and white 2 u play a god who has control over a certain area/land and u have to go against other areas/lands their might be other games like this already but what im thinking is mix this with sims 4 which gives u the ability to play as the god/head of the world but then just like sims 4 u get to experience the lives of individuals within ur world aswell... so in black and white 2 u get to play different paths depending on how u treat ur lands u get more grim reality streets look more run down ETC... for my idea of a game i want this to be similar to how it plays out... u can build ur world/worlds.. choose to go to war with other worlds/lands whatever choose to be either peaceful and good within ur world or evil and bad within ur world... the process from good to evil must take time and work.. so u cant just change a good land into a bad land or a bad land into a good land you will have to work on it by building infrastructure\n\nChanging the hearts and minds of the people because for this game i think traits should be included for different lets say ""people"" within the game world.. Similar to the way it is for sims 4 with a little exception... different ""types"" of people within the game should come with a collective trait as a group black and white 2 played on this idea a little... but beyond traits as a group also individual traits.. or however it works it should be that their are all types of different people within your population who react differently to different things.. (however this would work).. Next I think relationships within ur population should also be a thing similar to the way it is in sims 4 also with the made up language in sims 4 i think stuff becomes less repetitive but for this game i think it should be less goofy... probably a  impossible task but i think it should still be suggested... that their are different made up languages within the game that are similar to real world languages.. kinda like that Dothraki language from game of thrones? I think that language would fit for a type of people with harsh traits..\n\n Next the actual gameplay of the game... Well I already said i think u should have the ability to play the game as a lord in the sky and then u can play as a individual but what to do as a individual? well similar to sims 4 if ur living in a peaceful place or even a bad place u should be able to live and do jobs within the land... even in black and white 2 u can select a random person and put them to work and then follow their life until they grew old and die... it should be this way in this game... how long u play as a individual depends on you.. (or until they die) but the lifespan should be customizable depending on ur tastes... u should also be able to follow this individual's life from childhood (going to schools built within the land aswell) now for the gameplay about gta,manhunt,thief,assasin's creed and skyrim... So lets say you dont want to be a good schoolkid and become a good adult... you can start doing bad things from childhood in this game... using similar mechanics to these games because once u play an individual it wont be like sims but more like gta u know... so what do u want to do? steal cars if u want or become a serial killer like manhunt a soldier like imperial legion skyrim or a thief within the land and assassin's creed to become a assassin and parkour legend... also the overall happiness,stability,peace should matter throughout the entire land and if u move from a bad land to a good land you should feel the effect... as different people with different traits will react differently and the overall peace of an area will get different reactions.. well that's about it i think."
nk2ug1,Cyberpunk Resource Management/Strategy/Socially Complicated Idea...,"Cyberpunk is kinda the style du-jour lately, but I got thinking about something that Cyberpunk (both the TTRPG as well as the recent buggy AAA video game) touch on that really could have been expanded on. Characters in Cyberpunk are connected to each other, and those connections factor into how a given conflict or story could unfold, or exactly how dire the consequences of success or failure could be if your character isn't really invested in the fates of everyone else. Imagine a game where you build up a faction of cyberpunk style characters into a personalized faction (gang? crime syndicate? revolutionaries? mercs? corp clean up team?) that is in competition with any number of other similar factions on a city scale. Think..  \n\n\n\- XCOM2 style basebuilding of an underground lair/front/base/etc.. who joins up with you might depend on the kind of front you set up. Nightclubs attract all types of folks and earn good money. But when they get that soundproof booth in the basement, the biz starts really coming in. Merc hideouts are well hidden and protected, but expensive. Standard level work won't pay the rent here forever. Streetdoc clinics get lots of wounded, and those that live are pretty thankful. But once they discovered you were using expired synth-kidneys and twitchy neuroadapters on the sly, biz didn't do so good. And so on..\n\n\- Shadow of War style NPC generation, including concepts like class, skill specialties, fashion style, and most importantly, relationships with other NPCs and players. Can you really trust them? How do you know? What kind of things have they gotten involved with with the other NPCs/PCs? How will that change? Could an enemy suddenly become a good friend because of a single choice? Could someone be stabbed in the back by somone they thought they loved? What happens when you save the life of a friend that was secretly an assassin sent to kill you? And so on..\n\n\- 'upgrade' or 'adapt' your Faction members over time with cybernetics, cool gear, a wide variety of weapons and attachments. Sometimes because you can! Sometimes because you have to. Maybe that one merc friend you have needs a new arm after losing one in a firefight. Or maybe that streetdoc could use new eyes so he can start doing more complicated work. Just remember, if it ain't nailed down it could still be stolen or lost. And if its hardwired to your skin well, some people don't care so much about that. And so on..\n\n\- combat (in whatever form it takes) is chunky, brutal and quickly resolved.

nk2tab,A horror game concept with a senior citizen diseased.,"So these days i finished the game resident evil 7, And now im gonna play the saga silent hill and after finish the game one thing comes in my head, ""**What if there a game where we play with a 60-65 diseased man/woman and have to survive with these illnesses.""**\n\nFor example im the game i have pneumonia and i have to cover my mouth to the enemy dont hear me coughing, I cant run too much because of the age, i have amnesia and only can advance in the part when the character remember for a example i go to the objective but the character cant go until he remember and in this intervale that he gonna remember you need to hide from the enemy, The last example i have is the character have parkison syndrome and he has limited movement like he cant crouch he cant lie down and run he can only hide on cabinets and escape from the enemy without the enemy seeing him.\n\nIm with this idea in my mind for a month and i wanted to pass this concept for you guys because i dont see too much games and never see a horror game with a old-aged man/woman. What you do you think of this concept?."
nk1i80,"I am developing a card game where cards create 3d units on a hex map, but ran out of ideas.","Hi, I am developing an online card game. These cards have effects as the usual ""spell"" cards on different card games or may create a 3d unit on a hexagonal map, that can move and attack by turns. I already have this working and have units that do this and that when attacking or entering the board, nevertheless, I need good ideas on what units could do so that strategic positioning is a part of the game and you can build combos with different units. Thanks a lot!"
nk10za,"Almost done with my fighting game character ideas, just need some last input","This theme that consist of both horror-scifi-fantasy elements into one will have a different range of characters but I want some feedback on which one of these choices for these particular themed characters would be the best.\n\nA yeti beast from the Himalayan mountains from a yeti clan? Or an augmented ape beast with cybernetic enhancements?\n\nAn average MMA fighter that can change from human form to werewolf? Or a huge MMA fighter with enhanced body augmentations?\n\nA gorgon snake creature from a hidden ruins from Greece, with Greek themes? Or from somewhere deep in the Amazon jungles with an Amazon theme?\n\nAnd last one, would a female Amazonian warrior with tribal Mayan/Aztec themes from a secret hidden temple come off as offensive? If so, I will reconsider using it for something different.\n\nThank you again.\n\nThis is to get the best opinions, because their designs will play a big role in the choices, thanks."

njrs1l,Please! Ideas for my cat game,"Hi. I want to make a game which you play as a cat. It has to be a 2D game and not very complex, since I'm a beginner.\nI haven't decided the genre yet."
njood6,Animal Crossing but with gross creepy Zerg-like themes instead of innocent children and animals,"I think it’d be fun to play a game with the intimate and slower pacing of Animal Crossing but working towards a cooler purpose, like developing your swarm of semi-gross aliens."

njkr9s,Ideas for single player first person game? (3d),"Not too advanced ideas, I'am intermediate dev."
njjp8w,Star Wars,"A Star Wars game with the style of Halo Wars.\nMaybe have different campaigns for the 3 era's. You can unlock special units, upgrades and hero/villain characters by completing each campaign on different difficulties.\nHave 2 campaigns for each era where you play as either faction.\nMaybe add in special modes where you battle special enemies like death troopers(the zombie ones), planet specific enemies(Geonosians, Umbarans, Twi'leks, Death Watch and the Super Commandos, Wookies, etc. and maybe have random planet specific creature attacks(Nexu, Massiff, Vixus, etc.)."
njj8et,Rockstar collab,"I think it would be really cool, also expensive, if rockstar were to collab with Disney and create a Star Wars game. In which you start as a stormtrooper with a plan to take over the whole empire.\n\nI don’t know if someone has came up with already but it just crossed my mind and thought of sharing that concept."
njgwiv,Turn Based Combat Sim But Actions Are Queued Up And Applied At Once,"In turn based combat sims you usually play out an entire turn where you move all of your units one after another, or the units are shuffled so you and your opponent take turns moving a single unit at a time.\n\nMy idea is a turn based combat sim where you queue up your entire teams actions at once (as well as your opponent) and play them all out together.\n\nSome actions would make other actions impossible (pawn A blow up bridge, pawn B run across bridge) so it would need to be coded in a way where the pawns verify their action is still possible throughout performing them or having them halt midway through if their action suddenly becomes impossible."
njeyb9,Game Documentation,Is documentation really that important?
njcqjz,Medieval zombie apocolypse?,"I'd love to see an open world, possibly pve online medieval type game where you can explore and build up villages to defend etc.\nI can just imagine roaming through fields and forests with the looming threat of undead hordes stalking the wilderness as I make camp each night.\nWould love to make this myself but unfortunately I know nothing about coding :("

njay9y,Opinions,Ok so I have a game idea but if I write it right does it sound like something you'd play.\n\n So here's the summary.....You play as a teenager in a weird landscape and your goal is to collect items but it's not required to finish the game but towards the end of the game and a little though out something try's to break through (there is also enemies) and when you reach the end of the game you find out that those items you can collect were there to distract you from what was happening in reality. \n\nSo does that sound like a good game also it would be 2d

njamfs,Game Ideas,[Link](https://sctgames.blogspot.com/)
nja1dr,1 vs All Multiplayer Tactical Shooter inspired by Rambo or Die Hard,"Imagine you are the ""hero"" of an action thriller, deployed in a closed-off environment with nothing but a basic gun and a knife. You have to eliminate all players on the enemy team or do some sort of objective (detonate a bomb, save 1 or more hostages, etc.). You use the environment to your advantage. You hide, sneak up on enemies that are wandering alone, and pick them off one by one. Eliminating an enemy drops all their guns and gadgets which you can pick up and use against the rest.\n\nThe enemy team is composed of 5-10 players who don't know where you are, but they know that you're coming for them. They don't have a radar or minimap or death counter of any kind, so they don't know when one of their teammates is eliminated.\n\nMaps would need a lot of cover and places to hide. There should be many routes to get to the objective. For example, if we have a skyscraper map, you can use the elevator, take the stairs, climb through air ducts or even break windows and scale the building walls from the outside.\n\nPlaying as the ""hero"" would probably only appeal to the most hardcore shooter fans, but using stealth and strategy I think even intermediate players could do well. Also, it would lead to a lot of amazing moments when you're in a tense 1v5 firefight and you come out as the winner."
nj7r6r,Eldritch Horror without fighting,"Share some ideas on how you would make game centering around the Eldritch Horror theme but your main character cannot fight the creatures (ie. while they can fight or struggle to get away, they’re not picking up an assault rifle and going toe to tentacles with things)\n\nWhat would the character look and act like?\nWhat mythos would you use? (Bonus points for non-Cthulhu gods)\n\n\nOff-topic: First  time posting so I’d thought I’d start with getting creative juices going!"
nj4mxe,Help Evil Corp take corporate domination and take over and destroy the planet forever.,"When I was a kid I used to play this game called Syndicate, It was like a cyberpunk thing where you go around zapping people and taking over their minds. I'm sure there was a lot more to it than that but I cant really remember.  So I imagine the atmosphere of this game would look a lot like Syndicate, but the mechanics more like something like civilization mixed with something of a mafia or sim city type vein.  But your job is literally to destroy the planet... You have to figure out way to dump oil on beaches, destroy nature, log forests, turn entire swaths of the planet into mindless drones through drugs, advertising and media manipulation, buy politicians to get your laws passed, assassinate all the pesky do-gooders and whoever gets in your way, take over competitive companies, keep new eco technologies from ever seeing the light of day, all while staying a well respected businessman. (you lose the game by getting caught, not bribing the right people, or having the laws passed etc. money goes into  patent law, bribery, buying out competition, you know all the regular corporate stuff.)\n\n\nMaybe this will teach people a little more about how its done, raise awareness a little. I'm really not sure how I feel about the mental impact a game like this would have on the player. And of course the problem with real corporations is way more nuanced than this, but Im getting at the tactics at work behind corporate shenanigans that are hidden from most people. I feel like there are so many real life examples to be used in something like this."
nj1h2z,A game that uses both desktop and mobile,"I've been messing around with the idea of making a desktop game that connects to your mobile device through a link to get inputs or display info. My first thought was to use the mobile as a gamepad controller and make twin stick shooter but that seemed very uninspired and I wanted to try something unique. Would love suggestions on what I could make.\n\nNotes: The only inputs that can be made on mobile is the touchscreen, can't use gyro or tilt functionality. Also, I want to minimise the load on mobile, so preferably something light and minimal would be best"
nj0yc1,"I really think that an open world Wonder Woman video game would go over well with DC Fans, Superhero fans, gamers, and people overall",
nj0ka7,Unique city builder themes/settings?,"The more unrealistic the  better. Yet it still has commercial, industrial, residential zoning etc.\n\n* Pseudo-Stone age city builder. Not limited to caveman villages, but all the buildings look like they are made out of stone. Bit like Flintstones without dinosaurs.\n\n* Hell city builder. City builder in hell. Resource gathering, required walls and fortifications against Demons. Some mild Factorio elements (supplying the defenses) and Anno elements (with a bit of combat on top of the city building)\n\n* Cardboard box, toy city builder. Buildings out of cardboard, cars and people look plastic. Otherwise, the economy and infrastructure is as complex as a normal city builder, the setting just looks like a scrappy cardboard diorama.\n\n* Transport-focused arcadey city builder that really leans into ""as many trains as possible, as many planes as possible"". Roads exist only around buildings in a square, no extra roads can be built. Rails are hyper efficient and can do unrealistic, roller coaster like paths even for heavy long trains."

nipdz1,Mad science - Disrupting the tech tree mechanic,"The idea of disrupting the vanilla tech tree mechanic.\n\nI've seen games do tech trees/research in a couple ways\n\n1. In game menu, spend resources to unlock\n2. Randomized unlock (gambling almost)\n3. Find it in the world, you can research it without needing dependencies via tree\n\nWhat if research has failure? What if that failure was fun?\n\nThe premise, is that the tech tree is hidden information mostly, procedurally generated server side, such that all players have the same tech tree.\n\nYou may or may not know/see end goal (recipes). In the cases that you know what you are trying to build, but don't yet know it, it tells you generic categories that you may need. Example of this is a car engine. You need to know electronics, combustion, mechanical kinetic conversions (gears, pistons, etc).\n\nRegarding failure... things explode. Maybe your nuclear reactor melts down while trying to fix/upgrade it.\n\nMaybe you create a genetically engineered super bee by accident, and it infests your laboratory.\n\nMaybe you are doing advanced particle physics and you create a black hole that destroys your lab. Or a rift to another world/dimension that aliens/demons come through to reek havoc.\n\nShare successes and failures with friends. Mislead your competition with false data?"

nie04x,Game Idea: Ship building + Pirating game | MMOG,"Okay so imagine:\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nYou start off in a little row boat in the middle of a massive procedurally generated ocean world with lots of little islands to explore. You paddle around and collect resources (driftwood, fish, etc) and do little side quest missions and get paid in booty (gold, rubies, treasure etc). As you collect more stuff, you can upgrade your vessel.\n\n**Vessel upgrading:**\n\nYou start off in a small row boat. But you can quickly increase the square footage of your vessel by paying wood + iron. You can use gold to hire more crew mates. It would be a similar vibe as Sims, just for a boat (a bit more constrained of course). You can upgrade to a multi-level boat. You can install cannons (strength) + more sails (speed). The bigger the boat, the more gold you need to hire crew. For the crew, you need kitchens, sleeping quarters, etc. You can also have a hierarchy within your crew (chief mate (you), second mate, third mate, etc). These crew members can gain XP when battling or completing missions. Experienced crew operate the ship more efficiently (++speed, ++strength). There can be all sorts of cool upgrades that you can do on your ship.\n\n**Fighting:**\n\nBattle other (real) players who you encounter on the big open ocean will of course be an important aspect of the game. All online players sailing around in the same massive world. There will be lots of skill and strategy involved in battling another ship. How strong is your ship? 32 cannons? How agile and fast is your boat? If you win, you get all the reserve ""booty"" that the other ship had in the form of treasures chests that float in the water as the other ship is sinking. You may even nab a few of the opponents crewmates. It would of course be best to sail around with a gang of pirate friends so that if you do cross paths with an enemy, you can easily defeat them. You and your friends can all design your sail colors and flags the same to represent your gang identity.\n\n**Quests:**\n\nThere will be lots of side quests and missions that you can do in the world. Completing these give you resources and bounty. These quests are mainly found amongst the millions of small scattered islands and lagoons. Quests are typically fulfilling bounties. For example, kill a sea monster and receive 1000 gold coins. Or defeat a local group of pirates and get a free ship upgrade. These quests will help your battling skills (needed for when you encounter real players on the open seas!)\n\n**Item collecting:**\n\nLike games like Diablo &amp; Elder Scrolls, one of the most addicting parts of the game will be the item collecting. Besides the ordinary things like fish, wood, gold, minerals, etc. You can find rare artifacts that can be embedded or placed o your ship to boost various attributes. These rare artifacts can be obtained through side quests or just simply found.\n\n**More:**\n\nThere will also be ""neutral"" waters and islands. Here you can trade with other players, sell/buy goods from local merchants, and anchor your ship without having to fear attack. The map should be procedurally generate (endless) except for maybe a handful of the neutral areas that are designed by hand. Side quests should be endless (like Diablo).\n\nI have so many more ideas about the game... But curious what people think of the idea!"

For the crew, you need kitchens, sleeping quarters, etc. You can also have a hierarchy within your crew (chief mate (you), second mate, third mate, etc). These crew members can gain XP when battling or completing missions. Experienced crew operate the ship more efficiently (++speed, ++strength). There can be all sorts of cool upgrades that you can do on your ship.\n\n**Fighting:**\n\nBattle other (real) players who you encounter on the big open ocean will of course be an important aspect of the game. All online players sailing around in the same massive world. There will be lots of skill and strategy involved in battling another ship. How strong is your ship? 32 cannons? How agile and fast is your boat? If you win, you get all the reserve ""booty"" that the other ship had in the form of treasures chests that float in the water as the other ship is sinking. You may even nab a few of the opponents crewmates. It would of course be best to sail around with a gang of pirate friends so that if you do cross paths with an enemy, you can easily defeat them. You and your friends can all design your sail colors and flags the same to represent your gang identity.\n\n**Quests:**\n\nThere will be lots of side quests and missions that you can do in the world. Completing these give you resources and bounty. These quests are mainly found amongst the millions of small scattered islands and lagoons. Quests are typically fulfilling bounties. For example, kill a sea monster and receive 1000 gold coins. Or defeat a local group of pirates and get a free ship upgrade. These quests will help your battling skills (needed for when you encounter real players on the open seas!)\n\n**Item collecting:**\n\nLike games like Diablo &amp; Elder Scrolls, one of the most addicting parts of the game will be the item collecting. Besides the ordinary things like fish, wood, gold, minerals, etc. You can find rare artifacts that can be embedded or placed o your ship to boost various attributes. These rare artifacts can be obtained through side quests or just simply found.\n\n**More:**\n\nThere will also be ""neutral"" waters and islands. Here you can trade with other players, sell/buy goods from local merchants, and anchor your ship without having to fear attack. The map should be procedurally generate (endless) except for maybe a handful of the neutral areas that are designed by hand. Side quests should be endless (like Diablo).\n\nI have so many more ideas about the game... But curious what people think of the idea!"
ni4b5l,PrivApes - a game about army monkeys with bad puns for names,"This idea is nothing too special, it would certainly be a game about a war between apes, but i really would love to see a game using those punny names for enemies/players/units/etc.\n\nGuerilla gorillas\n\nAttack macaques\n\nBonobombers\n\nChimpanzer\n\nOrangutanks\n\nLemurderers\n\nAnd there are probably much more like these.

nhzl4i,Avatar the Last Airbender Deckbuilding Roguelike,"Imagine a Slay the Spire-type game with ATLA characters. You play as either Toph, Aang, Katara, Zuko, or Sokka, crawling through a procedurally generated dungeon using turn-based, synergy heavy deckbuilding combat. Each character has their own starting passive ability, cards to choose from, and slightly different mechanics.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nPlot: Like Slay the Spire, the plot is minimal to non-existent. It would be non-cannon &amp; implausible to the continuity. It would be almost dreamlike.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\n***In this section, I just kinda explain the mechanics of Slay the Spire, so you can skip over this if you already know the game\n\nLike Slay the Spire, you’d go through a procedurally generated dungeon, taking down opponents room-by-room to reach the boss at the end. You build &amp; utilize a deck of cards, each corresponding to different bending moves &amp; techniques in turn-based combat. And just like STS, you can always see the opponent’s next intended move so you can plan accordingly. Along the way, you collect items that provide unique passive abilities (like Spirit Water, Glider, Bison Whistle, the Waterbending Scroll, White Lotus Tile, ect.) Each time you defeat a room, you are allowed to choose 1 of 3 random cards to add to your deck.\n\nEach card costs energy, and you begin the game with a maximum of 3. Each turn, your energy is restored. Each character’s starting deck would contain 5 basic attack cards, 5 block cards (which work like temporary HP that disappears at the start of your next turn), and 2 special character-specific cards. Cards can all be upgraded once; some cards are granted a damage increase or a block increase, some have their energy cost lowered, some gain an edition also effect, ect.\n\nThe path to the end is branching, so to choose a path, you always will be able to see what each room is on the map: Normal Combat, Mini-Boss Combat, Healing &amp; Upgrade Site, Shop, Mystery Room, or Treasure Room.\n\nLike every roguelike, if you die, you start over with a new dungeon, and because of the randomness, no two runs of the game are similar. You have to adapt your strategy throughout each play run, meaning the only way to advance further is to get better at the game.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nWhile I’d love the game to be more-or-less a knockoff of Slay the Spire, there are some ideas I have that would make it unique:\n\n• Elemental Interaction System •\n\n\nSome waterbending moves could inflict a “Soaked” debuff on targets. The debuff would stack &amp; diminish each turn. Soaked targets could be frozen, sapped of moisture for bonus energy, lowered mobility (whatever that means in a turn-based game), and dealt half Fire damage &amp; double Lightning damage.\n\nSome fire moves would set opponents ablaze. While Airbending would dry Soaked enemies off &amp; put out flames. Water &amp; Earth could interact to make mud, Water &amp; Air could make mist, ect.\n\n• Environments •\n\nBecause the Avatar world involves manipulating the elements, which cards can be played will often depend on the surrounding environment. The randomly generated surrounding area could be made of wood, earth, or metal. It could be flooded, causing all the enemies to start combat with the Soaked debuff, or there could be plants to draw moisture from or control. I think the dungeons would be randomly selected from a few environments. I imagine things like The Swamp, North Pole, Cave of Two Lovers, Spirit World, Sun Sage Temple, Boiling Rock, Day of Black Sun, a Fire Nation Ship Convoy, ect. Each environment will have different bending resources, different opponents, and therefore, different tactics. \n\nEx. In a Swamp environment, enemies will likely be wet, so a Zuko player would have to focus on abilities that utilize his swords, or dry off enemies. However, Fire attacks would do more damage to plant enemies.\n\nEx. Toph’s cards that utilize her Seismic Sense won’t always work on snow or wood. There could be a few cards that provide her with Earth to stand on in these cases, or she can focus on Metalbending.\n\n• Character Encounters •\n\nAlong the way, the player could encounter characters from the show in the mystery rooms. Depending on the character, these encounters could do several different things. Either for free, as a prize if you beat them in a fight, or in exchange for a trade-off, these characters will give you certain unique rewards.\n\nA master could spar with you, unlocking a new bending subtype if you win (metalbending, plantbending, sandbending, sword mastery for sokka, ect). This would unlock a whole new pool of cards to find.\n\nThe character may teach you a valuable move, granting you a card that cannot be unlocked anywhere else, like Iroh teaching you lightning redirection. Or Bumi teaching you about neutral jing.\n\nAnd depending on different factors, some characters will even accompany you for the rest of your run. This includes characters like Suki, Ty Lee, Mai, Momo, Appa, any of the Freedom Fighters, and if you can afford it, Combustion Man or June. These characters joining your party act as passive assists who stand beside you in battle.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nFinally, let’s discuss characters:\n\n🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊\n\nKatara would have cards dealing with Water, Ice, and Healing. She would need to manage her water sources in order to bend, and could unlock the Water Pouch item to increase her total energy each turn. She could also learn how to Plantbend or even Bloodbend if she meets Hama. (Again, non-cannon)\n\nSome of her signature moves that would be incorporated include:\n\n• Water Whip\n\n• Water Arms\n\n• Octopus Form\n\n• Wave Surfing\n\n• Healing\n\n• Icicles\n\n🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨\n\nToph would be able to see multiple enemy intents using her seismic sense. She would be a defensive character with more heavy &amp; costly attacks than light &amp; cheap ones. Since Toph “waits &amp; listens,” her main strong suit would be cards that plan ahead. I imagine cards that grant benefits to Toph next turn, as well as cards that prepare reactions (like “prevent the next time you would be dealt melee damage, then inflict Defense Down on the attacker”). She focuses on incapacitating enemies, thinking ahead, &amp; attacking straight-on. Over time, she could unlock Metal Bending, Sand Bending, and Lava Bending.\n\nSome of her signature moves include:\n\n• Earth Armor\n\n• Seismic Sense\n\n• Earth Tunnel\n\n• Dust Cloud\n\n• Neutral Jing\n\n🪃🪃🪃🪃🪃🪃\n\nSokka’s cards would involve his machete &amp; boomerang, his wit, and most importantly: his strategic prowess. He could have skills that bend the rules, taunt enemies, and manipulate his cards with skills that draw, reorder, discard, duplicate, shuffle, ect. He would be a very cost-efficient character, being able to play more cards per turn (in fact, I think his passive ability would be drawing more cards per turn.) His runs would also have more character encounters, as he meets Piandao, Hakota, the inventor man (forgot the name), Suki, Yue, and Hawky.\n\nSome of his signature moves include:\n\n• Boomerang\n\n• Sand Attack (like his fight with Piandao)\n\n• Space Sword\n\n• Sneak Attack\n\n🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nZuko would utilize Firebending, twin swords, and semi-acrobatics to be a high-damaging character. Along the way, he could learn Lightning Redirection from Iroh, or dancing dragon style from the Sun Sages. He could run into Jet and be given the choice to fight him or hide all of his firebending for the rest of the run in exchange for adding the freedom fighters to the party.\n\nSome of his signature moves include:\n\n• Twin Swords\n\n• Aerial Fireball\n\n• Lightning Redirection\n\n• Fire Onslaught"

nhtwcq,Open World in games that are usually not so open,"So this probably has been suggested already, and I feel like it's not an original idea but I haven't seen it so here goes.\nI've always wanted a racing game that would not be racing only, instead that would be the ""main questline"" of the game. We could leave our vehicle and go around exploring, personally buying things for our car, maybe doing some action sequence missions tied to the main story, or just exploring, but the main missions would be more race related (since it's primarily a racing game, only bigger and with more freedom). I've imagined the same thing for fighting games, like boxing and stuff where we could have our apartment and go out to train in the gym and explore the city and meet people for quests. I wonder why hasn't anyone made a game like that yet, mixing up the genres. I think it could be pretty cool and even help set up new standards."
nht5jt,Vampire Valheim - Survival horror where you are the monster,"So Valheim-esque where you survive, craft, hunt, boss fight, progress through biomes and get stronger with all your skills.\n\nBut you are a primordial evil being that devours souls.\n\nYou start off naked and alone, hurt by sunlight so you are only active at night. Defeating enemies grants you a portion of their power. Deer - speed, Boars - strength, Frogs - leap, Humans - resistance to sunlight so you can be active for longer. Your appearance could even change depending on how proficient you were with skills, lvl 99 flight may have big wings, can always hide with clothing.\n\nYou can craft simple things but need knowledge from human civilisations scattered throughout the world to build bigger and better equipment, houses, forges etc. \n\nFirst island you are trapped on because water burns you, you must obtain the knowledge of boats to progress. Each biome is a different theme of human civilization. Viking -wood &amp; boats, Medieval - metal &amp; range, Egyptian - stone &amp; magic, Feudal Japan - black powder &amp; alchemy.\n\nEach biome would have human villages or cities you could terrorise, hide in, destroy or subjugate depending on how you treat the population and their figures of power. Kill - absorb 100% power but raise population fear, Let live - raise fear and renown, Thrall - give power to raise renown. Some civilisations will hate and fear you, some will try and hunt you down, some may worship you openly or in secret.\n\nBosses would be high ruling figures of the population or other monsters from their mythology. Gathering materials is for armour, weapons or magic ingredients - valheim food, or buildings. \n\nCombat can be unarmed, various weapons, mana can be used to cast spells - fireball, wolf transform, invisibility. All ranking up with usage and depending on the enemies you farm for power.\n\nMultiplayer means different civilisations fear/worship different beasts or monsters and may hunt your feral friend who kills all their sheep but whisper prayers to you who saved their king from a Troll."
nhrhya,Games Ideas,[Link](https://sctgames.blogspot.com/)
nhrh3y,Animal Spirit: An open world puzzle game similar to Myst where you are the ghost of an animal,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nMost ghost stories involve human ghosts, or evil creature type ghosts, but in this game you’re the ghost of a dog or cat.  You were murdered by mean people that abuse animals.  Your unfinished business to to help animals in distress and to bring your killers to justice.\n\nThe game is a blend of Myst and a Nintendo GameCube game called “Geist”, where you were a disembodied spirit that could possess objects and living things (although in this game you can only possess certain objects). In the physical world, you need to possess objects and do things with them to accomplish certain tasks and progress. In spirit realms, you can interact with your environment more easily, but you don’t want to be out of the physical world for too long or you will be pulled into the afterlife and the game is over.  Sometimes, there are portals to a spirit realm, but other times you are sucked in automatically.  Throughout the game, you can interact with other ghosts (human and animal), and in some cases you will need to accomplish tasks with them to progress.\n\nYou can play as either a dog or a cat, and you can adjust the physical appearance at the start of the game.  Dogs are more social, and may be better at interactions with other ghosts. Cats, on the other hand, may be better at some solitary tasks.  I recommend that dogs and cats have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nMovement is 3-D and open world.  You appear solid in a spirit realm and translucent in the physical world.  As with all ghosts, gravity has no impact on you, and you can move through solid objects and orient yourself in any direction (there is no “up” or “down”).  In a spirit realm, you cannot move through objects, since your environment’s reality phase is the same as yours.\n\nYou win the game when you have saved all of the animals throughout the game and brought your killers to justice. You lose by either not escaping a spirit realm in time or failing to accomplish mission critical objectives.  Either way, you go to the afterlife at the end of the game, whether your business is finished or not.\n\nThe game should involve complex puzzles like the games in the Myst series."
nhqngj,My custom gun maker game in scratch (far from done),This is a game I have been working on for about a week now. It's still far from done and there's no objective but the gun maker funktion is almost done so please take a look and see if you can make some fun combinations!\n\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/530084347\n\n(Btw i did the math and there is 41160 different combinations)
nhktql,SugarCave,"In this game i was thinking of a game that has a candy theme open world going on but it a high stakes platformer &amp; puzzles solve. This is similar to hollow knight or Mario but 3d like it takes two but solo for most part. The main story line is about a gummy, marshmallow and jelly boy that is trying to stop the  infestation genre engineered insects. This insects where sent by a company that would like to mine the cave for resources. The main gameplay is focus on Guerrilla War tactics and completing puzzles. There is cosmetics for the player to achieve and there is a multiplayer where you race through the platforms with other players just finished first at the finish line. Other game mode where you begin chase by players and have to beat insects along the way like minecraft sped runs. Next gamemode would be a swarm Arena where you fight different insects like shadow of war. The enemies can survive if you make them retreat but they will hold  a grudge on you and try to randomly attack you when free roaming on platforms or you are back in the area. The free roaming lets you take rescue missions bounteous races and random mini games. There is two hubs one for the player and another one for multi player. The player can have a home base for themselves and customize it and the multi player hub is more of large market city to shop with in game currency. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and critiques"
nhkl5g,played alien path before and liked it?,"kinda checking if any1 will like this idea.\n\nso itll be you as a group of ninjas in diff color outfits vs the enemy pirates\n\nyour powers will be ninja scrolls that u level up (think anime). pirate bosses have abilities too (think more anime)\n\nstory: camera zooms in on dojo on group of islands. inside, ninjas are training.\n\none angry ninja goes up to sensei, ""we've been training all our lives sensei, whats the point of all this?"". all nins quiet down to hear response.\n\nsensei: ""patience my children, a day will come when the world will need you all""\n\n**KABOOM** giant canonball busts through dojo.\n\ndazed sensei: ""i sense a great disturbance upon us. go my children, find out whats wrong"" (haha, i cant write)\n\ni was programming this for android a few months ago. i had some basic mechanics working then the laptop died on me and i had to put it on hold. ill prolly buy another laptop soon to have another try at it. unless someone else wanna program it for me :P"
nhji3x,How would a science based magic game work?,"Hear me out a game focused around magic in a sci-fi futuristic world where ""Spells"" aren't obtained via spellbooks but by mixing various chemicals and materials from the periodic table \n\nExample to make corrosive poison you would need to mix bromine and piranha solution or to make a fireball you'd need Calcium Acetate and Isopropyl Alcohol plus a way to light it with your tech \n\nI think it'd be fun personally science can make some amazing thing in the real world and I think using science to make ""Magic"" is a nice take on the idea of Witchcraft Alchemy and Wizardry\n\nLet me know what you think"

nhdgrr,1v1 Randomized FPS,"So I've signed up to reddit to be able to have a place where I can output all the little ideas I get while gaming, most will probably be eh but maybe one will be a hidden gem to someone and they will act on it and I will have a fun game to play :D\n\nSo I just thought about this today.\n\n1v1 Randomized FPS - What does this mean?\n\nI was thinking of having a case opening system like csgo, but whatever gun/weapon you get from the box you will have to use for the round. I think having a bo3 or bo5 will be best. The 3 randomized items you should be able to get would be an ability, main weapon, and some sort of utility. But heres the catch, you will get a certain amount of money every round like in csgo/valorant so you could choose where you want to spend your cash on. Do you have a T1 or a T3 rifle? well maybe the tier 1 could be $500 and the tier 3 could be $2000 with the tier 3 doing more damage. Utility could consists of multiple smoke grenades, stimshots, hearbeat sensor, etc.  I really enjoy doing 1v1s in various games and I think this would add a pretty cool twist and the matches could go pretty fast. For the abilties im still not sure on but im sure i could add on to it later if anyone would like to hear more. Let me know what you think or if theres games similar to this already!"

nh8ske,Procedurally Generated Hunter/Gatherer RTS,"This game will be similar in theme to Oregon Trail, only it will be centered on a tribe of stone age humans. There is no enemy except starvation and fickle mother nature. The tribe will grow and shrink based on the player's success gathering resources from the environment. Each play session will take place in a procedurally generate  map with different resources scattered about the map. At the end of the play session the tribe will move on to a new map with fresh resources. \n\nDuring a play session the player will need to send out tribesmen to scout the new area and locate resources such as berries, animals, water, wood, and flit. Harvesting tribesmen can the sent out with the appropriate tools to gather these resources. Wild Animals can be hunted but also may pose a threat to gatherers. \n\nGathering enough food and water for the tribe's needs will result in population growth between play sessions. Failure to gather enough will result in some tribes men abandoning your tribe   between play sessions. Also casualties from Wild Animals persist between play session. The number of tribesmen the player can have in the field is determined by tribe population. The type of tribesman is determined by the tools on hand. Tools can be constructed from gathered flint or traded at random events between play sessions."

nh3tgd,Underwater Photography Simulator,"I wanted to share the idea I had for an open world game about underwater exploration. The game would be set on Earth in realistic aquatic environments. You would play as an underwater photographer with the goal of documenting as many species species of aquatic organisms as possible, aswell as documenting the various behaviors of said species.\n\nThe gameplay would consist of SCUBA diving in various environments on Earth to look for and photograph various species. I don't think I would want realistic SCUBA diving mechanics, I would just want to explore the ocean unimpeded.\n\nSome species would only appear under specific circumstances, and other species would have unique behaviors under various circumstances. For example, some predators may only come out to hunt at night. Some species are migratory and only appear on certain days, and some species prey on said migratory species. Some species, such as corals, only reproduce on certain days. To photograph these species/behaviors, the game could tell you when they are likely to happen. You would have to plan out some dives ahead of time to have a chance to encounter some of the more unique things in the game.\n\nYou would also be able to randomly encounter very rare species. Some examples of rarer species might include deepwater sharks such as megamouth sharks, some pelagic fish such as the ocean sunfish, and some Cetaceans.\n\nPlease tell me what you think about my idea, and where I need to improve it.\n\nThis idea is heavily inspired by the Endless Ocean series."

ngy2wj,Splinter cell like battle royale,"ok so hear me out. The entire map in this game would have light areas and dark areas it would also be small. Unlike splinter cell you don't have night vision, but there are gadgets around like thermal goggles and a flashlight which like in chaos theory are only useful if you want to really make sure there are people there(a flashlight isn't in chaos theory but having a weapon that is turned on or off and  may reveal both your self and enemy players is interesting).  the only way to kill is to land on someone's head or  sneak behind them. At the end of the round dead players will come back as armed mercenaries(can't pick up items) (can be killed) and if your opponent dies from you or them first, you win."
ngx8e0,"Online Life Simulator, but you have roles","That's it. That is the idea...

ngtd47,A concept I posted on the CnC subreddit but gained little to no attention.,"~~~~~~Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 4 ~~~~~~\n\nSometime after the Events of Uprising, FutureTech Corp. has nearly taken over the World, but several fraudulent and anti-competitive practices has led the Corporation into a trial by the newly-formed International Alliance for Global Defence (IAGD) in the IAGD Unified Court in Paris, France. They were severely weakened by this series of trials and revelations. Someone took advantage of this, the Soviet Underground, though weak, managed to capture the FutureTech headquarters, the HQ doesn't have any guards outside-in because they were banned to do so by the IAGD. Now that the  Underground has taken control of the Corporation, they reclaim their former territories in Eurasia, but they had a problem reclaiming their former territories in the Arab World, another one has risen too. Recently, terrorist groups all around the Arab World have united to form one big and terrifying Alliance, the Sons of God. This Radical Alliance has occupied the entire Arab World including The USSR's former Arab territories (Namely Iraq, Syria, and Libya) and is threatening to also occupy other countries. Because of this, the USSR, temporarily led by their most successful Commander (who also have taken FutureTech Spokesperson Kelly Weaver as a Sex Slave [as their forces transport the frozen bodies of Premier Anatoly Cherdenko and Chief of Staff Marshal Nikolai Krukov to Mexico, which was also occupied by the USSR, to be melted in the hot desert]), officially declared Total War against the Sons of Allah. Because of these growing threats, the IAGD, with its Supreme Commander also declared war against the two emerging powers. The new Empire Of Japan, now led by Emperor Tatsu, allied with the IAGD and used their arsenal, along with new inventions, to help defeat both the USSR, which is starting to become a threat to Japan through the USSR's Chinese and North Korean territories, and the Sons of God, in which they help the IAGD's South-East Asian Wing to repel the terrorists coming from an Sons of God-occupied Malaysia, Indonesia and Southern Philippines. Eventually, the Sons of God, led by its self-declared Leader of the World, ultimately declares an All-out War against the whole world, triggering a 3-way World War. Who will win in this war of the century? The World shall be the Arena for this spectacular competition of military power!"
ngno8h,Heist Game Set in Monaco before and during F1 season,"I just finished watching The B1M's video on Monaco on youtube (Link here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X\_lFFLpHuSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_lFFLpHuSQ) ) \n\nFirst, I just thought, ""Monacos pretty small. It shouldn't be unreasonable to make a 1:1 recreation of it."" After all GTA V's San Andreas is around 31 square miles; the entire country of Monaco and a few surrounding towns in France are around 10 Square miles. granted, that's 10 square miles of fairly dense urban area rather than mountains and forest, but still a thirst the size of San Andreas.\n\nThen I wondered what could happen on that map. A million GTA clones already exist, but I thought the transformation of the city during the F1 races held there could make for an interesting dynamic of pathfinding during missions. \n\nSo the idea is this: A heist game set during the F1 season. It's entirely free-form like a hitman game. You have to find a team, find vehicles and resources, and plot out a plan while the city is changing and rebuilding itself for the upcoming race. It all culminates in the player actually participating in the race as part of a diversion while the team takes down the target. The player would be able to switch from team member to team member at key moments in single player or a group of players can each have a role in multiplayer. \n\nThere would be no set missions or objectives other than the target (which could be a casino or the F1 race itself like in Logan Lucky) which has to be hit during the race. So the entire game would have a timer attached of 6 weeks which is how long it takes for the facilities in Monaco to be built. Each week would be a chapter with a different stage of construction completed. Players can load into any day within a week (A day would be like 30 minutes), but once that week is finished, it cannot be reloaded and any progress will be saved. So if you accidently destroy your getaway vehicles the at the end of the week before the big race, you're screwed and will have to think on your toes."
ngnacc,A multiplayer evolution game that starts simple before growing and updating in real time as the playerbase grows,"Obviously, there's some Spore influence here, but I also had TierZoo in mind as well as Biblaridion's Alien Biospheres series.\n\nThe first released pre-alpha version of the game will involve playing as an aquatic worm-like creature that is capable of swimming, crawling on the seabed, and burrowing. Pretty much all you do is move around, eat plankton and algae, and gain points. But once you have enough energy to reproduce, you can use the points you've gained from eating food to upgrade your creature, and you can choose from a menu of various parts to grow or upgrade such as eyes, mouths, limbs, tails, armor, respiratory organs, reproduction, coloration, body shape and size, etc. \n\nEvery time the game updates, it adds other players' animals to the game, which new players can play as and evolve in their own divergent direction. Meanwhile, the devs will be changing the environment the players inhabit with each new update, whether it be new types of plants, lowering or raising oxygen levels, making the planet's temperature hotter or colder, splitting the continents, etc., which the players will have to evolve their respective species to better cope. \n\nThere will be both a single and multiplayer mode. In single-player, all the other creatures are AIs, whereas in multiplayer, almost every creature you meet is controlled by another player. \n\nOne thing I haven't figured out is how player species would go extinct. I know that in real life, animals go extinct when they die faster than they can reproduce, but I don't know how that would apply in-game. \n\nOther than that, what I like about this idea is that, unlike other evolution/animal simulator game ideas which are extremely complex and take a while to program before release, this one would be first released to the public as a relatively simple game, only becoming more complex gradually over time. After all, it can't be THAT hard to program a little worm that just swims, burrows, and eats.\n\nAny questions or suggestions?"

ntuuw1,A detective type game where you are also the suspect and innocent characters,"Warning-I don't know how to word this. Imagine a game where you and 4 other characters are in a room and your next casually playing since you were introduced to everyone and you were given freedom to roam the hotel. The only thing you notice is that you can move furniture, pick up objects and talk to random NPC's in the building. After following around for 15 minutes you switch characters but now you slowly begin to realise you can actually kill people. After some time you get a report on how you behaved, like the thing in GTA 5 after finishing the main game."

ntn76a,A game that players complement in real time," Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.  \n The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine  \n The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.  \n This ""game"" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game."
ntm8sb,Here’s a game idea that i have severely downgraded because my game is too difficult to make even with a team of 15,"Going off my other idea similar to the division i have come up with one idea. It will still use a looter shooter aspect just the gameplay being different \n\n\nHow about instead of having a set map and set missions you take on expeditions (procedurally generated) and continue to play them as you level up and get better gear and weapons. There will be x settings: underground, city streets, wildlands and city ruins (heavily damaged scenes such as collapsed buildings, blown up roads and such) \n\nYour main goal is to make builds to take on powerful content such as raids and assaults (mini raids like incursions). \n\nThere will be many gear and weapon attributes, many talents and weapons that are all modern. \n\n\nThis is all you will be doing at launch. Daily and weekly quests and more content will be available at a time after the game launches. \n\nThere will also be many apparel choices such as masks, helmets and outfits. \n\nThis is the first game I’m ever developing. Is it still too big or just fine?"

ntf7mv,Combat mechanics for lego game,"I wanna create a small avatar based Lego game since my sister and me are huge fans, but i couldnt find such a game. But i am struggling with combat mechanics. First i thought of just adding one bending ability per character but that would be boring, so i wanted to add multiple abilities. But since i only want to use 2 button (l-click, r-click), switching between them is some issue. Here are some ideas of mine:\n\n1. This one is based on every other lego game. If you're standing in front of an enemy and Leftclick, it punches, if you press Rightclick, you enable one special ability, like a shield. When you have some distance to other players, you can shoot a projectile of your element and also characters like Iroh could have the ""melting gold"" ability by holding Rightclick. You would see other abilities only at certain areas of the game\n\n2. A GTA V like switching method. The abilities are in the ""weapon wheel"" and you select them manually. This would add a lot more possibilities, but is also slow, because you cant just quickly switch and always have to search for your ability. Maybe some sort of Hotkey would be useful, but it should also be easily playable on a console.\n\n3. Adding some sort of combo-mechanics, based on the actions of the character. By that you can add 4 different abilities (standing + l click ; running + l click ; standing + r click ; running + r click) and also some if you hold your button pressed, click twice etc.\n\nWich one would you prefer? And if you can think of any other method, please let me know."

ntcw56,A Visual Novel Where You Cannot See the Real Appearance of Those You See Unless You Break a Curse.,"I could not think of a good way to explain through title alone. The idea for this potential visual novel is that the player (probably a blank canvas or a set ""protagonist"") receives a curse (from who or what is flexible, but this would likely not work without some method of understanding the way to break the curse or why it happened) due to excessive apathy.\n\nWhat the curse does is cause everyone, even yourself to appear as featureless, identical mannequins with identical voices. To break this curse, the player would need to establish and maintain numerous relationships. While this would be potentially difficult, each of the set characters (No ""required"" amount) would act, speak, walk, stand or more in distinct ways. If you pay attention, you will still know who is who and what to say.\n\nIf you don't, there would likely be a ""loss"" condition if you mess up all or most of the set characters. The big kicker here and I think a real ""shining"" moment of the experience would be a victory. Assuming you establish a certain amount of good connection, or through some other method, you get  a credits, a ""scroll-down"" or both. In this scroll-down, you could see the outlines of each specific character as you go down, in a specific pose and or performing a specific action. If you failed to become their friend, ect, they will be seen as only an outline of their actual appearance. If you are their friend, you can see the real, unaltered person and see just who you got to know.\n\nMaybe something special would happen if you befriended everyone without fail? The demon who could in theory have given it to you may rescind the curse in it's entirety, maybe you get a special dev message. Who knows? Anyway, that's the idea."

ntbj7p,In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder,"This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge. \n\nFor gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.\n\nFor enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction. \n\nMonsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it. \n\nEach Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.\n\nNot sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.\n\nThat's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!"
ntar9j,"Scalable - A GTA V-like game with the phrase ""Rags to Riches"" being a core concept","Hi guys,\n\nAs of writing this post, I'm also writing a Game Design Document for an idea I recently had for a GTA V-like game. Or similar to GTA V. I'm already working on a game called Chrome Switcher (on steam :) ), so this game will be worked on after that. Please note this game is mostly an excuse for me to practice level designing and coding.\n\nScalable is an open-world game similar to GTA V, except the economy plays a huge factor. Players can rent apartments, buy houses, form businesses, create cafes, and hire other players. They can do jobs/missions ranging from entry-level jobs like delivering food or goods to assassinating targets. This is essentially an economy simulation game, with the vehicle and gun shooting mechanics from GTA V.   \nThe main idea for Scalable is to encourage the player to partake in a ""Rags to Riches"" type of world, starting from a rundown apartment building and working your way up to billionaire status.\n\nOne philosophical concept for this game is for players to collaborate with their friends to form businesses. These businesses can sell certain products, handle shipping for other companies, and partake in other business practices. \n\nI still want players to feel the same type of excitement they have with shooting guns and escaping cops like in GTA V, which is why I'll design a system for players to create gangs and black market organizations. If the player kills someone for an assassination job, they'll have to escape the cops. If they escape, no big deal. If they get caught, some real consequences will happen. A massive bailout payment will occur and perhaps a reputation system will be implemented.\n\nSo basically, an MMO GTA V game with the economy playing a huge factor."
nt775d,Global strategy superhero game,"The basic idea is simple, you play as a global agency tasked with stopping supervillains and their organizations across the globe.  You start with basic agents and have to assign those agents to deal with various crisis across the globe, from escaped science experiments to crime sprees by super scientists. As the game goes on villains and crisis get harder, but you can even the playing field by recruiting superhero’s that solve crisis much faster and safer. The goal is to build your agency large enough to repel one of several endgame crisis. One example is an alien invasion, another is an doomsday device that will boil the oceans, a third could be an army of the dead that includes superhero’s you’ve lost on missions."

nt4ghi,Space-related game?,"The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.\n\n(fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)"

nt3nky,"You run a robotics manufacturing factory that makes automation equipment. At first you use human employees, but as you improve your factory you begin to rely on automation. The goal is improve your factory to the point it can run by itself.","And then it becomes self aware.\n\nIt's half Prison Architect and half Factorio. You build machines to build machines, and then you fire the humans that are no longer necessary. You'll hire an ""AI helper"" to help you with the harder manufacturing puzzles (i.e. a hint system), but as you keep upgrading it, it'll start to automate the machine design process on its own so you can just sit back and watch the money roll in. At this point the game transforms into a clicker game.\n\nBut then you can't control anything anymore. The AI stops letting you manually change the factory or upgrade systems because *it knows better.* It stops letting you play."
nt1udp,Seagull Life: A game where you play as a seagull on a tropical island,"Feel free to use this idea\n\nThe video game that I envision is like The Sims, but you’re a seagull instead of a person. It takes place on a tropical island with two nice hotels, small shops, and a restaurant, along with lots of palm and coconut trees and a beach.  You can freely roam the island, forage for food and water, fly out over the sea or up high over the buildings and trees. You can even land on the balconies of hotel rooms and occasionally be fed bread and French fries by tourists.\n\nThe game has a 24 hour cycle with day and night, but like The Sims, you can speed up gameplay. Tropical steel drum music should play in the background. Movement is 3-D, and the graphics should be very good, since the player should feel like they’re really on the island. This is an endless relaxing game.  It would easily make for a great VR game.\n\nThe only ways to die is by starvation or dehydration, and you would have to really slack off for this to happen. You have a hunger need, which can be satisfied by catching and eating fish, small organisms on the beach, bits of edible material that you can easily find, or being fed by tourists.  Your thirst need can easily be satisfied by drinking sea water or fresh water from rain or from puddles.  You also have a social need that can be satisfied by interacting with other seagulls or with tourists.  Your energy need is satisfied by sleeping, and your fun need is satisfied by simply flying around.\n\nYou can select the gender of your seagull, and you can also find a mate and have chicks.  The nest will need to be in an out-of-the-way location, and you and your mate will need to care for the chicks.\n\nSeagull Life: The endless vacation!\n\nAirfare cost: $0.00\n\nHotel cost: $0.00\n\nRental car cost: $0.00\n\nFood and drink cost: $0.00\n\n[https://www.austockphoto.com.au/imgcache/uploads/photos/compressed/close-up-of-a-seagull-on-the-beach-austockphoto-000021815.jpg?v=1.3.0](https://www.austockphoto.com.au/imgcache/uploads/photos/compressed/close-up-of-a-seagull-on-the-beach-austockphoto-000021815.jpg?v=1.3.0)"

nszmzb,How dungeons should be,"In my complete opinion, I think dungeons in open world games should actually take time to get through. Not just the “in and out” ones that take ten minutes and you never go back, but like where it takes you an hour or two, with its own lore and npcs and side quests. I came up with this while playing Skyrim and think how the dungeons are way to simple and quick. I want to be immersed in the thought that an ancient civilization made the place and now all their technology has gone haywire. But thats just my 2 cents"
nsrpnp,Parasyte based survival game,"This idea is based on the anime Parasyte:the Maxime:\n\nBeginning:\nYou play a simple parasyte, who is really weak in the beginning. Your only chance of survival is to find a host to infect (your hp decreases pretty fast so you cant really choose and have to take the nearest human/animal). \n\nDifferent Parasytes:\nYou can choose if you kill him and replace his head or enter some other part of his body to let him stay alive. Both decisions have a pro and contra. A ""full parasyte"" is weaker that a ""humanoid parasyte"" but they have to eat less food and have buffs like sensing other parasytes.\n\nLife in a host;\nwhen you first enter the body, all you can do is eating by killing humans, learning by watching peoples behaviour wich makes you more intelligent or kill other parasytes\n\nStats:\nthe most important stats in the game are food, stamina and health. \nnpcs also have a ""suspicion"" stat. The more suspicious you act, the more likely they do something against you. (Parasytes have a high suspicion level since they can sense you but they wont attack you if they arent hungry/agressive)\n\nAbilities to unlock:\nThere is a skill tree with ""genocide"" abilities on the left and ""adaption"" abilities on the right.\n\nGenocide abilities:\n- bigger lungs (you can run faster and longer)\n- bigger stomache (live longer without starving)\n- parasyte-string (swing to reach your target faster or Immobilize it by wrapping it)\n- parasyte-wings (fly)\n- fusion (allows you to add multiple parasytes to one target)\n\nAdaption abilities:\n- human food (allows you to eat not only other humans, but normal food)\n- human mimics (you can now interact with humans without being suspicious\n- family (You can now start a family. Its up to you what you gonna do with them)\n\nObjective\nsurvive and either kill everyone else in the city or adapt perfectly, so everyone in your area has suspicion level 1"

nso9gy,Classical music RPG with avatar TLA elements,"This is an idea I’ve been brewing, it’s not fleshed out at all I just like the thought of it. It’s a rhythm game/rpg kinda like mother 3 where you are a composer trying to rebuild the Lost orchestra. You travel to different places with avatar style clans (instead of earth wind fire ect, you have the instrument families like strings and brass.) each place has some side story, like a civil war between the violins and double basses. And with each you acquire a new instrument to add to the symphony which add more lives and new abilities. Haven’t worked out how battles will work, but the soundtrack would be modernized versions of classical music in the public domain. Like I said not fleshed out at all, prob not too useful an idea I just kinda like it."
nsnov5,Steampunk MMO where your character gathers skill attributes from the enemies you defeat,"Just like it sounds. \n\nAn MMO that centers around a compelling story that enables you to 'learn' one or two ""attributes"" from a defeated enemy in order to progress. This would certainly be a steampunk-themed world, however, I'm leaning towards some raw elemental-magic-based interactions drawn from different environments/zones within the game. \n\nIt would look something like this as an example:\n\nYou just picked up a sword and can fight spiders coming from a forest. You defeat one and learn the skill attributes ""SILK"" and ""SPEED."" These attributes combined with raw magic or steam can alter the way you fight, run, carry, jump, etc. Over time, and many defeated enemies and skill attributes learned, you discover many unique combinations and are able to progress to harder and more rewarding biomes/environments, eventually unlocking a way to traverse through what would essentially be the ""last/most dangerous"" zone to finish the story. \n\nThoughts? Skill attribute ideas? Base magic types?"
nsijpr,Medical system for realistic shooter,"So I've been thinking and realized that most realistic shooters (I.e. Squad, Arma III, etc.) use the same medical system, and it's one that could use a serious upgrade in realism. My thought is that when you are wounded, you can only see the rough severity of a wound, and use bandages and painkillers to stabilize yourself. In order to fully heal, you would need to be treated by a medic, who can examine the exact type of wound, and use various items to heal it (Tourniquet, bandage, hemostats, blood bags, etc.). In addition, when a medic treats another played, they will kneel next to them. Also, perhaps when hit by a blast, or when losing a lot of blood, players could be knocked out for anywhere from a minute to two or three. As you wake, you would be laying on the ground, with ringing ears, and distorted vision. There would be no numerical system for health of a limb. The only thing you as a player would be able to see would be the location of a wound, and its rough severity. Medics could see other effects such as bleeding, concussions, shrapnel, and other wounds. I feel like this would make the outdated feeling medical system in tactical shooters, specifically milsims, far better and more realistic. Any thoughts?"
nsfnlz,A Borrowers Type Game,"I keep thinking about a Grounded-esque game but inside a house VR-wise. I'd like to have humans, dogs, etc as well. \n\nThat being said, shrinking is also an *ahem* ""thing"" for some people, so finding potential ideas of interactions has led me to some websites I had no intention of going to. Any ideas of human/animal/bug interactions for an in-house shrinking game?"
nsfitx,Very hardcore management game of an estate with DnD 5e rules for adventurers. AI is the DM,"First of all, I might have have been a bit too ambitious doing this alone, I just want to share this as it has been my only goal in the last 6 month of my life.\n\nThe project started from me having an idea of simulating a world like dwarf fortress but with AI.\n\nI have started with creating a lot of the backend work. (agents, network sockets...)\n\nThe AI part is mostly completed, with some tweaking needed to avoid some exploits (one example is that some players could act so good that gods would bow to them, granting them superpowers)\n\nGraphically, rignt now is just ASCII art (think dwarf fortress) , but it's low effort to create a 3D environment instead, is using 3d vectors with 64bits floating point for location and is not framerate bound, so any 3D engine like unity or unreal would do.\n\nThe most challenging is balancing all the spells and abilities. \n\n**So the pitch of the game is:**\n\n**Think:** Darkest dungeon, you are an estate manager, with a goal in mind and a tavern. (think recruit geralt of rivia whenever you can to help you out) But combat and recruiting is based strictly on the DnD 5e ruleset.\n\n**But:** you have creating freedom in classes and abilities. yep that is the exception with the dnd 5eRS to counteract the evil AI dungeon master.\n\nSome sub-abilities can be tweaked and combined.\n\nAdventurers are recruited, trained and sent on a mission. If they succeed, they gain 1 level FLAT, this is because they are very likely to die.\n\nYou can watch your adventurers team dreaming of heroism and incredible tales falling at the hands of the first group of goblins they encounter,\n\nOr heroically destroy a legendary monster by rolling crits, while being unable to find out how to stop the water from filling up the room they are in, dying of stupidity.\n\nPure bliss..\n\nThe game is not punishing, in fact you can never lose, but winning is hella hard.\n\nI'm probably 80% through the AI code, 15% through in the campain code, 3% in for the art, 0% for the sound design, I want to complete this, but I feel I'll die before it is even half way finished.\n\nIf anyone likes this idea, just ping me, I'm feeling quite bad right now realizing how hard it's going to be. I want to give up. I feel like the idea is really good though, I wont be mad if you steal it.\n\nYou know, working alone on your uniquely challenging game project is kinda soul crushing sometimes."

There is a 1 second cooldown after each attack. If you die, you will, naturally, lose your entire inventory.\n\nThere are several classes, split in DPS, tanks and healers. Gear has some importance too, of course.\n\nMoving through a dungeon will be done automatically, unless you either want to move back or are at a crossing.

nsdy59,2D Mars split screen pvp game,I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.

nsbuql,Base building simulator inside what can only be described as the backrooms.,"Synopsis: You find yourself maintaining a small house that you have recently moved into through estate inheritance. Only you no longer can find the outside door after unpacking your belongings,  and to your horror when you pull the curtains back you discover that the windows only shine light into other dark rooms.  With every inch you advance in this ""thing"" it becomes more incorrect. Doors seem to to only want to open to a another labyrinth of doors, room slowly stop making any sense, dimensions will not mathematically add up, windows doors and furniture will start appearing in places they should not be. This early 1930's architecture has rapidly become less recognizable, It's clear at this point that you're going to need to keep searching to repair your home location, track your progress, and take care of your health and hunger, but advancing further into this architectural ""thing"" Not only confuses your sense of direction but begins to emit a feeling of trespass. This thing is alive and it hates you. Can you get out?\n\n\nAs the synopsis suggests this is a base building psychological horror video game.\n\nTo break things down further you need to be constantly searching through rooms while using specific inventory items that will prevent rooms from changing or from getting lost. Your reasoning for searching these rooms is to gather resources to slowly fortify your central location, maintain food health, in any sort of physical damage you might take along the way. Eventuallyrthrough physical entities or through psychological architecture, the home will become angry enough at your presence to start attacking your home base. \n\nEventually through collecting lore and The point you're discovering certain locations you are guided to collect a specific set of items to create a device that will either allow you to tame the architecture (to an extent) and begin bending it to your will, allowing for deeper more complex devices to be discovered and more dangerous exploration.  \n\nThe devices in question would have functionality as being able to collapse a wall, force pipes to freeze or overheat. Or literally push entire walls forward or backwards. \n\nIn an essence it's a survival craft game where you use tools to manipulate the physical architecture and solve puzzles while adventuring further into more abstract rooms and labyrinths. Your biggest enemies would be the architecture itself seeming to turn on you, whether that means running from a room that's flooding upstairs about to burst or stopping pipes that keep building themselves closer and closer to you."

nsa987,Heroes in Hiding [Board Game],"This game takes place a generation after a great war between Light vs Dark. After the war ended, the demigod heroes that fought in the war ""retired."" Their holy/demonic artifacts was sealed away, and the heroes themselves hid their war time personas to disappear among the everyday population. Now the Powers of Light and Dark are stirring again, and it is the player's job to reassemble the heroes and recover their artifacts to be ready for the upcoming conflict.\n\nThis will be a turn based board game with 2 players. The play area will consist of a bunch of investigation sites, a Fortress of Light, and a Fortress of Darkness. Each turn the players dispatch their heroes to investigation sites in order to uncover the hero or relics at that location, and if successful return them to their fortress for use in the following rounds and eventually the final battle.\n\nThe game lasts a set number of turns after which the Final Battle occurs to determine the winner. In the Final Battle each faction puts fourth their 5 best heroes armed with their 5 best relics, and they fight until one side is victorious."
ns7pub,An 80s/90s themed Megaman X-like game featuring yo-yos,"I have no idea how to make a video game, but I've had this idea for a while and really just want to put it out there.\n\nSo the idea is for something along the lines of Megaman X. (However, this might be better suited to a metroidvania style game instead) But instead of having a blaster, the main character uses a yo-yo. I envisioned it being something like a whip like in Castlevania.\n\nThe main character is a yo-yo champion who wins a tournament and receives the coveted Golden Yo-Yo. The Yo-Yo is stolen however and the character must venture into a sort of gang-controlled area to fight enemies and work their way up to find the person who stole the Golden Yo-Yo.\n\nThe very first battle is with a cup stacker. After defeating them, your health bar is now a bunch of cups stacked on top of one another. (I liked this idea because cups stacked on top of one another look a bit like the lines in the Megaman health bar.) Finding Golden Cups or something similar throughout the game will permanently raise your total healthbar.\n\nEnemy ideas: Three brothers who each have footwear themed abilities.\n\nThe first brother has roller blades. Defeating him gives you the ability to dash.\n\nThe second bother has light up sneakers. Defeating him give you the ability to dash in the air.\n\nThe third brother has air pump shoes. Defeating him gives you the ability to double jump.\n\nNext set: Three sisters who each have wristwear themed abilities\n\nThe first sister has sweatbands. Defeating her gives you the ability to charge up attacks.\n\nThe second sister has snap bracelets. There are three bracelets: Red, Green, and Blue. You can only equip one at a time, but each one has a different bonus ability. Red gives you better defense. Green lets you move faster. Blue gives you stronger attacks\n\nThe third sister is goth and has spike bracelets. Defeating her gives you the ability to cling to walls and wall jump.\n\nI had some thoughts on a fourth sister who maybe had swatches (those cheap multi-color watches). Defeating her would give you the ability to slow time, but it would need to be charged up. There would need to be some balancing mechanics to keep it from being overpowered. \n\nFinal set: High school archetypes?\n\nA nerd character. Defeating them gives you a pocket protector that would generate a small shield. \n\nA jock character. Defeating them gives you a helmet allowing you to do damage to enemies when you dash into them. \n\nFrom here on I'm less sure about the other bosses. I thought a preppy character would work for the official third, but I'm not sure what ability you'd get from them. The best I could think of was a backstep that lets you jump backwards, but that seems a little weak.\n\nOther possible maybes: The band geek? Your yo-yo now produces little music notes that can do damage. A pretty/ugly girl? She wears glasses, but then then half way through the battle takes them off and becomes prom queen. You get the glasses which lets you see hidden locations?\n\nMost of the regular enemies you fight would be people wielding nerf gunes that shoot darts, balls, etc. The thee sisters area would maybe have Lisa Frank-esque enemies. The guns would also fire glitter that would act like poison. It's basically all the tropes and fads that were popular in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe final boss is another yo-yo user and uses the Golden Yo-Yo which is very strong."
ns58gp,1v1 RTS where both sides have to influence a neutral side,"It takes place on an interstellar ship where there has been a severe malfunction. Before the match, both sides, the Ship AI (Defending) and the Infestation (Attacking) pick three perks that help them or hinder their opponent to make sure each match is fresh. The Infestation chooses what set off the alarm, whether it be an outbreak of spores or mysterious and seemingly random system failure.\n\nThere are six non-player units called Agents. These agents have a karma system that can be swayed by either side, lower karma makes it easier for the Infestation to influence them and higher karma increases their hate for the Infestation, making it easier for the AI to influence them. Certain actions can generate a boon for either side. There are three classes of boons, Diplomatic, Dominant, and Special. Diplomatic boons provide buffs for the player's team or change an Agent's karma toward the player's team. Dominant boons cripple the enemy team or make it harder for them to influence the Agents.\n\nThink of this as an attack/defend gamemode. The Infestation attempts to gain control over the ship and the Ship AI attempts to follow programing and protect the Agents at all costs. There could also be an alternate game mode where a specialist AI attempts to reclaim an infested ship, a Rogue AI attempts to take over a normal ship or two Infestations fight over turf."

nrl3xn,"WW1 themed game, but you're the animals trying to survive","Most, if not all, games that have the theme of WW1 or WW2 or such are in the perspective of the soldiers or people in charge AKA high command. Very rarely do we even hear about the animals trying to get by during such conflicts.\n\nYou can argue that the animals most likely avoided humans and places where there were humans, but for the case of WW2 for example, it spanned out to multiple different places, sometimes in the remotest of places and as such, animals have fallen between the crosshairs of human weapons.\n\nThe gameplay would be of a survival, where depending on what animal you play as, you do different things but some things stay the same: search for food, find shelter, keep out of danger and optionally, find a mate. What obviously makes this type of survival different is the fact you have to avoid battles, soldiers and bombs for example. Due to battles, food would be scarce, almost nowhere is safe and so on.\n\nI apologise if this idea seems incomplete, I don't have enough motivation to continue writing :P"
nrjd98,Suggestions for my game idea? :D,"Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/\n\n(The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)\n\nHere's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in ""camera mode"" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.\n\nAnways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)"
nrj13z,Zombie survival revolving around a Zombie Civil War,"Starts out typically enough, zombie plague, survivors, etc. However, at some point, the disease mutates and the infected beyond this point are basically just the deceased resurrecting (w/ some drawbacks and added abilities), and leads to 3 factions.  \n\n\n1. Human Survivors: Standard stuff, guns and medikits, co-op, etc. Goal is to outlast the plague and rebuild, but with the plague completely eliminated.  \n2. Shadows: Given additional abilities that make them unique, and are more independent with actual detriments to working with other teammates. Goal is to assist survivors, but also survive themselves, leading to them assisting from the shadows (hence the name) as Survivors would attack them on sight.  \n3. Zombies: Standard fare, swarm mentality and unique monstrous varieties. Goal is to feed, but cannot feed on Shadows, leading to them prioritizing the Survivors and avoiding the Shadows."
nretli,Kingdom Two Crowns + Bad North + Townscaper + RTS,"Game idea: elements of Kingdom Two Crowns, such as progressive expansion, coin collection for outposts secured, day/night cycle where daily income is collected once per day.\n\nElements of Bad North where squads of troops can be recruited, land is in civil war so bands fight in RTS / Roguelike style.  Could include similar premise of northern viking invaders.  I love the Bad North visual aesthetic. \n\nElements of Townscaper where as part of ending a civil war, rebuilding the kingdom, uniting the kingdom and then ultimately defending off the northern invaders you also have the option to upgrade towns and outposts so they expand and could look more decorative or grand as you level the kingdom up.  Could also transition from burnt ruins and smouldering rubbish to beautiful building and gardens, birds, wildlife etc.  There could be a sense of enjoyment from seeing the kingdom blossom again, coming out of civil war.  Again the visual design aesthetics here would be important.\n\nOverarching premise of the game could be that the land is in civil war, the king is dead, lords and barons are vying for leadership, you need to rise up, take control and unite the kingdom under one banner, either through force or influence.  Once you expand enough control as the game progresses more northern invaders arrive and depending on how well you have united the kingdom will determine whether you can hold them off and ultimately win the game.\n\nQuestion is could this be a good game, what appeals, what doesn’t?"
nreaf9,A Fall Guys looking game based on the Calvinball comic strips of yore by Bill Watterson,"I imagine it looking something like fall-guys in terms of character and map coloring as well as character design. Players start the game in a large arena playing a team sport ( Let's say football/soccer because that's one of the more widely known sports). The players and environment interact with the ball in a similar way to rocket league. At first the map is a huge but flat environment that is divided into a couple of sections: The scoreboard and rule board- where a player can check the score and rules. However players can find rulebooks scattered around the maps every now and then. Mixing and matching 7 noun prompts (*all players, your team, the other team, new rule, the ball, the objective,* and *the map*) with 7 descriptive prompts depending on what noun you picked. For example if I pick ""all players"", I am given 6 prompts to pick from that match with ""all players"" (*grow, shrink, can fly, run faster, can die, etc.).* The game ends when the objective is reached. This is unclear so I'll try and clarify in the comments."

nrcz9l,"There are NO cavalry-focused games, to my knowledge. Why?","There are games that feature cavalry in a strategic sense, as the total war games do.

Fun? Do you think it could work, from a mechanical perspective? I would really love to hear the general opinion on this, and I look forward to reading your thoughts!  \n\n\n(Also, I'm new here, I hope the request flair is the right flair to put this under.)"

nqut60,Poor stories don't make good games,"This is a bit of a rant I want to get off my chest. There are many good games out there whose narrative contain elements of ""poor"" storytelling. At their heart they are great game play mechanics that require narrative contortionism to provide \*affordances to the players. They are not jankey stories that happened to have an enjoyable game play experiences attached to them. The real art of game story writing comes in creating an environment where first time players instinctively know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a game designers puts the player in a game scifi scene with armed men in red and black uniforms. The player thinks ""they are probably nazis, I should try and kill them before they kill me."" It doesn't matter that visually coding bad guys as Nazi is a lazy story writing trope because it helps the player pick up what the game is expecting of them. In fact leaning heavily on over used tropes is good game design so long as it is in service of helping the player master the game mechanics. This is why it bothers me when I see ""game ideas"" that are all narrative with no discussion the mechanics the narrative there to support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt bothers me when people post an idea that is essentially bad fan-fic and act like it is the seed of a great game. It bothers me that some people think writing for games is easy because there are so many good games with ""poorly"" written stories. It is pursuit of some surface level detail that is almost useless without the all the stuff underneath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen children play great games with somewhat cringe stories they talk about the cringe stories because that is the only aspect of the game they have the vocabulary to describe. As we get older I would like to think our vocabulary grows and we can better articulate what about a gaming experience we enjoyed. If we get it in our heads to design a new experience I would like to think  that we also have vocabulary to include more than the surface level narrative details. I have been disappointed in this expectation many times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\* **Affordances** are properties of objects which show users the actions they can take.

Obviously the difference between AAA and Beginner is easy to know but Intermediate and Advanced are hard to gauge.\n\n**Should be added:**\n\n**Tags to sort by genre** (RPG, Visual Novel, Platformer, FPS, etc.): These tags would definitely help me out  and I'm sure there are at least a couple other people on this subreddit who can stand to benefit. I myself prefer to work in a couple specific genres (Platformers, RPG) and it would be nice to find ideas that are only those few genres. Plus it helps to weed out the MMORPGs and MMOs early on.\n\n**Tags to sort by viewing angle** (2D vs 3D): Again I prefer to work in a specific medium of art (pixel art) which means I would take a 2D idea over a 3D one any day. These aren't necessary but I think they would be nice to have.\n\n**IP Tags**: Honestly the worst game ideas on here are the ones that either call for duplicates of an existing game or the ones that involve IPs. You know the ones I'm talking about (""Make a Spider-Man game!"" or ""Make a Doctor Who game!""). These in themselves are not inherently bad but for me a simple rule of thumb is ""If it can't stand without the IP, would seem like a cheap knockoff without the IP, or simply doesn't work without the IP"" then don't post it. Nothing I say is honestly going to stop people from posting these which is why I feel like we should have these tags."

This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually. \n\nAs you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles."

nqcehh,Town Builder MOBA,"Traditional moba map with three lanes and a jungle filled with neutral mobs. Players can't directly attack the opposing town and must depend on creeps produced by the town to destroy the enemy town.\n\n3-5 players, with three roles to fill.\n\nBuilder : Builders don't leave the base and have two core responsibilities. The first is constructing new buildings to upgrade the creeps and create new kinds of creeps. The second is repairing buildings destroyed by enemy creeps or the...\n\nSpy : The Spy inhabits the enemy town and is equipped with mobility and stealth options. The spy sabatoges, spys and steals from the enemy town, setting bombs that the builder must respond, stealing loot from the treasury while the builder is distracted and disabling defenses at key times.\n\nAdventurer : A more traditional moba character, the Adventurer lives in the space between towns. Adventurers hunt jungle mobs and treasure to keep their builder well supplied with money. Adventurers can also disrupt and hunt enemy creeps, and opposing adventurers. \n\nVariation : Add a new role Guard, who more directly opposes the spy, possibly in a spy vs spy style. Require rare resources for certain building upgrades that the adventurer must find. Add a warlord role who focuses on advancing down lanes and destroying the enemy town."

nq4d89,Western MMO (Sun Set At High Noon) SSHN Concept,
nq3t0g,Coffee 2D Platformer,"My concept is you are a cup of coffee, trying to claim your right as the best beverage in the world. The game is presented in a classic pixel art style. The character controls normally, with a double jump &amp; mid-air dash. You would travel through different “levels” in each location, or “world” you visit. There are generally 5-7 levels in each world, filled with different hazards &amp; enemies suiting that location. For example, one level in a cafe’ world could feature bouncing around on computers like springs, while avoiding dangerous coffee stirrer enemies. Ideas for locations could be the aforementioned cafe’, a school, an office, etc. I imagine there would be 4 worlds in the game. At the end of each world, there is a beverage that must be defeated in a unique way. For the cafe’ world, you would fight milk, for the school, you would fight a juice box, &amp; for the office, you would fight an energy drink in a vending machine. Along your adventure, you can collect coffee beans to unlock new skins, which can all be instantly brought with real-world money. Also, if you fail in a stage, you can simply revive by watching an ad. Overall, I think it’s a decent idea, &amp; much more accomplishable that many of the other ideas in this sub. Of course, some things will need to be changed to work, but be sure to tell me what you think. Thanks for reading!"
nq1op2,The Survivalists - An Open World Zombie PVP where players are the humans AND the zombies,"Hear me out,\n&amp;nbsp;\nGame is a PVP Humans vs. Zombies in a vast open world with loot for human players but instead of fighting Zombie NPCs, players ARE the zombies. These zombies have hunger, and they are always hungry. They can eat animals, like deers and rabbits but they only fill a tiny amount of hunger. What really fills the belly is a human.\n&amp;nbsp;\nBoth humans and zombies benefit from surviving the most:\n&amp;nbsp;\n* Humans will be able to loot for better gear, create factions, defenses, alliances and so on. Everything that would improve survivability. \n\n* Zombies become stronger with every kill. At spawn zombie players are really weak and can only take on recently spawned users with shitty loot (and if they are alone...). With time, the zombie becomes stronger. You get points to spend in a skill tree. More agility, cunning, hearing, smelling, longer jumps, etc. Given enough time you can become a super zombie that terrorizes the entire server.\n&amp;nbsp;\nIdeally, it would be a persistent server where players can hop in and hop out. 50/50 forced distribution of playerbase. Map would have a starting area with the shittiest loot possible where both humans and zombies spawn. Humans need to gtfo of there fast, zombies need to follow to eat them. The farther you are from spawning point the better the loot. That doesnt mean better chances of survability, as humans would like that loot too, and zombies would like your head for breakfast.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe game would have a ranking with top players sorted by time alive. Server resets after 24h and has a hall of fame for hoever survived the longest. \n&amp;nbsp;\nI need this fking game in my life."

npp3ei,Mobile game concept. Rate please,"It seems to me that humans have ceased to be afraid of nuclear war. Humans are bored with works of art about the consequences of nuclear war. But nuclear war is not the only cause of post-apocalypse. Among them are environmental disasters. One of such problems of our time is desertification, or maybe you have heard the latest news about soil contamination with fungus entailing the risk of the complete destruction of bananas?\n\nLet's imagine. In the near future, a bacterium that destroys fertile soils appeared. Hunger and wars are reducing the population of humanity. The survivors build greenhouse cities in which locusts and algae are grown to feed the population. In the newly formed deserts, where it was once green, they begin to find an unknown substance - a spice - a new drug that improves the harvest of food, when consumed, mental capabilities, endurance increase, digestion improves, but also a strong dependence arises.\n\nThe main character, Garrett, is a driver, picks up the spice in the deserts, lives at the outpost. His old partner, the shooter, was killed by unknown people, and he wants to find out who did it, for this he needs to complete the tasks of the outpost, get spice, improve his cars and kill bosses. And all this with the help of a new partner Janet. The plot is presented as cut-scenes in the form of comics, dialogues while traveling.\n\nAs you might have guessed, the core gameplay is a trip from point A to point B with a top view, battles, finding a way and overcoming obstacles. During the battle, the gunner starts shooting automatically when the enemy hits the weapon's radius of destruction. On the left is the mode of a normal ride at the initial location, here the game only teaches us to ride and entertains us with dialogue. On the right is the battle, the player needs to avoid a situation when several opponents will shoot at him at the same time, for this he needs to choose where to maneuver, otherwise he will be blown up.\n\nMeta gameplay consists of prioritizing mission choices, upgrading the outpost, weapons, and vehicles.\n\nBalance\n\nThe main characteristics of our vehicles are: Speed, Maneuverability, Armor. The faster the car, the less strength. The higher the Armor, the slower the car. Controllability depends on the type of car, its personality. For example: the ""Interceptor"" muscle car is very fast, but poorly controlled.\n\nThe main characteristics of the weapon are: Damage, rate of fire, radius of destruction. Here the situation is as follows: the higher the damage, the lower the rate of fire. The higher the rate of fire, the lower the damage. For example: ""Machine Gun"" has low damage, medium rate of fire and medium radius. The rocket launcher has high damage and low rate of fire, high range.\n\nFor each improvement, points are awarded to certain characteristics, with a certain amount it becomes possible to kill the boss, in this case, about 40 points.\n\n**The moment you've been waiting for: how to make money from it?**\n\nSo, Soft currency is Money: for each killed bandit or enemy, the completed task, the Outpost Chief pays money, with the money we can buy a new vehicle and improve buildings, for example, a warehouse so that it can hold more spices.\n\nHard currency - Spice: in the warehouse, for each load of spices, you can get a loot box with supplies, from which an improvement for an already open weapon or vehicle can drop randomly, the same cannot be dropped again, but parts drop for each vehicle separately.\n\nAdvertising: - It takes time to deliver the supply loot box, which can be shortened by watching advertisements. For further deliveries of supply crates, it is necessary to bring spices. If the player does not want to go for spices, he can directly buy them from the store for real money, upgrade his car and get content faster.\n\nSince the main character does not know who killed his partner, you can add new bosses and locations on our way for a long time, for which a certain type of car is more suitable. For example: you can go to the location ""mud swamp"" only by a car with a caterpillar track. For the ""freeway"" location, a muscle car is better suited. Location ""quicksand"" - hovercraft. Ruins is a machine with a bucket to push obstacles apart."
npow3g,diverse bio-mecha,"I was thinking about how you could make humongous mecha a little bit less stupid, and my diseased brain spat out this wonky idea;\n\nAlien super science is used to create mammalian hybrid meat suits - basically meaty power armour. Making them bigger increases the power of the native weapons systems which are based on the same gravity bending magic tech that makes them fly, and mitigates the cube squared law, but they can only bend the cube squared law so far, so the smaller ones have a lower top speed but can change direction faster, making them better at melee.\n\nFor a bit of extra weird, you could also have low power suits that have just enough power to fly, a little bit, and huge eyes and ears, for sniper and recon work.\n\nFor a lot of extra weird you could have suits within suits, like a Russian doll.\n\nFor anime level weird, you could make the title ""Russian Dolls"", and make the pilots Russian school girls.\n\nOf course you're thinking ""Wouldn't the big ones be based on whales, so they don't have to carry limbs around?"". That's what I thought too, but I think that mapping a whale shaped body to a human brain would be too tricky, especially when you try to integrate the senses. I can't imagine the human brain could handle that..\n\nI'm thinking of using this in a space opera, but I would be stoked to see it in a game.\n\nHope you all enjoy the nightmares."

o306sx,Main character has a curse of immortality and has to get rid of it,"You are a seemingly regular human functioning in regular society. Although no one knows it, you are immortal due to a curse hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe only way to win the game is to replay it at enough *different points in time* where there are different people in your life, and you must get to know them in order to figure out how to break the curse. There could be \~1000 years of playable time, each containing its own influenceable events,.\n\nAnother interesting part of this game is that time would be bi-directional. Things you do in your future runs would affect your past runs, and things in your past runs would affect your future runs.\n\nThere would also be a bunch of custom characters that can meet the character, fall in love, become best friends, (personality system / 1-on-1 relations) etc. You would have to witness all these people die since you are immortal. Additionally, history could be discovered about them later which was never known before. You could also do things in the past to affect the future, to say, make sure your friend survives, but this would only be possible before you knew your friend died. As you play through time, it solidifies in placee and is stuck like this forever; the time between these solidified events are malleable but also change in order to fit the current narrative on either sides of the story.\n\nThe game would be mostly interaction-based with you walking around a 2D scene and approaching people. There would be some depth to the 2D scene making it look paperlike."

o2vyig,Arbitrary Frenzy: A 5v5 FPS Multiplier Game,"A 5v5 FPS Multiplier game, however, your weapons, equipments, etc. are all random.   \n\n\n(Also, I'm not sure about the name so let me know if you have a better idea :/)  \n\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy the opponent's ""core"". Each team will have a base, the core being in the middle or something. Teams spawn in and prepare in the ""Ready-Up Phase"" (\~2 minutes). In the ""Ready-Up Phase"", players will select their **Primary Weapon**, **Secondary Weapon**, **Equipment**, **Transportation/Vehicle**, and **Ability**. During this phase, players will also start off with a few coins (\~1,000). (More on Coins later)  \n\n\n**Primary Weapons** are main weapons such as a rifle, sniper, laser, rocket launcher, etc.  \n**Secondary Weapons** are weapons like pistols, alien blasters, etc.  \n**Equipments** are items such as grenades, Molotov cocktails, freeze bomb, etc.  \n**Transportation/Vehicles** are things like cars, helicopters, jets, etc.  \n**Ability** is a special power that players can use to help them.  \n\n\nThe game will randomly choose 3 of each category and players can select 1 of the 3. Players will have a certain amount of time to select each category (\~20 seconds). If players do not choose, the game will randomly select one.  \n\n\n(I'm not sure if players should have to select new weapons, etc. when they die or when it's a new game though)  \n\n\nOnce this phase is over, the game will start. Players will then have to destroy the other's core. Each teams base will be protected with turrets, cannons, etc. As long as the core is not destroyed, players can respawn. I'm not sure about this, but maybe, once a teams' core is destroyed, players on that team will still be alive, but if they die, they die permanently (similar to Bedwars in Minecraft).   \n\n\nNow, how coins will work. Coins can be obtained by killing players and destroying the opponents' base (turrets, cannons, etc.). The main (and maybe only) purpose of coins is to upgrade your teams' base (turrets, cannons, etc.) and your passive ability/stats. They can also be used to rebuild your turrets, cannons, etc. (if they're destroyed by the opponents).   \n\n\n**Passive abilties/stats** are stuff like damage multiplier, coin multiplier, speed multiplier, etc.  \n\n\nAnd, I think that's about it (gameplay wise)."
o2vu7d,Anti-peta beat em up,"The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a ""shelter"", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan."
o2v7eb,Three way animosity system,"This is a mechanic for world building in a multi racial/faction environment. For explanation purposes I will use humans, elves, and orcs, but this mechanic could expand to any alien race or political factions making up a game world.\n\nThe mechanic is each race will love members of its own race, tolerate  one  other race, and despise the third race. For example humans tolerate elves and despise orcs, elves tolerate orcs and despise humans, and orcs tolerate humans and despise elves.\n\nThe player can build a crew that consists of one race and it will have high morale, but if they bring in members of another race to take advantages of the race specific game mechanics, one of the two groups of the crew will start loosing morale unless the player spends resources to bring the morale up. For example a mostly human crew brings on a few elves for their bow making skill. The humans are happy but the elves are miserable to be forced to live among so many humans. The player can buy an elfin meditation garden to keep his bow makers happy.\n\nThis expands to how your crew interacts with NPC groups. The mixed elf human crew get preferential treatment at Human settlements who don't see hated orcs. Elf settlements dislike the crew since it is majority human but are not as hostile due to the slight elf presence. Orc settlements are neutral to the player's crew since it is majority human but hey would be friendlier if there were not the slight elf presence."

o2odu6,A 1st person shooter where you try to kill as few aliens on the Moon as possible.,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nStory: On one of the Apollo missions, a tool left on the Lunar surface had Staph viruses from Earth on it. Not only did some viruses survive, but a few went into the Lunar surface and adapted to a waterless and airless environment.  This seeded life on the Moon, which underwent a very rapid evolution.  When NASA returned to the Moon in 2024, they found intelligent beings that greeted them. The Lunarians were civil with the astronauts, and the first mission went well. In 2030, you were chosen for the next mission. When you landed, there was a thrust malfunction that killed a few Lunarians waiting to greet you.  This tragic misunderstanding led them to believe that you were hostile and there to kill them. You must now repair your ship and leave, while killing as few Lunarians in self defense as possible.  The more you kill, the more damage it will do to interspecies relations.\n\nMission: To repair your ship, you need to retrieve 3 items on the Lunar surface. The first is a set of wires from a probe that landed years ago. The second is a battery in a supply crate. The third is a repair kit left over from the previous mission.  You begin the game with a detailed map.  The 3 items have a different placement on the map for each game, and will be spaced far apart.\n\nStats:  You have 6 hours of oxygen in your suit, and the game is designed to last about 2 hours playing at standard speed. Oxygen isn’t much of a problem unless you play very slowly and strategically. You also have a gun that fires high velocity particles (given to you by NASA as a precaution). The gun has 10,000 charges, so you have more than enough ammo unless you shoot recklessly.  Your suit can take 100 hits. After that, it ruptures and you decompress and die.\n\nObjective and scoring:  Your score is determined by how many Lunarians you **don’t** kill.  You must retrieve the 3 pieces needed to repair your ship, do the repairs, and then come home. The game world is a large piece of the Lunar surface, and there are 500 Lunarians in total. A perfect score would be 500, and that’s if you beat the game without killing a single one (which would be practically impossible).  A score of 0 is if you kill them all (or if you die from decompression or suffocation).\n\nGraphics and audio:  The graphics should look as close to the real Moon’s surface as possible, and should have hills, valleys, craters, cliffs, etc. The sky should have stars, the Sun, and the Earth. Your view is 1st person from inside of your environment suit.  There is no music in the game, and the only sounds that you hear are your own breathing, your footsteps, the click of your gun when you fire, the impact of being hit, the occasional radio transmission, and your own scream if you die.  Space is a vacuum, so you hear nothing outside of your suit.  All movement should reflect Lunar gravity.\n\nLunarians: They are short and stocky, with thick carapaces. Lunarians have 10 legs, and stand partially upright on their bottom 4 legs. They have 3 eyes, 2 antennas on top of their heads, and protruding circular mouths with teeth all around. Their color is light grey, like the Lunar surface. Their technology is primitive, and they attack by throwing rocks, throwing spears, or with their claws. In some parts of the game, you see odd-looking structures made of stones, which are their above-ground buildings.  It takes 1 to 4 shots to kill a Lunarian.\n\nOther:  You can save your game and come back to it later,  The view is 1st person, and movement is 3-D. You can select your gender, but the only difference is the sound of the scream if you die (which would be either a masculine or feminine scream).  You should be able to log on to the server to upload your score, and view the top scores. There should also be deathmatch tournaments where two players battle it out with each other.\n\nFun fact: If this game is made, then it will be the very first 1st person shooter where the objective is to kill as few opponents as possible!"
o2cva2,A sci-fi game theme that can allow permanent and permadeath characters to compete against each other in PvP.,"Hi, just posting a game idea :) The idea is for a storyline that meshes with a type of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay part is a way to have procedural level generation, permanent characters on one side and permadeath/hardcore characters on another side.\n\nThe storyline is a sci-fi thing, there is an entity called the ""Locust Fleet"" which goes from system to system, or maybe star cluster to star cluster, consuming the resources of that cluster.  These represent the permanent characters, who are the villains.\n\nThe heroes are the permadeath/hardcore characters.  They represent the system defenders.  If they die, they are typically permanently dead, depending on some other possible stuff such as wounding systems.\n\nThe terrain of key areas on each planet in each system is procedurally generated.  The heroes (system defenders) win if they can cause enough damage to the attacking Locust Fleet, or delay them for long enough.  The Locust Fleet has to move on after suffering enough damage/delay because there is an even more dangerous entity that is hunting them, so they can't stay in one place for too long.  There are also plenty of systems/clusters that have little to no defense, so if a system is defended too well, it's simply not worth it to them to stay in that system.  They also typically never return to a system that they have previously attacked because it is either stripped of most/all useful resources already, or if it wasn't, they can assume that attacking without the element of surprise is not a good idea since they already failed when they attacked with it.\n\nThe Locust Fleet wins if they can take enough of the system/cluster resources, which typically involves killing most/all of the system defenders.\n\nIn rare cases, a successful system defender might follow the Locust Fleet and help defend a new system, which means both role-play opportunities and a chance to increase the ""high score"" of a specific hero character.  But having a hero character die reduces the points value, which discourages having every single defender follow to a new zone every time.\n\nSo, the game idea is basically a sci-fi themed battle game with procedural stages but the interesting part is a way to combine permadeath with permanent characters in a PvP setting."

Maybe a multiplayer sandbox mode where everyone is just doing this ridiculous stuff to each other all the time (would get boring really quick i know.), join in with your friends and steal a helicopter, blow up a limo, instantly become lvl 100 bosses and then go to your newly spawned mansion, go there, drink with girl npc's, then suddenly in bursts a lvl 1 crook killing you off, then that guy gets to keep everything, but quickly gets arrested by the police, in jail, his npc hitmen free him. Kinda lke goat simulator but crime themed or medieval themed like the many generic mobile game copy pastes.\n\nI know i'd buy something like this, just to get a kick out of it."

o21jcj,Beach Life remake/remaster!!!,"Hi Guys,\n\nI am not the biggest fan of management games (although I have 1160 hours on Surviving Mars) but IMHO Beach Life is a very good and rare management game from 2002. It's a beach resort game and this is why I dare to call it rare. I've played a ton of different games but no other game made me install Windows XP (or some emulation of it) so many times on my newer PCs over the years just to be able to play it since it's 19 years old game after all.\n\nIt seems very simple on prima vista but actually there are a lot of unique gameplay mechanics involved.\n\nIt has some nice randomizations as every single tourist has his own preferences and opinions about stuff. Every scenario seems to have some hidden modifications i.e. sometimes tourists will demand (more than usual) more bars, or water attractions, or places to party or cleanness etc.\n\nIt's fun to intentionally sell a strong beer in order to cause more crime and then have the security guard apprehend the drunk and violent person and get you some nice cashback.\n\nOr let sharks solve any potential overcrowding issues :) )).\n\nAnd this game still almost two decades later doesn't have a COMPETITOR!!! Literally I cannot find a single similar game allowing you to manage a beach resort. There might be some hybrid games where you manage a lot of stuff including beach related attractions but I've never seen a game just like Beach Life focusing entirely on one topic. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is because I am sure that there is a reasonable amount of money to be made by creating a remake/remaster of Beach Life as the market simply lacks such product.  And I would also enjoy playing such a game."

o1w6j9,A game where you get to make your own ability," This game idea is inspired by hunterxhunter, I created a post on this subreddit about this idea 10 months ago and I am reposting the idea because I have fleshed out the idea more now. I have used the flair dream but I think it could be made in smaller versions, the reason I took the dream flair is because my vision of it is really big and the version, I want to see be created is really large. The idea is a game where you get to create your own ability and I will post different version of this idea in this post because I couldn’t decide on one. In the paragraph after this one I'll talk about how Nen works and then after that I’ll talk about how the game would work.  \n\nYou can skip to the next paragraph if you want to just hear about the game idea itself. First, I need to explain a little about how hunterxhunters (hxh) magic/power system works, it's called Nen and you can use Nen to make your own ability. Nen has 6 different classes they are transmuter, enhancer, specialist, conjurer, manipulator and emission. The enhancer class lets you increase the strength of objects or yourself for example, you can strengthen your fist to make it do more damage when you punch and transmuter lets you use Nen to mimic the properties of something, for example you can mimic the properties of rubber and gum to make something that has the properties of both rubber and gum. I won't go into what all the classes do just google hxh Nen if you want to know more. The class you are assigned makes it so that you can use the classes full potential for example if two Nen users of equal skill were to enhance their fist to punch something and if one was a transmuter and the other one an enhancer the enhancer would do more damage than the transmuter. However, there is a class called the specialist class that the other classes can't use the potential of, a specialist has a unique ability only they can use like steal other abilities or predict the future etc. but a specialist can still do what the other classes can do. You can also put restrictions/conditions on an ability to make it stronger so, maybe, certain conditions need to be met before you can use an ability or you have restrictions on an ability for example you can only use an ability for a short period of time before the ability runs out and you have to wait to use it again. That’s all I'm going to explain about the Nen system I will say I did cut a lot out for simplicity's sake. \n\nSo, the idea I have for a game is where you can create your own ability. There are games that let you create other games and worlds like dreams on the PS4 and lots of games with customizable characters, but I have yet to see anything for abilities. So, the way it would maybe work is you have an in-game editor that is specifically designed to make abilities, I don’t have the technical skills to even make a prototype for this yet so I'm just going to put forward theories. Basically, you would choose a power like fire, ice or wind and then you get to choose how to manipulate that power for example you can choose projectile or sword etc. So, you are probably wondering how would you balance out the abilities and I'll go more in depth about that later but the more things you put on the ability the higher the cooldown. \n\nNow I'll start presenting the different version of the game \n\n3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version – For this version you would be in a colosseum where you fight other players or A.I. the arenas would have different themes maybe one is covered in ice/water and another arena is covered in fire/magma. The reason why I'm bringing up the themes of the arenas is because I would like for the environments the players are in to be useful so you can manipulate it and do very creative things with the players ability. Now I’ll go in depth with how the ability customization would work (this is just an example there a many different ways to make the ability system). First, you’d have a power like lightning, fire, ice, smoke, wind etc. You can then pick how you want the power to be manipulated and for the different powers there would be different ways to manipulate the power, they would be sorted into the different states of matter, the reason for having the abilities be sorted into different states of matter is because I wanted It to be somewhat realistic for example in real life you can't make a damage dealing sword out of smoke, another reason is the powers will have pre-determined attributes implemented so lightning travels really quickly by default and does a lot of damage, while smoke only makes it harder to see if the smoke is there, so if you were to make a sword out of smoke it wouldn’t do any damage by default. For this versions purposes it will be stamina, health, mana, cooldown seconds, that will be used to put limitations on the ability. So, you select the power wind which by default costs 1sec to use, you could instead make it cost 50 mana out of a mana pool of 1000 mana or make the wind power costs 50 health points out of a health pool of 1000. and then you select how you want the wind power to be manipulated, you get the options push the wind, pull the wind, tornado (basically any form that wind can take on Irl). So, you select tornado, a tornados attributes are that if it hits an enemy, the enemy will get stuck at the top of the tornado for as long as the tornado lasts, the tornado will last 1 sec by default and the tornado costs 3 seconds by default. Now you may have noticed we have only made a tornado but it wouldn’t move or has anything else on it, so, you can then pick if you want to shoot the tornado in the way you are aiming which would costs 1 sec more on the cooldown. You can pick if you want a new power to mix with the tornado let's say lighting, so now you have a lightning tornado that will move forward for 1 sec when you use it. So, you’d also be able to adjust the size of the tornado, it would have a default size which I think would be around the size of the character you are playing the bigger you make the higher the cool down. I would like to add that for simplicity's sake the bigger the ability becomes, the stronger it is, what I mean by the bigger it is the stronger it is, is, if you make the tornado bigger it will have a bigger radius for pulling things into the tornado itself. You could also adjust the time that the ability is out, for example each second you add to the length of the time that the ability is out the cooldown increases by 0.5 sec. Maybe you’d want the tornado to stay in place after the tornado has moved forward for a certain amount of time so you would also be able to edit that. I think I have made my point clear in terms of how the ability menu would work (in theory at least). So, what about a progression system, I have thought of two ways for a progression system, one is the higher level you get, the more mana, stamina and health you get, the cool downs would still be the same. The other option is the higher you level up, the lower the cool downs default cost is. I am also considering being able to use the environment to your advantage, but I can't think of a fun way gameplay wise where that would work, for example maybe you can pick golem in the ability menu editor and the only way to spawn a golem is if you have enough let’s say magma around you to create a golem, so, now you have a golem made out of magma, so the environment around could be used to create things but the restriction is that it would need a certain quantity of for example magma in the area to create the golem. Every time you enter a battle you wouldn’t be able to change the ability so, if you go up against a boss, you can't change the ability while on that boss, so even If you die you have to have the same ability until you beat the boss. So, I think that’s going to be it for this version on to the next one. \n\nPuzzel game version \- Basically for this version you would have to make abilities to beat the levels in the game. I’ll be honest I haven't given a lot of thought about how a game like this would work, but you would start with a power and then as you progress through the levels you get new powers after beating the previous level. The higher the level the more combinations and the more advanced the puzzle becomes. I put in this version of the game just to show how diverse this idea can be.    \n\n3d OpenWorld rpg version \- So, this version does take a lot of inspiration from Minecraft. You would start with nothing only a health, mana, and stamina bar. But the world itself would have a bit of a twist as the starting area would not be randomly generated so you would start on a huge island with a few kingdoms constantly at war which you can ally with, there is a lot more to this idea that I have thought out but I won't be mentioning it here because it would be too long of a post, but I'd be willing to explain this idea out in more detail if asked, I also, want to focus more on the game idea itself which is making your own ability. So, you start off with nothing and I'm not sure if I want the player to start of knowing how to use the mana system (I don’t think I have mentioned it but the mana system is what I have named the create your own ability system) or if the player does know the mana system but you don’t have access to a wide variety of powers or no power at all just only the mana system. For this version I need to explain some of the story I have written for the mana system, in short mana is life force, which means that mana can only be wielded by living beings, mana itself looks like some type of invisible energy, mana can only be used to mimic other forms of matter/energy in the universe, so you could copy fire, light etc. So, each kingdom would have powers that they specialize in, maybe there is a kingdom that specializes in lightning or another kingdom that specialize in wind etc. I know this is just straight up taken for avatar the last airbender but I'm not very original 😛. So, you as the player would gain different powers from each kingdom once you travel to them and learn from the people how to utilize each power. I was thinking about doing multiple endings for the 3d OpenWorld for example maybe you could restore peace to the kingdoms or make everyone your slave etc. But I won’t go into it more than what I already have done. Everything expect for the kingdoms would be fully destructible. Like I said in the beginning of the post I could go into it more but it would be too long of a post.  \n\n2d Platformer\- So, this is another idea I haven't given a lot of thought into, but I'm going to mention it because this is the easiest version to make, because you don’t have to think in 3 dimensions. The animations would be in pixel art so they would be easier to make then a 3d version. That is all I have to say about this version, but basically take the 3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version I wrote and just make that idea into 2d.  \n\nHunterxHunter version \- So, I think I have always wanted a hxh game ever since I first watched it in 2015 but I just didn’t have an interest in gamedev at the time. I haven't given this idea much thought because it would be really difficult to make unless you want to take some artistic liberties, so, for example the gameplay needs to feel good and I’m not sure how that would happen when abilities like Hisoka's bungee gum exist. I'm not going to go into it too much but I’m just not sure how to make a fun game using Nen unless you cut out a lot from the Nen system. I had a few ideas like maybe for the specialist class if you were to pick it then you would get a random unique ability that you couldn’t choose, which is why it would be a high risk selecting that class, I have more ideas I think but that’s all I feel like sharing.      \n\nFinal words \- personally I feel like the multiplayer game industry has gotten very stale, not sure if it always has been this way. To me games have started to feel very similar especially multiplayer games, or it's just the same problems I have with other games that reoccur in others. Personally, I want a game where creativity in combat is the larger focus and not a game where just being good at one thing like aiming makes it so you win and I hope that a game like this would be refreshing for the game industry. Finally, I have basically realized that my real-life problems make it so that I won’t really ever be able to make this game in the vision I want, I keep watching tutorials, then I stop and forget everything in an endless cycle so I don’t think I’ll ever be able to make this game sadly, but I keep dreaming about it. "
o1vg3e,Speed Racer,"Ok here me out, I just rewatched the movie Speed Racer after a very long time and I think it's an amazing movie, now I know it received a lot of bad rep and is considered a failure to some but even the idea is incredible.\n\nI had the idea of turning it into a game. Now I know there have been games but those a really old and honestly not what I'm aiming for. I'm looking at most of the movie elements, there's colossal tracks, secret(illegal too)weapons to modify vehicles and so much can go into customization of an iconic race car. I want to add these ALL OF IT. I imagine it could be a multiplayer and a really large game in terms of storage because of all the things I want incorporated. I thought it could have a tutorial on how to maneuver the car because I do want to see the exact thing we see in the movie or something close enough even just the feel.\n\nI could honestly ramble about this all day so for now I'll leave it hear. And I realized that most of this is all about the movie so it may not gain much popularity. It's just a thought anyway."
o1p0tf,Trapped in a game so glitchy the npcs become sentient,"The story would involve the hero being trapped inside a shitty game, like in avgn adventures, but the game was progra.med SO badly, that the game characters become sentient, and so some of them, like the friendly npcs, ask to join your party so they can escape the game with you, while the villians want to invade the real world, which they do in the final level. The gameplay itself involves abusing the glitches to your advantage, such as a noclip teleport, or messing up the graphics as a distraction. The ending will have the heroes realize they're still stuck in a game (the one being played), and then they bust out of the game window (or into the console menu), complete with a cartoony hole where they lept out of, and run off into the internet (or the digital store), and then if you have that save data, they show up in other games, living new lives travelling the multiverse."

That is when they find Earth, another planet with intelligent life and its own legal system, and quickly find you (yes, the lawyer from space is YOU!). They decide to abduct you to spearhead a new age of lawyers.\n\nAt first glance, it may sound like a space-themed Ace Attorney, but as a visitor to a whole different planet, you have to unravel a completely different society, with different cultures, customs, and of course, law. Inbetween your lawyering, you must understand how the wheels of their civilization works in order to reach that not guilty veredict. Can you get used to what is now considered legal or crime? Can you win in a battle of wits where common sense is thrown out of the window? How will you act when you have to choose between your dearly held morals and their law?\n\nIDK, sounds like a fun game to me."

o1gwza,A co-op platformer but with a unique POV,"Basically your POV is of the character your partner controls and vice versa. except you control the camera. So you would need to describe how far to move and which ways and where jumps need to be done.\n\nThe game could start with your partner visible, so you are able to see what you are doing from a perspective (like a fixed camera-ish) and then slowly block vision of your partner/ character you control to solely rely on your partner to describe what to do."
o1ffff,"Game that's all Controls Tutorials, but it gets Weird","My game idea is one where the entire thing is a controls tutorial puzzle game.\n\nSo, the game will start by starting with WASD and Space Bar to complete a certain task.\n\nThen then it becomes DSAW and Space for the same task, or a different one it doesn't really matter. \n\nEventually, after some escalation, the tutorials become more like riddles or visual puzzles to figure out the controls.\n\nI'm also picturing a level where the mechanism that tells you the controls breaks for a level, so it's a matter of randomly clicking keyboard buttons till you find the keys. Or another level where the player actions change the controls mid level. Or maybe a level that's red light green light, but the player has to adapt to changing controls.\n\nNot sure how to end it, maybe a typing of the dead style boss fight using weird controls, I don't know. That's my idea, thank you!"
o1f80j,Multiplayer hitman,"I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants. \nIt only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target. \nVisuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP.\nAesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.   \nGameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky.\nIf topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept.\nEnd-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received.\nGame balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it.\nThanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it."

Swift was told by the town's priest that a cure can be made from a magical flower, this flower can only be found deep in a dungeon built into a large cave. The priest tried to warn swift of the dangers the dungeon held, but swift was determined and began gathering a few supplies. Before leaving, the priest gave swift a pair of enchanted boots that turned the ground he stepped on to ice. So with nothing but a few weapons and the ice boots, swift set out to claim this magical flower, but things aren't as they seem.\n\n**Gameplay:** a 2d pixel platformer with very little friction. You slide around a massive dungeon, discovering secrets, and defeating enemies. you can choose to wield 4 different weapons, and each have their own skill trees and attack patterns. The weapons are a sword, a battle axe, a bow, and a magic wand. Each weapon has a heavy attack and a light attack that will activate different moves depending on where and how your moving, similar to combat from brawlhala. There will be 4 main areas/levels to explore and find secrets in, these areas are the barracks, the dark dungeons, the enchanted tower, and the frozen garden. \n\nEach area has its own boss, and once you kill them you get their weapon which gives you a new ability. There will also be secret mini bosses that will upgrade your ice boots in different ways. You can slide, double jump, dash, and leap off walls. I also plan to add a PvP arena where you can battle other players.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to see in the game, or anything you would like to change?"
o19s51,Choice based game,"Its a 1v1 competitive game where both side choose between soldiers and then the fight happens automatically.\n\n\nEach player start with 100$ and secretly choose 1  soldier between 25 different soldier all displayed on screen. If both players choose the same soldier, that soldier is removed and another round of picking starts. If both players choose a different soldier, they both buy their choices, and a new round of picking happens. This goes on until both players can't buy a soldier anymore. There is no soldier limit per team.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers have 4 different attributes:\n\n\n* Price (5-30)\n\n\n* Speed (1-25) (each soldier has a different speed)\n\n\n* Hit Points (1-25)\n\n\n* Damage (1-10)\n\n\n\nThe game auto generate these soldiers, but obviously the AI tries to have a minimum of balance so players don't always make the same choices. For example, a slow cheap soldier with a lot of hit points would be too strong.\n\n\nOnce the picking is over, the battle starts. The first soldier to shoot is always the fastest one, and he always shoots the slowest enemy. Then the next fastest soldier shoots, and this goes on until the slowest alive soldier has shot. Then the process repeats until one side is decimated.\n\n\n\nThe winner wins elo points, and there would be match making to ensure fairness."

o15ksv,A puzzle game with a unique feature.,"""A puzzle game with a unique feature.""  \n\n\nThe main goal of the game is to escape an unknown dimension/world using combat and strategy. The setting would take place in a world similar to Monument Valley and gameplay-wise, it would be pretty basic. However, there would be the feature of shapeshifting/transformation.   \n\n\nBasically, players will have the ability to transform into a different creature/entity to assist you throughout the game, and ultimately, you **will** need them to overcome certain obstacles and complete the game. For example, you might need to jump over something that the main character can't. To resolve this, you could transform into the character that is capable of jumping over it. Each character would have a specific ability/task that it'd be used for (jumping, shrinking, pushing, etc.).   \n\n\nTo make this game more of a challenge, I was thinking maybe each level would be timed and there could also be a limit to how long you can stay transformed for every character. This would maximize players' ability to problem-solve and be quick at the same time.  \n\n\nAs for how you would get each character, I'm not too sure. I was maybe thinking there would be a combat system and to get a characters' soul, you'd have to kill them, but I don't know lol."
o13knq,A crypto currency game that can actually work.,"There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.\n\nThe core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.\n\nThen to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.\n\nYes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**\n\nBy using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.\n\nNow players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do the developers make money from this:\n\nBy selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.\n\nIn short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.\n\nThe developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash."

o10wwr,A men in black kind of game,Men in black have always been my favorite secret organization however there hasn't been any good games with said universe. \n\n\nI recall some shooter game we had but that one didn't really feel like an mib game.\n\n\nWe also have xcom and other like it but theybmostly fight aliens head on and don't try to cover things up. \n\n\nI would love to see one game were we are at the beginning of the MIB era or another version of it.\n\n You go out question vitnesses investigate crime sites. \n\nTry to figure out the alien species and then try to find its next target. \n\nAnd more importantly come up with a lame excuse before you neutralize them losing possible leads forever.\n\nMaybe even some base building where you get new tech that you buy of other alien spiecies. Still a mystery to me how MIB got their tech but i believe aliens gave it to them. Make money by selling patent of stuff like the microwave or what the mib does to gain money. \n\nIs this something that already exists? Or does this sound like a bad idea?
o10ec4,A Heist game about a small group of European criminals getting together to steal things,"There aren’t many heist games out their tbh and the heist games that are out their are kinda meh. Also i dont think there is a heist game with a story or at least i dont think so.\n\n\nFor the game I would imagine it to be a open world third person shooter with some fighting mechanics. I was thinking for the criminal group each would have a sort of role or specialty, Like one would be the brute who specializes in hand to hand combat and can take alot of hits, The Gadget guy who has the equipment needed to disable traps/ alarms and take out guards, and the leader who specializes with guns. \n\nFor the heist before you start them you would need to get the equipment or people needed for the heist which would be its own mission. Before the Heist starts you can select which plan you would want to.For the heist itself i would imagine your actions can effect the outcome of the heist alot. For example using guns or being loud will bring the police to your location alot earlier which would make the getaway driver unavailable which would force you to take a different escape route. There would also be a variety of heists like having to protect a safecracker so they can open the vault, having people held hostage to get what you need etc. As the game goes on each heist will get bigger and more difficult. I would also imagine there to be side missions like maybe stealing things at a much smaller scale,being blackmailed by corrupt government members to do some jobs for them etc\n\n\nFeel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments below"

o0wyvc,3 player Beatboxing competition game,"Not going to lie I had this idea while playing Friday night funkin.\n\nTwo players face off in a beatboxing competition while the third player spectates and judges who wins each round of Beatboxing\n\nFor the control scheme I'm imagining a standard duelshock/sense for this.\nEvery button does a different beatbox noise while the analog sticks change the pitch and speed of the noise,while the touchpad is used to make scratching noises\n\nBoth player gets the same predetermined amount of time to perform their beatbox before it switches to the next player having a total of 2 turns each before the judging starts. At the end of that a winner is chosen for the round and they win a point, best two out of three wins.\n\nThere's no predetermined charts to compete against, neither is there a score system, the winner is determined purely by who the third player spectator thinks wins.\n\nThe third player is also in charge of the background setting of the match as well as the backing music track, meaning players will have to improvise their beats more often.\n\nIn the menu, players can choose their sounds to allocate to each button from a library of pre-made beatboxing sounds as a kind of loadout to keep every player sort of unique.\n\n you can practice your beats in a practice room attached to the ""beat loadout"" menu.\n\n you can customize your character with outfits and bling you win from matches( given randomly but never repeating after a win) from a custom character screen."

o0sog5,Need some feedback on the game concept,"Hello everybody!\n\nMy name is Alexey. I am a beginner game designer (currently just taking courses). I am from Russia, specifically from Siberia. I would like to present you with a concept description of my game and get feedback. I apologize in advance for any possible incorrect translation. My English is not very good ... (all complaints to google translate J)\n\n**Game description:** The action takes place in the future. The scene is a town littered with trash up to the rooftops. The main character is a small robot that can perform only the simplest actions. A great feature of this robot is that it can think. The robot develops, recycles garbage into resources, discovers new technologies for garbage recycling, improves them ... The main goal of the game is to return the town to its original form.\n\n**Genre:** Life simulator with elements of crafting, construction, RPG.\n\n**Technical implementation:** 2D graphics like in Stardew Valley and Graveyard Keeper\n\n**Topic:** Confronting chaos. Transforming the game world from disgusting to beautiful.\n\n**Setting problem:** The world is a dump. To transform this world requires resources and technologies that are not available at the start of the game.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n* Garbage|resource - The main element of the game. What is garbage can now be converted into a resource using technology.\n* Technology - needed to build new installations and more efficiently converting waste into resources.\n* Space - At the start of the game, there is not enough space to build basic installations. To start efficiently recycling waste, you first need to build which of the basic installations is better to build (a crusher or a warehouse of that type of waste or a press installation ...)\n* NPC Community - There are still residents (NPCs) in the city who have already forgotten that their city was once a beautiful and comfortable place to live. The robot's job is to bring them back to normal.\n\n**Possibilities of the main character:**\n\n* Perform the simplest work of collecting and sorting garbage;\n* The ability to improve;\n* Ability to build facilities for sorting and recycling waste;\n* Ability to develop technologies\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThe player will control a small robot to transform the game world. In order to do this, it is necessary to find the appropriate technologies that are scattered throughout all locations. Accordingly, it will be necessary to penetrate into abandoned and littered buildings, investigate them, find samples of equipment.\n\nThe development of technologies will increase the depth of processing waste into resources:\n\n* Level 1: Scrap Metal - Pressed Scrap\n* Level 2: Scrap Metal - Iron Ingot\n* Level 3: Iron Ingot - Steel Ingot\n* Level 4: Steel Ingot - Steel Beam\n* ...\n\nInteraction with NPCs is also an important aspect of the game. First, NPCs give simple tasks to the hero, for example, bring 10 iron ingots. As the character and technologies develop, NPCs begin to give more difficult tasks, for example, free this building from garbage and bring resources, then this NPC will take this building and open a shop for something there.\n\nThe game ends when the last NPC finds a home and acquires a profession.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Stardew Valley - character management, crafting and inventory system, building system, principles of building the game world\n* Graveyard Keeper - Character Control, Graphic Style\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment I can not provide screenshots or a video, because the idea is still in its infancy and my skills are still not enough to create a prototype of the game. Therefore, I tried to make a clear text description and at the same time not make it too long.\n\n**Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!**"

o0ltb0,"Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android","Hi guys, \n\nI would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing. \n\nIt is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it. \n\nGameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.\n\nThere are certain requirements to build units. \n\n1.	Mine – free\n\n2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal\n\n3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal\n\n4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood\n\n5.	Air units – 3x food + metal"

You can only teach each student so much so you'll have to pick what to focus on and what to omit.\n\n---\n\nScenario ideas:\n\nHistory Classes give kids better overall decision making. Math and Science allow them to improve their province's infrastructure.\n\nGiving the kids military training may help them with conquest - both of other nations and over each other. You could forgo military training to hopefully build a more peaceful state but that might backfire if you get invaded by neighbors.\n\nMaybe give the kids a few semesters of swordsmanship so that they don't get killed in a duel. Or omit that from somebody you don't like so that a more promising younger sibling can usurp them.\n\nTeach them statecraft so they can better manage political matters.\n\nHave somebody that's a bit of a punk?

o0k91y,An evolution game based on skillpoints,"Sort of like irl millions of years ago where different abilities/skills got you somewhere different. Every 10-50 skill points used, your ""build"" could become available for others to start as. for example, a dude has put all his points to defence and his/her ""build"" has gained either hard skin or a shell, after reaching the 10-50 points used, people could have the option to choose the ""build"" and sort of become that species. and either continue the same strategy or deviate from the strategy and swap or put some points to the offense for example. skills could be for example: intelligence, eyesight, offense, defence, mobility and stealth.\n\nI don't know if this is in any way possible because I'm no game dev and don't know how ridiculously hard this would be or if even possible, but I got this idea in my head from TierZoo (a content creator on YouTube) and the ""Ancestors:humankind odyssey"" game (I don't think this would be a copy since that game focuses on only human evolution)"

o09no1,Question about world building,I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
o06uga,life/zombie/disaster game,"The idea is a multiplayer sandbox game where you start off as a civilian working a job whatever you decide you can choose when creating character and doing day to day things. hang out with mates etc. pretty much a life simulator game but eventually after some time a zombie apocalypse outbreak would happen where everyone's characters would need to run etc to escape the apocalypse. the players characters will turn into the zombies you are fighting creating more zombies to fight and the zombies you are killing are real player models. each server should be at different stages so players wanting to start fresh can and those who want the zombie aspect can run that.  \n\n\n**Life:** during the life sim part you can respawn and do what most life sims do. buy a house, car food and water. build a bunker in your back yard if you like. do whatever you feel you want to do. if you want to get ready for the apocalypse why not but the limiting factor should be funds. stockpiling guns and ammunition why not but people need to keep working to earn money and should be punished by not working. if someone wants go full bush and and live in a little wooden house let them but unless they steal they shouldn't be able to get mid to top end weapons.  \n\n\nIn the life stage of the game people should be allowed to respawn as much as they would like. when i say respawn though i mean end up in hospital regardless of the sort of injury to allow people to keep moving forward but it will cost them $x to be treated. if they cant afford to pay for the medical attention they have to respawn as a new character. maybe as a relative who inherits their stuff but new stats etc.  \n\n\n**Jobs:** most real life jobs should be in the game to some extent from manufacturing which give better crafting stats, paramedic which gives better healing stats all the way through to hobo. each job being worked will give stats towards the accompanying occupation. there should be benefits towards every occupation including hobo that will help during the outbreak. people should also be able to attend classes to level up certain stats as well but of course that costs money but could also lead them into making more money such as a manufacturer can create better items causing more income etc.  \n\n\ndepending on player numbers there should also be npc's that act as bosses or key characters in the game. medics should have to go out to where things have gone wrong such as car accident or robbery gone wrong. if someone commits a crime they will be reported but there needs to be some sort of system in place that can help the criminal get away with the crime if they do it well. if they manage to rob a bank and not reveal their identity they should be allowed to get away with it. when they are reported either by a player or spotted through cameras etc they should be sent through to the police who will be notified of the persons name and added to an most wanted list and essentially have bounties on them. the bigger the price of the bounty the more people can join in.  \n**Outbreak:** The zombies should be rather menacing when the outbreak starts. think war z when they're in New York in rush hour traffic. it could hit at any time and the players shouldn't really have an idea of when unless they work in certain divisions of military. at most they should have 10 minutes in the cities as the outbreak occurs which can be heard through normal means like radio tv etc. at this point people should be allowed to raid shops without joining a bounty list and money doesn't become a necessity at all. people can raid and loot whatever they want but the hordes of people should be pushing from inside the cities forcing people to run or bunker down wherever they are.  \n\n\nonce the outbreak starts people can no longer respawn into the current game. if they die to anything other than a zombie a medic with a high enough stat can bring them back within a short period of time but headshots are instant death with no respawn. a spectator mode should be allowed but players should be allowed to turn spectating on them off so that would prevent ghosting. to spectate a player you need to type their name in so as to prevent ghosting.  \n\n\nIf this gets too much backlash a party system with so many extra lives could be given to simulate people coming together as a group and play as a npc such as a family member etc who escaped with them. these extra lives could be given to people as they rescue npc's from situations but of course they would have all new stats and attributes.  \n\n\n**Post outbreak:** at this stage people should be dying off but i would love to see what people do at this stage. with the ability to fortify and build a compound to defend using vehicles etc and try recreate some sort of society or turn into nomads running from place to place. really this point is about thinning out the last of survivors to start the cycle over again. im eager to hear peoples suggestions on this as to how this should end. i feel like a forced ending like nuclear explosion would ruin this part but holding off until the last person is dead also feels like a bit of a buzzkill too. i feel like once the last group has had its last member die after no more respawns available should be the end of the game.   \n\n\n**World:** the world should be relatively large. I'm picturing semi instanced regions where there is a city in one or 2 regions that leads into towns and forests. as a regions zombie % goes up it starts to trickle into the other regions. as the world goes on wandering zombie hordes should start to travel around. these hordes should be able to be messed with by flares and explosions or loud noises in general. if a horde is wandering nearby a place players should be able to set off fireworks to redirect the movement of the horde towards the noise. church bells cars anything major like that should allow players to plan some sort of defence or offense using the zombies as tools.  \n\n\n**Other disasters:** As the game is updated later on other disasters could happen such as military takeover or natural disaster and the server rolls a dice to see which disaster it gets. this would keep players on their toes and tuned into the radio in game or watching the news for the latest happenings.\n\nsorry for the long post. I've really been wanting to see a zombie sandbox where players are in the thick of the initial outbreak. In a story driven game its always planned out and I've never really been able to enjoy the escape that much. although I did love how the last of us did their escape sequence but after the first couple of times you know what's going to happen when and it loses that something special. Please leave any other ideas or suggestions in the comments and I really hope an amazing dev picks it up.   \n\n\nIf you do make the game from my idea **please shoot me some credit** through some fun way in game e.g. browsing reddit in game on a laptop or on a billboard. some fun little easter egg. also feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like more ideas i've got more to this idea but the post is already long enough."
o04niv,A sports series that gives you compete control,Im thinking about making a sports game that gives you compete control of your everyday life from buying cars and houses to getting to your event on time but the game will have players starting off in high school and depending on what version you pick up would determine what sports that would be open for you but you would be able to associate with all players through out the game
o032mc,"Trying to create a unique MOBA, Part 2","Thanks to the few people who replied to my first post, here are some changes I think would make it better. \n\n First, I think we could have both of the old ideas in the game, and just make them separate modes . For changes to the first idea we simply move it away from being a team deathmatch and back to more of a MOBA, as I originally intended. We do this by making the goal of the game anything else besides killing enemy players; although it could work as a team deathmatch its just that I dont want to copy battlerite. I want to still make the goal something more unique than just destroying the enemies base, but I feel like a fast paced 4v4 two lane MOBA where you make your own custom hero is unique enough. Generally, I want this mode to still be mainly PvP focused.\n\n For the second idea I came up with a two ways to change it. Firstly it could entirely be a co-op PvE mode where you and your team of 4 get a certain amount of time to farm before a giant boss shows up that you have to kill. Second we could make it a PvEPvP, you on a team of 4 against another team of 4, both teams have to compete over minions and jungle camps. After a certain amount of time a boss shows up, Instead of killing the boss the team that deals the most damage to the boss by the end wins the game."
o02alz,Here is my idea of a dungeon crawler type game that I am most likely gonna make,"My ideas I have come up with so far are:\n\n* Enter dungeon, possibly fight monsters or be stealthy, loot, leave\n* Sell loot for gold coins which then you can use to buy upgrades and equipment\n* Obviously different loot items would be worth different amounts but item could also be worth more or less based off its condition, like damaged or pristine\n* Some upgrades could be Strength, Stealth, speed, HP, and luck\n* And finally it would probably be top down 2D\n\nPlease comment any other ideas you might have."
nzyivn,Tree simulator,"Control the growth of a tree from seedling to mighty oak (or other kind of tree). Decide where to grow branches, roots, leaves and fruits/seeds/flowers. The game has an above ground and below ground view. The gameplay is very chill/relaxing. Each season takes about 2 minutes. Challenges include expanding the root system to find new nutrients, competition from other plants, infestation with bugs or disease, etc. You can deal with some problems by killing off a bit of the trunk or branches and cauterizing with bark. Players could sort of prune or grow their tree strategically for artistic purposes (like a bonsai tree).\n\nCould be 2d or 3d."
nzwku4,"Silent Hill 1/ResiEvil 3 controls, Dark fantasy rpg elements (like Dark Souls) and a ""stance"" system like Bushido Blade type game","Title sounds convoluted but lemme explain.\n\nIn this game you would have the tank controls like Silent Hill 1, with a 3rd pov camera (exception being areas where a fixed camera would work). You utilize a stamina bar for every time you run, attack, dodge, and block you do.\n \n\n- You have 3 stats you level up throughout the game: Endurance (health) Attack Power (how strong your attacks are) and Agility (how much stamina you have). Theres 4 starter classes each with different amount of points put into all 3 (all starting at lvl 15). \n\n\n - Combat in this game is like Resident Evil 3/Silent Hill 1 melee attacking (however when you are in you attack mode you can still walk backwards slowly, so you arent stuck in place. Your attacks stagger more often and are quickerm to make up for the tank controls.)\n\n\n- Doing a jumping back dodge is an option too, which makes you invincible during the entire animation, but takes all your stamina, meaning you cant immediately attack. Guarding attacks is done automatically when you have the ""attack stance"" button held down (by attack stance I mean like in ResEvil you stand in place pointing your weapon). Guarding an attack will only take part of your stamina but will do less damage to you, making it so you can attack afterwards.\n\n\n - You have 2 stances for each weapon, a medium and a high (kinda like in Bushido Blade). Some enemies will also utilize stances and guarding. These enemies require that you guard whichever area attack they use on you, and attack the area they arent guarding. (Example: you see a bloodied knight raise his sword in the air signaling a high attack, so you switch to the high guard. It successfully blocks, taking stamina and a little health. He then goes into high guard, so you change back to medium and successfully hit him)\n\n\n - A few enemies will be crawling on the floor or ceiling, which means you must face upwards/downward to attack them. The up and down stance are their own stance, and doesnt hit a normal ""in front of you"" enemy. Some enemies, while not utlizing stance themselves, will have areas of their body defended permanently so you can only use one stance attack against them (for example, some kinda of demon whose legs and torso are stone, so only high attacks damage them.)\n \n\n- Multiple weapons can be found throughout the world (axes swords, bladed batons, daggers, halberds, spears, even ranged weapons like bows and thrown items) along with armor sets. Each starter class has a unique set of armor they start with that only they can use, but these armors all have the same stats. Armor is mostly cosmetic but each have some kind of upgrade, usually a +(#) boost to health or endurance.\n \n\nI have a whole lot of other things written down but I dont wanna over do it more than I already have in this post. Id love to see this game made someday. If anyone has criticism, questions, or wants to hear any more ideas for this (concepts, enemy/level designs, boss designs, lore things) id love to hear it. Thanks for reading."

nzmwfx,Second person storytelling," I need your feedback with our game project. Me and my team are building this adventure-roleplaying game in a dieselpunk world mixed with art deco aesthetics.  It’s still in the early stages of development.   \n \n\nOur main gameplay twist is that the game is second person storytelling ™. For us second person storytelling ™ can be described that you are playing as Watson in Scherlock Holmes stories, or Alfred in Batman story. This means that you play as support type side character, in a story revolving a hero that is larger than life. Translated in to gameplay this means that most of the decisions are made by the hero, and you cannot directly harm enemies, you just have to make hero survive by e.g. using smoke grenades or gadgets that fit the dieselpunk theme.\n\nThoughts?"
nzkb6s,a new thief game,"This is 3rd person rpg game . A reboot to the old thief series\n\nThe game takes place in medieval times and like the old thief games it has a little magic but its not full blown fantasy game\n\nstory\n\nThe game starts with a cutscene where you are a kid thats helping ur parents working in the garden feeding animals and stuff and a group of soldiers come to collect taxes from the kingdom . You parents dont have enough so they want to have sex with your sister and they wont take everything you have . The father says no and they try to take her by force , your father tries to fight them but he gets killed , your mother tells you to start running in the forest she gets killed aswell and your sister was caught raped and killed too \n\nyou return to the house when the night comes only to find you family's heads on spikes and house burned down . You go to the city and start begging for food when someone from the Thiefs guild finds you and recruits you . You play 1 or 2 missions as a child then you grow up . In one of ur mission as a adult you go to rob a house of one of the king's guard and as he sleeps you recognize him as the one that came for the taxes and killed your family . Here you have a choice  (1) either do your job and get out or (2) brake the rules and kill him\n\nIf you chose number 1. you kill continue to do missions for the thiefs guild , and eventualy become the guild leader, you will be able to decide what kind of jobs you can give to other and the main story will revolve around the war between the thiefs guild and the kingdom trying to save the poor and eventualy bring down the king \n\nif you chose number 2. the thiefs guild will abandon you for breaking one of the most important rules ( never kill your target ) and you will do missions that you can find around the city from tavern or just hearing people talk , the main story will revolve around a conspiracy that a group of necromancers will try to bring down the kingdom from within and make everyone slaves of the ancient evil religion\n\nThere will be other important decisions to be made and you can choose a side and be good or evil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\nMost important is that you can enter every building , every window every door can be broken or lockpicked as long as your skill will be high enough\n\nalot of parkour , climbing will be very important \n\nthe classic rope arrow , water arrow \n\njust like in the previouse game you can choose to fight with a sword but you wont be very good because of your skinny constitution , if you try to fight 2 people at once ur dead 100%\n\nchoice will have a great impact , everything will change around you as you make the decissions for example house from rich people can become empy if you rob all their money and you can see them on the streets poor \n\nYou walk around the town without a mask in places like taverns and look for missions , normal mission that will help you improve your skills will be in normal places like taverns and brothels and main story missions you will either get them by raven at ur house or by npcs in a underground world in the sewers"
nzk4nt,"Drag to Hell, a zombie survival shooter with Drag Queens.","Picture it, horrifying zombie outbreak. People dismembered and devoured only to rise up and join the undead crowd. Fires and explosions everywhere, but there’s only one thing standing against the hordes of undead tonight. Four fabulously dressed divas with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGuns, glamour and guts galore. Want to take it close range with the deadites with a manniquin leg, wig head or a brick filled purse? Go right at it! Prefer a glue gun turned pistol or a confetti cannon full of shrapnel and glitter? Show these corpses how it’s done.\n\nDrag to Hell? Drag fights back.\n\nMy idea is a campy version of Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood with the comedy of Lollipop Chainsaw and a million and one gay podcasts, youtube channels and drag shows combined. You could pick from different classes of queens from snarky hard hitting queens with melee weapons, to sweet healers or even someone throwing shade from a distance with a rifle. Light that fire with a mech queen using a flamethrower to melt face off all these ugly undead.\n\nWhile i know it’s probably somewhat offensive, after watching shows like Unhhhh and Dragula, i’d kill for just some kind of a funny, gorey, glamorous zombie game thats all shades of colors and comedy. I’d gladly pay for an Triple A title like this, even double A. I’m just putting the idea out there to hopefully stir someones interest.\n\nPlease, tell me what you think!"
nzis2a,// [PvP] Gameplay Concept - Keep moving to stay alive,"The idea is pretty straight forward as the title suggests: In order **to stay alive**, the player needs to be **constantly moving**. Staying still drains health.\n\nI've found one party game that utilizes this gameplay, called [Move or Die](http://www.moveordiegame.com/) *(who would've guessed)*\n\nBut I haven't come across any other games yet, having this as a primary feature, especially in higher productions. More specifically I'd like to see this implemented in a competitive PvP environment, like First-/Third-Person Shooters.\n\n**My Game Idea:**  \n\[Intermediate-AAA\]  \nCompetitive PvP FPS (2v2, 5v5 etc.)  \nPlayers control humanoid robots running on batteries.  \nThese batteries recharge (or stay charged) as long as the Player moves (walking, running).  \n**Edit:** Movement counting towards recharging must be significant (travel distance), not AD strafe spamming. (u/Paradox\_Synergy thx for heads up)  \nAs soon as the Player stands still (or moves on spot), the battery starts depleting (fast).  \nMaybe even emitts a distinctive beeping sound for others to hear.\n\nThis should prevent exploitations/annoyances like camping or AFK and encourage a fast-paced playstyle. It would also mean, that there's no *typical Sniper class*, since it wouldn't make much sense.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be interested in such a game?\n\nAny ideas or recommendations for improvement, expansion, similar games or else highly welcome!\n\nAlso, if you do decide to utilize this feature in your own games, please be sure to reach out to me. I'd love to see and try your takes on it! :D   \nI'm available on all significant social platforms (except Facebook) under u/domfiglhuber"

nzczp6,An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines.,"Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.\n\nThe life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.\n\nThen you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.\n\nSo for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features. \n\nAnd with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.\n\nAnd you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.\n\nI've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!"
nzcma7,Asynchronous single-player campaign missions played within large multiplayer matches. We can make it work.,"When I learned *Battlefield 2042* will not have a single-player campaign, I wondered if one could be added later-on by letting one person play a scripted single-player mission within the active battlefield of a live match. You know how some FPS single-player missions take place within a chaotic, active war? What if we do that, but the war is other actual players having a large-scale match.\n\nWith some tweaks, I think it can work. This is how:\n\n1. **The multiplayer mode is free-to-play while the single-player campaign is not (like Halo Infinite will be).** Even though the number of players in multiplayer usually far outnumber those playing single-player, this model will ensure there are more multiplayer users than single-player users.\n\n2. **The story involves a country using the war as cover for some secret plan.** In other words, your teammates aren't helping you with your mission because they don't even know about it. It's just you.\n\n3. **The missions are short enough that they can be completed within the length of a single ground war multiplayer match.** For reasons I'll get into later, the locations of your objectives are different every match. You'll have to get from point A to point B without dying, which can be difficult in the middle of a ""real war"" so it's important the missions are short enough to retry in a new lobby.\n\n4. **The large multiplayer maps have several doors and buildings that players regularly can't enter, except for the one person playing the campaign mode.** Any scripted cutscenes or events that should not be interrupted would happen there. You might enter one buildings, move through some vague underground system, and emerge from another player-only building for your next objective.\n\n5. **Dynamic story events would happen outside in the chaotic battlefield.** Sometimes the next objective isn't to get to another secure building. Sometimes the objective is outside ""in the shit"" so to speak, such as having to kill a villain that's escaping in a vehicle. Or you might have to trigger a dynamic map event like collapsing a building or destroying a dam. In situations like this, your teammates might make things easier or the enemy team might make it harder. But that's war. Someone on your team might unknowingly kill your target for you to complete your objective.\n\n6. **Missions are dynamic using some smart system to keep it as fair as possible.** If players guess who is the campaign player, some of them might troll the player. So the locations of story events, as well as the paths that NPC targets might take outside, are dynamically scripted to avoid (or sometimes approach) where the action is heaviest. Moreover, when the objective is to trigger a dynamic map event (collapse building, destroy dam, etc.) the smart system would have to pick one that hasn't been done on the map yet.\n\nLastly, the whole thing can be asynchronous as it needs to be. If the game needs to make you invisible to players and them invisible to you, while spawning AI enemies only for you, it can.\n\n****\nIt could be fun. It'll make replaying missions new experiences every time. It could lead to some crazy, by-the-skin-of-your-teeth missions for people to share replays of. And most importantly, as the developer you get to repurpose all the maps and assets that already exist for multiplayer instead of making those expensive single-player campaigns. Even AAA budgets can't keep up with those costs."
nzbwnw,Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights),"First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.""\n\nThe game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.\n\nI am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game."

nz7jlh,"In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first","Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this. \n\nI had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.\n\nI can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.\n\nSo the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters\n\nOr I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.\n\nWhich seems like a better option?"
nz704x,Missed a major core aspect of my rhythm game idea for some reason. Gameplay.. hElp,"I was gonna make a pretty big post here, but I realised that the gameplay makes very little to no sense.\n\nIn the most basic of basics layman's term, you create a beat (made out of meters). Then the opponent would play it and they would give their own afterwards, but then I thought ""How the hell is that even gonna work?"". I originally thought you could just make it before joining a round, but that would end up making it sound terrible. \n\nMaybe you could make the beat during the game, but I don't know how you would make the ""beat"" in the first place. I also don't think that wouldn't sound very good.\n\nThere's one feature I wrote of which I have no idea what it means. But it has something to do with ""snappers"" which are rectangles that connect from right to left. I'm not sure if that was about the beat, or an setup thing. It was based off of a device that would snap to another thing and added a feature.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nISTG my brain works on a whole new different wavelength. It's fine if you understand nothing about what I said."
nz561r,The Harlequin: A clown superhero game where you’re the opposite of the Joker,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nIn this game, you play the role of the harlequin, which is similar to a clown.  You fight crime, help people in need, and carry out covert international missions in service to the free world.  Your skill set is similar to that of the harlequin in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin\_(3.5e\_Class)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin_(3.5e_Class))\n\nStory: You grew up in a circus family.  Your dad was a lion tamer, and your mom was a trapeze artist. You and your siblings worked in the circus starting at a young age while being homeschooled (despite the fact that “home” was constantly changing from one location to another). Both of your parents were upset when you decided to be a clown, since they wanted you to have a managerial role in running the circus.  Your happy albeit hectic childhood was cut short when the FBI came in one day and started arresting the higher ups running the circus. Apparently, they were involved in organized crime, and were using the circus to launder money for criminal organizations.  The circus went out of business. Your dad ended up working as a dog walker, and your mom worked at a day care center handling games and activities.  Meanwhile, you continue to learn how to be a clown to help support your family, and when you’re 14, you meet a clown from Italy that teaches you the way of the harlequin. This is a form of combat that combines clowning with speed, martial arts, and combat tactics. Imagine James Bond, Jackie Chan and Jester the Clown fused into one. That’s you.  When you reach adulthood, you begin your life as a harlequin, committed to fighting crime, helping those in need, and protecting the free world from terrorists and tyrants.\n\nAt the start of the game, the intro and background story play. Next, you create your character, choose your gender and physical appearance.  You need to manage your career and your life as well. You can choose missions to earn money and gain experience.  Money is needed not only for better gear, but also for paying bills and other living expenses.\n\n* There are idle missions that involve actual clown jobs, such as birthday parties, where you dress up, leave your home to go do the job, and return home when the job is complete. These missions are a good way to earn money earlier in the game.\n* Crime fighting missions involve hunting down criminals and infiltrating criminal organizations, and you are paid by the police and the FBI to complete these jobs.\n* Treasure hunting missions involve more complex adventures, and the pay offs can be substantial.  You can earn valuable artifacts, better gear, and treasure to be sold.\n* International missions will take you all over the world. You’ll be fighting against terrorist organizations, mafias, drug cartels, dictators, human traffickers and warlords. Governments of different nations pay you for these missions.\n\nWith more money, you can buy nicer homes. You start in an apartment, but late in the game you might have an expansive lair.  The interior of all your homes will be carnival-themed.  You can even have romantic relationships with different people that you meet, get married, and have a family.  This is an action rpg.  As you defeat enemies, you gain experience, go up in levels, gain hit points, master new skills and launch deadlier attacks.  The Harlequin skills are more gear-based than magic-based, so in this regard the game differs from D&amp;D, although the skills should be similar.  Attacks include acrobatic martial-arts moves, as well as using light weight weapons and firearms."

Viking and Roman traders that will wander the island and fight each other if they see each other. Also animals\n\nServers?

nyzqkg,Trying to create a unique MOBA,"I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.\n\n**A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.\n\n**The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG."

I guess you could earn point to upgrade ur house or something and gain notoriety. maybe even a feud feature?

nytl3c,Crazy idea for a Nintendo fangame,"First, Make all the Nintendo characters REALLY transparent substitutes (example: ultra angelo the miner instead of super mario the plumber, the difference being angelo has a beard and wears a helmet), but have hints that they're actually the real, copyright infringing deals that got transformed by a curse by actual legal ninjas! \n\nThe second step is to make an arg depicting the affected heroes going on a quest though the multiverse (via the websites connected to the arg) to defeat the legal ninjas and restore themselves to normal! The final part would be an html5 game recreating a boss fight in the game, against the legal ninjas. Winning gets you a download link to mod files that restore the characters to normal, and the dialogue changing to reflect that."

Im thinking on a energy system where, you get a small amount of energy and use it to build your first panel, you would send this panel and receive energy from it, using this energy gives you the ability to build more panels etc... i also think there would be random text events which can be good or bad, such as a worker was crushed by machinery and would halt production for a day.

o306sx,Main character has a curse of immortality and has to get rid of it,"You are a seemingly regular human functioning in regular society. Although no one knows it, you are immortal due to a curse hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe only way to win the game is to replay it at enough *different points in time* where there are different people in your life, and you must get to know them in order to figure out how to break the curse. There could be \~1000 years of playable time, each containing its own influenceable events,.\n\nAnother interesting part of this game is that time would be bi-directional. Things you do in your future runs would affect your past runs, and things in your past runs would affect your future runs.\n\nThere would also be a bunch of custom characters that can meet the character, fall in love, become best friends, (personality system / 1-on-1 relations) etc. You would have to witness all these people die since you are immortal. Additionally, history could be discovered about them later which was never known before. You could also do things in the past to affect the future, to say, make sure your friend survives, but this would only be possible before you knew your friend died. As you play through time, it solidifies in placee and is stuck like this forever; the time between these solidified events are malleable but also change in order to fit the current narrative on either sides of the story.\n\nThe game would be mostly interaction-based with you walking around a 2D scene and approaching people. There would be some depth to the 2D scene making it look paperlike."

o2w5fm,Hello Can You guys suggest some cool mechanics for my 2d platformer game,
o2vyig,Arbitrary Frenzy: A 5v5 FPS Multiplier Game,"A 5v5 FPS Multiplier game, however, your weapons, equipments, etc. are all random.   \n\n\n(Also, I'm not sure about the name so let me know if you have a better idea :/)  \n\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy the opponent's ""core"". Each team will have a base, the core being in the middle or something. Teams spawn in and prepare in the ""Ready-Up Phase"" (\~2 minutes). In the ""Ready-Up Phase"", players will select their **Primary Weapon**, **Secondary Weapon**, **Equipment**, **Transportation/Vehicle**, and **Ability**. During this phase, players will also start off with a few coins (\~1,000). (More on Coins later)  \n\n\n**Primary Weapons** are main weapons such as a rifle, sniper, laser, rocket launcher, etc.  \n**Secondary Weapons** are weapons like pistols, alien blasters, etc.  \n**Equipments** are items such as grenades, Molotov cocktails, freeze bomb, etc.  \n**Transportation/Vehicles** are things like cars, helicopters, jets, etc.  \n**Ability** is a special power that players can use to help them.  \n\n\nThe game will randomly choose 3 of each category and players can select 1 of the 3. Players will have a certain amount of time to select each category (\~20 seconds). If players do not choose, the game will randomly select one.  \n\n\n(I'm not sure if players should have to select new weapons, etc. when they die or when it's a new game though)  \n\n\nOnce this phase is over, the game will start. Players will then have to destroy the other's core. Each teams base will be protected with turrets, cannons, etc. As long as the core is not destroyed, players can respawn. I'm not sure about this, but maybe, once a teams' core is destroyed, players on that team will still be alive, but if they die, they die permanently (similar to Bedwars in Minecraft).   \n\n\nNow, how coins will work. Coins can be obtained by killing players and destroying the opponents' base (turrets, cannons, etc.). The main (and maybe only) purpose of coins is to upgrade your teams' base (turrets, cannons, etc.) and your passive ability/stats. They can also be used to rebuild your turrets, cannons, etc. (if they're destroyed by the opponents).   \n\n\n**Passive abilties/stats** are stuff like damage multiplier, coin multiplier, speed multiplier, etc.  \n\n\nAnd, I think that's about it (gameplay wise)."
o2vu7d,Anti-peta beat em up,"The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a ""shelter"", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog.

o2v7eb,Three way animosity system,"This is a mechanic for world building in a multi racial/faction environment. For explanation purposes I will use humans, elves, and orcs, but this mechanic could expand to any alien race or political factions making up a game world.\n\nThe mechanic is each race will love members of its own race, tolerate  one  other race, and despise the third race. For example humans tolerate elves and despise orcs, elves tolerate orcs and despise humans, and orcs tolerate humans and despise elves.\n\nThe player can build a crew that consists of one race and it will have high morale, but if they bring in members of another race to take advantages of the race specific game mechanics, one of the two groups of the crew will start loosing morale unless the player spends resources to bring the morale up. For example a mostly human crew brings on a few elves for their bow making skill. The humans are happy but the elves are miserable to be forced to live among so many humans. The player can buy an elfin meditation garden to keep his bow makers happy.\n\nThis expands to how your crew interacts with NPC groups. The mixed elf human crew get preferential treatment at Human settlements who don't see hated orcs. Elf settlements dislike the crew since it is majority human but are not as hostile due to the slight elf presence. Orc settlements are neutral to the player's crew since it is majority human but hey would be friendlier if there were not the slight elf presence."

o2odu6,A 1st person shooter where you try to kill as few aliens on the Moon as possible.,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nStory: On one of the Apollo missions, a tool left on the Lunar surface had Staph viruses from Earth on it. Not only did some viruses survive, but a few went into the Lunar surface and adapted to a waterless and airless environment.  This seeded life on the Moon, which underwent a very rapid evolution.  When NASA returned to the Moon in 2024, they found intelligent beings that greeted them. The Lunarians were civil with the astronauts, and the first mission went well. In 2030, you were chosen for the next mission. When you landed, there was a thrust malfunction that killed a few Lunarians waiting to greet you.  This tragic misunderstanding led them to believe that you were hostile and there to kill them. You must now repair your ship and leave, while killing as few Lunarians in self defense as possible.  The more you kill, the more damage it will do to interspecies relations.\n\nMission: To repair your ship, you need to retrieve 3 items on the Lunar surface. The first is a set of wires from a probe that landed years ago. The second is a battery in a supply crate. The third is a repair kit left over from the previous mission.  You begin the game with a detailed map.  The 3 items have a different placement on the map for each game, and will be spaced far apart.\n\nStats:  You have 6 hours of oxygen in your suit, and the game is designed to last about 2 hours playing at standard speed. Oxygen isn’t much of a problem unless you play very slowly and strategically. You also have a gun that fires high velocity particles (given to you by NASA as a precaution). The gun has 10,000 charges, so you have more than enough ammo unless you shoot recklessly.  Your suit can take 100 hits. After that, it ruptures and you decompress and die.\n\nObjective and scoring:  Your score is determined by how many Lunarians you **don’t** kill.  You must retrieve the 3 pieces needed to repair your ship, do the repairs, and then come home. The game world is a large piece of the Lunar surface, and there are 500 Lunarians in total. A perfect score would be 500, and that’s if you beat the game without killing a single one (which would be practically impossible).  A score of 0 is if you kill them all (or if you die from decompression or suffocation).\n\nGraphics and audio:  The graphics should look as close to the real Moon’s surface as possible, and should have hills, valleys, craters, cliffs, etc. The sky should have stars, the Sun, and the Earth. Your view is 1st person from inside of your environment suit.  There is no music in the game, and the only sounds that you hear are your own breathing, your footsteps, the click of your gun when you fire, the impact of being hit, the occasional radio transmission, and your own scream if you die.  Space is a vacuum, so you hear nothing outside of your suit.  All movement should reflect Lunar gravity.\n\nLunarians: They are short and stocky, with thick carapaces. Lunarians have 10 legs, and stand partially upright on their bottom 4 legs. They have 3 eyes, 2 antennas on top of their heads, and protruding circular mouths with teeth all around. Their color is light grey, like the Lunar surface. Their technology is primitive, and they attack by throwing rocks, throwing spears, or with their claws. In some parts of the game, you see odd-looking structures made of stones, which are their above-ground buildings.  It takes 1 to 4 shots to kill a Lunarian.\n\nOther:  You can save your game and come back to it later,  The view is 1st person, and movement is 3-D. You can select your gender, but the only difference is the sound of the scream if you die (which would be either a masculine or feminine scream).  You should be able to log on to the server to upload your score, and view the top scores. There should also be deathmatch tournaments where two players battle it out with each other.\n\nFun fact: If this game is made, then it will be the very first 1st person shooter where the objective is to kill as few opponents as possible!"
o2cva2,A sci-fi game theme that can allow permanent and permadeath characters to compete against each other in PvP.,"Hi, just posting a game idea :) The idea is for a storyline that meshes with a type of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay part is a way to have procedural level generation, permanent characters on one side and permadeath/hardcore characters on another side.\n\nThe storyline is a sci-fi thing, there is an entity called the ""Locust Fleet"" which goes from system to system, or maybe star cluster to star cluster, consuming the resources of that cluster.  These represent the permanent characters, who are the villains.\n\nThe heroes are the permadeath/hardcore characters.  They represent the system defenders.  If they die, they are typically permanently dead, depending on some other possible stuff such as wounding systems.\n\nThe terrain of key areas on each planet in each system is procedurally generated.  The heroes (system defenders) win if they can cause enough damage to the attacking Locust Fleet, or delay them for long enough.  The Locust Fleet has to move on after suffering enough damage/delay because there is an even more dangerous entity that is hunting them, so they can't stay in one place for too long.  There are also plenty of systems/clusters that have little to no defense, so if a system is defended too well, it's simply not worth it to them to stay in that system.  They also typically never return to a system that they have previously attacked because it is either stripped of most/all useful resources already, or if it wasn't, they can assume that attacking without the element of surprise is not a good idea since they already failed when they attacked with it.\n\nThe Locust Fleet wins if they can take enough of the system/cluster resources, which typically involves killing most/all of the system defenders.\n\nIn rare cases, a successful system defender might follow the Locust Fleet and help defend a new system, which means both role-play opportunities and a chance to increase the ""high score"" of a specific hero character.  But having a hero character die reduces the points value, which discourages having every single defender follow to a new zone every time.\n\nSo, the game idea is basically a sci-fi themed battle game with procedural stages but the interesting part is a way to combine permadeath with permanent characters in a PvP setting."

Kinda lke goat simulator but crime themed or medieval themed like the many generic mobile game copy pastes.\n\nI know i'd buy something like this, just to get a kick out of it."

o21jcj,Beach Life remake/remaster!!!,"Hi Guys,\n\nI am not the biggest fan of management games (although I have 1160 hours on Surviving Mars) but IMHO Beach Life is a very good and rare management game from 2002. It's a beach resort game and this is why I dare to call it rare. I've played a ton of different games but no other game made me install Windows XP (or some emulation of it) so many times on my newer PCs over the years just to be able to play it since it's 19 years old game after all.\n\nIt seems very simple on prima vista but actually there are a lot of unique gameplay mechanics involved.\n\nIt has some nice randomizations as every single tourist has his own preferences and opinions about stuff. Every scenario seems to have some hidden modifications i.e. sometimes tourists will demand (more than usual) more bars, or water attractions, or places to party or cleanness etc.\n\nIt's fun to intentionally sell a strong beer in order to cause more crime and then have the security guard apprehend the drunk and violent person and get you some nice cashback.\n\nOr let sharks solve any potential overcrowding issues :) )).\n\nAnd this game still almost two decades later doesn't have a COMPETITOR!!! Literally I cannot find a single similar game allowing you to manage a beach resort. There might be some hybrid games where you manage a lot of stuff including beach related attractions but I've never seen a game just like Beach Life focusing entirely on one topic. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is because I am sure that there is a reasonable amount of money to be made by creating a remake/remaster of Beach Life as the market simply lacks such product.  And I would also enjoy playing such a game."

o1w6j9,A game where you get to make your own ability," This game idea is inspired by hunterxhunter, I created a post on this subreddit about this idea 10 months ago and I am reposting the idea because I have fleshed out the idea more now. I have used the flair dream but I think it could be made in smaller versions, the reason I took the dream flair is because my vision of it is really big and the version, I want to see be created is really large. The idea is a game where you get to create your own ability and I will post different version of this idea in this post because I couldn’t decide on one. In the paragraph after this one I'll talk about how Nen works and then after that I’ll talk about how the game would work.  \n\nYou can skip to the next paragraph if you want to just hear about the game idea itself. First, I need to explain a little about how hunterxhunters (hxh) magic/power system works, it's called Nen and you can use Nen to make your own ability. Nen has 6 different classes they are transmuter, enhancer, specialist, conjurer, manipulator and emission. The enhancer class lets you increase the strength of objects or yourself for example, you can strengthen your fist to make it do more damage when you punch and transmuter lets you use Nen to mimic the properties of something, for example you can mimic the properties of rubber and gum to make something that has the properties of both rubber and gum. I won't go into what all the classes do just google hxh Nen if you want to know more. The class you are assigned makes it so that you can use the classes full potential for example if two Nen users of equal skill were to enhance their fist to punch something and if one was a transmuter and the other one an enhancer the enhancer would do more damage than the transmuter. However, there is a class called the specialist class that the other classes can't use the potential of, a specialist has a unique ability only they can use like steal other abilities or predict the future etc. but a specialist can still do what the other classes can do. You can also put restrictions/conditions on an ability to make it stronger so, maybe, certain conditions need to be met before you can use an ability or you have restrictions on an ability for example you can only use an ability for a short period of time before the ability runs out and you have to wait to use it again. That’s all I'm going to explain about the Nen system I will say I did cut a lot out for simplicity's sake. \n\nSo, the idea I have for a game is where you can create your own ability. There are games that let you create other games and worlds like dreams on the PS4 and lots of games with customizable characters, but I have yet to see anything for abilities. So, the way it would maybe work is you have an in-game editor that is specifically designed to make abilities, I don’t have the technical skills to even make a prototype for this yet so I'm just going to put forward theories. Basically, you would choose a power like fire, ice or wind and then you get to choose how to manipulate that power for example you can choose projectile or sword etc. So, you are probably wondering how would you balance out the abilities and I'll go more in depth about that later but the more things you put on the ability the higher the cooldown. \n\nNow I'll start presenting the different version of the game \n\n3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version – For this version you would be in a colosseum where you fight other players or A.I. the arenas would have different themes maybe one is covered in ice/water and another arena is covered in fire/magma. The reason why I'm bringing up the themes of the arenas is because I would like for the environments the players are in to be useful so you can manipulate it and do very creative things with the players ability. Now I’ll go in depth with how the ability customization would work (this is just an example there a many different ways to make the ability system). First, you’d have a power like lightning, fire, ice, smoke, wind etc. You can then pick how you want the power to be manipulated and for the different powers there would be different ways to manipulate the power, they would be sorted into the different states of matter, the reason for having the abilities be sorted into different states of matter is because I wanted It to be somewhat realistic for example in real life you can't make a damage dealing sword out of smoke, another reason is the powers will have pre-determined attributes implemented so lightning travels really quickly by default and does a lot of damage, while smoke only makes it harder to see if the smoke is there, so if you were to make a sword out of smoke it wouldn’t do any damage by default. For this versions purposes it will be stamina, health, mana, cooldown seconds, that will be used to put limitations on the ability. So, you select the power wind which by default costs 1sec to use, you could instead make it cost 50 mana out of a mana pool of 1000 mana or make the wind power costs 50 health points out of a health pool of 1000. and then you select how you want the wind power to be manipulated, you get the options push the wind, pull the wind, tornado (basically any form that wind can take on Irl). So, you select tornado, a tornados attributes are that if it hits an enemy, the enemy will get stuck at the top of the tornado for as long as the tornado lasts, the tornado will last 1 sec by default and the tornado costs 3 seconds by default. Now you may have noticed we have only made a tornado but it wouldn’t move or has anything else on it, so, you can then pick if you want to shoot the tornado in the way you are aiming which would costs 1 sec more on the cooldown. You can pick if you want a new power to mix with the tornado let's say lighting, so now you have a lightning tornado that will move forward for 1 sec when you use it. So, you’d also be able to adjust the size of the tornado, it would have a default size which I think would be around the size of the character you are playing the bigger you make the higher the cool down. I would like to add that for simplicity's sake the bigger the ability becomes, the stronger it is, what I mean by the bigger it is the stronger it is, is, if you make the tornado bigger it will have a bigger radius for pulling things into the tornado itself. You could also adjust the time that the ability is out, for example each second you add to the length of the time that the ability is out the cooldown increases by 0.5 sec. Maybe you’d want the tornado to stay in place after the tornado has moved forward for a certain amount of time so you would also be able to edit that. I think I have made my point clear in terms of how the ability menu would work (in theory at least). So, what about a progression system, I have thought of two ways for a progression system, one is the higher level you get, the more mana, stamina and health you get, the cool downs would still be the same. The other option is the higher you level up, the lower the cool downs default cost is. I am also considering being able to use the environment to your advantage, but I can't think of a fun way gameplay wise where that would work, for example maybe you can pick golem in the ability menu editor and the only way to spawn a golem is if you have enough let’s say magma around you to create a golem, so, now you have a golem made out of magma, so the environment around could be used to create things but the restriction is that it would need a certain quantity of for example magma in the area to create the golem. Every time you enter a battle you wouldn’t be able to change the ability so, if you go up against a boss, you can't change the ability while on that boss, so even If you die you have to have the same ability until you beat the boss. So, I think that’s going to be it for this version on to the next one. \n\nPuzzel game version \- Basically for this version you would have to make abilities to beat the levels in the game. I’ll be honest I haven't given a lot of thought about how a game like this would work, but you would start with a power and then as you progress through the levels you get new powers after beating the previous level. The higher the level the more combinations and the more advanced the puzzle becomes. I put in this version of the game just to show how diverse this idea can be.    \n\n3d OpenWorld rpg version \- So, this version does take a lot of inspiration from Minecraft. You would start with nothing only a health, mana, and stamina bar. But the world itself would have a bit of a twist as the starting area would not be randomly generated so you would start on a huge island with a few kingdoms constantly at war which you can ally with, there is a lot more to this idea that I have thought out but I won't be mentioning it here because it would be too long of a post, but I'd be willing to explain this idea out in more detail if asked, I also, want to focus more on the game idea itself which is making your own ability. So, you start off with nothing and I'm not sure if I want the player to start of knowing how to use the mana system (I don’t think I have mentioned it but the mana system is what I have named the create your own ability system) or if the player does know the mana system but you don’t have access to a wide variety of powers or no power at all just only the mana system. For this version I need to explain some of the story I have written for the mana system, in short mana is life force, which means that mana can only be wielded by living beings, mana itself looks like some type of invisible energy, mana can only be used to mimic other forms of matter/energy in the universe, so you could copy fire, light etc. So, each kingdom would have powers that they specialize in, maybe there is a kingdom that specializes in lightning or another kingdom that specialize in wind etc. I know this is just straight up taken for avatar the last airbender but I'm not very original 😛. So, you as the player would gain different powers from each kingdom once you travel to them and learn from the people how to utilize each power. I was thinking about doing multiple endings for the 3d OpenWorld for example maybe you could restore peace to the kingdoms or make everyone your slave etc. But I won’t go into it more than what I already have done. Everything expect for the kingdoms would be fully destructible. Like I said in the beginning of the post I could go into it more but it would be too long of a post.  \n\n2d Platformer\- So, this is another idea I haven't given a lot of thought into, but I'm going to mention it because this is the easiest version to make, because you don’t have to think in 3 dimensions. The animations would be in pixel art so they would be easier to make then a 3d version. That is all I have to say about this version, but basically take the 3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version I wrote and just make that idea into 2d.  \n\nHunterxHunter version \- So, I think I have always wanted a hxh game ever since I first watched it in 2015 but I just didn’t have an interest in gamedev at the time. I haven't given this idea much thought because it would be really difficult to make unless you want to take some artistic liberties, so, for example the gameplay needs to feel good and I’m not sure how that would happen when abilities like Hisoka's bungee gum exist. I'm not going to go into it too much but I’m just not sure how to make a fun game using Nen unless you cut out a lot from the Nen system. I had a few ideas like maybe for the specialist class if you were to pick it then you would get a random unique ability that you couldn’t choose, which is why it would be a high risk selecting that class, I have more ideas I think but that’s all I feel like sharing.      \n\nFinal words \- personally I feel like the multiplayer game industry has gotten very stale, not sure if it always has been this way. To me games have started to feel very similar especially multiplayer games, or it's just the same problems I have with other games that reoccur in others. Personally, I want a game where creativity in combat is the larger focus and not a game where just being good at one thing like aiming makes it so you win and I hope that a game like this would be refreshing for the game industry. Finally, I have basically realized that my real-life problems make it so that I won’t really ever be able to make this game in the vision I want, I keep watching tutorials, then I stop and forget everything in an endless cycle so I don’t think I’ll ever be able to make this game sadly, but I keep dreaming about it. "
o1vg3e,Speed Racer,"Ok here me out, I just rewatched the movie Speed Racer after a very long time and I think it's an amazing movie, now I know it received a lot of bad rep and is considered a failure to some but even the idea is incredible.\n\nI had the idea of turning it into a game. Now I know there have been games but those a really old and honestly not what I'm aiming for. I'm looking at most of the movie elements, there's colossal tracks, secret(illegal too)weapons to modify vehicles and so much can go into customization of an iconic race car. I want to add these ALL OF IT. I imagine it could be a multiplayer and a really large game in terms of storage because of all the things I want incorporated. I thought it could have a tutorial on how to maneuver the car because I do want to see the exact thing we see in the movie or something close enough even just the feel.\n\nI could honestly ramble about this all day so for now I'll leave it hear. And I realized that most of this is all about the movie so it may not gain much popularity. It's just a thought anyway."
o1p0tf,Trapped in a game so glitchy the npcs become sentient,"The story would involve the hero being trapped inside a shitty game, like in avgn adventures, but the game was progra.med SO badly, that the game characters become sentient, and so some of them, like the friendly npcs, ask to join your party so they can escape the game with you, while the villians want to invade the real world, which they do in the final level. The gameplay itself involves abusing the glitches to your advantage, such as a noclip teleport, or messing up the graphics as a distraction. The ending will have the heroes realize they're still stuck in a game (the one being played), and then they bust out of the game window (or into the console menu), complete with a cartoony hole where they lept out of, and run off into the internet (or the digital store), and then if you have that save data, they show up in other games, living new lives travelling the multiverse."
o1m7oo,Lawyer from space,"You are a successful attorney at law, until one day you get abducted by aliens.\n\nTurns out their alien society has a legal system with their own prosecutors and lawyers, but all their lawyers are terrible, and form a society to try and find their way. That is when they find Earth, another planet with intelligent life and its own legal system, and quickly find you (yes, the lawyer from space is YOU!). They decide to abduct you to spearhead a new age of lawyers.\n\nAt first glance, it may sound like a space-themed Ace Attorney, but as a visitor to a whole different planet, you have to unravel a completely different society, with different cultures, customs, and of course, law. Inbetween your lawyering, you must understand how the wheels of their civilization works in order to reach that not guilty veredict. Can you get used to what is now considered legal or crime? Can you win in a battle of wits where common sense is thrown out of the window? How will you act when you have to choose between your dearly held morals and their law?\n\nIDK, sounds like a fun game to me."

o1gwza,A co-op platformer but with a unique POV,"Basically your POV is of the character your partner controls and vice versa. except you control the camera. So you would need to describe how far to move and which ways and where jumps need to be done.\n\nThe game could start with your partner visible, so you are able to see what you are doing from a perspective (like a fixed camera-ish) and then slowly block vision of your partner/ character you control to solely rely on your partner to describe what to do."
o1ffff,"Game that's all Controls Tutorials, but it gets Weird","My game idea is one where the entire thing is a controls tutorial puzzle game.\n\nSo, the game will start by starting with WASD and Space Bar to complete a certain task.\n\nThen then it becomes DSAW and Space for the same task, or a different one it doesn't really matter. \n\nEventually, after some escalation, the tutorials become more like riddles or visual puzzles to figure out the controls.\n\nI'm also picturing a level where the mechanism that tells you the controls breaks for a level, so it's a matter of randomly clicking keyboard buttons till you find the keys. Or another level where the player actions change the controls mid level. Or maybe a level that's red light green light, but the player has to adapt to changing controls.\n\nNot sure how to end it, maybe a typing of the dead style boss fight using weird controls, I don't know. That's my idea, thank you!"
o1f80j,Multiplayer hitman,"I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants. \nIt only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target. \nVisuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP.\nAesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.   \nGameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky.\nIf topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept.\nEnd-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received.\nGame balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it.\nThanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it."

o1bi1q,A mertroidvania puzzle platformer on ice,"**Story:** you play as a character named swift, and swift's family all got sick with a rare and deadly disease. Swift was told by the town's priest that a cure can be made from a magical flower, this flower can only be found deep in a dungeon built into a large cave. The priest tried to warn swift of the dangers the dungeon held, but swift was determined and began gathering a few supplies. Before leaving, the priest gave swift a pair of enchanted boots that turned the ground he stepped on to ice. So with nothing but a few weapons and the ice boots, swift set out to claim this magical flower, but things aren't as they seem.\n\n**Gameplay:** a 2d pixel platformer with very little friction. You slide around a massive dungeon, discovering secrets, and defeating enemies. you can choose to wield 4 different weapons, and each have their own skill trees and attack patterns. The weapons are a sword, a battle axe, a bow, and a magic wand. Each weapon has a heavy attack and a light attack that will activate different moves depending on where and how your moving, similar to combat from brawlhala. There will be 4 main areas/levels to explore and find secrets in, these areas are the barracks, the dark dungeons, the enchanted tower, and the frozen garden. \n\nEach area has its own boss, and once you kill them you get their weapon which gives you a new ability. There will also be secret mini bosses that will upgrade your ice boots in different ways. You can slide, double jump, dash, and leap off walls. I also plan to add a PvP arena where you can battle other players.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to see in the game, or anything you would like to change?"
o19s51,Choice based game,"Its a 1v1 competitive game where both side choose between soldiers and then the fight happens automatically.\n\n\nEach player start with 100$ and secretly choose 1  soldier between 25 different soldier all displayed on screen. If both players choose the same soldier, that soldier is removed and another round of picking starts. If both players choose a different soldier, they both buy their choices, and a new round of picking happens. This goes on until both players can't buy a soldier anymore. There is no soldier limit per team.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers have 4 different attributes:\n\n\n* Price (5-30)\n\n\n* Speed (1-25) (each soldier has a different speed)\n\n\n* Hit Points (1-25)\n\n\n* Damage (1-10)\n\n\n\nThe game auto generate these soldiers, but obviously the AI tries to have a minimum of balance so players don't always make the same choices. For example, a slow cheap soldier with a lot of hit points would be too strong.\n\n\nOnce the picking is over, the battle starts. The first soldier to shoot is always the fastest one, and he always shoots the slowest enemy. Then the next fastest soldier shoots, and this goes on until the slowest alive soldier has shot. Then the process repeats until one side is decimated.\n\n\n\nThe winner wins elo points, and there would be match making to ensure fairness."

o15ksv,A puzzle game with a unique feature.,"""A puzzle game with a unique feature.""  \n\n\nThe main goal of the game is to escape an unknown dimension/world using combat and strategy. The setting would take place in a world similar to Monument Valley and gameplay-wise, it would be pretty basic. However, there would be the feature of shapeshifting/transformation.   \n\n\nBasically, players will have the ability to transform into a different creature/entity to assist you throughout the game, and ultimately, you **will** need them to overcome certain obstacles and complete the game. For example, you might need to jump over something that the main character can't. To resolve this, you could transform into the character that is capable of jumping over it. Each character would have a specific ability/task that it'd be used for (jumping, shrinking, pushing, etc.).   \n\n\nTo make this game more of a challenge, I was thinking maybe each level would be timed and there could also be a limit to how long you can stay transformed for every character. This would maximize players' ability to problem-solve and be quick at the same time.  \n\n\nAs for how you would get each character, I'm not too sure. I was maybe thinking there would be a combat system and to get a characters' soul, you'd have to kill them, but I don't know lol."
o13knq,A crypto currency game that can actually work.,"There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.\n\nThe core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.\n\nThen to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.\n\nYes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**\n\nBy using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.\n\nNow players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do the developers make money from this:\n\nBy selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.\n\nIn short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.\n\nThe developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash."

o10ec4,A Heist game about a small group of European criminals getting together to steal things,"There aren’t many heist games out their tbh and the heist games that are out their are kinda meh. Also i dont think there is a heist game with a story or at least i dont think so.\n\n\nFor the game I would imagine it to be a open world third person shooter with some fighting mechanics. I was thinking for the criminal group each would have a sort of role or specialty, Like one would be the brute who specializes in hand to hand combat and can take alot of hits, The Gadget guy who has the equipment needed to disable traps/ alarms and take out guards, and the leader who specializes with guns. \n\nFor the heist before you start them you would need to get the equipment or people needed for the heist which would be its own mission. Before the Heist starts you can select which plan you would want to.For the heist itself i would imagine your actions can effect the outcome of the heist alot. For example using guns or being loud will bring the police to your location alot earlier which would make the getaway driver unavailable which would force you to take a different escape route. There would also be a variety of heists like having to protect a safecracker so they can open the vault, having people held hostage to get what you need etc. As the game goes on each heist will get bigger and more difficult. I would also imagine there to be side missions like maybe stealing things at a much smaller scale,being blackmailed by corrupt government members to do some jobs for them etc\n\n\nFeel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments below"

o0sog5,Need some feedback on the game concept,"Hello everybody!\n\nMy name is Alexey. I am a beginner game designer (currently just taking courses). I am from Russia, specifically from Siberia. I would like to present you with a concept description of my game and get feedback. I apologize in advance for any possible incorrect translation. My English is not very good ... (all complaints to google translate J)\n\n**Game description:** The action takes place in the future. The scene is a town littered with trash up to the rooftops. The main character is a small robot that can perform only the simplest actions. A great feature of this robot is that it can think. The robot develops, recycles garbage into resources, discovers new technologies for garbage recycling, improves them ... The main goal of the game is to return the town to its original form.\n\n**Genre:** Life simulator with elements of crafting, construction, RPG.\n\n**Technical implementation:** 2D graphics like in Stardew Valley and Graveyard Keeper\n\n**Topic:** Confronting chaos. Transforming the game world from disgusting to beautiful.\n\n**Setting problem:** The world is a dump. To transform this world requires resources and technologies that are not available at the start of the game.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n* Garbage|resource - The main element of the game. What is garbage can now be converted into a resource using technology.\n* Technology - needed to build new installations and more efficiently converting waste into resources.\n* Space - At the start of the game, there is not enough space to build basic installations. To start efficiently recycling waste, you first need to build which of the basic installations is better to build (a crusher or a warehouse of that type of waste or a press installation ...)\n* NPC Community - There are still residents (NPCs) in the city who have already forgotten that their city was once a beautiful and comfortable place to live. The robot's job is to bring them back to normal.\n\n**Possibilities of the main character:**\n\n* Perform the simplest work of collecting and sorting garbage;\n* The ability to improve;\n* Ability to build facilities for sorting and recycling waste;\n* Ability to develop technologies\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThe player will control a small robot to transform the game world. In order to do this, it is necessary to find the appropriate technologies that are scattered throughout all locations. Accordingly, it will be necessary to penetrate into abandoned and littered buildings, investigate them, find samples of equipment.\n\nThe development of technologies will increase the depth of processing waste into resources:\n\n* Level 1: Scrap Metal - Pressed Scrap\n* Level 2: Scrap Metal - Iron Ingot\n* Level 3: Iron Ingot - Steel Ingot\n* Level 4: Steel Ingot - Steel Beam\n* ...\n\nInteraction with NPCs is also an important aspect of the game. First, NPCs give simple tasks to the hero, for example, bring 10 iron ingots. As the character and technologies develop, NPCs begin to give more difficult tasks, for example, free this building from garbage and bring resources, then this NPC will take this building and open a shop for something there.\n\nThe game ends when the last NPC finds a home and acquires a profession.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Stardew Valley - character management, crafting and inventory system, building system, principles of building the game world\n* Graveyard Keeper - Character Control, Graphic Style\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment I can not provide screenshots or a video, because the idea is still in its infancy and my skills are still not enough to create a prototype of the game.

o0r3cq,Necrology: Necromancy meets Archeology,"You play as an archeologist who's also a necromancer. Your job? Find and catalogue rare artefacts found within Dungeon-like catacombs.\n\nUnlike normal archeologists, you can actually find bones/corpses of the dead and bring them back to life. \nWant knowledge about a specific artefact? Locate the body parts of the buried and revive them to interview them. Some are easier/harder to find, based on the amount of information they hold. \nYou'd also need to study inscriptions to learn the language.\n\nThe dead can also be brought back as minions, and can also be used to solve puzzles or avoid traps."
o0qagv,Space game idea,"Idea is an open world game in space based on real life planets and etc.Earth is in after war state,after world war 3 and youre the only survivor.The space would be scaled of course but still feel big enough.For traveling in space rockets could be reusable.You would need to build a shelter and look for resources even tho aspect would be on exploration and because of that there would be automated ""farms"".There wouldnt be an story nor end of it and that is because it would be better if player made story no? There would be upto 4 players co-op multiplayer."
o0ltb0,"Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android","Hi guys, \n\nI would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing. \n\nIt is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it. \n\nGameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.\n\nThere are certain requirements to build units. \n\n1.	Mine – free\n\n2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal\n\n3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal\n\n4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood\n\n5.	Air units – 3x food + metal"

o0km2m,Headmaster: You run a school for a country's nobility. You don't control the country itself but you steer it's course by what you teach your students.,"[](/cheerteach)You run a school where the ruling class of a generic European-like country send their kids - everybody from the crown prince down to the children of barons.\n\nYou customize the curriculum for each child based on their aptitudes, the needs of their (potential) future jurisdiction, and how you want to steer the country.\n\nOnce they graduate you have no control over how they act or how the country shapes up, you can only point them in the right direction and keep tabs on the current events.\n\nThis is going to border on a Grand Strategy game like Crusader Kings as you're going to have to know an ever moving selection of pupils, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they fit into the bigger picture. You can only teach each student so much so you'll have to pick what to focus on and what to omit.\n\n---\n\nScenario ideas:\n\nHistory Classes give kids better overall decision making. Math and Science allow them to improve their province's infrastructure.\n\nGiving the kids military training may help them with conquest - both of other nations and over each other. You could forgo military training to hopefully build a more peaceful state but that might backfire if you get invaded by neighbors.\n\nMaybe give the kids a few semesters of swordsmanship so that they don't get killed in a duel. Or omit that from somebody you don't like so that a more promising younger sibling can usurp them.\n\nTeach them statecraft so they can better manage political matters.\n\nHave somebody that's a bit of a punk? Put them in Chivalry classes so they don't become a problem later."
o0k91y,An evolution game based on skillpoints,"Sort of like irl millions of years ago where different abilities/skills got you somewhere different. Every 10-50 skill points used, your ""build"" could become available for others to start as. for example, a dude has put all his points to defence and his/her ""build"" has gained either hard skin or a shell, after reaching the 10-50 points used, people could have the option to choose the ""build"" and sort of become that species. and either continue the same strategy or deviate from the strategy and swap or put some points to the offense for example. skills could be for example: intelligence, eyesight, offense, defence, mobility and stealth.\n\nI don't know if this is in any way possible because I'm no game dev and don't know how ridiculously hard this would be or if even possible, but I got this idea in my head from TierZoo (a content creator on YouTube) and the ""Ancestors:humankind odyssey"" game (I don't think this would be a copy since that game focuses on only human evolution)"

o0euij,What game would you like to see in the Bone Wars time period?,"So I'm thinking about developing my next game and I thought that a game set in the Bone Wars period could be very interesting. Basically, during this time people found out that you can find dinosaur fossils and two scientists got into an extreme competition to beat each other in discovering as many dinosaur species as possible. It got pretty crazy, as they would bribe, hire armed men, blow up dig sites etc. If you haven't heard about this I recommend watching this 10 minute video (it's really fun):  [The Petty Feud That Almost Destroyed Paleontology - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP_3PF-FOV0). I would love to hear your ideas of games set in this time period!"

o09no1,Question about world building,I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
o06uga,life/zombie/disaster game,"The idea is a multiplayer sandbox game where you start off as a civilian working a job whatever you decide you can choose when creating character and doing day to day things. hang out with mates etc. pretty much a life simulator game but eventually after some time a zombie apocalypse outbreak would happen where everyone's characters would need to run etc to escape the apocalypse. the players characters will turn into the zombies you are fighting creating more zombies to fight and the zombies you are killing are real player models. each server should be at different stages so players wanting to start fresh can and those who want the zombie aspect can run that.  \n\n\n**Life:** during the life sim part you can respawn and do what most life sims do. buy a house, car food and water. build a bunker in your back yard if you like. do whatever you feel you want to do. if you want to get ready for the apocalypse why not but the limiting factor should be funds. stockpiling guns and ammunition why not but people need to keep working to earn money and should be punished by not working. if someone wants go full bush and and live in a little wooden house let them but unless they steal they shouldn't be able to get mid to top end weapons.  \n\n\nIn the life stage of the game people should be allowed to respawn as much as they would like. when i say respawn though i mean end up in hospital regardless of the sort of injury to allow people to keep moving forward but it will cost them $x to be treated. if they cant afford to pay for the medical attention they have to respawn as a new character. maybe as a relative who inherits their stuff but new stats etc.  \n\n\n**Jobs:** most real life jobs should be in the game to some extent from manufacturing which give better crafting stats, paramedic which gives better healing stats all the way through to hobo. each job being worked will give stats towards the accompanying occupation. there should be benefits towards every occupation including hobo that will help during the outbreak. people should also be able to attend classes to level up certain stats as well but of course that costs money but could also lead them into making more money such as a manufacturer can create better items causing more income etc.  \n\n\ndepending on player numbers there should also be npc's that act as bosses or key characters in the game. medics should have to go out to where things have gone wrong such as car accident or robbery gone wrong. if someone commits a crime they will be reported but there needs to be some sort of system in place that can help the criminal get away with the crime if they do it well. if they manage to rob a bank and not reveal their identity they should be allowed to get away with it. when they are reported either by a player or spotted through cameras etc they should be sent through to the police who will be notified of the persons name and added to an most wanted list and essentially have bounties on them. the bigger the price of the bounty the more people can join in.  \n**Outbreak:** The zombies should be rather menacing when the outbreak starts. think war z when they're in New York in rush hour traffic. it could hit at any time and the players shouldn't really have an idea of when unless they work in certain divisions of military. at most they should have 10 minutes in the cities as the outbreak occurs which can be heard through normal means like radio tv etc. at this point people should be allowed to raid shops without joining a bounty list and money doesn't become a necessity at all. people can raid and loot whatever they want but the hordes of people should be pushing from inside the cities forcing people to run or bunker down wherever they are.  \n\n\nonce the outbreak starts people can no longer respawn into the current game. if they die to anything other than a zombie a medic with a high enough stat can bring them back within a short period of time but headshots are instant death with no respawn. a spectator mode should be allowed but players should be allowed to turn spectating on them off so that would prevent ghosting. to spectate a player you need to type their name in so as to prevent ghosting.  \n\n\nIf this gets too much backlash a party system with so many extra lives could be given to simulate people coming together as a group and play as a npc such as a family member etc who escaped with them. these extra lives could be given to people as they rescue npc's from situations but of course they would have all new stats and attributes.  \n\n\n**Post outbreak:** at this stage people should be dying off but i would love to see what people do at this stage. with the ability to fortify and build a compound to defend using vehicles etc and try recreate some sort of society or turn into nomads running from place to place. really this point is about thinning out the last of survivors to start the cycle over again. im eager to hear peoples suggestions on this as to how this should end. i feel like a forced ending like nuclear explosion would ruin this part but holding off until the last person is dead also feels like a bit of a buzzkill too. i feel like once the last group has had its last member die after no more respawns available should be the end of the game.   \n\n\n**World:** the world should be relatively large. I'm picturing semi instanced regions where there is a city in one or 2 regions that leads into towns and forests. as a regions zombie % goes up it starts to trickle into the other regions. as the world goes on wandering zombie hordes should start to travel around. these hordes should be able to be messed with by flares and explosions or loud noises in general. if a horde is wandering nearby a place players should be able to set off fireworks to redirect the movement of the horde towards the noise. church bells cars anything major like that should allow players to plan some sort of defence or offense using the zombies as tools.  \n\n\n**Other disasters:** As the game is updated later on other disasters could happen such as military takeover or natural disaster and the server rolls a dice to see which disaster it gets. this would keep players on their toes and tuned into the radio in game or watching the news for the latest happenings.\n\nsorry for the long post. I've really been wanting to see a zombie sandbox where players are in the thick of the initial outbreak. In a story driven game its always planned out and I've never really been able to enjoy the escape that much. although I did love how the last of us did their escape sequence but after the first couple of times you know what's going to happen when and it loses that something special. Please leave any other ideas or suggestions in the comments and I really hope an amazing dev picks it up.   \n\n\nIf you do make the game from my idea **please shoot me some credit** through some fun way in game e.g. browsing reddit in game on a laptop or on a billboard. some fun little easter egg. also feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like more ideas i've got more to this idea but the post is already long enough."
o04niv,A sports series that gives you compete control,Im thinking about making a sports game that gives you compete control of your everyday life from buying cars and houses to getting to your event on time but the game will have players starting off in high school and depending on what version you pick up would determine what sports that would be open for you but you would be able to associate with all players through out the game
o032mc,"Trying to create a unique MOBA, Part 2","Thanks to the few people who replied to my first post, here are some changes I think would make it better. \n\n First, I think we could have both of the old ideas in the game, and just make them separate modes . For changes to the first idea we simply move it away from being a team deathmatch and back to more of a MOBA, as I originally intended. We do this by making the goal of the game anything else besides killing enemy players; although it could work as a team deathmatch its just that I dont want to copy battlerite. I want to still make the goal something more unique than just destroying the enemies base, but I feel like a fast paced 4v4 two lane MOBA where you make your own custom hero is unique enough. Generally, I want this mode to still be mainly PvP focused.\n\n For the second idea I came up with a two ways to change it. Firstly it could entirely be a co-op PvE mode where you and your team of 4 get a certain amount of time to farm before a giant boss shows up that you have to kill. Second we could make it a PvEPvP, you on a team of 4 against another team of 4, both teams have to compete over minions and jungle camps. After a certain amount of time a boss shows up, Instead of killing the boss the team that deals the most damage to the boss by the end wins the game."
o02alz,Here is my idea of a dungeon crawler type game that I am most likely gonna make,"My ideas I have come up with so far are:\n\n* Enter dungeon, possibly fight monsters or be stealthy, loot, leave\n* Sell loot for gold coins which then you can use to buy upgrades and equipment\n* Obviously different loot items would be worth different amounts but item could also be worth more or less based off its condition, like damaged or pristine\n* Some upgrades could be Strength, Stealth, speed, HP, and luck\n* And finally it would probably be top down 2D\n\nPlease comment any other ideas you might have."
nzyivn,Tree simulator,"Control the growth of a tree from seedling to mighty oak (or other kind of tree). Decide where to grow branches, roots, leaves and fruits/seeds/flowers. The game has an above ground and below ground view. The gameplay is very chill/relaxing. Each season takes about 2 minutes. Challenges include expanding the root system to find new nutrients, competition from other plants, infestation with bugs or disease, etc. You can deal with some problems by killing off a bit of the trunk or branches and cauterizing with bark. Players could sort of prune or grow their tree strategically for artistic purposes (like a bonsai tree).\n\nCould be 2d or 3d."
nzwku4,"Silent Hill 1/ResiEvil 3 controls, Dark fantasy rpg elements (like Dark Souls) and a ""stance"" system like Bushido Blade type game","Title sounds convoluted but lemme explain.\n\nIn this game you would have the tank controls like Silent Hill 1, with a 3rd pov camera (exception being areas where a fixed camera would work). You utilize a stamina bar for every time you run, attack, dodge, and block you do.\n \n\n- You have 3 stats you level up throughout the game: Endurance (health) Attack Power (how strong your attacks are) and Agility (how much stamina you have). Theres 4 starter classes each with different amount of points put into all 3 (all starting at lvl 15). \n\n\n - Combat in this game is like Resident Evil 3/Silent Hill 1 melee attacking (however when you are in you attack mode you can still walk backwards slowly, so you arent stuck in place. Your attacks stagger more often and are quickerm to make up for the tank controls.)\n\n\n- Doing a jumping back dodge is an option too, which makes you invincible during the entire animation, but takes all your stamina, meaning you cant immediately attack. Guarding attacks is done automatically when you have the ""attack stance"" button held down (by attack stance I mean like in ResEvil you stand in place pointing your weapon). Guarding an attack will only take part of your stamina but will do less damage to you, making it so you can attack afterwards.\n\n\n - You have 2 stances for each weapon, a medium and a high (kinda like in Bushido Blade). Some enemies will also utilize stances and guarding. These enemies require that you guard whichever area attack they use on you, and attack the area they arent guarding. (Example: you see a bloodied knight raise his sword in the air signaling a high attack, so you switch to the high guard. It successfully blocks, taking stamina and a little health. He then goes into high guard, so you change back to medium and successfully hit him)\n\n\n - A few enemies will be crawling on the floor or ceiling, which means you must face upwards/downward to attack them. The up and down stance are their own stance, and doesnt hit a normal ""in front of you"" enemy. Some enemies, while not utlizing stance themselves, will have areas of their body defended permanently so you can only use one stance attack against them (for example, some kinda of demon whose legs and torso are stone, so only high attacks damage them.)\n \n\n- Multiple weapons can be found throughout the world (axes swords, bladed batons, daggers, halberds, spears, even ranged weapons like bows and thrown items) along with armor sets. Each starter class has a unique set of armor they start with that only they can use, but these armors all have the same stats. Armor is mostly cosmetic but each have some kind of upgrade, usually a +(#) boost to health or endurance.\n \n\nI have a whole lot of other things written down but I dont wanna over do it more than I already have in this post. Id love to see this game made someday. If anyone has criticism, questions, or wants to hear any more ideas for this (concepts, enemy/level designs, boss designs, lore things) id love to hear it. Thanks for reading."

nzmwfx,Second person storytelling," I need your feedback with our game project. Me and my team are building this adventure-roleplaying game in a dieselpunk world mixed with art deco aesthetics.  It’s still in the early stages of development.   \n \n\nOur main gameplay twist is that the game is second person storytelling ™. For us second person storytelling ™ can be described that you are playing as Watson in Scherlock Holmes stories, or Alfred in Batman story. This means that you play as support type side character, in a story revolving a hero that is larger than life. Translated in to gameplay this means that most of the decisions are made by the hero, and you cannot directly harm enemies, you just have to make hero survive by e.g. using smoke grenades or gadgets that fit the dieselpunk theme.\n\nThoughts?"
nzkb6s,a new thief game,"This is 3rd person rpg game . A reboot to the old thief series\n\nThe game takes place in medieval times and like the old thief games it has a little magic but its not full blown fantasy game\n\nstory\n\nThe game starts with a cutscene where you are a kid thats helping ur parents working in the garden feeding animals and stuff and a group of soldiers come to collect taxes from the kingdom . You parents dont have enough so they want to have sex with your sister and they wont take everything you have . The father says no and they try to take her by force , your father tries to fight them but he gets killed , your mother tells you to start running in the forest she gets killed aswell and your sister was caught raped and killed too \n\nyou return to the house when the night comes only to find you family's heads on spikes and house burned down . You go to the city and start begging for food when someone from the Thiefs guild finds you and recruits you . You play 1 or 2 missions as a child then you grow up . In one of ur mission as a adult you go to rob a house of one of the king's guard and as he sleeps you recognize him as the one that came for the taxes and killed your family . Here you have a choice  (1) either do your job and get out or (2) brake the rules and kill him\n\nIf you chose number 1. you kill continue to do missions for the thiefs guild , and eventualy become the guild leader, you will be able to decide what kind of jobs you can give to other and the main story will revolve around the war between the thiefs guild and the kingdom trying to save the poor and eventualy bring down the king \n\nif you chose number 2. the thiefs guild will abandon you for breaking one of the most important rules ( never kill your target ) and you will do missions that you can find around the city from tavern or just hearing people talk , the main story will revolve around a conspiracy that a group of necromancers will try to bring down the kingdom from within and make everyone slaves of the ancient evil religion\n\nThere will be other important decisions to be made and you can choose a side and be good or evil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\nMost important is that you can enter every building , every window every door can be broken or lockpicked as long as your skill will be high enough\n\nalot of parkour , climbing will be very important \n\nthe classic rope arrow , water arrow \n\njust like in the previouse game you can choose to fight with a sword but you wont be very good because of your skinny constitution , if you try to fight 2 people at once ur dead 100%\n\nchoice will have a great impact , everything will change around you as you make the decissions for example house from rich people can become empy if you rob all their money and you can see them on the streets poor \n\nYou walk around the town without a mask in places like taverns and look for missions , normal mission that will help you improve your skills will be in normal places like taverns and brothels and main story missions you will either get them by raven at ur house or by npcs in a underground world in the sewers"
nzk4nt,"Drag to Hell, a zombie survival shooter with Drag Queens.","Picture it, horrifying zombie outbreak. People dismembered and devoured only to rise up and join the undead crowd. Fires and explosions everywhere, but there’s only one thing standing against the hordes of undead tonight. Four fabulously dressed divas with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGuns, glamour and guts galore. Want to take it close range with the deadites with a manniquin leg, wig head or a brick filled purse? Go right at it! Prefer a glue gun turned pistol or a confetti cannon full of shrapnel and glitter? Show these corpses how it’s done.\n\nDrag to Hell? Drag fights back.\n\nMy idea is a campy version of Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood with the comedy of Lollipop Chainsaw and a million and one gay podcasts, youtube channels and drag shows combined. You could pick from different classes of queens from snarky hard hitting queens with melee weapons, to sweet healers or even someone throwing shade from a distance with a rifle. Light that fire with a mech queen using a flamethrower to melt face off all these ugly undead.\n\nWhile i know it’s probably somewhat offensive, after watching shows like Unhhhh and Dragula, i’d kill for just some kind of a funny, gorey, glamorous zombie game thats all shades of colors and comedy.

nzis2a,// [PvP] Gameplay Concept - Keep moving to stay alive,"The idea is pretty straight forward as the title suggests: In order **to stay alive**, the player needs to be **constantly moving**. Staying still drains health.\n\nI've found one party game that utilizes this gameplay, called [Move or Die](http://www.moveordiegame.com/) *(who would've guessed)*\n\nBut I haven't come across any other games yet, having this as a primary feature, especially in higher productions. More specifically I'd like to see this implemented in a competitive PvP environment, like First-/Third-Person Shooters.\n\n**My Game Idea:**  \n\[Intermediate-AAA\]  \nCompetitive PvP FPS (2v2, 5v5 etc.)  \nPlayers control humanoid robots running on batteries.  \nThese batteries recharge (or stay charged) as long as the Player moves (walking, running).  \n**Edit:** Movement counting towards recharging must be significant (travel distance), not AD strafe spamming. (u/Paradox\_Synergy thx for heads up)  \nAs soon as the Player stands still (or moves on spot), the battery starts depleting (fast).  \nMaybe even emitts a distinctive beeping sound for others to hear.\n\nThis should prevent exploitations/annoyances like camping or AFK and encourage a fast-paced playstyle. It would also mean, that there's no *typical Sniper class*, since it wouldn't make much sense.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be interested in such a game?\n\nAny ideas or recommendations for improvement, expansion, similar games or else highly welcome!\n\nAlso, if you do decide to utilize this feature in your own games, please be sure to reach out to me.

nzczp6,An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines.,"Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.\n\nThe life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.\n\nThen you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.\n\nSo for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features. \n\nAnd with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.\n\nAnd you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.\n\nI've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!"
nzcma7,Asynchronous single-player campaign missions played within large multiplayer matches. We can make it work.,"When I learned *Battlefield 2042* will not have a single-player campaign, I wondered if one could be added later-on by letting one person play a scripted single-player mission within the active battlefield of a live match. You know how some FPS single-player missions take place within a chaotic, active war? What if we do that, but the war is other actual players having a large-scale match.\n\nWith some tweaks, I think it can work. This is how:\n\n1. **The multiplayer mode is free-to-play while the single-player campaign is not (like Halo Infinite will be).** Even though the number of players in multiplayer usually far outnumber those playing single-player, this model will ensure there are more multiplayer users than single-player users.\n\n2. **The story involves a country using the war as cover for some secret plan.** In other words, your teammates aren't helping you with your mission because they don't even know about it. It's just you.\n\n3. **The missions are short enough that they can be completed within the length of a single ground war multiplayer match.** For reasons I'll get into later, the locations of your objectives are different every match. You'll have to get from point A to point B without dying, which can be difficult in the middle of a ""real war"" so it's important the missions are short enough to retry in a new lobby.\n\n4. **The large multiplayer maps have several doors and buildings that players regularly can't enter, except for the one person playing the campaign mode.** Any scripted cutscenes or events that should not be interrupted would happen there. You might enter one buildings, move through some vague underground system, and emerge from another player-only building for your next objective.\n\n5. **Dynamic story events would happen outside in the chaotic battlefield.** Sometimes the next objective isn't to get to another secure building. Sometimes the objective is outside ""in the shit"" so to speak, such as having to kill a villain that's escaping in a vehicle. Or you might have to trigger a dynamic map event like collapsing a building or destroying a dam. In situations like this, your teammates might make things easier or the enemy team might make it harder. But that's war. Someone on your team might unknowingly kill your target for you to complete your objective.\n\n6. **Missions are dynamic using some smart system to keep it as fair as possible.** If players guess who is the campaign player, some of them might troll the player. So the locations of story events, as well as the paths that NPC targets might take outside, are dynamically scripted to avoid (or sometimes approach) where the action is heaviest. Moreover, when the objective is to trigger a dynamic map event (collapse building, destroy dam, etc.) the smart system would have to pick one that hasn't been done on the map yet.\n\nLastly, the whole thing can be asynchronous as it needs to be. If the game needs to make you invisible to players and them invisible to you, while spawning AI enemies only for you, it can.\n\n****\nIt could be fun. It'll make replaying missions new experiences every time. It could lead to some crazy, by-the-skin-of-your-teeth missions for people to share replays of. And most importantly, as the developer you get to repurpose all the maps and assets that already exist for multiplayer instead of making those expensive single-player campaigns. Even AAA budgets can't keep up with those costs."
nzbwnw,Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights),"First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.""\n\nThe game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.\n\nI am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game."

nz7jlh,"In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first","Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this. \n\nI had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.\n\nI can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.\n\nSo the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters\n\nOr I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.\n\nWhich seems like a better option?"
nz704x,Missed a major core aspect of my rhythm game idea for some reason. Gameplay.. hElp,"I was gonna make a pretty big post here, but I realised that the gameplay makes very little to no sense.\n\nIn the most basic of basics layman's term, you create a beat (made out of meters). Then the opponent would play it and they would give their own afterwards, but then I thought ""How the hell is that even gonna work?"". I originally thought you could just make it before joining a round, but that would end up making it sound terrible. \n\nMaybe you could make the beat during the game, but I don't know how you would make the ""beat"" in the first place. I also don't think that wouldn't sound very good.\n\nThere's one feature I wrote of which I have no idea what it means. But it has something to do with ""snappers"" which are rectangles that connect from right to left. I'm not sure if that was about the beat, or an setup thing. It was based off of a device that would snap to another thing and added a feature.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nISTG my brain works on a whole new different wavelength. It's fine if you understand nothing about what I said."
nz561r,The Harlequin: A clown superhero game where you’re the opposite of the Joker,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nIn this game, you play the role of the harlequin, which is similar to a clown.  You fight crime, help people in need, and carry out covert international missions in service to the free world.  Your skill set is similar to that of the harlequin in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin\_(3.5e\_Class)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin_(3.5e_Class))\n\nStory: You grew up in a circus family.  Your dad was a lion tamer, and your mom was a trapeze artist. You and your siblings worked in the circus starting at a young age while being homeschooled (despite the fact that “home” was constantly changing from one location to another). Both of your parents were upset when you decided to be a clown, since they wanted you to have a managerial role in running the circus.  Your happy albeit hectic childhood was cut short when the FBI came in one day and started arresting the higher ups running the circus. Apparently, they were involved in organized crime, and were using the circus to launder money for criminal organizations.  The circus went out of business. Your dad ended up working as a dog walker, and your mom worked at a day care center handling games and activities.  Meanwhile, you continue to learn how to be a clown to help support your family, and when you’re 14, you meet a clown from Italy that teaches you the way of the harlequin. This is a form of combat that combines clowning with speed, martial arts, and combat tactics. Imagine James Bond, Jackie Chan and Jester the Clown fused into one. That’s you.  When you reach adulthood, you begin your life as a harlequin, committed to fighting crime, helping those in need, and protecting the free world from terrorists and tyrants.\n\nAt the start of the game, the intro and background story play. Next, you create your character, choose your gender and physical appearance.  You need to manage your career and your life as well. You can choose missions to earn money and gain experience.  Money is needed not only for better gear, but also for paying bills and other living expenses.\n\n* There are idle missions that involve actual clown jobs, such as birthday parties, where you dress up, leave your home to go do the job, and return home when the job is complete. These missions are a good way to earn money earlier in the game.\n* Crime fighting missions involve hunting down criminals and infiltrating criminal organizations, and you are paid by the police and the FBI to complete these jobs.\n* Treasure hunting missions involve more complex adventures, and the pay offs can be substantial.  You can earn valuable artifacts, better gear, and treasure to be sold.\n* International missions will take you all over the world. You’ll be fighting against terrorist organizations, mafias, drug cartels, dictators, human traffickers and warlords. Governments of different nations pay you for these missions.\n\nWith more money, you can buy nicer homes. You start in an apartment, but late in the game you might have an expansive lair.  The interior of all your homes will be carnival-themed.  You can even have romantic relationships with different people that you meet, get married, and have a family.  This is an action rpg.  As you defeat enemies, you gain experience, go up in levels, gain hit points, master new skills and launch deadlier attacks.  The Harlequin skills are more gear-based than magic-based, so in this regard the game differs from D&amp;D, although the skills should be similar.  Attacks include acrobatic martial-arts moves, as well as using light weight weapons and firearms."

nz3p9w,An MMORPG set in a 1-1 scale of Ireland,"Why Ireland? Its not as big as Great Britain, so much more feasible. Madagascar, Taiwan, and Hokkaido are good candidates, too. \n\nStructures? Literally everything should be player made. Very few to no pre-built or procedurly generated structures. \n\nNPCs? Viking and Roman traders that will wander the island and fight each other if they see each other. Also animals\n\nServers? Preferably one huge server, but it would likely need loads of servers if the playerbase gets huge. \n\nQuests/missions? Just a tutorial and starting missions. \n\nWhy this? I'd be one of the most ambitious games ever made, why not this?"

nyzqkg,Trying to create a unique MOBA,"I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.\n\n**A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.\n\n**The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG."

lu30ge,GDDs and Game Ideas,
lu2n4c,What a tool,"You play as A.K.M an Awesome Killing Machine. Your master is in some serious debt, don't fail him or you will be disposed of.\n\nAt first you don't control your camera or your movements but you have to help your master kill his targets. At first you are a ""simple"" silenced pistol, but over time you can upgrade yourself and become many tools to help kill people. You can become a drone, grapple hook, sniper, or a shield. Using your different forms you will go through increasingly difficult places to eliminate the target.\n\nTo choose what tool you become you use a wheel of options to switch which form you become\n\nYou interact with stuff you use a crosshair. For example, you use it to aim and shoot. Kinda like going through a whole bunch of ""quick time events"". When you use the shield the cross hair becomes a shield, if you hide someone with the shield they can't shoot you\n\nWhen you get turned into the drone the game becomes a point and click stealth game. You gain as much info as you can about the place, in a set time period. If you are seen by a guard you will be destroyed\n\nYou interact with your master with a visual novel kinda system, if you don't gain enough info about certain things you won't be able to talk to him about it. For example if you don't learn about the guard in the hall you won't be able to warn him about the guard, leaving him in a bad situation.\n\nAt the end, you try to kill the mob boss so you can be free of your debt. No matter what you do you will be overwhelmed by the amount of people attacking you. From there, there are two endings. The bad ending has your master getting killed by the mob boss, while you are taken and used to cause mass massacres around the city.\n\nTo get the ""good ending"" you have to have a close relationship to your master so you can unlock the choice to, ""Defend at all cost"". You turn into a drone and create a mini gun to shoot everyone around your master. All the stress causes you to explode into shards of scrap metal. Your master is able to get away with only a shot to the arm and leg.\n\nDepending on the ending you got, your master or the\n mob boss will end the game saying ""What a tool""\n\nI got this from a dream so ehhhhh. Yet another game idea that is probably impossible but whatever."
lu0si6,Acting career simulation,"You're an actor or actress and you will be able to play in movies, ads and theatre plays.\nThe game world procedurally generate fellow actors of all ages that will act in those and you could act together with some of them.\nBasic plots, scenes and characteristics of movies are also procedurally generated. The industry must feel alive and producing stuff regardless of your indivial success.\n\nAt the beginning You will have to pick careful what audition to attend, have an alternative job to pay rent and bills ( but if you are busy working at a certain time you won't be able to make it for an audition).\n\nEach gig you can get has a set of requirements, fame, genre skills, phisical appearance, so it's not easy to pick the right ones and it's not easy to be picked for one.\nBut once things start to go well you can afford to hire an agent to deal with finding more suitable jobs or other issues you might have.(addictions, scandals etc)\n\nInvesting time into socials, events, fan base and gossip is required later on to increase your fame and have access to high budget movies.\n\n""Acting cards""\nYour performance will be impacted by how well you match your available acting cards with the one required in the specific scene. A brilliant performance requires more acting cards. Acting cards are available, to be found and collected when buying items, studying, meeting and acting with other actors etc."

ltrz1x,VR Superhero Alchemy,"\nIn this VR game you combine and level up superpowers as you face other players or waves of robots, aliens, zombies, etc.\n\n\nImagine you choose a base power like fire that starts at level 1. \nLevel 1 would give you a limited fire based skill set that would get stronger as you fight waves to advance to level 2. \nAt the advance of level 2 you unlock another base power like water.\nNow you have the option of fighting the waves at either level 1 water or level 2 fire.\n\n\nAlso included in the game would be a lab where you can combine powers to unlock a new one.\nIn the lab you could combine the fire power with the water one and make a smoke type power for you to level up. (Example)\n\n\nIf you’ve played any alchemy game than you know that it can get really deep and fleshed out as you combine elements to make new ones. In virtual reality i think it would be really cool to see the powers in action. Multiplayer would be fun as you fight other players with powers that you’ve never seen before and come up with strategies to win.\n\n\nI also would include some type of random way for you to unlock other powers that you couldn’t combine to get. (Like speed or flight)\n\n\nIdk I kind of just thought of this on the spot so there may be another game like this. Either way let me know what you think or anything you would add or change."
ltpzld,Surfacers,"This game is made in a universe where all other game universes exists, like a multiverse.\nMain character: Mack Sharky (not kidding)\nThe story unfolds according to my gaming career. A lonely Summit Striker (Fortnite) who has no other weapons than a Prismarine Trident (Minecraft) and a sheild made of a sea turtle shell (OC). Guided by the Shark God (still thinking of the appearance), Mack acquires npc teammates through the game, like a gunslinger raptor-person Koatl, a Hamster in a small robotic suit (idk the name), and Clever, who is basically a Fortnite Headhunter skin with (insert melee ability) and much more others. The characters are all real life teammates I fought with in game. While the game is goofy, the storyline is colder than the entire Souls franchise, ending with the protagonist waking up on a restraining bed in a run-down lab, realizing that it was nothing but a simulation at the end of the world, putting all humans in hibernation in a virtual reality. He explores the chambers, finding his friends not yet awake in the same type of bed, Clever remains a human as she was already one, but other animalish characters are indeed human. The ending was either to leave the VR and wake up, or stay in it, to bask in the beautiful, whimsical lie, or embrace the brutal, thorn-filled truth. Isekai game to be honest. Pretty depressing."
ltpo23,Suggestion: Path of Titans Panjura Battlegrounds (Battle Royale),"Game consists of humanoid dinos (basically humans with dino heads, feet and tails) competing for dominance in a vicious Battle Royale. This League style game has a complex lore and playstyle, with different characters wielding different kits. Set in a semi-futuristic world with a Valorant-ish art style, with modes such as:\nTeam Deathmatch, 7 vs 7, infinite respawns, kills cap at 70\nHostage rescue, 10 players to rescue and secure the hostage from the 8 captors, infinite respawns\nFree for All, self explanatory, 10 players, infinite respawns, kills cap at 30, top five players ""win""\nThis game requires significant funding, will be nice to see Riot Games collab with Alderon Games."

ltiauw,Texas Hold'em Rogue-like,"A game where you're dealt a pocket hand and enemies can have a number of cards based on how strong they are and the player can have a range of cards off level-ups (think cheating in red dead redemption where you can swap out your cards). Power ups can include seeing what cards an enemy has, reshuffling your hand, auto changing your hand to a winning hand say an enemy draws a three of a kind reshuffle your hand to a fullhouse. (one-hit KO for an enemy). High level bosses could ""Run it twice"" for the second phase. But you choose to stack powerups onto your hand to take on stronger enemies.. that way when you have to fight 3-4 hands back to back you can use your 4x4 powerup forcing you to have quads.. or you got the mythic rare item that hits a royal flush for a free boss hand."
lth83b,Horror Game,So this can be a single horror game or multiple depending how it is done. The settings would be the most haunted places around the world.

I need some ideas of gameplay elements and mechanics that can be brought into this, maybe even story/lore wise. \n\n     I was also thinking that base building could be a big part of this game. Think of a game like Subnautic. \n\nAny ideas are welcome :)"
ltfvb5,A inverted galaxy exploration game,"So while recently watching a video on r/oddlysatisfying a post by u/tilltheend0ftime came up about an opal. The commentator remarked on how it was inverted with ground on the outside and sky in the inside. My brain immediately started thinking of how a solar system would work if roles switched. So let’s get into the main parts.\n\nYou start off with one Orb, I don’t know what to call it, where life has evolved into consciousness. Life is like earth but you know, there’s no sun. Don’t ask about breathing because I haven’t fully thought about it but I’m thinking the large oceans have something that solve that. Anyway the reason why the whole place doesn’t freeze is because orbs are usually surrounded by a material that acts as insulation. This is a substitute for an atmosphere and digging into it is like creating a hole in the ozone layer. Luckily this protection goes very deep so you can still dig up resources in the ground without causing mass extinction.\n\nPlants and animals glow, not to the point of mimicking a sun but to a point of being able to see. The premise of the game is to build up and to expand until you can’t fit in your Orb and have to dig to a new one. You can’t just dig Willy nilly thought, remember the insulation. You will have to build a sonar type Device to find out where to dig and how far then dig up your insulation to create a insulated tunnel all the way to it. You have to hope that that Orb has insulation because if it doesn’t well it’s basically a lost cause. Of course you could create your own orbs but you need a good supply of insulation to make it.\n\nMoons are replaced by small orbs but are already connected to the main orb. So if a Orb like Jupiter exists it would have a lot of small orbs connected back to the main one, course that’s just an example an would not happen. Stars are now replaced by big magma pockets that generate heat instead of loosing it.\n\nThis is just a small daydream I had and thought it was good enough to share, thanks for reading."
ltfd7x,Spirit Bowman,"A lone Bowman seeks a forest spirit (shaped like a deer) to revive his dead wife. Survive in a procedurally generated world, hunting and foraging to eat as you track the forest spirit down. Craft arrows and new bows as you explore, eventually collecting special items from each biome to craft a mystic arrow. With this you have a chance to catch the spirit and grant your wish. I am imagining controlling the character from above, and really zooming out so you can see animals from far away, hide in grass, and use cover while you are hunting. But I guess the concept would work from first person perspective as well"
ltey6v,Things you dislike from game genres you like,"The point of this thread it's to get an idea of what other players dislike about their favorite game genre and take those ideas to create a concept either to make it better or rework that very thing.\n\ni'm posting mine as example:\n\nFPS\n\n* *Guns that feel &amp; look like a toy:* unless it about toys gunfighting then it doesn't apply, since the first doom, i think it's outdated the idea of small guns doing little damage, the pistol becomes useless the moment you get another weapon. In Return to Wolfenstein Castle, and Wolfenstein: New Order, did an amazing job for giving an use for the 'low' damage weapons."
ltesiy,Game Where I can Make in-game money doing real-life based things like gambling. (not real money),This one has legal pitfalls that need to be addressed but it's quite simple.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your game is about only that you need resources.\n\nLet me earn those resources by doing a bunch of different things. Gambling for one. (No real money!)  Let me bet on something.  Let me play the stock market.  Let me write a post on reddit and base the resources I receive on the upvotes I get.  Lock it into specific reddits so I can't just create my own sub and start adding  posts etc...\n\nThis has sort of been utilized in games where you make assets and sell them to other people (roblox comes to mind) but there should be many ways to do it.  Not reliant on the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me practice solving programming problems on hackerrank in order to gain resources in your game.  Let me do an udemy course for the same.

ltenz2,A Game Where You Play Other Games,"This is more a game about games.  \n\n\nI'd love to see a meta ladder.  \n\n\nMatchmake for me. Find someone near my level.  Then, through a series of choices of the type of game to play, we play one of the many, many games out there.  This game utilizes a library which allows the game to create a specific set of circumstances for the two players to play versus each other.  \n\n\nThe winner goes up in rank, like a typical mmr ladder.  \n\n\nThe biggest issues are getting the game makers to use your library and finding games both players own.  \n\n\nThe second issue is solved by the new game streaming services.  \n\n\nMitigation for the first issue is that you look for games that already allow you to call the game from the command line.  I'm positive there are some out there. I don't know which ones  \n\n\nFor single player games, you don't need a direct competition.  Use Super Mario Bros. for example.

lteiw3,"Utilizing Esports, Sports, Stocks etc... Statistics to Generate In-Game Content","What a terrible title, nobody will read this.  \n\n\nI have never played fantasy football but that's where the idea comes from.  \n\n\nMove away from real sports to Esports.  That's one possibility. So, create your esports team and it does well based on the real players.  \n\n\nOr, use the history of a stock as to seed data for a random world generator.  \n\n\nOr, use the current wins/losses of a specific esports player the player of your game has selected in order to determine whether the player receives a bonus or not each day.  \n\n\nIt doesn't have to be sports data, just real world available data."
ltcwuo,Anyone here using data to help coming up with ideas?,I’m working on a web-app called [Appsedia](https://appsedia.com/landing) that collects review and social media data from players and analyzes them for insights. I’m trying to figure out who else might be interested in using these data insights.\n\nI used to work in the game industry as well for 5 years and always played games to learn about new mechanics which helped me to work on mew ideas. Would other player’s online discussions about what they liked or not would help you on you ideas?
ltbibh,Hell 2 Pay,"Coop game 2 characters, character creation for both. Can still play a lot of it in single player and level up on your own, but main storyline is coop.\n\nBoth are souls/demons In hell. Special in that they both managed to keep a more humanoid form in hell, which is uncommon. They are brought together for whatever reason.\n\nBoth are new in hell and start out living on a home layer of hell, 1st layer, where if they are torn apart they are pieced back together at ""home.""\n\nThey can leave first layer of hell whenever they want (going downto lower levels, all the way to 9 and not necessarily Dante style hell), however highly recommended to wait until strong enough to survive.\n\nBoth make choices throughout story to decide individual stories. Can romance eachother or others. Can remain allies to the very end or become worst enemies. Redemption story or Conquerer of hell.\n\nPerk tree based on 7 deadly sins. Examples: \n\n	Wrath perks focus on more damage and destruction. \n\n	Sloth perks increase Luck, gaining more experience for less work. \n\n	Lust perks increase charisma and adds dialogue options.\n\nCertain Events will play out differently based on points in each Sin, based on Dice rolls mechanic. Depending on level cap, use a dice of that many sides. If you roll below your Sin score, character may make decision or instance happen automatically. A character with high wrath may jump into combat based off dialogue. A lucky sloth character may have an upward wind blow them back onto a ledge if they'd have otherwise fallen to their death. Not Always good, not always bad.\n\nFast paced action. Think Prototype but with Demons in Hell instead of Infected in New York. Free Roam for both characters, some quests can be done solo while others, all main story lines, require both characters to be together. \n\nCharacter customization continues throughout game with weapons, armor and even choosing appearance and style of Devil Transformation. Could be a Agile character in normal form that turns into a large slow brute in Devil Form, vice versa or whatever you want."

lt7cm3,Rocket Interceptor RTS,"The player will take the role of coordinating the air defenses of a nation under attack by strategic bombers using late 1940's technology. Specifically the player will be coordinating the launch, intercept and recovery of Vertical Launch Rocket Interceptors (VLRI's) like the Bachem Ba 349 Natter. In real life these were a late WW2 innovation that never went anywhere due to diminishing industrial capacity and lack of pilots. However this game will take place in a fictional setting so we can disregard those pesky historical limitations.\n\nThe VLRI have a very short powered flight time, but can climb stupid fast, and can outrun fighters. They don't need air bases since they can launch from a tower that can be towed behind a truck and land by deploying parachutes when they get relatively close to the ground. This leads to an interesting cat and mouse dynamic where the launch and recovery teams are vulnerable on the ground to fighter attack.\n\nThe player will have a night time deployment period where they will be given an expected target and allowed to place their launch and recovery teams. Once the day starts enemy fighters and bombers will take off from their bases in enemy territory and fly towards their objectives. The player will be able to track their progress and decide when/if to launch the interceptors they hid the night before. Once launched the player will have to vector the interceptors in on their targets to make their attack and plot their exit path to get them to their recovery teams.\n\nGroups of piston driven fighters will escort the bombers and fly Combat Air Patrol (CAP) routes over the player's territory. If a fighter gets close enough to an interceptor there will be a shoot down chance. Likewise CAP fighters and escort fighters that follow the interceptors down have a chance of discovering the Launch vehicles or the recovery teams before they can get back under camouflage. Ground teams exposed during launch/recovery and interceptors on their parachute decent will be easy kills to any fighters who are in the area. So it is important for the player to plan the launch and escape paths to ensure the survival of their resources.\n\nAt the end of each day a tally will be made of Destroyed Enemy Bombers, Infrastructure damage, losses of Interceptors, Launch platforms, Recovery crews, and Pilots. The Surviving launch platforms, interceptors, and recovery crews; as well as any new equipment/crews, will be available for the next day's night time deployment phase. The air campaign will go on until a peace treaty is signed. The terms of the treaty (good / bad ending) will be determined  by bomber losses and infrastructure destroyed."

When your ingredient reach certain level, you can evolve your ingredient into a selection higher tier ingredient, such as turning flour into noodles or pastries, each also with their own skill and passives.\n\nThose Ingredients can then be combined to make Foodie Hero. For example, combining noodles with Boiled Water will create Ramen Shogun. Combining it with other ingredients as Wagyu Beef (evolved from Beef) and Premium Seaweed (evolved from Seaweed) will enhance the power of the ramen even more (giving it more Star Power)\n\nBut that's just one Hero. Having certain Hero together will give them Synergy during battle. For example, Having Captain Burger, Sushi Monk, Ramen Shogun, Viva Pizza, and Looney Fruit Juice will not give your team a synergy, but when placing Captain Burger, Mighty French Fries, Super Cola, I-Scream, and Nuggy McNuggets will give them a special Fast Food Frenzy synergy that enhance their battle powress, such as giving assisting attacks, combo attack, and powering up teammates."

lspfwd,My Dream CRPG,"* The combat of Underrail\n* The story and writing of Disco Elysium\n* The emergent gameplay of Divinity: Original Sin 2\n\nI'd love to have a game that united all of the good qualities of these games, plus more.\n\nThe combat is the focus of the gameplay loop of Underrail, while dialogue is the focus for Disco Elysium. I want to make a game where failure is just as interesting as success, both in combat and dialogue.\n\nIn fact, I think it'd be pretty cool if failing is the only way to earn enough experience to advance. It'd be a tough balance to make sure that the player isn't tempted to fail on purpose just to earn XP, however.\n\nFor example, if you get a partial success on a dialogue check, instead of earning the reward that you demanded, you could earn a randomized equivalent reward, and if you failed outright, you'd earn lots of XP for the related skill and advance the story through different means.\n\nBeing locked out of content because your character wasn't skilled enough is always frustrating because the player never feels as if it was their own fault, so even if your character fails on a check, there should be a way to advance your goals in a way that solely depended on player skill, unlocked after failing the desired test.\n\nWhile I don't loathe metagaming, I'd want this game to encourage role-playing through its mechanics, so that the player would naturally end up acting naturally within the game world. That way even players who aren't usually given to role-play would end up being immersed just the same.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts about this idea! So, thank you for reading, and I wish you all a lovely day/evening!"
lslae4,"Good World (warning, very long paragraph)","Ive had this idea for years now but when I told it to my brother he said it was trash, I was sad so I never posted it but here I go. OK so, good world is a survival open world game. You can run around, dig, set up a home, and fight off animals, but the game focuses on mining. This may seem like Minecraft but as I go on further its far from it. First you wake up in a cave with no gear and a skeleton is beside you. Your meant to take the mining helmet and pickaxe from it. After that you are taught to mine and you have to mine out of the cave. Then you have to build a base. Then you have to go back in the mine, get some blue crystals, fight off ground worms, and craft a shaft (wood and stone pull elevator that requires blue crystals). After that you have completed the tutorial.\n\n Blue crystals are power sources in the game, they can also be used as a dim light while mining. Ground worms are a threat that are a little smaller than the player and have 10 HP (the starter pic does 2 HP). Now you will start your adventure. After you have mined a bit you will eventually get a ""skull of adventure"" that will be used later on to spawn in a boss. There is also an ocean to explore, mainly ocean caves.\n\n In ocean caves there is ""oceanic crystal"" that powers machines you make underwater. After about 2 hours of gameplay you should have found the ""underground boneyard"". There you place the skull you have on the place where it looks like it should fit and a message will pop up saying ""you have awoken the beast that many have feared upon, you are **foolish**"". After this your camera will start to shake and blurry teeth will shoot out of the ground. This is the boss who is called ""shhrn"" (in the in game language, not a real one). If it was translated to earth English it would be called ""being of the eerie teeth"". To defeat this beast you have to look it in the eye by mining to expose its body. Once you have defeated this boss you will get ""shhrn's treasure"", its just a all gold chest with moderate loot like a level gem, ingot of power, a couple of lost lore journals, a picture of a family, and a gold plated wearable skull.\n\n About 25 bosses later like, the kraken, massive worm, bull dog (not earth bull dog, totally different), mother of shhrn, the alpha, the beta, and a lot more, your off to beat the game. By this point you should have at least 3 automatic mining machines, a two story mining base, and a weapon. To beat the last boss you have to have 1000 power gems, shhrns chest, and a picture of the family. First you use all 1000 gems to even be able to enter ""thrnws layer"", then you insert shhrns chest in the slot, after that hold up the picture of the family. A message in all red will pop up on your screen saying ""the hate inside you, the beast sences. The love inside you, the beast is blinded. Nothing inside you is  visible to it. Everything inside you is blue or red to it. Cold or hot you will prepare for the time that is now."" Then an all black four legged monster in the shape of a dragon mixed with a horse will appear. A tear will drain down its eye and it will scream making you drop the picture. The boss has 10000 hp, the first one had 50. To kill it you have to continualy show it the picture, this will do 100 HP per hit. When you completed the fight, the black coat of the beast will melt off and it will reveal a man standing there holding the picture smiling while a tear drop falls.\n\n You walk over to the man revealing a mirror, the beast was you. You had been controling the beast while an AI controlled you. You will notice that you have a note in your inventory, it says ""hello,\nthis is you that is writing this letter. You will forget you did but I'll explain everything. You are being sent to an island to save hamanity by finding crystals to restore power. Our family died on this island and everybody left us behind. We were consumed by emotion and turned into a beast of hate. We defeated this creature and realised it was us. We return home. *you* are stuck in a loop an eventually you will write this note and have gotten out of this loop with a new family. We are evil"" I know nobody will read this long thing 😢😢😢😢 I just wrote it for fun."

Knights could team up or go it alone to enter the maps to fight AI creatures, to 6find loot and complete quests. Other teams of knights can also be on the map with their own objectives but can decide to attack if they wish. \n\nDying means losing everything on your character and having to go to the shops to get new gear."

Not exclusive to just these gameplay styles or being these styles either, but just an example. Completely different genre-based characters in one game.

However, along with managing the stores inventory and supplies you will have to deal with customers. Instead of (or maybe along side) AI customers they will be players playing a separate non-vr RPG on pc/consoles.  \n\nShops would be places like smithies, general stores, healers, and taverns. The type of shop and the shop keepers level will dictate what services are available as well as what tasks the shop keep will have to do. \n\nAs a shop keeper just starting out in a new shop you will start as an apprentice and go through a tutorial teaching you the basics while an AI deals with the public. Once you graduate to running your own shop you will need start crafting items to sell, preforming services for customers, and buying the materials needed to make more items to sell.\n\nSome shops will be more crafting based while others will be more customer based. Blacksmithing and potion creating will focus on mini games where you turn your resources into product. Managing the general store would be about haggling and managing your inventory to make the most money. The tavern would focus on time based mini games where food and drinks need to be prepared."

He has powerful magic and he is made to be a military’s special weapon. He has a hard time killing though. The merciful potion Dr. Sager accidentally dropped in the capsule made him give mercy to even terrible beings. Also, the Wolf’s name is X1, but I’ll think of a proper name later.

lrtkgp,My WHOLE STORY for trying to think of a game story,"So, there’s this game called Starlink: Battle for Atlas right? Well, all the gameplay and piloting stuff may be good, but I hate that game. Do you want to know the answer? It’s not the toys. There’s Star Fox exclusive stuff or whatever right? Fox looks fluffy and jacked, Falco looks even more cockier and cool, Peppy looks more like.... Peppy, Slipyy looks more like an aquatic animal, and WHY IN THE GOD IS WRONG WITH WOLF! That’s right guys. I mean, I think Wolf as an Anti-hero, but what is wrong with this! His voice is literally from Scar in Lion King, and I think it was a bad idea to make HIM the bad guy. He’s my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE character because it only started because he was a Wolf, but Assault made me like him even better. Seriously. Assault Wolf is the best. Anyways, suddenly seeing him trying to take over Corneria is...... he’s not Andross seriously. Then, the whole team arrives and causes more trouble but they all die in some sort of black hole. I MEAN WHAT IN THE HYLIA!?!?!? IS THAT HOW YOU END FOR MY ABSOLUTE FAVE CHARACTER!?!? Maybe I’m way too taking it far, but I hate it. I hate it. \*sighs\*. So that’s why I’m never ever seeing that custence again. Well, despite how I hate that story, but that’s how it made me inspired, but mostly to get revenge by creating my OWN game. Of course, I‘m gonna make the main character a wolf, possibly an anthropoid wolf. I didn’t want it too be too similar to Star Fox, so I started them as robots and the guardian of the Robot Utopia. Not so well on that. I soon made them actual anthropoid wolf with robot suits. Not so well on that too. I tried making the wolf and his..... team and out law, but that ain’t so good. I tried giving them unique abilities, and completely trashing out that robot suit, but that didn’t work either. Oh, and did you know that I gave him an betrayed team? Yeah! The animals who betrayed the other animals living with humans because it’s in the year 10,000! They are a Lion, Shark, Bat, and a well......Fox. The reason I picked them is because the strongest canine and feline are wolves and lions, strong water creatures are- The Wolf’s team is a Wolf, Croc, Racoon, and an Eagle. Anyway, sharks and crocs are strong water creatures, eagles and bats can fly, and raccoons and foxes are known to be sneaky and clever. Oh, and how many times has lions became a good guy. Give them a chance to be a little bad. The BAD TEAM IS AN ANTI-HERO OKAY. NO HARD FEELINGS NOW. Then, I trashed the whole evolved animals. I decided to make them TEST evolved animals. I won’t stop trashing ideas. I trashed the whole opposite team, and left only the Lion. Then I gave him like nearly invincible ability. That ain’t work out for me too. I started to trash living on earth and saving the planet and blah blah blah. I made the five animals evolve on the moon for safety, but the Lion roared and hypnotized to attack the staff. They all escaped on escape pods, and none chased the Lion and the human’s. Meanwhile everyone died except for the lion and the wolf. The wolf combined with his human and became anthropoid. I made them make teams with aliens but NO NO NO!"
lrs8j8,A proposal for a rule against controversial game ideas,[deleted]
lrrm6k,Break my game idea please,"So imagine a raffle game where every week is a drawing. Let's say you pay 1 dollar($) for a ticket, and you can buy as many as you like.\n\nWhen you buy the ticket, you ""donate"" your raffle ticket to a bucket.\n\nThen your tickets are added to the bucket, and the money you spent goes into a pot (containing all of the money made during the week).\n\nAt the end of every week, the game-master draws a ticket from a bucket containing a copy of every raffle ticket purchase. \n\nThen, the winning raffle ticket gets traced back to the bucket, and every raffle ticket holder wins a share of the pot!\n\nNow here's the kicker - 50% goes directly to the owner of the bucket (let's say each bucket represents a charity), 1% goes to the game-master for costs associated with running the game, and the remaining 49% gets evenly split between the buyers of the tickets that ended up in the winning bucket!\n\nHere's an example:\n\n&gt; Say in one week we generate a million tickets ($1million) and it gets split between 50+ buckets\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if one bucket only has one ticket ""donated"" to them they still have that one-in-a-million chance... And if theirs gets drawn they win the whole pot, with the single ticket owner getting 49% of the take ($490,000!).\n&gt; \n&gt; Two tickets = twice the odds, but technically more will go to the Charity per-dollar-spent since the user's reward was proportional to the number of shares (tickets) they bought. \n&gt; \n\nThe hope is that one person or (or bucket) can't just guarantee that they'll win money by buying a bunch of tickets, since even with 50% of the tickets (500,000 of the 1mil in the example) they will only get 50% of the winnings, with the rest going to the bucket and other ticket-holders\n\n\n\nMy question is - is this a good system with potential to help the buckets, despite the potential for bad agents (assuming cheating is impossible)? \n\nIf not, how could this be improved? Too many rules and nobody will care.\n\nBut without any other rules, how might this be exploited?\n\nPossible exploits that I'm considering:\n\n- One bucket owner buys a huge amount of tickets and places their tickets in their own bucket, ensuring their bucket has a very good chance to win (but never 100%, given other buckets have at least one ticket)\n\n- One user buys a ticket for each bucket, guaranteeing they will win a share of the pot regardless of the winning ticket (I'm actually okay with this since the buckets still win in the end, but it takes away some of the fun).\n\n\nThe point is that it should be *fun* and *feel* like winning a lottery for the buyers, but the buckets (charities and non-profits) will be the ones taking away most of the money. \n\nWhat do you think? Open to any discussion as well."

liczs3,The Corruption Chaos Rains," \n\nI know this would be impossible without an entire company working on it but I just think it would be a cool idea.\n\n**Third Person Arena Team-based Fighting Game**\n\n**This is an idea I thought would be cool as a game to go with a book series I'm writing.**\n\nYou can choose between 94 characters and they each have unique stats when it comes to armor, health, energy, and stamina. Each character also has 8 abilities, and they range from Healing, Melee, Ranged, and throwables. Each character is given a side or species ranging from **Demons, Angels, Hybrids, Rebels,** and **Corrupted.** Each class is more effective towards certain species. Armor is a part of your overall hit points and it can't be fixed. Health is the smaller part of your overall hit points but it can be regenerated over time. Energy is a bar that is taken away from when you use and ability but it regenerates over time. Stamina is used when you run at full speed and it regenerates over time( Each character has a different max speed ranging from 20-90mph depending on what the character's strengths are).\n\nThe different type of fights would either be objective based and just killing your opponents. You can have **1v1s** up to **10v10s**. Each location is huge and multiple routes, but most are very open. In each location has buildings and parts of the ground that can be destroyed and parts of the destroyed areas can be thrown as an opponent. You can grab an opponent and choose to try landing a few combos on them but once you go for a punch your opponent can press the same button and block the attack, if you grab someone and land a few hits you can used an enhanced ability and then throw your opponent into something.\n\nThere is also a **Boss fight mode** where you can pick certain characters that become more powerful in the story and depending on the character you choose as a boss will change the amount of people that will fight you. As a boss you can summon minions to assist you and your abilities are always enhanced but it takes more energy to use. The boss fights can go up to 1v18.\n\nThere would be a **Survival mode** where you and 3 other players can choose any character and face waves of zombies, demons, angels, corrupted, lost minds, gods, hybrids, cyborgs, and universe overlords. You would be stuck in a small arena with these enemies breaking through buildings to get to you. It starts to amp it up once you face a new enemy and the enemies would be smart where they would use their strengths to fill that gap for others that don't do good in certain actions.\n\nThere is also a **Story mode** where you can choose a character for each species. You can change the character's stats to make them fit your playstyle but they all have their own strengths that you can't change (So someone might do more damage the faster they go but if you increase their health and get rid of their speed it won't be as effective). There are **5 different difficulties** that go from trying to just have a fun time all the way to absolutely unfair. If you choose the **Corrupted Campaign** you start almost maxed out but you can still edit their stats but its only available in **Corrupted Difficulty** which is the hardest difficulty. **Corrupted Difficulty** is locked unless if you beat the Corrupted Campaign. In each campaign you get a chance to interact with all **94 characters** and you can **befriend** them or **kill** them. Depending what you do will change their opinion towards you which can make it easier to choose who they are towards you. If you befriend them they will assist you during levels, if you are just allies they will give you new perks and abilities, if you become enemies and you kill them you get their weapon that you can have as a part of your character. Each weapon has special traits and have their own special attacks that do massive damage. Each campaign has **4 different endings** **Good, Neutral, Evil, Unrivaled Genocide.**\n\n**Demonic Evasion**, you and three other people have to make it from one end of **Troven City** and make it to the other. There are demons and zombies roaming the streets and you get a mini-map to tell you where the zombies are but not the demons and to make things harder there is a bunch of orange smoke spread across the city to make it harder to traverse, you have a sound meter that goes up the more sound you make and if you make to much noise you alert all the enemies in the area and you can try to run into a building to hide but some of the buildings have spots that can be destroyed by your enemies if you are caught you die. You can try also fix up some cars by finding some parts in the area to escape easier but the vehicle makes you automaticly hunted by every enemy in the area and if you didn't find any armor in the area and you hit something you need to find a replacement part for the part you broke.\n\n**Demonic Pursuit**, one person is driving in a car with three people that are trying to kill them following the vehicle, the three people play as any demon character and they have to total the car the chased is using to escape. The three demons can use powers to do damage to the car but it takes quite a few hits to take it out, the person that is being chased needs to either make it to the finish or they can outrun their pursuers.\n\nEven if this would be the hardest thing to make I think it would be cool if you would be able to explore the main cities and points of interest from all 14 planets that the game and books take place. (Keep in mind this is supposed to be 19 books long).\n\nTo be fitting with the game the soundtrack would consist of metal-step, heavy metal, rap, rap-metal or also known as Nu Metal. The books that go along with this game idea I got the ideas from the musical artist The Enigma TNG so a good amount of music would be from them if possible."
libn9h,Time To Survive,"I love survival games, and I'm also painfully aware that the market is *flooded* with them right now, and it's difficult to find new twists on the genre. If someone has implemented this idea before, please point me in the right direction. And if you like it, and feel like putting in the effort to bring it to fruition, please feel free to steal it (or if you want to collab, DM me).\n\nI want to make a survival game that incorporates two time travel-related mechanics. Here's a copy-paste of the relevant parts of my GDD:\n\n**Working Title**\n\nTime To Survive\n\n**Story/Synopsis**\n\nYou have become stuck in a time loop. Worse still, you are stranded, doomed to die over and over again in an unforgiving place. With the most basic of survival gear, you must survive long enough to figure out what is causing the time loop and how to stop it. Along the way you discover the ability to travel backward in time as far back as the start of the loop. Perhaps this new ability will be the key to finally escaping the loop? The only way to find out is to keep developing this ability, all the while trying to put off the inevitable reset as long as possible. If you don’t, it will cost you dearly, but at least you will have the foreknowledge to pull yourself up and get back on track faster than before.\n\n\n**Core Gameplay Mechanics (in order of appearance)**\n\n**Survival** - traditional survival mechanics with emphasis on keeping fed, building shelter, and protecting yourself from hostile elements (natural or otherwise)\n\n**Time Loop** - think *Groundhog Day* or *Majora’s Mask*. After a set period of time, everything resets, sending you back to square one with just your experience/recipes/abilities intact. Dying will also trigger a loop reset.\n\n**Backwards Time Travel (Retrocausality)** - limited ability to travel backwards in time which expands as player develops better equipment/abilities. Eventually they can travel as far back as the start of the loop. Unlike the time loop, players can bring materials back in time, so they can build up their base faster (before the loop resets). Going backwards in time requires energy, so to avoid the loop reset entirely, the player will need to have built up a fair bit of infrastructure.\n\n\n**Aesthetic**\n\nTime To Survive takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting.\nIn general, the experience should have a ""lost on an alien planet"" vibe, but more ""Lost in Space"" than survival horror. This idea came about from playing a lot of *Stationeers,* so that should give you some idea of the kind of aesthetic I'm going for. An aesthetic like *Astroneers* would also work (although it is a bit more cartoony than I envision). The movie ""Interstellar"" is another good model for the aesthetic I'm going for. More *2001*, less *Star Trek*, but somewhere in the middle.\n\n\n**Influences:**\n\nGames: *Stationeers*, *Majora's Mask*, *Outer Wilds*\nMovies: *Groundhog Day*, *Edge of Tomorrow*\n\n\n**Project Description:**\nSurvival games are very popular, and the market is positively flooded with them, however there are few if any that explicitly include time travel as a gameplay element. In a sense, time travel is nothing new to survival games, or indeed to games in general, if you take a “meta” view and step outside the in-game worlds presented.\n\nWhenever you load a previous save to undo a costly mistake, or simply to witness your game in an earlier state (for nostalgia or whatever), you are effectively time travelling - you cannot take things from your later save, but you still have an advantage over your previous self in that you know the game better. And, if the game has predictable/scripted events, you also have some foreknowledge of what is to come that you can better prepare for.\n\nMany players of survival games enjoy the early stages of the games, where you are just trying to survive the first few nights and trying to gain a little bit of a foothold against whatever dangers the game will throw at you. Players who grow bored trying to find new things to do with an old and well-established setup, and miss those early days of standing up against great adversity, will happily start a new game from scratch, using their hard-won mastery of the game’s mechanics to start “smarter,” proving their improved survivability. This is effectively the same as a time loop, like in Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, etc.\n\nTime To Survive effectively “gamifies” these two common player practices, with the intent of increasing immersion by folding these activities into the game itself, and allowing the player to make use of unlocked abilities or materials from the late-stage game in the earlier stages. Doing so advances the player towards an explicit end-goal (escaping the time loop), something that is frequently absent in many survival games (for better or worse)."
lib15e,Any ideas for a fun probably addictive 2d game for a noob to make?,
li9wr8,College studio 2d top down tactical shooter,"I will be working on a a game development college project. It is to be a 2d top down military tactical shooter (aka not fast paced). Doing some UX, what would you like to see in such a game with all resources available and realistic features for a 3 person (game designer, producer and manager, artist, and game dev) with less than 7 months?\nReally appreciate if you could answer, thank you :)"
li9i8w,A zombie game where you and your dog try to escape the city,I've always thought how immersive it would be to have a story driven game with rpg elements would be like if the story was centered around you and your dog ( characters gender and facial structures are fully customizable. You can make the dog look like your dogs breed too ) script is similar with tlou and i am legend. Story is the focus but you can also free roam. Story starts with you meeting up with your friends on escaping through the city and you meet up with other civilians as well. Friends die here and there but one friend died due to a paranoid civilian killing him/her. Tons of emotional scenes specially where your dog sacrifices itself to save you from the hoard. Game ends up with you and the survivors escaping the city but at what cost. One of the boss fights is your mutated dog. There is no happy ending.
li7uae,A puzzle game where saving/loading/pausing only affects certain parts of it.,"So, for example, you could pause the game to suspend yourself in midair, or save and load to infinitely generate keys. Certain objects might have a little glow, to indicate that they aren't affected by the shenanigans.\n\nI'm thinking this would need to either be level-based with a lot of autosaves, or have ""real"" pausing and saving too, but the latter would probably make the in-game stuff feel awkward and unintuitive.\n\nThe main inspiration for this was Braid, a game where you could rewind time, but some objects weren't affected by it."
li6qym,An idea for game that i literally had in my dream,"So as i wrote in the title, tonight i had a dream about a game and i wanted to share this idea with someone,especially  because i usually don't have such vivid dream\nConcept:\n3 different soul share the same body, in particular a child, a old policeman and a woman (which is the original owner of the body). \nEach soul has his own objective, the child wants to find his parents, the policeman wants to go to the bottom of the situation and understand why they are sharing a body and finally the woman thinks she is going crazy and wants to find a psychiatrist.\n\ngameplay:\ni don't have a precise idea, i was thinking a something like heavy rain or until dawn, that type of game in which the main focus is the different choices that the mc make. \nA gimmick that i would like to see is the possibility to swap soul, and each soul has its own unique ability that could help in puzzle solving.\nObviously according to the choice you make you reach a different ending.\n\nlocation:\nin my dream the location was a partially collapsed skyscraper and main characters are stuck in it, and the only way to escape is going up.\n\np.s :to be clear english is not my native language, so if you find some grammar error pls forgive me, i really did my best\n\npps : i know that different soul sharing the same body it is not the most original idea, already used in other media and game but it is not like i can decide what i dream"

lhzcmz,A game based in the Atlantic ocean as a destroyer escorting convoys from America to Britain during WW2," Concept of the game\n\nso the basics of the game is that you have a destroyer that is in formation with a convoy headed to Britain. the main objective is to keep as many freighters, oilers and liners afloat until you reach aircover from across the pond from German U-boats and surface ships.\n\nthe core gameplay will be multi crewed destroyers of about 6-10 people all manning important post such as guns, engines, sonar/radar, steering, spotting, depth charges etc.\n\nthe ships used can be similar to the Fletcher class destroyer (USA) and tribal class destroyer (Royal Navy)\n\nplayers will have to work together to listen out for German U-Boats with sonar and give directions to the one steering the Destroyer to drop depth charges to ether sink or force the U-boat to surface. this will also be similar to German surface ships but with radar instead.\n\nsize of the game\n\nthe game size would be semi large if it where to go into massive detail but the size of the map would be large but would just be sea but convoys went mostly at 6-8 knots while crossing the Atlantic to conserve fuel \n\nso to simplify and finalise the idea \n\nits basically Greyhound the film turned into a game without tom hanks\n\nbut the game would be a \n\nOpen world\n\nAnti submarine warfare\n\nWorld War Two\n\nTeam Based\n\nPvE  (Optional PvP)\n\ncould be classified as a simulator if detail and historically accurate were the main selling points\n\nnice graphics if possible\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfeed back on the idea would be nice I know there are a lot of U-boat games like U-BOAT, Wolfpack, Iron wolf VR and others but I don't know one where you're the destroyer defending the convoys from them"
lhysl2,50 Player Competitive Rogue-lite/Hades-style Game,"Just had an idea I wanted to expand a bit on (one of many, just never thought to look up a subreddit like this). So, I have been enjoying the hell out of rogue-lite games recently, and steam-charts indicate I'm not alone on this one.\n\nMy thought would be to capitalize on this cultural moment by making a massive multiplayer, competitive ladder match.\n\nHere is my game flow concept:\n\nRound 1 will include 3 standard PvE stages followed by a PvP fight between two players. Potentially have a store stage prior to entering the first PvP arena stage.\n\nDown to 25 players. Those who are out can use what XP they gained to spend on passives or cosmetic upgrades.\n\nRound 2 will include five PvE stages followed by a boss fight. For the third stage in this round I would consider placing either a shop stage or a mini-boss stage.\n\nAfter the boss has been defeated, the surviving players will move into the final round.\n\nRound 3 should be comprised of either three challenge stages (timed chest fights, timed health restoration fights, mini-boss rush) or 1v1 PvP arenas. \n\nThe final stage should be a free-for-all battle between the remaining players. If this was a side-scrolling rogue-lite, perhaps this could be done as a race to the top of a platforming puzzle while fighting off other players. Maybe even an ending SSB-inspired fight.\n\nDefinitely interested in hearing if this is something anyone else would be interested in, either playing or making!"

lhu652,Godzilla game,"So anyways I just found this subreddit because I had an idea for a Godzilla game but didn’t know where to write it but I found this subreddit thankfully and wanted to see if anyone would actually be interested in my idea.I know there has been other Godzilla games and i don’t have any intention to turn this idea into the generator simulator godzillla game.It would be open world somehow and have it’s own original story and would switch off between gameplay of a scientist,Godzilla,and a solider.you’d be able to choose whether you want be the protector Godzilla or a rampaging Godzilla.obviously the idea needs work but it’s a start!"
lht5eq,Why I don't post game ideas anymore,"Now that I'm a game programmer, I keep all my game ideas in a private Discord channel. Before, my ideas and ability were too distant, so there were games I would have liked to see come to fruition, but couldn't make it happen.\n\nI have executed on 2 of my own game ideas so far, and since I'm gaining the ability to make these games happen, its unwise to make them publicly accessible. They are intellectual property, and I have to keep the good ideas to myself now. :p\n\nSorry /r/gameideas. My ideas are becoming reality."
lhpldl,A Cross between City Shrouded in Shadow and Shadow of the Colossus,"Your character is in a city. You must survive, because Kaiju are attacking the city. Sounds familiar, right? Yep. City Shrouded in Shadow was an awesome looking survival horror game featuring popular kaiju that released in Japan in 2017.\n\nWhat if we take the premise of CSiS, but we make it that the player can find weapons all around the city... weapons capable of damaging the kaiju?\n\nCity Shrouded in Shadow, but you can go all Shadow of the Colossus on the kaiju. Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks that would be awesome."
lhn84x,DEVIANT,"Right so I've been at this for a few days now, and the game idea I have is pretty massive. The game so far will be called DEVIANT set in a dystopian future of the year 2110 you can play as either Luke Jones or Megan Stride.\nThe location of Deviant is a place called Magnum City with locations of Klara Town, Silva Wood, OHM District and LU-POD. \nThe game type is a RPG, Free roam. Story line is a horror comedy. \nWeapons can evolve and you can choose what special ability to use with that particular weapon, the more you level up the weapon it will allow you to unlock room for more attachments and special ability to use with that gun  for example the PIX-t4k you'll start of using as an smg that'll turn to an assault weapon the more you use it. It has the ability to charge up and turn to rapid fire for a short period of time before overheat.\nBut I think in my head this could be big if it did come to it."
lhlr19,Mixing Cyperpunks Backstories with Fallouts Factions,So in CP there are three different introductions and in Fallout games there are often different endings based on the Faction you joined.  \n\n\nHow about combining those two. Meaning in Fallout 4 you could actually start the game already being part of the Brotherhood of steele for example and then play the whole game being part of the faction OR you can alternatively change faction during the story.
lhk5vw,Monster Builder/Fighter,"General idea would be a sort of Armored Core or Spore type game. You build a monster, the parts you use have different effects/abilities/stats. Additional thoughts: terrain and objects should be able to be interacted with like thrown cars/buildings or silly stuff like drinking nuclear reactor juice for a power up. \n\nBuild your monster, fight your friend's monster while jamming some badass thrash metal!"
lhfp8o,What’s the craziest game idea you’ve had?,"I know this is supposed to be backwards, but I haven’t seen much ideas posted as much lately and wanted to create a question to get it started up again. \n\nThere are no rules, but I would suggest that you pick it up randomly and quickly then develop from that instead of picking mechanics from different games.\n- These games definitely don’t have to be successful either."

lhb6dx,A point and click Mortal Kombat horror game,"Simply put, this game would be a point and click adventure in which you would try to escape from various Mortal Kombat fighters in various stages. Many of these stages would often be dimly lit/ very tight thus rendering you incapable of seeing whether your pursuer is in front of you. You would also have little to no options to fight back thus forcing you to either run or hide.\n\nI understand this sounds more or less absurd but try to imagine the intensity/fear of running away from Goro in a dark dungeon. Along with sluggish point and click controls making every click count.\n\nSorry for the sloppy writing I kind of just threw this together."
lh93jb,"Open world RPG, but the world is destroyed in 3 hours.","Whenever I play an open world RPG like fallout, skyrim or outer worlds, I always want to do every single mission but this ends up ruining my character b/c he ends up doing stuff against his character. Like I'll make a heroic guy who fights for good, but then I'll just help out a drug smuggler because idk why really, I just want to see what happens.  \n  \nLimiting the game to just 3 hours constrains your time so you have to ignore a lot of quests and I think I'd end up making a more cohesive storyline with my character. Then, you get to replay with an evil character or a greedy character, or whatever you want to do next.  \n  \nThere'd probably be less leveling and it would probably need some randomization or big choices at the start so you're not replaying the same missions a lot.  \n  \nMaybe fast-travelling/resting could also waste your time so those actions aren't free.  \n  \nMaybe, if you have to, throw in some world persistence between playthroughs. Maybe there's a time manipulation thing, so certain actions with one character persist to the next playthrough.  \n  \nIt's kinda like a cross between a rogue-like and an open world game.  \n  \nNo theme ideas yet, was imagining skyrim or fallout or outer worlds.  \n  \nAlso open to game suggestions if there's anything like this. I was thinking it'd be kinda like majora's mask but you can't reset the day (and gameplay around that is removed)."

lh6i2t,RPG Mechanic - World changes based on player actions / inaction,"I know some newer MMO's are attempting this type of mechanic, such as Ashes of Creation, and i just wanted to open up a dialogue around how player action might be able to make meaningful and dynamic changes to a world. For this scenario, picture the game is a classic sword and sorcery RPG based around party-based combat / exploration.\n\nLet's say there's a high-level quest to slay a dragon on a mountain. Until the dragon is slain, it might periodically raid and raze nearby villages, causing people to adandon the village and the jobs that village provides. That then knocks on the economy of the nation, who start seeing an increase in food or resource prices. That price increase effects every player, because no one has yet killed the dragon. \n\nAnother example might be a city is becoming prosperous due to players choosing to sell their wares there. Traders start arriving at the city to try and purchase these wares. Bandits start attacking the traders on the roads out of the city. The players now have a bandit problem to deal with.\n\nThe question I'm throwing to the community here is if this type of dynamic questing mechanic would be a positive; offering replayability and continued interest; or a chore; distracting people from what they actually want to do? I feel that consequences of inaction are something that could be done really well in games with a persistent world / universe. While in reality it may be no different than a ""weekly raid"", I feel the final product could make a world feel more alive. \n\nKeen to hear what others think, and some other examples of how such a mechanic could be applied."
lh5cw6,A civilization game where the skill tree is random,"I really like Sid Meier's Civilization games, but I don't like how the static skill tree dictates unit/economic progression. With a decent knowledge of history, a player can guess that mathematics is going to lead to artillery at some point. I am proposing a game where the social and military advancements are known, but the research path to arrive at them has been randomized at game start, thus forcing players to explore various dead end paths before unlocking advancements. \n\nFor example there could be three research trees Social, Economic, Military, and four research disciplines Nature, Literature,  Astronomy, Math. As ruler you can tell your Social college to study Literature, your Economic college to Study Nature, and your Military college to study Astronomy. Several turns later your Social college says there are no further advancements it can make in Literature and they are going to start looking into Math. Your economic college on the other hand some how figured out the production line by studying Nature and your military college was inspired to invent the machine gun by studying Astronomy.\n\nYou can send spies to enemy civilizations further along the tech tree than you and steal their discoveries or steal the correct path to those discoveries. For example your civilization could be significantly behind in economics but you send a spy to a neighbor that is further ahead and find the research path for the next two advancements are Nature and Math thus saving you from having to guess Nature and Math from the 3 other choices.\n\nAlso the effects of some advancements could be randomized to change the optimal strategy per session. One session unlocking agriculture could result in a +3 economic boost and unlocking archery gives a +1 military boost, and another game could have agriculture+1 and archery +3, thus changing the ease of an economic vs military victory at each session."

lh1e32,A horror survival game about split personalities,"Usually I don't give into horror games, but I had a dream about this game. So you somehow end up in a mansion, and someone is hunting you down for an unknown reason. You have to try to survive and escape this mansion. The killer has a spilt personality though. One second he's helping you by dropping items you need or something, other times he's trying to kill you, and other time's he just acts strange. The dialogue and the character is what would matter in this game. Let's say you're hiding in a closet and he walks by, he'd be talking out loud and saying things in a friendly manner like ""I have a gift for you! Where are you? Do you not want to be my friend anymore"" then suddenly it would change to ""WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU. WHEN I FIND YOU I'm GOING TO SLIT YOUR THROAT"" then ""Why would you say that? You're going to scare him off. We just want to help him"". I think it would be a pretty interesting idea IMO."
lgyh5e,City Shrouded In Shadow inspired Lovecraft game,
lgu1by,"A MMORPG where players create the races, lore, countries and conflicts","My idea is for an MMORPG where all the peoples, races, cities, countries, and how they behave and their goals in the world, is all created by players.\n\nI'd like building to be similar to minecraft except that blocks can be placed freely.\n\nTo prevent everyone from creating their own race, which would make the world messy, players are encouraged to organize in groups of many players and create a race togheter. Artists in the group can design their appearance, clothes and architecture style, writers can make their lore, roleplayers can be their spokespersons when talking with other races, etc.\n\nRoleplaying when the races interact is encouraged, as is following a temperament for the group to create a reputation in the world, like being kind and trustworthy, evil and dangerous, funny, animal-like...\n\nPeople working on the game can also created content, like missions, encourage players to create with rewards. These workers could roleplay in the game as ""gods"", and ""praying"" might make you get in touch with them if you need help, chances increasing if you've gained points for goodness and pray to a good god, or gained points of evil and pray to an evil god.\n\nThey can roleplay as both evil and good gods. If the world seems to be lacking any interesting conflicts, an evil god might encourage a country to become evil, promising rewards which will give them a very fun time to be evil. Or another god might reward moral players who for example sacrifice their characters life and loosing some progress to save anothers. Or if one country have become too powerful and is dominating much of the world and preventing others to create, the gods can keep the balance by giving special abilities to a country that promises to defeat them.\n\nHow does the game start?\n\nI'd like for the world to be in the beginning just untouched nature, full of dangerous or friendly creatures, fantastical and varied landscapes, myserious secrets.\n\nAt first the players in the world are few in numbers. They decide where they want to spawn and then struggles to create a stronghold to survive. As they have children more players can join, so your characters fundamental appearance is made by your ""parents"". A bit of their abilities and points for good or evil are also inherited. So a player well-off in the game from the start might have genuine feelings of gratitude towards their ""parents"" in the game.\n\nSurvival knowledge, alchemy, magic spells etc are hard-earned knowledge and passed on from one generation to the next. Eventually more players from the group can join in and they can build their land, if they want, or just explore.\n\nThe ""gods"" might also appear early on to speed up the creativity."

lgtfb6,My idea on how to make a 2D level longer without making it overstay its welcome,So there are hollow blue blocks and solid red blocks when jou enter the the level after jou defeat the boss or collect a item in the end(and so on) the blue blocks become solid to block off parts of the old path(to keep players from getting lost) and the red blocks become hollow to open up a new path back as the player now has to race back against a clock to the start on a new path that occasionally crosses with the old one (what do jou guys think of my idea) this game was implemented in a very good game from a few years back called WARIO LAND:SHAKE IT

lgs3o8,A pretty big idea that I have been working on for a while.,"An MMORPG (Not so unique, I know).  \n\n\nKey features:  \n\- Multiplayer  \n\- Huge world  \n\- Unique crafting system  \n\- Skill system  \n\- Legendary weapons (Only 1 of each)  \n\- Legendary skills (Given to people by staff members, very rare)  \n\- The ability to do almost anything  \n\- Build system (Only for staff members in multiplayer, for everyone in singleplayer)\n\n  \n\--==Huge world==--  \nA world with a kingdom in each corner of the map.  \nIt takes 24 hours to travel from one corner to the other on foot, because of this the world is split into 4 servers.   \nThese kingdoms will be run by actual players.   \nStaff members will be advisors to the king/council/whatever the player uses, so that players won't go overboard and destroy everything.  \n\n\nBecause the world is being ruled by actual players, a lot can happen (Wars, political assassinations, etc.)  \nThis ensures real reactions to certain situations, unlike staff members that might script these events.  \n\n\nThe staff members/advisors will be known as the 4 archmages. They possess great power and unique skills.  \n\n\n\--==Unique crafting system==--  \nAnyone can upgrade their weapons.  \nThey do this by going to an anvil, popping in their weapon, and picking an upgrade.  \nThese upgrades can include things like:  \n\+ 1 blade  \n\+ longer handle  \n\+ longer blade  \n\n\nPeople with the blacksmith skill can make weapons exactly how they want. They can also use the system above, but they can also decide where they want the blade or handle, what shape the blade/handle is and how long they are.  \nThey get to customize every single bit of the weapon  \n\n\n\--==Skill/Class/Stat System==--  \nYou can equip 2 offensive classes, 1 defensive class, and 1 utility class at a time.  \nYou unlock classes by upgrading skills. Once a stat is high enough, it can be turned into a class when combined with another class.  \nFor example:  \n25 Dexterity + Fighter Class = Sworddancer (Double-bladed sword)  \n15 Dexterity + 20 Mana + Mage Class = Magic Monk (Uses melee spells on their fists)  \n\n\nOf course, the classes, skills, and stats are up to what you think fits best with your idea.  \n\n\nSkills are features you can unlock like:  \n\- Potion Brewing  \n\- Creating Jewelry  \n\- Herb Enhance (Upgrade herbs to make better potions)  \n\n\n\--==Legendary Weapons==--  \nLegendary weapons are unlocked by completing events, rare quests, or helping a kingdom.  \nThey are extremely powerful and there will only be 1 of every legendary weapon.  \nSome roleplay bloodlines might keep a legendary weapon.  \n\n\n\--==Legendary Skills==--  \nJust like legendary weapons, they can be unlocked by completing events, rare quests, or helping a kingdom.  \nLegendary skills can be unlocked by multiple people, they're just rare to unlock.  \nLegendary skills can be:  \n\- Dual-wield  \n\- Plant Generation (Ability to generate herbs or other plants)  \n\n\n\--==The Ability to do almost anything/Build System==--  \nPlayers can start shops, farms, and even entire towns.  \nThis can all be achieved by sending an appeal to staff members.  \n\n\nPlayers can build their own houses in a program inside the game. Once approved by the staff member, it will be placed where the player wants it.  \nThis allows the creation of almost any building you want.  \nCertain build pieces will be unlocked by unlocking skills.  \n\n\nThat was my TEDTalk that was way too long, thank you for listening.  \n\n\ntl;dr: An MMORPG where anything is possible"
lgrl9a,Mobile FPS game,"This is not an idea for a specific game. Rather, an idea on how we can improve a niche genre.\n\nYou see, I played some mobile FPS, including NOVA from Gameloft (I was huge fan of Gameloft in the Java games, so I was really disheartened to be so disappointed) and mobile Doom ports. However, they all suck, because controls are totally unadjusted to a mobile setting. Both Delta Touch and Freedoom have a separate fire button in top of the screen, which requires me to put my fingers into a claw. While Nova, and other games like it, fires automatically when you target the enemy (a huge improvement), they still use virtual sticks for controls - and not only FPS on gamepad is already suboptimal, virtual sticks feel much worse than real sticks because of lack of haptic feedback (you can't feel them).\n\nSo here's my idea:\n\n* On the right side of the screen, covering most of the bottom of it, we have a horizontal slider that is used for horizontal aiming. This slider represents all 360 degrees of possible rotation. Edges are looking directly south, middle (marked with an ""N"" above it) represents facing directly north. Player can rotate smoothly by tapping and dragging the slider nub, or tap directly any place on the slider to quickly/instantly 'snap' the rotation angle of player view to it. This way, rotating can feel potentially as good and responsive as using the mouse. The slider can also be used to display other information, for example a red ""X"" that will show which direction you're getting attack by, or a green circle that shows angle to the next objective compared to you.\n* On the very left edge, we have an empty area. If player taps anywhere on it, a centered virtual joystick will appear under their finger. Player can then move their finger while holding to start walking. Moving it further from center will start running instead.\n* The game fires automatically on enemies in the middle of the screen, in the rectangular area equal to width of the crosshair, and entire height of the screen. T**he game would play like Doom, meaning there is no looking up - you just rotate left and right.** Instead, there is vertical autoaim, where as long as enemy is in the middle slice of the screen, the autoaim will target them even if they're above or below the crosshair. It's the same autoaim area like in original Doom, if you played that.\n* The distance at which the automatic firing starts varies depending on weapon, where each has an associated variable of range. So for example a shotgun has low range, while a sniper rifle has very long range. If you want to use this system in a mobile Doom port, then just associate hardcoded range values to all default weapons,  and for new weapons that are added in mods, use a generic default value.\n* Similarly, if the game features contextual melee (like the knife button from CoD or Mighty Foot from Duke Nukem) the game will automatically perform a melee attack when you get close to an enemy, and keep melee attacking until enemy is dead.\n* On top of the screen, we have other buttons. Jump forward (so player doesn't have to hold the direction while jumping), switch weapon, reload, action, grenade, ADS toggle. This is because player will use these actions less often, so they can take their fingers off the controls temporarily when doing that.\n\nAnd that's it, that's the idea. I think using something like that could drastically improve player experience of mobile FPS, as long as they're designed to use that optimally. And I think it'd be a perfect fit for a mobile Doom port.\n\nOh, and if you want to use this system in your game, it'd be nice to credit me. But you don't have to, since subreddit rules define that all ideas are 'free range'."
lgqtjn,I swear I have the best game Idea!,"Ok, so in season five episode 36 of adventure time, there is this infinity train dungeon. It's my favorite episode of all time, I feel that if there was a VR game that had the theme of that game and it was combat like Gorn with procedurally generated loot that has a cool effect; the battle moon, flame helmet, or stone cage helmet with an eyeball Lazer bat ect, that gets harder as time goes on and never ends, kinda like a roguelike. that would be like crack to me!"

lg6eu7,Hypercasual Ideas - As Many As Possible :),"Hey there everyone,\n\nI've been working as a game designer for more than 8 years now, and I have worked on a number of different genres. I've mostly worked on Hidden Object and Point and Click adventures, but I have also developed a number of more challenging projects like turn-based RPGs and Sim games.\n\nFor the last couple of years, I've been working on hypercasual games for the mobile market. Unfortunately, I don't have much to share, but I have a lot of ideas that didn't end up developed. For some of these ideas, we simply didn't have enough time or resources, and some simply weren't good enough. Some were considered by the biggest hypercasual publishers as great ideas, but our prototypes didn't do them justice, and they failed as potential hit games.\n\nI've been digging through this subreddit and I haven't found any posts similar to this one, so I wanted to start a thread where people would share their ideas for hypercasual games. Who knows, maybe some of the people browsing through this subreddit will get inspired, and maybe some will be able to develop other people's ideas as successful games.\n\nIf you have an idea, or you'd like to hear some of my ideas - feel free to comment and leave a response, you may even contact me via DM if that's more of your style.\n\nI'll be posting some of my ideas in comments and replies soon, so if you're interested - make sure you follow this subreddit.\n\nIf there's a similar post that I've somehow missed, please direct me to it, and I'll delete this one.\n\nCheers."
lg462m,A Persona-Inspired Third Person Shooter,"(I just lost a lot of what I wrote so I'm gonna speed through this)\n\nIn this game there are no guns\nInstead you use elemental skills.\nAll of the elements can be found here:  https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Persona_5_Skills\n(I would recommend not using the ""gun skills"" or ""almighty"" skills)\n\nEach element has 3 tiers, a Light, a medium, and a heavy.\n\nA light elemental skill does the least damage, while a heavy elemental skill does the most. Each character should have a weakness to one element, with a resistance to another. Usually their resistance is to the elemental skills they use.\n\nIf a character uses ice skills, they're usually resistant to ice. But you don't have to always follow this. Different resistances and weaknesses would make the game more diverse, so have fun with it.\n\nEach element is more like an AOE ability rather than a different kind of bullet. An electric skill could be like a thundercloud or something. And the heavy version could be a bigger thundercloud that's faster.\n\n If you can't figure out an idea for an element, then maybe watch some gameplay and you could find one. Be creative!\n\nThere are also physical skills, which for the sake of balance will not do crits. Instead of that, they can be treated as an extra element. Some characters can be resistant and others can be weak to it. But If a character is weak to physical attacks, then they should be allowed 2 resistances instead of 1 for balance, because every character should have a basic melee attack that would weaken them.\n\nFinally, we come to the last type of skill. Buffs and Debuffs. I have almost no idea how these will work. Maybe it'll be another sort of AOE and if your opponent gets caught in it they get debuffed but for the moment it's up to you, the cool gamer coder man.\n\nA Buff can do 3 things: Increase Attack (Physical skills and Elemental skills) Increase Defense (Take less damage), and Increase speed (Because a hit/evasion system would be too much extra work)\n\nThe names being\nTarukaja Rakukaja and Sukukaja respectively. Oh, and if you want, you could add Heat Riser, a skill that raises all 3 at the same time but costs more SP.\n\nOh dang, what a good segway into the HP and SP system, I'm so good.\n\nAnyways HP and SP. For every skill there is a cost. For all elemental skills, they cost SP, and only SP.\n\nFor all Physical skills, which can vary from skills like ""Kill rush"" to others like ""God's hand"", They cost HP.\n\nIf you ever want to find out the cost of a skill you want to add, just check here: https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Persona_5_Skills\n\nOn that website they have all the skills from Persona 5, which has all the elements I mentioned. If there are any skills you want to add from there, feel free to. There are a few elements I haven't mentioned for reasons, usually because it'd be too powerful, but feel free to experiment and do whatever. It's your game, so have fun with it.\n\nFinally, probably one of the hardest things to ask would be the ability for players to make custom characters. I know it is hard. I would never even try it. But having the ability to create your own character is awesome. You don't have to make an extensive character creator, but just the ability to choose your own skills and resistances and weaknesses would be really fun. \n\nOh, and I'm not sure exactly what hitting a weakness would do. Usually in the games it would set up for an all out attack by knocking them down, but I'm not sure if that would work here. Feel free to come up with something new.\n\nAnd I guess that's it. The rest is up to you and your imagination. If you do ever make this a real game, it would be nice if you could credit me, but you don't have to. I would like to be able to playtest tho.\n\nAnyways, for anyone who stopped by to hear this, uh....\n\nHave a nice day!"

lfxswd,Project pitch: Gentle: an action RPG with a story covering mental health topics not discussed that could help the world understand people better.,"Hey everyone. So, I had an idea I talked with a few close friends about and wanted to share the idea with this sub reddit because a friend who got a project going with this place suggested it to me. Okay, *inhales* here we go!\n\n\nThe project title is: Gentle. It's a 2D RPG akin to say, The World Ends with You in how the presentation for the gameplay portion works. With a sort of Tetsuya Nomura art style. (I like how he draws anime esque designs over traditional anime. The outfits are so creative plus the faces are more emotional too me). \n\nThe story follows a boy who struggles with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and a topic that's difficult to discuss and isn't talked about in media enough which needs to be addressed as I've dealt with it for a long time: self harm. Even when media portrays it, it's usually with girls but it's become a bigger issue among guys as well and I wanted to raise awareness too it. He'd rather sit in his own space in his own world because he's afraid of being close too people, especially after a bad breakup where he was left for someone online. He often sees couples, friend groups, family's and just feels like there's something wrong, or different about him that's preventing him from finding something he felt he lost as a kid or was taken away from. He just doesn't understand how people do the things they do but more importantly, why they do the things they do, even if he has his own passions like messing with game design, drawing digital art, going for walks, etc \n\nHe often wears headphones or earbuds, listens to video game, anime, and film music over other music and sort of filters the world through a special way with the music. For example, while most people would be walking in a busy city and see grey colors, hear car and bustling City noises, he with the right music sees more color, objects he can interact with, people when they talk are more expressive and their personalities are hightened (like, how they speak either had more enthusiasm or even less depending on them). I figured this would make for an interesting world to explore, because you can have interesting world design without sacrificing a more down to earth feel. I figured the setting would be in some sort of dream or daydream type realm you switch between. Like, maybe an object he holds and he phases between the two. A good example for the color/tone shift would be in the difference between the real and dream worlds in Mario and Luigi Dream Team. \n\nIt'd follow him after a huge setback in his life that sends his depressive behaviors down a near death path that leads him to meet with people that teach him how to understand the world in a way that merges his with reality so he can learn to be happy and find the things he'd like out of life. \n\n\nIt'd be an action RPG, with combat built around basic punch/melee attacks with energy infused with them that comes with usual dream world type settings ing games so the basic punches have a bit more flare too them with the main gimmick/draw being that you have a few items slots to equip various weapons, badges/etc (I haven't decided on what they are yet, but they are your sort of special attacks) each with either a recharge period, different range or conditions to use, etc but much like say, 3D Zelda, you have a couple buttons open to map those items too during combat, I felt this design choice helps keep things more easier to digest for newer people while adding a degree of customization too it. You'd be limited to just 3 or so, so there's a good emphasis on getting creative with your picks of what you want to have for battle. \n\nBecause of the daydream type environment and not as realistic physics of that world (you know, the typical stuff RPG protagonists can do that we can't like how they jump,) it could lead to fun world design and exploration for extra goodies. I enjoy a game that balances 3 key elements rather than 2. I can't stand if a game is just, walk to fight, okay, walk to next one. I like substance in between to help keep things fresh and interesting. \n\n\nObviously, some kinks and such need too be worked out but I felt the daydream like idea could lead to limitless possibilities in what can qualify as a special. I figured you could also use a combination of basic and specials to build up to other unique moves. Party members and such I haven't worked out yet, but it's something I'd like to include. I have an original character of mine I've wanted to use in a game project for a while that plays an important character role in helping the main character. \n\n\nOverall, I've had this idea for a while but haven't shared it with anyone. I figured I'd put it out and see if it was fucking trash or actually really good or somewhere in between. Leave some feedback because I'd like too maybe one day take this idea somewhere. \n\n\nThank you for your time if you decide to look at this! My DM's, comments, etc are always open."
lfvzv6,The Corruption Chaos Rains,"This is a game idea I based off my book series that's in the making. This game would be an arena fighting game where you could choose all 94 of the characters and they each have 8 special attacks and have their own melee attacks. There would also be a story mode, survival, boss fights, and carnage modes. \n \nThe base game you could have 1v1s up to 10v10s and you can choose a character that fits your style. There would be death matches and objective based versions by escorting a payload or capturing a flag.\nEach character has armor, health, energy, and stamina bars. \n\nArmor is decreased before your health and can't be repaired.\n\nHealth is only decreased when you have no armor and it can regenerate after killing an opponent.\n\nEnergy decreases the more abilities you use and you have to wait for it to regenerate to use more abilities \n\nStamina is how long you can run at full speed, each character has a different stamina amount and it regenerates at different speeds for each character.\nEach bar has a unique amount for each character.\n\nSurvival, you can choose between 16 of the rebel characters to survive multiple waves of demons, angels, corrupted, zombies, and super soldiers. You can escape but only after a certain amount of waves and you only have one chance to escape or you have to stay and fight.\n\nBoss Fights, there are some characters who pushed their boundaries and reached new heights. Face a boss or be the boss in a 10v1 where the 10 weaker characters have to fight off one of their own turning against them for power. \n\nCarnage is a playlist of vehicle modes consisting of racing, boss runs, and vehicle survival.\n\nRacing, you can choose between characters cars and race them through destroyed cities or even futuristic paradises.\n\nBoss runs, a boss character needs to stop 4 runners from making it to the finish by an means necessary by throwing chunks of buildings and throwing vehicles to slow them down and kill them.\n\nVehicle survival, 3 characters need to stop one character in a car from making it to the finish line by using their abilities.\n\nStory mode, you can choose between 5 characters with their own sides of the story. There are five difficulties , and you can customize your character to your liking and upgrade them with new powers,perks, and weapons.\n\nDifficulties. We'll go easy, Stepping it up, Adrenaline Rush, Blood Rush, Corrupted Hell. Corrupted Hell is the only difficulty in the corrupted story and you can only unlock it for the other stories by beating the corrupted campaign.\n\nEndings. Each character has 4 endings and the endings depend on whether you spare characters befriend them, or kill them.\n\nThe four endings are good, neutral, evil, and unrivaled genocide.\n\nStory, each character is a part of a side of a war going on and you are selected to fight to secure dominance over the other sides. The sides are Demons, Angels, Hybrids, Corrupted, and Rebels.\n\nYour actions. Each character can be of use to you. If you befriend a character they become an allie that fights alongside you. If you spare them they give you new abilities and perks that can help you. If you kill them you take their weapon and can use it to help yourself.\n\nWhat your actions are towards the other characters can also unlock cosmetics for that character so you can choose something that you prefer for the character to wear or you can customize their weapon with a different look.\n\nStory mode fighting. You spawn on one side of the map and have to make your way towards the other side and in your way are a bunch of different types of enemies that are willing to tear you apart. In each map you can meet 3 characters and every few levels you encounter a boss that wants to take you off the face of the planet permanently. (You can't be their ally). It would be in third person. Depending on what you do even if it doesn't affect the characters it might be thing that makes them your friend or enemy."

lfm2vt,Team-Based FPS Idea,"16v16 team based FPS.\n\nNo TDM, entirely objective based modes.                                                                                                      Maps are bigger than CoD, smaller than Battlefield.\n\nYou get points for doing stuff like killing people, helping teammates and capping objectives.            Points can be used to upgrade gear. For example, a sniper rifle. It has two skill trees that you can pick individual skills from, Scout and Eliminator. \n\nScout has access to stuff like marking enemies on the minimap while scoped in, and Eliminator specializes in stuff like swapping their regular sniper rifle to a 50 Cal. But, the thing is, you can mix between these two archetypes, so for example, you can spec entirely into Scout, and at the endgame skills you can choose the 50 Cal that Eliminator gets.\n\nA couple of other things about gear is that it has a set weight to it, and there's a pick 10 system.           \nSo you pick your armor, which determines the weight you start at and your speed/health, and you can choose a variety of gear, from guns to medic and ammo packs, to sentries and spawn beacons for your teammates.\n\nThis would encourage a wide variety of builds, from an extremely fast, minimum armor pistol build, to an engineer class that has two sentries and a shotgun, to a highly armored sniper that can punch holes through even the toughest of enemies.\n\nBasically, this game's major strength is the customization of everything from attachments, to loadouts, to armor, to even basic cosmetics.\n\nThanks for reading, and have a nice day, everyone."

lfhfft,Need advice with rhythm games,"I'm planning to make a rhythm game, but I just can't make up a new idea. I really liked Avicii Invector and Beat Saber, and my goal is to make something similar to them, but not an exact copy. That is, there are notes coming towards you, you have to press the correct button when the notes reach a line, you are allowed to miss some beats before fail, only the multiplier resets. I also want the game to be controller compatible, while also being playable using a keyboard (and/or mouse).\n\nI came up with the idea to use two buttons only. On the controller, this would mean the two triggers. The problem with this is, that pressing the right button out of two seems not too competitive, as you are allowed to miss. \n\nThen I thought about a 4 button control. On the controller: triggers and LB RB (the buttons above the triggers). This would allow for a more challenging level design. But the problem: when playing a really fast song (e.g. Overkill by RIOT), you would be forced to use your middle and index fingers on both the keyboard and controller - and latter is not a comfortable hold. Otherwise, (using only your index fingers) the control would be way harder and tiring using a controller.\n\nI really liked the idea to use both triggers (like u are playing the drum), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea as it prevents you from using any other buttons. I mean, when your index fingers are on the triggers, and you are playing a really intensive level, you just can't use your thumb without disrupting your index fingers, just try it.\n\nDo you have any ideas about the game itself or the control?\n\nI'm also open to totally different ideas! :)"
lfgmc7,"Competitive Game that Incorporates ""Foul Play"""," One of the things that I realised greatly separates E-sports from most regular sports is that within reality, there is always room for subjective ""rule breaking"" and testing the limits of what is ""allowed"". For example: what counts as a foul in football? Before the days of HawkEye, although there are strict rules about what counts as ball in tennis being within the line, it was up to human perception to dictate if a ball was ""in"" or ""out"". In videogames, because everything is controlled by the programmed mechanics and game engine, there is no room for foul play or human error when accounting for rules.\n\nMost people would see this as an advantage - and generally I would agree. But in my opinion, the act of pushing the boundaries of what is ""allowed"" in real sports/games adds a dynamic that is lost in videogames, and to my knowledge, is not something which has ever been really explored (if it has, I would love to know!). \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have any ideas for videogames with foul play, or how they could even be incorporated. If there were foul mechanics which were not detected by the game itself, who adjudicates the game? If it were a MOBA style team game for example, would there have to be some third-party referee? Could it perhaps be that the game \*can\* detect ""foul play"", but it's on the burden of the player to call it out? What would ""foul play"" in a card, RTS, MOBA, Shooter, fighting game or whatever even look like? I'm not sure, but I'm hoping anyone reading this finds it as oddly interesting as I do.  \n \n\n(Again, there's always the chance that this has been done effectively elsewhere and I'm just not aware of it, and if so, I would love someone to point it out.)"

l9oxh0,A Space Age Nubian version of the the movie “Stargate”,"  \nFeel free to use this idea.\n\n  \nIn the movie Stargate, an alien took ancient Egyptians as slaves, and brought them to another planet in a distant galaxy.  In the game that I envision, a wormhole brought people from ancient Nubia to another world billions of light years from Earth.  Once they got there, they built a civilization, and over time, they became a space-faring empire.\n\n  \nThe architecture would look both Nubian and Space Age, similar to the movie “Stargate” (although Nubian architecture and art would look different than Egyptian).  Essentially, you have to manage your empire by colonizing other worlds, gathering resources, dealing with alien civilizations, doing research for tech improvements, and keeping your people happy.  You can be diplomatic with aliens, trade with them, avoid them, or fight wars with them.\n\n  \nYou would start on your home world, which would be very Earth-like.  The next step would be to colonize the solar system.  After 20 game years, you would begin discovering alien civilizations.  Some would be friendly, others would be businesslike, isolationist, or hostile. The decisions that you make would determine your relations with each civilization.  Over time, you would be all over the galaxy.\n\n  \nThere are several ways to win, which would be political, economic, military, and technological:\n\n1.  Establishing a lasting peace throughout the galaxy with your civilization becoming the central figure in galactic politics.\n2. Building up enormous wealth (1 trillion space credits), thus becoming the financial powerhouse of the galaxy.\n3. Conquering the galaxy.\n4. Becoming so technologically advanced that all other civilizations are dependent on information that only you can provide through your Galaxynet Information Superhighway.\n\nYou would lose the game if you are conquered by an alien civilization, or if one of them meets a victory condition before you."

l9o2fb,Space Clash Royale - Clash Royale meets FTL,"Currently started working on a small prototype for this idea, and I wanted to post it here to get some feedback in advance.\n\n**The general idea**\n\nBasically the game's mechanics for the most part resemble Clash Royale (mobile, 1v1 realtime PVP, energy recharges over time, cards, etc); mixed with a simplified version of FTL.\n\nThe major difference is that the combat itself is much more dynamic; having no static towers, and each player controls a single ""mothership"".\n\n**Movement**\n\nThe player can always give an order to move his ship to a specific destination on his half of the board.   \nMovement is relatively slow, and has a X second cooldown between activations.\n\n**Shields**\n\nPlayers have shields that defend the ship's hull, and will recharge if the ship hasn't taken damage in X seconds. Shields take -50% damage from energy weapons &amp; +50% damage from all explosives.\n\nOnce the shields are down, the player receives damage to his hull; once hull integrity reaches 0, the player dies and the other player wins.\n\n**Units**\n\nPlayers can also summon units (smaller ships/squadrons), that will fly towards the enemy mother ship and fight any incoming units on the way.\n\n**Ship upgrades**\n\nUsing a full energy bar, each player can upgrade 1 of 3 parts of the ship, up to 3 times **total combined:**\n\n1. Movement - Movement speed &amp; cooldown is increased by 25%\n2. Shields - Max shields and recharge rate is increased by 20%\n3. Energy - Energy recharge rate is increased by 15%\n\n**Meta game**\n\nPlayers unlock/upgrade abilities and choose their ""deck"" prior entering battles.\n\nPlayers can also unlock/upgrade ship hulls, each ship hull giving a different combination of base stats (movement, shields/hull, energy).\n\n**Wanted feedback**\n\nJust by reading this idea; do you feel it is unique enough to stand out as a game on it's own?  \nDo you like/dislike this idea? Why?  \nDoes this sound like a game you would play?  \nWhat design problems do you think this idea might have?\n\nPlease note, ***I am not*** ***looking for technical/business advice***; just about the **game idea itself**.\n\nThanks!"

l9jovg,Archaeologist Tycoon - A business simulation about archaeological excavation,"There has been a resurgence of the tycoon or management genre recently, and I don't think this has been ever done in video games before. I think a business simulation game based on an archaeological excavation would be a really fun concept to make a game out of.\n\nI got this idea while reading about Howard Carter, who discovered the tomb of King Tutankhamun. How he had no formal education of archaeology, persuaded an aristocrat to fund his venture into tomb excavations, and after years of nothing and right before his employer cut the fund, he accidentally stumbled on a stone that turned out to be the tomb. It's such an interesting story and it is something I wish to experience in a video game format, which is great at creating a sense of exploration and discovery.\n\nHere is the general premise. The player runs their own relic excavation camp, including designing the methods, who to hire, researching, and securing funding. There are various maps that used to be sites of the ancient civilizations, from Egypt, China, Europe, South America. Before digging something, the player has to buy equipment. You need the right equipment and the right people to a specific job. For example, you need a translator to read ancient texts that might give you a clue. \n\nThen you need to decide which location to dig by following the clues, and this takes a lot of time. Rewards are rare and big discoveries are a few. Big archaeological discoveries mean more attention and more funding. There will be times when you dig out nothing, which means you wasted time and money, and this causes the investors to be angry at the player and cut the funding. However, the smaller relics are more frequent and these will help the player to salvage some of the costs.\n\nOnce you find remains of the ancient civilization, for example, a pyramid, you have to send out workers to the site, and this section plays like an isometric tactical game. The player has to be careful of the environment since the haphazardly rushing the excavation means there can be damage to relics. Some rooms may be rigged with traps.\n\nIt also shares some commonalities with grand strategy games where long-term strategy rather than short-term tactics matter more. The game starts at the birth of the archaeological excavation boom of the 19th century and continues to the future. Historical events will shape the gameplay. The player needs to purchase better equipment and figure out new methods constantly. Buy medicine so the workers don't die from diseases or accidents. Wars can interrupt your excavations, damage the relics, and kill your workers. Some governments may not like what you do, and you have to bribe the officials. There will be times when you will go bankrupt, so selling relics to the black market for money is a tempting option, but this means a decrease in reputation thus locals and the press will not be helpful to your excavations, which will damage your business.\n\nThere are a lot of elements that can be gamified here. Frustratingly long gameplay sessions paced by short bursts of excitement."

l9adoy,A Real-Time Strategy game that is secretly an Open World RPG.,"Story: A new continent has been discovered and is in dire need of colonization.\n\nThis continent is our game-world. One singular, huge, open world - that is colonized and conquered by 4 warring factions (Orcs, Hhumans, Elves, Dwarves) over the course of the game - in real time.\n\nHere is the twist: The game starts as a Anno 1404-esque RTS game. You build a woodcutter, a fisher, marketplace, etc. But that typical strategy game / isometric perspective is actually a POV camera.You are literally a god, looking down on the people you command. And the people below see you as this kind of magical light in the sky.Suddenly, you get backstabbed by another god and thrown down into the mortal world. You find yourself in the middle of the town you have been building until now - you look up and see the strange light in the sky that used to be you but is now someone else.You were replaced and that strange god just keeps on doing what you were doing before, as if nothing happened. Now he is telling everyone where to go, what to build, etc.Luckily, you find yourself un-influenced by this new god's commands and keep your free will.\n\nOver the course of the game's story you re-gain your godlike powers (allthough the game never goes back to being a RTS), you can cut NPC's ties to their god and make them follow/obey you isntead.  \n**The game is basically Skyrim - in an open world in which 4 AIs / Gods fight and build and trade in real time and try to conquer the continet.**  \nOver the course of the game a trading system is established in which you can participate - reminiscent of the one in the X-Series. (Terran Conflict, etc.) You can build your own towns and settlements, if you want. You can play as a solo adventurer or make literal armies follow you.You can conquer by strenghts, trade or politics. -- But at it's core, all of **this is a 1st person RPG Game.**"

l96l05,17th up to/or 19th century Firearms FPS,"I would love to see an fps in a pre-automatic time period. It doesn't need glorious graphics or a beautiful story. I just want a randomized character with random stats that can affect how effective I am at everything from fighting to running, moderately large maps with ""soft"" borders, and variable quality weapons to fight with.\n\nFor the character, I think that they should have five stats: strength, agility, endurance, melee combat, and ranged combat. Strength affects how quickly they accelerate their melee weapon and how fast they can run, agility affects how smoothly they move themselves and their weapon and reduces how likely they are to trip, endurance affects how long they can run and how much they can swing their weapon, melee combat boosts both their melee weapon speed, and ranged combat affects how steady they are with their gun and how fast they can reload. All of these should have either a random granular value or several tiers that each have their own values.\n\nThe maps should include woodlands, farms, trenches, villages, etc., as a ""battlefield"" isn't just a flat, open plain used for combat, it can be wherever, whenever, however. I also don't want bodies to despawn. They should remain on the field until the end of the game and be a constant hazard to the players, as they might trip over them and their weapons. The borders of the map should give you a warning, but not kill you based on time, rather distance from the boundaries of the map. These areas should be really disadvantageous to be in. I think three or four maps or map archetypes would be great: city, fort, farm, and wilderness, or any combination thereof. The more militarized, the more military equipment (like artillery and mantlets) should be available for the players to utilize on the map.\n\nFurther adding to the topic of weapons, the player should choose absolutely nothing. They should get a pop-up message when they spawn of the stats of their character, armor, and weapons, but besides that they get no other ui besides the number of bullets they have for their weapons. They should get a random large weapon and two random small weapons. The long weapon could be a pike, shotgun, blunderbuss, rifle, musketoon, whatever type of weapon is proper for the period chosen. The small weapons could be a hatchet, hammer, maul, pistol... again, whatever is appropriate. If they land with two small melee weapons or small firearms, they only get one of the two. They should also start with a random amount of ammo, which can even be nothing, to begin with, but they can pick up ammo of the specific type that their weapon uses from dead bodies, which might take a few seconds to search.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, there should be rather standard firearms combat- movement should affect aim sway, you should be able to steady your aim somehow, can prop your gun up, etc. I'm not too concerned about that because that is a well-beaten path, though there are some changes I would make and concerns I have. Rather, what I am worried most about is the melee combat. If you approach somebody with a melee weapon out, you should have a soft lock-on with them. Your aim should be slightly slowed down in this area. Your weapon should come out of a relaxed stance and into a combat stance. You should be able to move your weapon into different positions by moving your view around a little bit. For thrusting weapons, you should be able to make a lunge by using the regular fire button and then move towards your opponent. With swinging weapons, you should simply change the position your weapon is in to make a strike in the direction of the change of position. The same stabbing method would apply to weapons like sabers and cutlasses. Parries would be made in the same method as cuts or strikes. Firearms of this period should take a while to reload. IIRC, in many periods, a person could shoot two or three times per minute. I would want the game to hold true to that. It would make bayonets and melee weapons totally necessary.\n\nOptional additions: destructible terrain, weapon durability, mounts, boats, fortresses, artillery, etc.\n\nTL;DR: I am disorganized and don't know how to code, but I want a game that has early-firearms warfare. (I might learn to code just to do this myself)"

So thank you this is my first post!\n\n\nI don't know what the story could be, but basically my idea is that you start off with a basic story mirroring early Atari/NES days and or a or a primitive character from the Atari graphics era, and slowly throughout the game, you morph into the 8-bit era, 16-bit era, transition into early 32-bit 3D, followed by PS2/XBox graphics, moving into XB360 graphics and ultimately PS5/XBSX, etc.\n\n\nI've thought about it and if there's already a game like this I'd love to know. There's an Oculus game kind of like this but it's not all gens in one game. \n\n\nI think it'd have to obviously be early early Atari 2D at the start (maybe even earlier?) but at the end of the game, the transition, the characters, the story, all of it, we'll get to see it all ultimately transition into an open world, (a la Red Dead 2 graphics) graphically stunning game where the story comes to an end, possibly with a 'to be continued' type ending pointing to the idea that visually and hypothetically, videogames will continue to expand into new dimensions, new types of games, new ideas and the characters will continue on.\n\nAs for the KIND of game. It would obviously need to start off as platforming but it could blend and mix as the story/game progresses."
l95v9m,"A card/board game I had about a year back, needs fleshing out.","Card/board game idea: a mix of Clue and Are You A Werewolf. Played like if the gang from Scooby-Doo was in The Shining.\n\nConcept: A murder(s) happen at a remote resort only accessible by boat/helicopter/snow bus and weather has delayed the arrival of the authorities. The killer has 48-72 hours to escape/dispose of the evidence, and the authority figure has that time to catch the killer and preserve the crime scene.\n\nPlayers are given cards at random that define their roles. Most will be innocent, while one (or two on special occasions) is a murderer/maniac/serial killer/etc., and another will be a detective/cop/security guard/etc.\n\nInnocents all get generic decks of action cards, while killers get special sabotage decks, and the authorities receive counter measure decks.\n\nCertain cards are played during your turns (so killers and authority have generic cards as well so both can maintain a cover) and a separate deck played at the end of a round.\n\nThe board is a simplified layout of the resort, with defining search times for each area. The border of the board is the countdown for when the ragtag investigation has to end and the actual authorities take over.\n\nThe game starts with the handing out of the roll cards, then everyone leaves the room (or cover their eyes), then one by one each player returns to the board to claim their personal deck. Each innocent has to do something and leave evidence/alibis that they were in a specific area of the map. The killer takes this time to hide their evidence/body in different locations across the resort.\n\nAlibis are character cards that can only be placed in a selection of places, and they confirm whether a player is innocent, but if a killer gets to them first no proof can be gathered.\n\nInvestigating any area takes the amount of time determined by the ""cost"" on the board, but if the killer is part of the group, they can foil your search and make them fail and/or take longer. An investigation works by one or more players declaring a search, then they put their investigation bonus cards (or sabotage cards in the case of any killer) and it fails or succeeds depending on total bonuses, so it's either progress with evidence or a waste of time.\n\nEvidence is collected, and eventually a vote must be made, which also takes time.\n\nThe innocent win if they detain the killer, and it's pretty obvious how the killer wins. Unless certain killers have special requirements between rounds. Like a serial killer that has to kill more people or has to leave a calling card. Or a cannibal who can only eat people so they keep bits of their kills hidden as leftovers for later, but the pieces can be found as evidence."

Thing is I don’t have know how to incorporate Zelda mechanics into an idea that still feels like Zelda but isn’t blatantly copying it. Any help?
l92kfh,Unfriended combined with The cutting Room floor,"I have this idea where you play as a game file dumper or whatever you call it The concept would go like this:\n\nYou are a big fan of this game it can be 3d 2d whatever but it kinda has to capture the feeling of Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, and maybe sonic if you're going 2d, the game you are a fan of doesn't matter too much. So you go through the game dumping files on forums and speaking with your friends via chat your main objectives for the first half are to find files and game history and dump it onto the forums you frequent with you chatting with your friends about your discoveries slowly though throughout the course of the game you find sprites that don't fit with the game strange hidden messages from seemingly the developers and your friends the more involved they get with this find strange people following them and weird messages from people you don't know are becoming more rampant. I think the game should be simple enough so the players can navigate it and find things to post about you start each day with a set amount of objectives like find out if this is real or dump sprite sheet like that. And slowly your friends get picked off by a group of mysterious people that you can save them from.\n\nEndings:\n\nI'm thinking there should be multiple endings like The good Ending you save all your friends from the mysterious people find out the secret of the game and dump most of the files you wanted to. Bad ending Most or all your friends die and you don't know the full secret. The neutral end is in between of course .and maybe a secret ending too if you get EVERYTHING.\n\nPretty complex I know while writing I really thought about how to simplify it without dumbing down the idea but I gave up :p."
l90m08,Multiplayer game engine,"I would absolutely love a game engine like Little Big Planet or Gmod but much more focused on actually making completely unique games. \n\nI know standard game engines are more efficient but ""physically"" making the games with friends is so cool and as far as I know hasn't been expanded on a lot."
l8zijt,"Folklore battle - Turn based, base battle","At the start of the game You can choose from one of these folklores:  \nIrish folklore  \nJapanese folklore  \nGerman Folklore  \nMexican folklore  \nFrench folklore  \nIndian folklore  \n\n\nOnce you pick this you will get a base. The base will include Ports for ever monster (will go more in depth later), Training bay, Medical wing. \n\nTraining bay - Lets you increases stats of monsters, get new skills, or enchase already existing skills.\n\nMedical wing - Lets you heal injured monsters, or give medical knowledge to monsters.\n\n**The Folklore you chosen can be changed.**\n\nEvery folklores base will look unique to its folklore. every folklore also comes with 5 Monsters. Each monster will have Unique minions that will go around with its certain Monster. Each monster has unique abilitys and powers that will help them with their battle\n\nIrish folklore Monsters - Fairy, Pooka, Leprechuns, Dullahan, Banshee  \nGerman folklore Monsters - Drude, Alp, Kobold, Bilwis, Changeling  \nJapanese folklore monsters - Kitsune, Tengu, Jorogumo, onryo  \nMexican folklore monsters -  Huay chivo, La llorona, Chaneque, Chupacabra,Quinametzin   \nFrench folklore monsters - Lutin, Ogre, Gargoyle, Melusina, Farfadets    \nIndian folklore monsters -  Timingila, nandi, Airavat, narasimha, garuda  \nGreek folklore monsters - chiron, Harpy, siren, Cyclops, chimera\n\n**The game revolves around ffa/2v2/4v4 games with each person having 1 base and 5 monsters wiith pve elements.**\n\nThe game will be tile based so your monsters will be on tiles. Each turn ever player can move 2 monsters, Change 1 monsters stance, use Monsters ability's. After every player is ready the monsters will do their actions (all at once). If 2 monsters on opposing sides clash on 1 tile they fight in a battle. who ever wins will get the tile and the monster who lost will be sent back to the base on a timer. while in the battle mode the 2 or more players battling will have the ability to choose powers to attack the opposing monsters. (looks like for the king type battle with 1 monster in the middle and 2 minion monsters on both sides. if there is a close monster it will join the battle instead of one of the minions.). \n\nTo win the game you have to attack the opponents base 3 times. But there will be pve monsters, other players, fog of war, and other stuff that will get in your way."
l8z699,You play as a pacifist who wakes up in a lab with an odd gun strapped to their hands.,"The gun is made of a material similar to mercury but it won't come off. The gun begins to talk to you, not out loud but in your head. It doesn't remember anything but it wants out. It suggests using itself to shoot the glass of your cell open. You wanting to get out as well, decide to go along with the plan.\n\nYou explain to the gun your personal philosophy, you aren't going to risk escape if it means killing other people, you're alright with incapacitating them in self defense though, the gun reluctantly agrees to your terms and the both of you begin your escape.\n\nYou start off with a shotgun type gun, you can shoot objects in the environment to incapacitate guards but you cannot shoot them directly otherwise it's a game over. The game is very physics based and many of the guns have knockback which you can use to launch yourself across the rooms or even into guards to knock them out.\n\nYou eventually gain the ability to transform your gun into new guns and gain upgrades such as a rocket launcher which has more knockback or piercing bullets. These have disadvantages as well however, as they make your guns potentially more deadly.\n\nGuards use futuristic stun guns with slow moving projectiles allowing you to use knockback to dodge bullets, as you come closer to escaping however, the guards will escalate their methods in order to stop you."
l8xf3h,"RPG that instead of having a huge open worlda map, you have a small space but you can move through time.","So actually an ""Open Time"" RPG where instead of having a huge map/world, you have a smaller space that you cannot leave, could be as small as a room or a building, or a space ship, or a small city like rapture. Then you can move freely back and forth in time and your actions would affect how the place involves in time. There would also be other time travelers who based on your actions might also affect the timeline so the past might also change without you knowing."
l8wyp6,Chi Saber,"VR game where soft music plays and the player follows smooth hand motions in the form of Tai Chi.    A perfect score is zero points.  Points are lost when the hands move too fast or too slow or oriented in the wrong direction.   \n\nAlternate modes could include weapons such as dao or two-handed weapons such as a spear, but still involve slow, steady motion."
l8vxn8,An RPG game where you don't play as the Party Leader.,"Essentially it's like a normal turn-based RPG, except you play as one of many party members the hero may come across on their journey.\n\nIn the overworld map, you can move freely on your own, but when you are in the hero's party, they take control. You can influence where they take you, through various dialogue options, however.\n\nSimilarly, in battle, you do not choose your actions when the hero is present, but you can influence their choice through dialogue. When the hero tells you an action, you are then able to control how you approach said task.\n\nSay the hero wants you to attack, you can choose what direction to attack from, and how strong the attack is. (Certain attacks may provide more options.)\n\nWhen the hero is not present and/or is unconscious during battle, you then have full control of your actions. Intentionally bringing harm to the hero, in order to have more control, may be a smart strategy, although I doubt the hero would appreciate it very much.\n\nIf you die at any point, you then play as a different party member. If the the hero dies, game over. If everyone is unconscious, game over.\n\nIf all party members die aside from the hero, you'd have to watch and hope they pull through to victory. Afterward, you'd play as another party member who's about to meet the hero.\n\nThis whole concept seems a bit confusing, but hopefully I described it well enough. What do you all think?"

l8sxvp,A survival horror game in Jurassic park.,"Something similar to alien isolation, but in Jurassic park. There are already so many different dinosaurs which would make excellent enemies. I also feel like the book canon would be much better for a horror game, since it is much scarier.\n\n* Raptors could behave similarly to the alien, stalking you. The book version is also completely psychotic.\n* T-rex can only see you if you move, so if you stay still, it will ignore you. The book version is also very intelligent and has a long tongue.\n* Dilophasaurus can spit at you. Maybe make it so it behaves like it does in the movie, all cute and innocent until it suddenly strikes you. The book version is also much larger.\n* Compies are weak, but they can swarm you. The book version is also venomous.\n* Carnotaurus can change colors like a chameleon."

l8ottp,Space Battle Royale,"A large space BR that can be played solo or with up to 6 people on a team. First map setting could be a large planet with lots of moons and asteroids orbiting it and a large debris field of capital ships lost in a battle. You wouldn't be able to land on the planet, but the moons, asteroids and ships are all accessible.\n\nEveryone starts off in their escape pods on a large capital ship that is heavily damaged and they deploy whenever they want before the capital ship makes it to the edge of the map. You can steer your escape pod for a finite amount of time and the quicker you land somewhere the better. Players can find weapons, armor, and equipment scattered throughout the map on outposts on the moons or in destroyed large ships. Players will have EVA suits and can use their propulsion packs to get around in space, but finding fighter ships is extremely crucial to winning the match. Fighter ships can vary from being small 1 person fliers to 6 person cruisers that need team cooperation to operate (I.E. someone piloting, 2-3 running the guns, 1 fixing various parts of the ship, 1 using the command console to navigate and use special abilities like navigation jamming/missiles/ shields/ etc. Teams have to loot for supplies/ammo/fuel/etc for their ships. If someone dies and you get to their body, you can transport them to an aid station that could be on a moon or a space station and revive them once per match.\n\nI haven't figured out what the blue or closing circle would be.. thoughts were initially like a solar storm or maybe a space fleet closing in...\n\nFeel free to add all your ideas. This is just a game idea off the top of my head. It would be cool to see any kind of Space BR that requires teamwork to fly a ship."
l8obo0,Hivemind,"The Concept for this Idea is full throttle Teamwork while under pressure... The pressure of Bullets Whizzing by, this game is a First person Action platformer you have a Team consisted of 2-6 players in which each player plays as a Humanoid Robot, Customized to their liking in the Menu, when the game starts the team of 2-6 has to get through a level chock fully of Obstacles, Puzzles and Heavily armed enemies, The catch? if one player dies the Whole team dies The Team of Machines has a Variety of Classes and Abilities, Being The Engineer, The Brute, The Specter and The Joker each individual Class plays a Role in each level though some Obstacles change depending on the player count, Some Obstacles such as a Shoddy brick wall will need a Good punch, Anyone can Break these but they need way more punches than of a Brute as the Brute can Break down walls with a single punch and push Objects faster, Though they are slower and have more health In some Areas You can Distract Enemies as a Joker by Placing down Holograms of yourself that Run in the Direction of the Enemies shooting at you, However like with the brute Anyone can Distract an Enemy in many ways such as throwing small items, whistling and Simply grabbing their attention by running out The Specter However is for purely Convenience as they can Float around the area while invisible to Mark enemy locations and the Locations of Powerups to support your team, The Engineer however is The medic of this game, Having a Needle gun to heal your teammates from afar or A palm-based Healing Device that heals far more than the Needle gun but trades off that you need to be very close.\n\nTLDR: A Puzzle game that heavily utilizes Teamwork but everyone can do anything but using Specialized characters do these things faster"
l8lahs,"A game with branching storylines but all the choices are ""hidden"".",So usually you make choices in games and while it's not always clear what the consequences are you always are aware when making a choice through dialogue options.   \n\n\nI had an idea where there is a game where all the choices are hidden inside completely mundane and subconscious things so you never know when something could be important.   \n\n\nFor example a cutscene starts and depending on what weapon you have equipped at that point the cutscene could play out completely different and have huge consequences. Or if you do a mission wearing certain clothes it leads to different outcomes or during certain weather.   \n\n\nIt would be cool to always be surprised by the consequences of your subconscious choices and would make it unpredictable yet at the same time more personal and individual.

l8gc5g,Shock trooper,"I am an avid writer but am absolutely horrible at implementing ideas and wanted to share this one with the good people of Reddit to see if anyone wants to make this a reality or just discuss it. Shock trooper is a game about a soldier sent out in the middle of nowhere in the fictional country of Cen a forest filled war-torn place he was supposed to be heading back to a camp but his helicopter crashes and is now stuck with the only weapon left being his heavy-duty tazer gun that can shoot multiple times and does a fair amount of damage but has a pretty abysmal battery life I also think it should be solar charged so it can slowly refill energy. Now that he is stuck here he thinks his only worries are enemy soldiers but soon finds that there is some sort of strange mutant creatures living in the forest that are very strong but have one fatal weakness you guessed it electricity you gain a lot of weapons throughout the game but your tazer is your workhorse that stuns regular enemies but does massive damage against the mutants slowly you gain a lot of gear and try and figure out why these mutants are here but when you are getting close to finding some clues you are attacked by a large creature dubbed The Stalker by the natives I'm thinking this is like a terminator thing with the monster coming at you, again and again, you slowly witling it down until its final form as the boss kinda like how resident evils bosses work. The final fight of the game has you in a helicopter fighting The Stalker with your Gatling guns with a big meter on top charging up your hellfire missle you have to survive it long enough to shoot it. This is kinda like predator combined with Resident Evil I know but I really like this idea and have a lot more but this is just one I think of every time I listen to specific music for some reason"

l8esuv,Multi-character RPG,"What if there was a game in which you could play as three or so different characters who all follow the same story with minor deviation. Seems pretty generic right? But what if this was done in a way that actually sustains main characters with MASSIVE personality differences which, while not majorly effecting the general plot, grants a totally different set of dialogue.\n\nFor example, let’s say we have three characters: Lewis, Mary, and Alex. The plot centers around a galactic rebellion.\n\nLewis could join the rebels because he wants to fight against evil. Mary could join because she wants to save a loved one from imprisonment. Alex joins because he has been betrayed by the empire and seeks morally-neutral justice.\n\nAt some point, these characters would crash land on a planet. The survivors of the crash are then kidnapped by bandits and it’s up to the player to get them back.\nLewis would get knocked out underneath some rubble and would therefore be missed, commenting about how he needs to save the others. Mary would hide and spend the night by the ship until she realizes that she needs the others to have a chance at survival/escape. Alex would be left behind, having been seemingly mortally wounded, but pulls though and immediately recognizes he needs the others (knowing that getting them back may involve disposing of some lawless scum).\n\nThe downside to this idea is that you have to come up with an extremely fitting story, one that consistently drives these diverse characters all in the same direction. I think it would be really cool though if someone could pull it off successfully."
l8con0,An online multiplayer stealth game,"I've had an idea for a game called SpyGuard and I'd like to hear your guys opinions on it. There are two teams: 3 Spys and 7 Guards. Both teams have different abilities and objectives. Guards must kill all the Spys before they complete all their tasks or can just wait out the time to win. Spys are assigned special tasks such as stealing or breaking something. Some will even require you to stay in a certain area for a set amount of time or maybe even knock out a guard and use their fingerprint on a scanner to open a door. Guards are given a variety of tools such as guns and explosives to eliminate the Spys. Spys are given many abilities such as going invisible, transforming into props, messing with electronics and much more to keep guards of their tracks. Messing with electronics could do things such as set off alarms in other places to trick guards or slow the power making all Guard Tech weaker or slower. Each Spy is given 3 lives and Guards are given unlimited lives. If you're a Spy you can easily take out guards if you use your sneaky abilities to get upto a guard and take them down. If you are real sneaky you can even pickpocket guards. Once all Spy tasks are completed a warning will be sent out to all Guards that the Spys are escaping. During this time the Spys must run to the exit and the Guards have to kill them before they get out. And before you ask, no this is not inspired by Among Us. I thought of this before that game even existed. Sorry for the huge word chunk."
l899a8,Sonic Riders 4 Ever,"A new Sonic Riders game where you play through the story as your custom character (Like forces except you play as your character the whole story) There would be an open over world where you can ride around practicing tricks. It would also be filled with NPC's that will give you missions and side quests. Completing side quests would reward you with rings, Avatar Parts and Gear Parts. Gear parts can be applied to your Extreme Gear to give it stat boosts and sometimes even new passive abilities. The game would only have 6 different extreme gear, one for each type (Board, Air Ride, Skate, Bike, Wheel and Yacht) I did this since the players can already change the abilities and appearance of their gear with Gear Parts. I would add the Air System from the first game because it was such a unique mechanic, it would work exactly like it did in the first game. Also Im not really a fan of the Gravity Drift from the 2nd game. I know alot of people like it but I really just prefer the classic drift so I'd add that. Lastly NO KINECT LIKE SONIC FREE RIDERS THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON THAT GAME MESSED UP."

I'd like the game to be easy to learn, hard to master. Run, jump, shoot, swing weapon/shield, alt-attack and switch equipment forward/back for each hand and that's it. There will probably be weapon and stat upgrades between levels but I don't want to interrupt the flow of levels with inventory management, levelups etc and there will only be 3 weapons and 3 shields total so all equipment is only ever 1 click away.\n\nGraphically it'll be pretty low poly to make things easier to develop, probably somewhere between PS1 and PS2. \n\nSetting, story, gameplay mechanics, types of blade, gun, shield etc haven't been decided yet. Any ideas?"

l7p8q8,"MMORPG where instead leveling stats, you change physic size","Very old idea of mine that came from my early vanilla WoW days - when gankers made me hated starting out - what if the high level players can't revisit low level areas?\n\nFrom there came the idea of an MMORPG where you grow in size as you 'level' up, where you're able to reach places you couldn't when small, but also unable to get into smaller places, and small players could even climb on you to gain access to places that you can't get into but they can't reach.\n\nThere's a natural element of larger players being 'tanks', but with different sizes come the opportunity of tanks at different sizes - I think if the size mechanic is adapted to have varieties, it could be quite cool.\n\nIn my own concept of this game, the world would be set on tectonic plates that move so that the world changes over time, but that concept can be a game concept in itself."

With the ability to build a town hall that would unlock a form of leadership, with laws taxes or whatever policies you could enact based on your population and government type.(such as if you develop feudalism or stick with a voted upon leader. That kinda thing) possibly you could make guilds, houses, or even entire kingdoms and nations. Of course, you could add a threat to the game that would cause enough people to band together such as violence between players, but I find that perhaps struggles such as managing food, clothing, trading, gathering luxury resources, building materials, seasons changing, wild animals, bandits?, and others possibly, may cause people to actually work together. I've just grown tired of seeing games that are all about fighting each other, when i thing if people banded together they could create beautiful towns and kingdoms that would stand to show what we are capable of. please add on and criticize this because I want it to be hammered out into something someone would make."

l6pboe,Space 4x game set in a hexagon grid with less empasis on micromanagement.,"**Gameplay:** The galaxy in this game is a large hexagon grid.Galaxy can be about 250 to 2000 hexagons.A single hexagon can be a star system with a lot of planets,a black hole or simply empty space.This means that you can control and rule entire star systems with way less micromanagement than your usual space 4x, as most things you can build in the star hexagon applies to all the planets in the star system(For example: Building a Orbital Habitation Swarm in a star system increases the population capacity, interstellar migration, local productivity and tax income of that system).You can build patrol stations and trade hubs in interstellar space to strengthen your border security, combat piracy  and improve interstellar trade.\n\n**Races:** While the alien empires in this game are procedurally generated with their own culture and way of governance, they are all descendants of one of the three precursor races: The insectoid Nxy, silicone based Morax and carbon based Humanity."
l6p6jm,Urban Champion: REBOOT,"A reboot of Urban Champion would be great! The game can be a fluidly animated beat-em-up, the story being that the main character wants to topple down the current **Urban Champion** as they are using their status for corrupt gain (urban champions are highly respected defenders of neighborhoods who often get special treatment from community businesses as a result). The game itself could be similar to **Scott Pilgrim** or **River City Girls** in terms of structure. The bosses themelves could be references to NES titles (The skating shouter referencing ""Clu Clu Land"" or a cousin of the star-faced wrestler dude from ""Pro Wrestling"")."

l6mdxb,I need your help,"So I've always wanted to make a 2D platformer because those are the kind of games that I tend to play the most. Hollow Knight, Celeste, Guacamelee 2, etc. \n\nWhen I started before, I have a clear direction of what I wanted to do but I am going through a separation with my wife of 10+ years and now I'm lost. I still wanted to make the game but with my current emotional status, I prefer to make a game that best reflects what I feel right now.\n\nI just find it hard to translate these emotions/situation into game mechanics for a platformer.  My vision for the game is to have the MC be overcoming platforming obstacles to get to his goal (his partner). it will be a precision platformer and I'd like to make the environment to be the same city where i live.\n\nWhat kind of mechanics do you suggest?  For example, i am thinking if i want to portray a suffocating environment, it can be in the sewers but that's just the setting, i'm at a loss for now at the mechanics. like aside from it being in a sewer, what mechanics can i use to portray the MC is getting suffocated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nappreciate all your ideas."
l6m17b,A game that uses popularity as a tangible weapon.,A game that has two modes. One where you have to try and be as popular as possible online and another where the popularity can be used as a weapon and the more popular you become the bigger your weapon will be and the more powerful it will be. I think this could be both a deep and surface level game. The deep one maybe starting off with you and a couple of your friends having to try and survive with tiny daggers but a big well known celebrity comes along and makes you popular. But that leads to internal conflict and many problems arise from the fact that you are now popular.\n\nOr it could be a simple game like pewdiepie simulator except with some fighting instead of decorations.
l6iuqs,A Godzilla/Kaiju inspired action adventure RPG,"Kaiju games are something I’ve always enjoyed(Even the bad ones) however I feel that there is, and can be more to a giant monster game then an arena fighter.\n\nThere are a few games who’s individual mechanics are something I can see made into a solid experience if meshed together effectively. Games such as Prototype, War of the Monsters, Maneater, Spore, and even Evolve to an extent influenced a lot of these vague ideas I’ve got.\n\nSo imagine a Kaiju game in which there isn’t a specific region or area, but something rather global. Immense cities in different countries, numerous islands, hollow earth, etc. Character creation could be centered around picking a silhouette and adding characteristics to really customize your own kaiju. You could give them a base trait that not only dictates where you start the game, but how you traverse as well. A kaju who gets around through burrowing, one that gets around through flight, and like most Kaiju, one that gets around by swimming through the ocean.\n\nAs you survive, explore, and combat both man and other Kaiju, you not only grow in size or evolve characteristics, but you also gain more abilities. Builds wouldn’t be dictated by stat numbers and percentages, but rather evolutionary traits and powers, size, mobility, and reputation.\n\nYou’d start the game off as a smaller Kaiju. You can still be dangerous, but you can also be easily defeated in the right situation. You have a few options to evolve and grow your character: You can decide that you would want to evolve by taking energy directly from cities.(Think “Godzilla is approaching the generator”) but fully expanded upon with layers of depth. As you destroy a city and evolve by taking in their energy(Power plants, factories, radiation) you also gain a threat level. Not GTA stars that come and go, but a actual threat level that dictates how this city, or cities at large respond to you. Based on your specific Kaiju build, after enough time these areas find ways to combat you, exploiting your weaknesses, learning your patterns, developing weapons to combat your strengths, ability to track/anticipate you, etc. The more you visit a city(As each city will be more prominent in one resource over another) you not only get more of that resource, but it becomes increasingly hard, and that cities technology developes faster. You can think of this as the villain route.\n\nAnother avenue would be finding and killing other Kaiju, you could even do so in a way that protects cities or humanity at large. This could be the hero route. As you fight and kill other destructive Kaiju, you’re able to have an array of evolutionary traits and abilities at your disposal. However, this makes you a direct target to other Kaiju, and even boss-like monsters who may track you down for all the precious power you possess.\n\nYou could even manage some form of neutral stance. Killing kaiju who target humanity, and taking out cities/military that become too powerful. I like the idea that the world functions even outside of you, and other Kaiju roam and effect the world just as you can. You could for instance; come across a devastated area, or a giant corpse in which a specific Kaiju has caused. By interacting with these enough you can “Monster Hunter” style track down this Kaiju and you won’t know who they are or what they possess until you meet them.\n\nCities that have faced enough Kaiju and collateral damage(Gaining maximum defense/offense) could develop mechs more powerful then even some of the toughest Kaiju. A city at this level will have knowledge, preparations, a diverse and advanced military, traps, and a multitude of powerful mechs they can use all at will on a big enough threat.\n\nYou could also have legendary Kaiju, ultra bosses that will take both a lot of skill, knowledge, and a evolved enough build just to stand a chance against. Killing these could further your build possibilities. Advanced enough Kaiju can even call in others that have decide to join them to avoid death themselves.\n\nYou could have allies, arch enemies, and even a Souls-like mechanic where you invade someone else’s world to either kill, or help them(whether that be destroying, hunting Kaiju, or defending an area).\n\nAnyhow, that’s really where my thoughts kind of end."

l6cx9k,Stronghold WW1 clone,"There is plenty of WW2 RTS games, but battlefield-level (as opposed to grand strategies) strategy games really struggle to depict WW1 trench warfare, because trench warfare was so incredibly static and reliant on artillery.\n\nThen I thought - wait a second! Medieval sieges were also very static and reliant on artillery!\n\nSo here's the idea, WW1 reskin of the classic games Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader (with some elements from Dawn of War). Instead of building walls, you build trenches around your base. Instead of villagers, you have conscripts, who are sent to your base depending not on happiness, but on your military victories, as in amount of Strategic Points (which are key areas strewn around the map) that you control. Unlike Stronghold, you can actually select, control and move Conscripts and use them in combat, though they are the weakest units. Economy is simplifed and is based around Strategic Points giving you Requisition, like in the Dawn of War series - maybe with extra resources of Food (acquired by looting Farms that you find on the map), Fuel and Ammo.  Food would be the most detailed, with different kinds of food in rations providing a morale boost just like in Stronghold. You can use Requisition to dig trenches (with the same click-and-drag interface  from Stronghold), promote conscripts to specialists (infantry, cavalry, tank crews, engineers, field medics, stormtroopers, snipers), or build machines, cannons and tanks - and make structures, like Machine Garage, Artillery Tent, Radio Tower that lets you call in airtstrikes, or Field Hospital. Basically, Requisition replaces money.\n\nInstead of lobbing dead cows over walls that splatter into cloud of plague, your artillery lobs mustard gas shells into the trenches. Instead of Assassins climbing the walls as seen in Crusader, Stormtroopers can climb trench walls. Instead of Lord being the key unit that needs to be killed to win the game, each side has a General. Instead of villager happiness there's Morale, still based on entertainment and food rations, that decides how quick your troops will run away when overpowered (there's a similar mechanic in an old game American Conquest, where under fire your troops will lose faith, and run away not allowing you to control them for a while).\n\nSimilarly to Stronghold and Crusader, there'd be a freeform skirmish mode against AI or in multiplayer, but also a Historical Battle mode that well, recreates historical battles from WW1 (for example, Attack of the Dead Men would be played as Russians, and your side would start already covered in gas clouds, constantly damaging your units). Also a historical campaign that tells the whole story of the war, one for Entente and one for Central Powers."
l6bnaz,Any comedic dialogue heavy game like Conker,"I just want a comedic game with a ton of witty dialogue and absurd scenarios like Conker’s Bad Fur Day or Armed &amp; Dangerous. This can range from shooters, platformers, adventure games, and I guess technically point and click."
l69nx2,A game about being all the parts of the crew of an AC-130 on a mission,"Imagine a game similar to the Star Trek Bridge Crew.\n\nYou and 5 teammates play the mission crew of an AC-130 on a mission in enemy territory.\n\nSlots to play:\n\n**Pilot:**   \nJob - Flies the plane. Must alert navigator of potential issues and maintain level flight for operational efficiency. Must also follow route and maintain time-table of mission. Must also stay alert of potential firing onto the aircraft and deploy flares when necessary.\n\nToo steep of a roll angle, lose altitude due to lack of lift. Too shallow, guns are not able to go low enough to fire on the targets.  \nKeep an eye of where you are. Weather can be a factor. Clouds will block the camera views. Low cloud ceilings will require lower altitude. Meaning, you will need to make sure you are going slow enough that the target isn't immediately out of range. \n\nPilot must monitor various systems. Fuel levels, ability to operate aircraft. Switch fuel tanks as they empty, adjust speed and power as weight is diminished during the length of the mission, and other factors.\n\nCockpit has a view of the local area, WITHOUT AIRSPACE BOUNDARIES. Navigator must mark points\n\nFiring of aircraft guns shakes aircraft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overlord:**   \nIs Commander's video view. Satellite view, straight down view. NOT BLOCKED BY CLOUDS. Has information of mission objectives. Information of target buildings, No-Fire structures, and other important information of mission directive.\n\nJob - Give information to AC-130 Gunners, Camera Operator, and Navigator; specifically camera operator. Use landmarks in the area to help give information and frames of reference through voice chat.\n\nView is of Operational area boundaries on screen 1, mission directives on screen 2. Mission directives have timestamps and desired flight path for mission effectiveness. Operational Area can be zoomed in, has a day &amp; night satellite view reference images. \n\nHas a video feed of the operation, on a 5 second delay. Switching between still images &amp; satellite video feed takes 1 second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Camera Operator:**  \nIs a camera operator within the aircraft. Has a view from the aircraft. View is distorted by angle of aircraft over the area. Large buildings will block view behind it if angle is not good. Will need direction from Overlord. Camera operator takes information and frame of references from Overlord and marks it on the map. These marks are seen by Gunners ONLY.\n\nView of Camera Operators is of the entire area from the angle of the aircraft. WIDER than the fire area of the gunner. \n\nCamera Operator can place 3 way-points at a time. Can clear them all, automatically clear themselves.\[Place 1,2,3...4{1 disappears}, 5{2 disappears}, etc..\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gunner - 1:**  \nOperates 1, 25mm &amp;  the 105mm guns. Guns use have cameras from the perspective of the end of the barrel of the gun. View is zoomed in at a fixed level, cannot be adjusted. Takes directive from the Camera Operator and Overlord. The maximum range of the camera is the maximum usable area of the weapon. Switching between weapons takes 0.5 seconds.\n\nView uses cross-hair in center of the camera to show point of impact.  \nGunner has own voice line ONLY THEY HEAR giving information on when the gun is loaded. No other player hears this voice line.  \nGun can jam. 3% chance after each shot to jam. Chance of jamming is independent across guns, potential to jam does NOT compound. If gun jams, gun is not available for 20 secs.\n\nGun DOES NOT have an indicator of how far to lead the shot. Leading of shots determined by range\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gunner - 2:**\n\nOperates 1, 25mm &amp; the 45mm gun. Gun uses a camera from the perspective of the end of the barrel of the gun.

Leading of shot determined by range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Navigator:**\n\nSends information from Overlord to Pilot. If the Pilot turns too early and the gunners complain about the targets now being out of range, the Navigator relays the message to the Pilot.\n\nNavigator uses the same camera feed as the Camera Operator.   \nNavigator can hear the audio from Overlord, Camera Operator, and Gunners, **BUT CANNOT TALK TO ALL OF THEM!** Navigator can **ONLY** talk to the Pilot and Camera Operator.\n\nNavigator can see the ""cone-of-vision"" of the guns. Cone of vision is based on angle of the plane  \nNavigator can give marks on the map that **ONLY** the Camera Operator and Pilot can see.\n\nNavigator has a view of entire local geographical area (LGA). Can place way-points in front of the plane for the pilot to fly towards. ONLY 1 WAY-POINT AT A TIME.  \nLGA View is different from Camera Operator view. View looks like a radar scope for Air Traffic Control. Can see boundaries of operating area (area delegated for operation of mission directives, blocked out by Air Traffic Control. Leaving Area is VERY BAD.)  \nPilot CANNOT see the boundary of the flight area. They just see what is around them.\n\nNavigator has a timeline of the operations. Keynote points of the operation and specific timestamps of when they should be done and where the plane should be at that specific time. Overlord has specific information on the operation. (Overlord: ""The firing area needs to be facing East to west due to the contour of the mountain we are flying over. We need to follow the time-table."" Navigator: ""Understood. Pilot, decrease speed and take as wide of an angle as you can. I'll mark the edge of the Airspace."")\n\n=================\n\nCOMM CHANNELS\n\nFlight Operations- Pilot, Navigator\n\nMission Implementation- Overlord, Camera Operator, Gunner -1, Gunner -2, Navigator\[Listen Only\]\n\nCamera Direction - Camera Operator, Navigator\n\nFire Team 1- Gunner -1, Loader 1\[Automated voice line\]\n\nFire Team 2- Gunner -2, Loader 2\[Automated voice line\]  \n\--------------------------------------\n\nVIDEO CHANNELS\n\nOutside world - Pilot\[See Only, cockpit view\], Navigator\[Place Way-points, show up on Cockpit Area View of Pilot\]\n\nSatellite View - Overlord\n\nPlane Camera View - Camera Operator\[Controller\], Navigator\[Video Feed Only\]\n\n25mm #1 - Gunner -1\n\n105mm - Gunner -1\n\n25mm #2- Gunner -2\n\n45mm - Gunner -2\n\nLocal Geographical Area and Airspace - Navigator\n\n=========================\n\nFollowing a mission, a grade is given to the crew on how they did on the mission.

l591k5,Historically accurate games,"So, an idea popped into my head that I think could be pretty good if handled well. It revolves around making a game or games that are historically accurate to their time period, where you play the events of an actual person's life, whether they served in a war, or maybe were just an interesting figure with an odd life story. Unfortunately, I can see that the one main drawback of this would be making the game fun, enjoyable, and engaging for the player, while still remaining accurate to the events. So, I think a project like this will remain a dream for now.  Also, even if I did try and make something like this, I have zero game making knowledge, so it wouldn't work out."
l58xh9,Malware simulator,"Basically, you know there's plague Inc and bio Inc, well here's another idea; it doesn't have a name yet but I've been calling it Malware Inc\n\nThe premise is simple, pick a type of malware, use your money to help it adapt and grow and complete a certain amount of tasks,\n\nI can imagine the basic types, Worms, Viruses, Spyware, Trojan and ransomware special types could be something like a rogue AI\n\nTo win the game you must complete items on a checklist, The way the game progresses would be based on the difficulty, Casual would have only 3 items required off the checklist, normal W would be 5, brutal would be 8 and mega brutal would be the entire checklist\n\nThere would be stats including spread likelihood, noise and destructive potential,\nSpread likelihood is self-explanatory, how well it can spread, noise is how likely it is for an antivirus to notice it, it would behave very much like corruption in rebel Inc, destructive potential consists of chance of destroying computers and stealing information \n\nThere might be alternatives based on the origin for instance it could be a hacktivist weapon or digital warfare or just malicious intent.\n\nI'd make this game myself but, I'm a little busy with another ambitious game project. Anyways I wanted to throw this out into the internet before I forget it."
l58vkb,You remember zombie farm?,Honestly I've been searching the internet to see if the servers for zombie farm 1/2 are still up and from what I've heard they aren't but I'm not sure cause its hard to find info about the games. \n\nWhat I think someone should do is make a zombie farm like game because I've been searching thoroughly but found nothing similar. \n\nOf course it doesn't need to be zombies or a farm it could be like robots in a factory being made or something like that. \n\nI want the attacking system to be kinda similar but maybe give your troops active abilities you can activate or maybe do a Pokemon go type of battle system where when you fight another player by tapping and to use your special attack you have to collect the type symbol to improve your attack power for the special attack\n\nI also think that a type advantages/disadvantages system kinda like pokemon could make it interesting\n\nAnother idea is that instead of having to buy brand new zombies after they have died you could revive your upgraded zombies either by waiting or some sort of in game free currency\n\nAnd although this next idea isn't much of a fan favorite. A gacha system could theoretical be implemented and give seeds for unique zombie breeds that are only slightly better then normal zombies. Or maybe it would allow you to unlock the zombie type so you can grow multiple of the zombie you got and if you get  dupes it powers up  the zombie you got a dupe of.\n\nAlso the money system from zombie farm was good so I don't think too much changes are needed but you could always have some sort of side mini games to increase the speed of growing crops or just do side minigames to give a little more money while you wait for the crops to grow.\n\nOf course I'm not a game developer nor do I know anything about making games or making a game fun. However I remember always liking zombie farm as a kid and I just want to be able to play it again in some sort of way even if its not exactly the same. I have android and no longer have a tablet like how I used to play the game.

l54ie6,Joint mobile game Ideas,"Might I ask that I get credit for the idea if you make this.\n\nThese ideas are kinda similar in the fact that they both involve one person killing the other in real life (not actually killing). You can track location to find the person.\n\n1: Mission Mobile (can change)\nMission mobile is where you (and everyone else) is a spy. Your goal is to accept the mission to kill the person, physically go to their location, and find them than walk up and fake kill them. They will get notifications when you are near (can cause a chase) but you can get a power up to delay the notification. You also have to watch for notifications and people trying to kill you. Most likely there will be a 48 hour waiting period to get to play again. There will also be banning if the person is to not say they were killed on the app. \n\n2: the hunt. \n\nBasically the same thing but not with spys. There can also be a thing where it is hunters become the hunted. (Where someone who chooses to kill you, you will be able to defend against them.\n\nThere will also be more points/coins the higher the level and farther away they are. It only allows people in your country."
l51rfi,A satirical adventure where you play as a Beta tester for an unfinished fantasy game.,"Similair to the Stanley Parable, you 'playtest' a game narrated by the lead developer. The game starts off with an over-the-top lore explaination video. However, as the game starts you notice that there are a lot of bugs, bad writing and mechanics so broken that they essentially became new mechanics of their own.\n\nThere are side-quests with awfull voice acting, obnoxious tasks or just the worst rewards imaginable. Items don't behave like they're suposed to. For example: you eat steal swords to gain health or throw chicken drumsticks as molotov cocktails.\n\nYou can go on and on with this idea. It's pretty much Tommy Wiseau's Dragon Age."
ln0kxq,Rhythm Games combined with Turn Based Battles.,"So, whenever you enter a fight, you start your turn by selecting one of the four ""attacks"" you have. Each attack has a small dance dance revolution minigame that lasts between 5 to 10 seconds. The difficulty of the minigame is based on how strong the attack is. After you finish, the effectiveness of the move is based of off how well you did. The more notes you hit, the better. Some attacks do damage, others do healing, buffs, debuffs, etc.\n\nAfter your turn, the enemy takes their turn. They give you another DDR minigame, which will usually be more difficult than your attacks. The more notes you hit, the less damage you take. \n\nEvery time you beat a new enemy, you get a new attack added to your arsenal. You can only equip 4 of them at a time, though.\n\nThere probably wouldn't be a big world, but single levels all connected in a hub world. There would be specific bosses you'd need to beat to advance the story.\n\nThere could also be mechanics such as different types of music dealing super effective/ less effective damage against certain enemies."
ln0g4t,A hybrid of visual novel and action hack and slash game?,"The gameplay is a simplistic soulslike: You can attack, avoid, guard, and deflect based around a constantly regenerating stamina bar. By attacking enemies with their own guard raised and deflecting their attacks, you can drain their stamina to leave them vulnerable until it regenerates once depleted.\n\nThe game world is divided into multiple parallel routes where you have to get to the end while collecting various things to upgrade your character such as different types of weapons that are better at ranged combat, stamina damage, crowd control, or having a faster recovery between attacks, along with active-use abilities that deal greater damage with modifiers, stamina and hp upgrades, and equipment that endow passive effects.\n\nBetween routes are ""Story junctions"" where depending on what you say and do to certain people can change your objectives and lead you down a different route. Depending on the route you take, you will accumulate different collectables and have different experiences.\n\nThe ending largely depends on your final route and your interactions between NPCs and some junctions might be affected by your actions in previous routes.\n\nAny thoughts?"
ln0bgn,Codename: Jumpman,"I originally created this idea while predicting nintendo’s lineup for 2021, but the more i though about it i had many more ideas, until it became a full game in my mind. \n\n     Codename: Jumpman is a 3D take on the arcade donkey kong games. The player controls mario (or others in multiplayer) and plays different vertical platforming stages, with the main objective being to get to the top of the level and fight donkey kong. Mario has the same move-set and physics as in mario odyssey, as a way to keep development easier. The only exception to his is cappy, who does not appear. All stages are vertical, as if your climbing a building like in donkey kong. Levels are completely linear with few branching paths. The length of stages is longer than a level in mario 3d land/world, being a little under double the length of a level in those games. Because of this, the game features a little over half of the stages in a linear 3d mario game. Each stage ends with a fight against donkey kong, though it is different with each stage. For instance, in a water level, donkey kong would be dressed as a pirate and use cannons and other pirate related weapons. The game would also be much more difficult than a standard mario game, being much faster as well as very tight jumps, as if you were jumping from guard rail to guard rail on a construction cite.\n\n         The games tone and style is very different to a normal mario game, being based on action movies of all types and eras. This is even reinforced in the title, which implies that mario is known under the alias jumpman. This theme would also be prevalent in the opening cutscene, with mayor pauline (from the original donkey kong and mario odyssey) would say to an advisor “get me jumpman” and then mario would walk through the door in slow motion, wearing a suit and sunglasses while james bond-ish music plays. Many stages also pay homage to action movies, either being based on specific movie (like a rush hour level, a matrix lever or a die hard level) or being based on generic action movie set pieces (like a casino level, oil rig level or a warehouse level). Not all stages would be based on action movies, would other ideas i had being a flooding lighthouse, a factory making bomb ombs and mechakoopas, and an abandoned office building. \n\n\n        Donkey Kong attacks from above, like in the original game, throwing barrels along with many other both generic and stage specific attacks. Standard mario enemies like goombas and koopas also appear, but very rarely. Despite attacks from donkey kong and mario enemies, the main challenge comes from with level design, with tight jumps and small, moving platforms being abundant. \n\n         Most mario items appear alongside coins. The hammer from the original donkey kong also appears, and instead of working like it did in the original game. It gives mario a very powerful sword like weapon until it breaks from too much use. The only new power up is the buffshroom, turning mario into muscular action movie stars. The character designs could be based off different action movie actors, for instance mario could be based on arnold schwwarzenegger, and luigi could be based on the rock.\n\n       Codename: Jumpan would attack a more adult crowd than a normal mario game due to it’s higher difficulty and action movie motif. The would also be very good for speedrunning, with a mode specifically for it. The game would also have local and online four player multiplayer, with mario, luigi and two other characters being playable"
lmxxue,Yandere Simulator but you're a noble trying to marry the Kingdom's Prince/ess to become a King/Queen,"Your character isn't in love (at least initally), they just want power. Every week a new potential suitor from a faraway land (with different strengths and weaknesses) will try to court the Prince or Princess and you have to sabotage their attempts.\n\nEndings vary depending how you did this. If your character used mostly peaceful or more strategic methods, they end up being a fair &amp; just ruler. But if you played dirty or even ended up committing murder/treason, your character ends up becoming a cruel dictator. Alternative endings may be possible depending on your actions. (For example, if you learn &amp; harness dark magic to dispose of every single one of your rivals, your character may end up being a cult leader who sacrifices the entire kingdom to an evil Eldritch god. Or if you go Robin Hood on all your rivals, you end up leading a revolution against monarchy and overthrow the kingdom. If you dueled all your rivals &amp; won, you're asked to sign on as a Knight and get sent off to war. Just some ideas)"
lmwxsl,Gathering Hack n Slash/ARPG ideas (everything),Hello I am gathering EVERY SINGLE PIECE of idea related to hack n slash. Even if it is a single sentence describing an idea that crossed your mind !\n\nThanks I hope i'll read so good ideas \^\^ \n\n:)
lmwc7c,"Crystallized, a platformer with story","This is a simple progression for a game idea I have been having after a friend suggested that\n“What about a game where you have a parasite”\nWhich caused me to brainstorm and create this out of my own free will and useless time\n\nTHIS IS MORE OF A STORY BASIS AND NOT MECHANICS\n\nPrototype Act 1.\n“Break Free”\nA average woman is at her office job as she was typing away on the computer, suddenly a sharp pain shoots through her body, red crystals that appeared to be made of blood appeared on her body, a couple on her wrist, more on her shoulder, one even replacing her eye as it covered it making it harder to see, syrens blared as the windows locked with automatic systems\n\n“INFECTION DETECTED, EXTERMINATION PROTOCAL ACTIVATED”\n\nThe woman looked up at the speaker as the pain subsided\n“Infection…. what..?”\nThey say to themselves as vents closed in the office\n\n???:\n“What are you waiting for! Make a run for it! You don’t want to be killed now do you?!” \n\nThey hear a mysterious voice inside their head as vision to their eye now made of crystals returned\n\n“Hold on who are you! And why should I listen.”\nShe said reasoning with a unknown voice\n\n???:\n“I can fill you in later, all you need to know is that I already know everything about you, Stella. Now get moving or we are both gonna be dead in a few minutes!”\n\nStella was a little shocked as the stood up with a stagger, and started heading to the door, as a noxious gas started filling the entire office complex\n\n{this is when the main mechanic of the game is introduced, time limits, you have a fixed time to complete a part of the game, and if failed you have to start over, and can gain more time by doing certain objectives}\n\n*after the voice tells you how to move, jump, special mechanics and such to avoid the now dangerous office, traps and obstacles littered everywhere to stop you from escaping, to add more time to your timer you would grab emergency oxygen tanks from people that died trying to escape, and some unknown people that seemed to be the ones that set the traps up*\n\nHalfway through you get a checkpoint and a brief conversation happens\nStella: \n“Who are you anyway, are you just a voice in my head?”\n\n???: \n“Im just you conscious, I’m that light voice in you head telling you what to do and avoid. And I’m saying that you shouldn’t die here”\n\nStella:\n“Fair, and I should be standing around for too long-“\n\n*during the halfway period, you eventually gain the ability for slashing and dashing, a crystal extending from right above there elbow, extending slightly pass the hand, it’s one side is razor sharp*\n\n{each level of the building is a level of the game, as you start at floor 50 or 25 working your way down}\n\n{At the first floor in the grand lobby}\n\nYou almost exited the building as someone in a ballistics vest and other bullet proof clothing stops you, they wear sun glasses and a gas mask to help to they can breathe in the toxic air of the office\n\nBallistics guy:\n“So your the one that set off the infection alarm, I must admit, I’m surprised you made it to the first floor at all”\n\nStella:\n“So that’s what these crystals are- but please let me out of here! I’m still in control!”\n\nBallistics guy:\n“Not a chance, that infection you have can crystallize people in a single day, from a single prick of blood, and I’m surprised your still conscious in all honesty, usually people pass out in the first hour of being infected.”\n\nStella:\n“So I’m gonna become a crystal?! But.. but..-“\n\nBallistics guy:\n“Yeah, your too young to die, but your gonna die today no matter what, so die in here and leave innocent people unharmed”\n\nStella:\n“Unharmed?! I saw dead bodies from the traps you guys set up on the way down here! I haven’t hurt a fly on the way here”\n\n???:\n“Just end this guy and escape, he’s lying.”\n\nBallistics guy:\n“If you get out and lose control, this entire city could be wiped out, it’s a necessary sacrifice for the greater good, now die like the zombie you are, but I will make it so you don’t suffocate, I will kill you swiftly so you don’t have to suffer from that leach inside of you, Now accept your death by me! Cole Smith!”\n\n*they make a frantic dash at the player, if the player doesn’t jump out of the way they Die a scripted death followed by this like: \n“Thanks for standing still, now Rest In Peace, and know you saved people by dying”\nBut if they do dodge the attack, the fight begins where the player\n\nIf lose:\n“You resisted, but the ending is just the same, sooner, and safer”\n\nIf win:\n\nCole:\n*starting to bleed out*\n“You- you infuriating Zombie! Cant you see that your being used as a puppet before you die? Cant you see your going to hurt more people?”\n\nStella:\n“I’m still in control, and I intend to live as long as I can! And I will find a way to stop my death from this leach as you call it”\n\nCole:\n“Impossible… there isn’t a way- there isn’t a chance! You will just end up killing others… starting… with… me…”\n\n???:\n“Just ignore the Idiot that died, now is your time to leave”\n\n{Cole falls to the ground, now lifeless, and clutching the remote to open the door of the office}\n\n{quickly Stella picked up the remote and exited into the outside, realizing something was wrong}\n\nTO BE CONTINUED"
lmud1q,Lost for mobile games ideas,"Does anybody have any ideas for a mobile game I could make. I am stuck for ideas. It would preferably be a simple game, such as platformer or something along the lines of flappy bird, maybe even a board game. I am not familiar with making multiplayer games or FPS games for mobile but other than that I am happy to give it a go. \nUnfortunately, I can only publish to android platform because I am too broke to pay $99 a year for iOS devices 😖"
lmtpd9,Dream Groundhog Day,"Being stuck in your dream, but knowing that it's a dream, doing whatever crazy stuff you may have in your dreams happen! XD As for mechanics, you are also stuck in one same day, so every NPC in the city has the same schedule every day, and it resets at the end of the each day. You just discover, try to do different or same things, and see how the world tries to react to your actions. One day you can be a criminal, ""another"" day you can be a hero, yet ""another"" day you can kill yourself. Some of the stuff may be easy to achieve in one day, but the others? Could you get promoted from an office employee to be the CEO in just one day? Could you make someone fall in love with you in one day? Could you become a serial killer without getting caught in one day? On the other hand, your time is infinite, since your memory keeps the information, so you can learn and try to achieve more stuff each day, but not necessarily the same stuff. Think of it more like an open-world game.  \n\n\nThat would be a fun to play game for me, but since it would require writing down way too much stuff, like daily schedule and events of a thousand citizens!? I don't think I'll ever gonna build such game. So feel free if you may. :)"
lmr9g8,What if the game designer lies to you?,"A game which starts off in classic fashion: menu, options, start game, tutorial...\n\n...but then, after you get the basics of the game, in follow up interactions with you, the game narrator and UI of the game itself start introducing information that is purposefully wrong and get you into trouble.\n\nAfter a while, it becomes obvious that the game designer is diagetic (in the game world) and is a character who tries to either make you fail, or use you to get to his own goals (which don't align with your own goals as a character or player). Hence, the game designer is the bad guy too.. xD\n\nI guess this is a similar idea to Stanley Parable (or Nier), and invites you to think about the following: how can the Game Designer lie to the player?\n\nI'm not talking badly designed UI or UX here, I'm specifically talking about ""lying"" to the player as a game challenge that the player must overcome. Maps with wrong information, tutorial pop-ups that invite you to do mistakes. Narrator that purposefully lie. And most interesting of them all....the game trains you on mechanics on one way, and then, throws a challenge that requires you to do the opposite of what you learned..."

I also get frustrated when people I live with don't load a dishwasher efficiently.\n\nSo the thought here is, can you make a Tetris clone that involves loading a dishwasher? Either that or a Deus Ex inventory management style puzzle mechanic. You have X number of dishes of varying shapes and limited space to fit as much as possible.\n\nCould be 2d or 3D. Could even have Surgeon Simulator style controls for comedy. A sink full of dirty dishes. Some so greasy they might slide out of your hands."

Fear has struck some, others are filled with motive. Oh my home, where my bones are kept warm, alike the mirage in the desert. Then the angel without wings pays his respect, alike old forgotten heroes.\n\n""Demon..."" proclaimed the hero without wings, knowing he had fallen from grace, yet he met his distant brother. Demon then walked across with silent respect, the unspoken language of a soldier.\n\nAcross the turmoil, amid the warzone, the wrecked ship, and fallen fellow brethren. Hope was in the heart of the hero. He wanted to keep his hope up, Cortana had learned hope from him. Alike a getaway drive. Frees the soul of trapped angels, who roam the earth searching for something.\n\nOut the wreck, into the glorious world, the unseen was revealed. The tone of legendary flutes and sounds of instruments with strings, my heart startled. Angels of Demons, Angels of War, Angels of Death, Uknown Angels, and the unseen.

""How"" answered the Chief... showing hope.\n\nShould legends include unknown kingdoms, unknown kings, unknown heroes? Those are my riddles."
lmk787,Stupid dungeon crawler idea,Not very specific but as of recently i have been very interested in the idea of a 2d game where you fight with a ball and chain. Just swinging it around decimating enemies and gaining xp to upgrade it. And that's just all a you go in a dungeon/forest thing and just kill small monsters upgrading your weapon the way you feel like maybe you can make the ball larger or make it smaller and faster. You can light it on fire or dip it in poison or maybe dip it in poison get a secondary ball and chain that rotates around the first ball and chain that is on fire idk. Best comparison is 2d medieval Doom.
lmjvu2,How much would you buy my game for? [Curious],"I guess this might or might not count so if it doesn't you guys can tell me and i will take it down.\n\nAnyway here is my game idea / work in progress.\n\nSo its when the player becomes the president and is trying to solve problems that become more and more difficult to solve, although there would always be a way to solve it with some twists in the story line where the user might not think there is a way but if the continue with the best options they solve the problems.\n\nYou would also get the option to have a partner/girlfriend or boyfriend/ whatever and you could even be single if you want through out your journey. You could also decide which characteristics your partner, or so, on will have.\n\nYou could always speak whatever and whenever you would like and the AI could respond appropriately, in accordance to your other decisions you've made before hand, and if its your partner (or so on) they will respond according to the characteristics you've chosen in the beginning before the game started.\n\nI know there was a post where the moderator said the game ideas should be reasonable i feel like this counts as i have already started the prep work and began a path already so i think it is reasonable.\n\nIts going to be made in [console.app](https://console.app) framework in c# using the Visual studio 2019 IDE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game would unfortunately have now graphics except text (as my laptop could literarily be passed for as a literal potato and it runs as good as an overweight person with asthma and a dislocated knee).\n\nSo in essence i would like to know if anyone would buy this game if its ever made, and for how much, or should i give up and make some other game."
lmfh0n,When I was a kid I dreamt of traveling. Imagine a full virtual vacation focusing on realism.,"The ""Uber"" drive to the airport, the airport itself, the plane flight, the hotel check-in, the hotel room, and several locations with attractions. All with dynamic audio and full length (for example, real flight lengths, but skippable). I for one would love to take a nap in a virtual hotel room with maybe a built-in video player on the tv and ocean sounds outside. This would be focused on realism and not cartoony. Think total recall, but less death and muscles. In fact! Hold on... we could call it ""Utter Recollection"". See? We can do this! ""Oh wait, it's not a partnership."" \[Mumbles to self\]. \n\nWhen I was a kid, once I took a trip with my parents, I played ""take a vacation"" all the time, because I loved the whole process. This could be an entertaining game for kids and adults who want the experience but can't or for someone who just wants to relax.\n\nI wish I could take on this project, but I have too many projects already and I am not experienced enough. Unless... you wanted to take a trip on the partner-ship. No? Ok.\n\nI realized how cool this could be when I watched a ""plane passenger"" 360 video and later found myself taking a nap in the oculus home. Real travel is of course best, but for relaxing this would be amazing.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. Oh and no I am not the impostor. That was Steve. Always steve. Did I mention I want to do voiceovers?"
lmernx,GRIEF,"The rouge like that puts a new meaning in “everyone grieves differently”\n\nThe player controls a character who has no memory but has found themselves in an unfamiliar place with creatures surrounding them and the only instruction they have is “Fight” \n\nAfter completing the first room, the character unlocks a memory/power up following a cutscene. In Grief the power ups are also the characters memory’s awarded by completing rooms/ bosses. After a while of stacking memory’s the character infers that he is dead and is in some sort of limbo\n\nThe bosses at the end of each 5 levels are The 5 stages of grief, in creature like form but also with some similarities to characters that pop up in certain memory cutscenes. Each boss has a memory attached to them and two very strong power ups. The character at the start of the fight will have to choose how they want to embrace the memory, like bury it down or accept it for what it was. That will determine which power up they will get for the boss fight ahead of them. \n\nhow did they player die ? was he killed ? was it suicide ? who or what are they grieving, and why is their grief so powerful that it is keeping them alive ? \n\nThis is a game will focus on a strong deep story and wild fun boss fights."
lmehdp,"Here’s mine i recently came up with, an Adventure Open-world survival-like game where you play as a Dog, traveling together with your owner. But with a twist, the dog’s a robot and its set somewhere around the future.","(Tell me if this idea is already taken or not) \n\nIt’ll be like a Survival journey game. You play as the owner’s dog. Your owner’s a hunter doing his job for a living. And ofc as his dog, you’ll help him gather and craft some supplies and help hunt some food for him. Once you keep doing that, your “bond” together will increase. And as it goes up, you, the dog, your robot-like traits will slowly fade away as you slowly become more like a real dog."
lmeb05,New fps mafia game idea (scrapped the idea for my old post),"I’ve made a new script and some lines of code for a new project I’m making: A mafia game set in the 70s.\n\n-You are a no-name guy who has no voice (similar to some of my favourite rpg’s) that is a low-level petty thief from a city sprawling with lights, skyscrapers and a whole lot of crime families and street gangs. In the early-mid 70s, after about a year of trying to make a name for yourself, you attempt to join a street gang related to a big-time crime family. When you try to pull off a car jacking, you’re caught by a local gang, who’s leader owns the car. These guys beat the crap out of you and a couple of other recruits. You must now make your way back to the main hideout to get medical help with the other guys. The game continues on with you making it back and already moving on to other missions, trying to gain as much territory and members as possible before the police regain control of the situation. The reason why you’re doing this is because the police are finally starting to put godfathers and leader of the families in prison, so you need as many men as possible to remain in control and prevent any future problems. In the end, you either succeed, fail (I’ll explain shortly) or you get killed after getting whacked for trying to begin a side business without sharing a cut of your own earnings. (These endings will become more developed in a second). You progress through the ranks as the story goes on.\n\n\n-The city:\nIt’s just a city, it’s got a central area with nature and man-made lake. There’s a river that surrounds it and the other industrial island with it’s power plant. The city sprawls with light however. It’s the reason why I chose a first person camera, so you can appreciate the gloomy, the shiny and the bougie parts of the city. Most buildings can be entered, there’s a metro that connects to most areas of the map, being the quickest but being the most expensive of your 4 options of transportation. Taxis exist but prices vary depending on the location and how willing they are to go there (nicer areas will be guaranteed for acceptance by the drivers, while gang run neighbourhoods will be less accepted).\n\n\n-Options for the player:\nthere’s free reign for customization but you will be judged and have a higher likelihood of getting mugged depending on your location and what you’re wearing. You can change the colour of your clothes when you buy them and keep all colour versions to use them when you want and mix your clothing up. Note that the clothes are period correct and are based on the trends of the time. You can buy, steal and collect cars and modify them in any way. You can change engine parts, suspension, fenders, interior pieces, colours, wheels, exhausts and much more! Want a hot rod, make one! Want to have a luxurious cruiser, why not?! You have almost no limits. The car will need to be cleaned, turned on and off by holding a key/button, have the lights turned on and off manually, manually turn on the windshield wipers and refilled for gas. The player can change their appearance in any way they feel like. There will be different shops for all you want to do to yourself. You can buy penthouses, condos, bungalows or maybe a basic apartment is more of your fancy. \n\n\n-weapons:\nFists, pipes, baseball bats, crowbars, knives, knuckle dusters, golf clubs, trash can lids, revolvers, pistols, shotguns, sawed-off’s, rifles and smg’s. Snipers are only useable in story missions and in the epilogue.\n\nGaining territories:\nAs the game progresses, day-by-day you will either lose or gain territory. If you’re not involved enough, you’ll start losing lots of turf, eventually resulting in a game over, resulting in a restart or load-up of a previous checkpoint. More contribution means more territory is gained and it can be protected for longer without you needing to do much.\n\n\nEndings:\n\n1- You succeed at gaining all turf and fight off the police, keeping your control over the city and being inducted in as the godfather. You can free roam in the epilogue.\n\n2- You fail and go into hiding, being forced to fight at every corner just to survive. The family has fizzled out and you are back on the streets. You can free roam post-story albeit with much less money and properties/possessions in general.\n\n3- At the final chapter, you start a business separate from the crime family. If you choose not to cut them in, you’ll be killed and will never learn of the outcome of the city. If you do cut in the family, you get endings 1 or 2. In this ending, free roam isn’t possible post-story.\n\n\n*You can upgrade stats on your character by doing missions, side missions and business growing.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated, so please share your thoughts. This game won’t be finished for a few years so might as well get the kinks figured out before it’s too late."
lmbiix,survivial game,"So this idea is a bit similar to the Forest, but the idea is that a person who gets stranded on a island after a really bad plane crash, you set out to save yourself and/or find other survivor's (NPCS) . They help you navigate and stuff, but unlike the Forest, you also find people that were already living there but not like tribes but people that went missing. So and you find out you're in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle, and find many missing people on the island."
lm85iu,"Play as powerful wizard, but using your powers corrupts you.","Basically you play as Gandalf with a whole bunch of powerful skills, but using them turns you into Sith Lord. Game tempts you to do it because it's an easy solution for each mission and also it's fun. Probably the game would need to have a very strong narrative."
lm5svn,Singleplayer Survival RPG set in the Ice Age,"This is a dream game since childhood, I love this time period and I am sad this Period is so uncommon in gaming. I know of Stone Rage but this idea is more Roleplay based.\n\nThe working title is Age of Beasts.\n\nRaces: You could play as a few different races, the first would be based off the first H. Sapiens coming from Africa they would have great stamina and speed but be weaker as a result. The second based off the Neanderthals and they would have higher HP and strength but would be slower and need more food. Third is the Hybrid, they would be a mix of the Humans and the Neanderthals, they would be kind of the jacks of all trades, good strength and speed but lower Strength the the Neanderthals and slower than humans but would be Stronger than humans and faster than Neanderthals.\n\nThe Biomes: There would be 4 biomes, the Biggest would be the steppe. It would have massive herds of mammoths, bison, reindeer horses, and Saiga antelope. It would also have woolly Rhinos and Elasmotherium with small herds of Irish elk maybe 5 to 8 animals. The predators would also be the most dangerous here with prides of cave lions and packs of cave hyenas and wolves. The scariest predator would be Homotherium, a sabretooth cat. Hybrid players would start here It would have only a few trees and would be very dry.  2nd is the forest, It would have Aurochs, red deer, wild boar, rabbits, Irish Elk, tapirs, moose and brown bears. It would have lynx, wolves and Cave bears, the biggest predators in the game. The Forest would be where human players would start. 3rd is the mountains, the second biggest biome. It would have the same animals as the forest but with addition of the Ibex and snow leopard. The cave hyenas and Lions would live here as well. Neanderthal players would start here. Lastly the coast the coldest biome by far. It would have Whales, seals, fish and Polar bears. It would be frozen over in the Winter.\n\nClimate and weather: The Biomes all have different climates. The steppe would be the driest and have little too no rain or snow. The steppe would be the place to be in Summer but be devoid of life during Winter. The steppe would have extreme weather, so if it snows it snows 10 feet and if it rains it floods the small streams of the steppe. The forest would have moderately wet. In Winter it would have mammoths who fled the steppe and snowfall regularly. Summer in the forest would be nice and temperate. The Mountains would have Hibernating bears, and cave lions and hyenas would live here in the Winter.  It would also be a good place for players to go in the Winter with it's large caves providing shelter from the elements. Summers in the mountains would be colder than the forest but warmer than the steppe and coast. The coast would be cold in the summer but would be a good place to go in the Spring.\n\nCrafting and building: Building would be like Grounded you make the building as you go. Humans and Hybrids could make large round houses and huts but Neanderthals would have to settle for tents. There would be a enchanting system, where you get animal bones and they imbue the weapon with the animal's power. Mammoth tusks and furs could be used to make huts and other structures. The common argument against this setting is it not having much diversity in tools, but I think that is wrong. You would have 4 tiers of weapon materials, each with drawbacks and strengths, the materials would be flint, bone, antler and obsidian. flint and bone are worse versions of antler and obsidian. Obsidian weapons would have crazy damage but be very fragile and would break often making them less sustainable. Antler would have good durability but less damage output than obsidian. Bone would have the least amount of damage and flint would have more durability than bone but do less damage than antler and obsidian. The weapon types would be Axes, daggers, atlatls, spears, and clubs. Spears, clubs, and atlatls would be good hunting tools and war weapons. Axe and daggers would be useful for combat and would be used as tools as well. Clothing and weapon types would be dependent on race with Hybrids and Humans making more advanced tools and huts but Neanderthals having more basic tech, Neanderthals would be able to make spears and knives but axes would lack shafts and be almost unusable as weapons. Neanderthals would make clothes like capes, skirts, boots but would not be able to make pants or shirts. Humans and Hybrids would make shirts and pants as well as capes skirts and boots. Fur clothes would worn in Winter but would be exchanged for woven cloth in Summer.\n\nGameplay and core mechanics: Combat would be like Grounded, with the ability to yeet spears and other weapons at your foes. NPCs would travel the map and would trade with the player. Neanderthals would be able to get advanced weapons and clothes from these merchants. The player would form a tribe as they go from place to place. Humans and Neanderthals can only recruit their own race but hybrids can recruit anyone. The seasons would dictate your life and your companions lives. You would have to travel around with the seasons. If you stay in place to long animals will avoid it and food will become scarce. Animals will have realistic behaviors and will either fight or flee. No passive animals that ignore you. Mammoths would be the hardest to hunt due to having such high intelligence. Humans and Hybrids can tame dogs. \n\nI know it is long but I an really passionate about this game idea."

lm3udo,A Sims game in style of Project Zomboid,"Now I am a sucker for sims 1's art style, and that might be what made me enjoy Project Zomboid so much.\n\nWhile playing PZ, I cant stop thinking how cool it would be to have a game like the Sims where you can just walk and drive around the city like you can in PZ.\n\nMaybe throw in some RPG elements like the GBC version of Sims Bustin out and the ability to influence the town and start building projects.\n\nDon't know if others would be interested in this, but I can't stop thinking about it!"
lm0wrt,JRPG Inn Tycoon,"You know the game Recettear: an Item Shop Tale, where you play as a shopkeeper in a JRPG world? This is that, but for inns.\n\nFirst of all, compared to Recettear where you have to go to dungeons from time to time, you never go anywhere outside your inn. The game is focused more on the simulation, customization, and management aspect, where you can design your own building.\n\nFirst, you start on the beginner's town. Your inn is small and only has one floor. The only people who visit are farmers and bored villagers. Your objective each stage is to attract a quantity of ""heroes"" to your inn. To attract them, you need to provide things that a JRPG hero would need, such as beds, meals, and *save points*. Villagers provide rumors on which events are happening in the town or what heroes are currently in town and how to attract them to your inn.\n\nAs you reach the mid to end game, you move to larger and larger cities, and finally at an end game city that borders on the demon lord's castle or something. Then your inn will be visited by the rumored chosen one that will save the world. Sometimes there will be events where your inn will be attacked by monsters (common JRPG tropes) or if two certain heroes are staying at the same time, they will trigger a romance event and you'll get a hidden achievement. \n\nI could go on and on, tell me what you think!"

llf718,Asymmetrical godzilla style games.,"After watching godzilla I started thinking how cool it would be to do an asymmetrical style multiplayer game where 1 or more people play as a giant monster like godzilla while you have dozens of other players play as soldiers fighting the monster. I imagine it being like battlefield in terms of what the soldiers using tanks, helicopters, and jets. Or instead of the monster being the size of godzilla you could have let's say maybe 10 people playing as monsters that are the size of Titans from attack on Titan and maybe like 60 people playing as soldiers trying to defend the city."

lled7h,Open World Zombie Game Idea,"Zombie Game Idea\n\nMix of Ark, Fortnite, Call of Duty and Minecraft.\n\nYou are stranded on an island during a zombie outbreak. You must find a way to escape and survive. (Open world)\n\nCall of Duty is the main movement system. You can run fast, the gunplay feels very call of duty etc. \n\nYou start off on a helicopter and you are told to investigate the island (Very large island) The helicopter gets shot down. \n\nYou must build bases, build weapons, build things to survive and escape. \n\nAs you start getting better at building, you can build better bases, weapons etc in some sort of xp system\n\nYou can't just build a wooden boat and leave. Zombies will swim and kill you on the boat. It's not that easy. \n\nThis is of course a multiplayer game! You can add people to your clan to help you survive! But there is also other clans. You can raid and kill other clans for their loot and bonus rewards. \n\nThe stronger you and your team gets, the harder the zombies get too. It's not a simple walk in the park. If you die, you will respawn. But only if your base is still standing. If your base is raided and broken. You must restart.\n\nAlso, whatever loot you have on you when you die, stays where you die. Adventuring will be a challenge. \n\nYou can play it safe and get everything yourself, or raid peoples villages, bases etc and get the loot and added bonuses. Whatever helps you escape. \n\nWant this game to be a very grindy game but still really fun with friends. Definitely want the game to take a while to complete. \n\nYou can build guns, crossbows, swords, catapults whatever fuckin works for whatever level you are at. It would be cool if there was active challenges for extra loot and live events that people can fight for tons of loot. \n\nJust an idea tho."

lksboc,Kind of a realistic police simulator,"This game idea centers around you being a rookie cop going through training and heading up till you retire or are killed in the line of duty it'll go through years because a game would be to long if it was till you retire you could create a character but you would have to choose from a preset names list. This will take place in NYC but you'll be in one area at a time because you will be transferred or will have to request a transfer to a different precinct around the city. Now onto the rank of your character you will rank up based on how good of a cop you are this will require missing time with family and friends you can also be a crooked cop or just a all around bad cop this could get you fired from the force depending on what you do. You can also be killed in the line of duty or get injured you will be issued a vest but if you are shot in the vest your vision will blur and you will become slower until you recover in a short amount of time if you are shot in a place that is not armored you will have to be treated by a medic and or depending on how bad the wound is have to leave the fire fight as soon as possible. Will also be able to choose between being a swat officer And a normal officer but this depends on if you can pass a special test that you can retry at certain poitns. There will be armory that you can pick weapons up from but they are only what police can actually issued. The arrest system is basic you get a certain amount of cuffs you can use to arrest but you can only take two the rest will be dealt with by separate officers, you can take a bribe from them for you to let them go although this will get you closer to being fired. To keep this post shorter ill update as I come up with thoughts and ideas for this game but this is just most of the stuff i thought of."
lks9hr,Godzilla game (update 1),"So far I have made progress on my idea of a Godzilla game for the mechanics on it.It will involve a weapon wheel and certain combos for certain moves but not too complex combos just simple enough for the player to get a hang of it.The weapon wheel would involve atomic breath,claws,tail attacks,and a small nuclear pulse wave attack,a power meter or as I would a call it your atomic power meter would fill up over time and when you reach two bars you can fire super charged atomic breath,and at three bars you would shoot atomic spikes,and at four bars you would a special smash attack,and at five bars you would fire off a charged nuclear blast.still working on the mechanics let me know what you think!"
lkr06c,Wizardly Magic System for VR,"Disclaimer: this system of virtual reality mechanics is intended to be implemented with a physical full-body player controller such as [this](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/hexabody-vr-player-controller-185521), and assumes a medieval fantasy setting wherein scholarly witches and wizards cast spells from a personal spellbook by performing wand gestures or utilizing scrolls. Given controls for this system are based on the Valve Index controllers, but support for other controllers could be added by remapping where necessary. Given *storage socket* locations and wand gesture shapes are based on right-handed dominance, but could be horizontally mirrored for left-handed players.\n\n# SPELLBOOK\n\n""Every witch and wizard owns a personal spellbook filled with all the spells they've collected or discovered through years of study and practice.""\n\n* Holding / Storing: mechanically, the spellbook will involve a dynamic book controller. In particular, [this asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/megabook-17826) may be optimal. While not in use, the spellbook can be stored in a *socket* represented by a [special holster](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1008/4418/products/IMG_7189_1024x1024.JPG?v=1590347655) tied to the left side of the player's waist belt. When equipped and held within 6"" of the *socket*, the book will play a closing animation. When equipped and moved outside of that 6"" radius, the book will play an opening animation, turning to the spell that was open before the book was last closed, or the first spell by default. The book can be dropped or thrown, but will play the closing animation immediately upon leaving the player's grasp.\n* Reading: the spellbook is divided into pairs of pages. For each pair of written pages, the left side will include a spell name and short description, while the right side will include a drawing of the wand gesture shape required to ""prime"" the spell, a spell type indicator icon, and the mana cost of the spell. To flip to the next spell, the player can use their free hand or wand tip to tap on the right-hand page. To flip to the previous spell, the player can use their free hand or wand tip to tap on the left-hand page. Tapping on the left-hand page of the first written spell does nothing. Tapping on the right-hand page of the last written spell will flip to a blank page that can be filled with a newly discovered spell.\n* Writing: right-hand blank pages of the spellbook will contain a feather quill icon. When a feather quill icon page is tapped by the player's free hand, a feather quill will materialize into that hand. The quill is *sticky* in that it cannot be thrown or dropped. Squeezing the grip input or pressing the trigger input of the quill-equipped hand controller will dematerialize the quill and free the player's hand. When the tip of the quill is tapped on the surface of a loose/torn spellbook page (possibly found as loot scattered around the game map), the spell that was tapped will be copied into the player's spellbook on the blank page that is currently open, followed by the automatic dematerialization of the quill. Even if a spell (wand gesture shape) were to be memorized by the player in an older game, they would not be able to cast it in a newer game until it was copied into their spellbook -- i.e. wand gestures are not recognized until the associated spell has been collected.\n\n# WAND\n\n""A wizard's wand is his closest ally; a tool to focus the innate magical energy swirling around and within him.""\n\n* Holding / Storing: while not in use, the wand can be stored in a *socket* represented by [another special holster](https://ravenswoodleather.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/6U5A7238.jpg) tied to a harness on the left side of the player's chest, sitting above the spellbook holster. The wand can be dropped or thrown like most other wieldable items.\n* Casting: in order to cast a spell from their spellbook, the player must first ""prime"" the spell by (1) equipping their wand, (2) pressing and holding the trigger input of the wand-equipped hand controller, (3) drawing the wand gesture shape in the air, and (4) releasing the trigger input. If the gesture was performed accurately, the wand-equipped hand controller will quickly vibrate to indicate that the spell has been primed -- or if controller battery life is a concern, maybe there could be an alternative visual indication, such as the tip of the wand emitting a soft glow. Once a spell has been primed, the player is given one full second to cast the spell before it is no longer primed. To cast a primed spell, the player must tap the trigger input of the wand-equipped hand controller at the end of a wrist flick or jabbing motion. In other words, the spell must be ""thrown,"" and will not cast if the player attempts to emulate standard gunfire mechanics (point and click). If the player really needs to cancel a primed spell before the one second time limit, they can do so by simply tapping the trigger input of the wand-equipped hand controller without moving it quickly beforehand. Once a spell is cast, the spell's mana cost is subtracted from the player's ""mana"" -- a blue-colored resource bar that acts similarly to Dark Souls' stamina bar; it decreases when used, but is constantly recovered at a slow rate. If the player's mana pool is not sufficient enough to cast a spell, sparks will emit from the tip of the wand, indicating the cast was a dud.\n* Blasting: sometimes there just isn't enough time to prime a spell. In scenarios like this, the player may tap the trigger input of the (un-primed) wand-equipped hand controller at the end of a wrist flick or jabbing motion to launch a small orb of raw arcane energy towards a target. These arcane orbs will only impact living creatures, dealing minimal damage -- the lowest damage output of any spell -- and potentially distracting/stunning them for a (very) short time. On collision with any physical or magical barrier, the orbs will dissipate. This basic ranged spell attack still has a low mana cost, preventing players from spamming at like a pistol with infinite ammo. Just like with primed spells, attempting to ""blast"" a target without sufficient mana will result in sparks emitting from the tip of the wand, indicating the player needs to retreat for a few seconds.\n* Deflecting: if the player happens to be fighting a wand-wielding enemy, they can deflect incoming ""blast"" projectiles by physically whacking them out of the air with their wand as if playing baseball or tennis. Other non-""blast"" spells (and also ""blast"" projectiles) can be blocked by utilizing a standard shield spell included in every spellbook. This shield spell is special compared to others in the spellbook because it is automatically cast once the wand gesture is recognized. Mechanically, the shield spell wand gesture shape is a single straight line at any angle. Once cast, an invisible circular shield will form using the drawn line as its diameter, allowing the caster to determine its general location and size based on the detail of their gesture. The disc will dissipate on hostile magic collision, or remain intact for one full second before dissipating on its own.\n* Dueling Arcs: if the player and a wand-wielding enemy cast non-""blast"" spells at each other within the same second, their wands will be connected by [two arcs of opposing magical forces](https://youtu.be/vpFIj_8daVU?t=193). At this point, both casters must rapidly tap the trigger input of their wand-equipped hand controller to push their arcs towards one another. While the arcs still exist, it is possible to hold the wand with both hands, and when doing so the player will gain the ability to rapidly tap both input triggers, potentially doubling the speed of their tapping and increasing their chances of winning the duel. In the case of an NPC, these rapid taps would obviously be simulated. During this magical tug-of-rope, mana pool replenishment is paused for both casters. At some point, one of the casters will slip up, letting the other overcome them. The losing duelist will have their mana pool completely drained in addition to being struck by the winner's spell. The winning duelist will suffer no setbacks. As soon as the arcs dissipate, the mana pool replenishment of both casters will restart. Additionally, it is possible to break and dissipate the arcs without winning or losing a duel by moving the wand-equipped hand(s) such that the connection between the wands is severed by a physical object or entity. When this happens, the object or entity breaking the arc will incur moderate damage, potentially destroying or killing it (shattering a wooden crate, burning some poor bystander to a crisp, etc). Be wary, for even though it is possible to use equipped items to break the connection, those items will be damaged. Using the spellbook will destroy all collected (not initially included) spell pages, using a spell scroll will incinerate it beyond repair, and so on.\n\n# SCROLLS\n\n""In a split second decision, the witch grabs a scroll tucked under her belt and absorbs the power she stored within it the night before. The energy flows into her wand as the parchment falls apart between her fingers.""\n\n* Holding / Storing: While not in use, a total of three scrolls can be stored in *sockets* represented by scrolls peeking out of an open pouch tied to the right side of the player's waist belt. Initially, one rolled-up scroll can be seen peeking out the top of the pouch, but when three written scrolls have been stored, four scrolls can be seen peeking. The first, farthest righthand scroll will always be blank -- this is the *socket* that stores all of the blank scrolls the player has accumulated. As a consumable resource, blank scrolls (or parchment, whatever you want to call it) must be looted or purchased; whatever that entails within the context of the game. When the player uses a free hand to hover over one of the three written scroll *sockets*, assuming it is populated, a GUI icon will display above the player's hand indicating which spell is written onto that scroll. Blank scrolls and written scrolls can be dropped or thrown like most other wieldable items. Blank scrolls cannot be stored in any of the three written scroll *sockets*, and written scrolls cannot be stored in an empty blank scroll *socket*. Attempting to place a scroll into an invalid scroll *socket* will automatically store it in the next valid, available scroll *socket*. If there are no *sockets* available, the scroll will simply drop to the floor on grip input release. \n* Preparing: to prepare a scroll, the player must first use a free hand to equip a blank scroll, and then place/release it onto a flat upward-facing surface such as a floor, table, or countertop. When placed on such a surface, the scroll will play an unrolling animation to reveal a feather quill icon -- the same icon written onto blank spellbook pages. When the feather quill icon is tapped by the player's free hand, a feather quill will materialize into that hand. The quill is *sticky* in that it cannot be thrown or dropped. Squeezing the grip input or pressing the trigger input of the quill-equipped hand controller will dematerialize the quill and free the player's hand. When the tip of the quill is tapped on the surface of a written spellbook page, the spell on that page will be copied onto the blank scroll, the scroll will play a rolling animation to complete its transformation into a written scroll, and the quill will automatically dematerialize. At this point, the player can equip the written scroll and store it in one of the three written scroll *sockets*.\n* Using: to use a written scroll, the player must (1) equip their wand, (2) equip the written scroll with their free hand, and (3) double-tap the trigger input of the scroll-equipped hand controller. Upon double-tapping, the scroll will fall apart and the wand will automatically be primed with the spell for two full seconds. At this point, casting the spell is the same as if it was already primed through gesturing. If the spell is not cast within two seconds, the player just wasted that scroll. Note: scroll utilization does not cost any mana, but the caveat is that scrolls need to be prepared in advance. It's possible to prepare a scroll in the heat of battle, but it would arguably take longer than casting the spell via gesture. Perhaps if the player was out of mana, they could take cover and prepare a scroll while waiting for their mana to refill."

lkq6yo,World Wide Racing,"Essentially an open world racing game that tracks damage similar to BeamNG or Wreckfest (not necessarily as detailed visually on the car, but retain a similar HUD interface that tells you if your major car components are damaged or destroyed).  \n\nPlayers can walk/run around outside of vehicles for the purpose of switching cars.  Only unoccupied vehicles can be driven.  \n\nAll vehicles have a gas tank, the size and fuel consumption of which would be built around car specs, terrain, speeds, etc.  Gas usage can become an important component during some longer races.\n\nI envision, however lofty, an open world environment encompassing an entire continent, such as the US.  This could possibly be expanded on later on with additional DLC that gives you other continents.  The Crew 2 does a fantastic job at creating a condensed version of the US to drive coast to coast.\n\nPlayers in the ""world server"" that they are on can create a game mode with other players.  Some game modes could be ""Survive the Hunt"" (credit to FailRace), ""Infection"" (or Tag basically), ""Canonball Run (a coast to coast race that requires several stops for fueling and repairs (possibly add other tasks?))."

lknhtb,The ultimate game: your own inner Matrix-like fantasy world,"Could we create alternate personalities to run our lives?  My idea is this: Imagine a hypothetical brain modification that allows us to create an alternate personality that would take over and handle things for us when we want it to.  This personality could go to work for you, go grocery shopping, exercise, attend social events that you don’t want to go to, or anything else. Meanwhile, your conscious mind is off in a Matrix-like dream world that you can create just by imagining it. This world would feel completely real. The people, objects, and scenery would be mental constructs in your own inner world, and they would all be exactly what you want.  You can return to the real world anytime you wish, or you can tell your alternate personality to disengage and give you back control at a given time.  Essentially, this alternate personality would be the neurological equivalent of a computer program. It would have access to all the information stored in your brain, and could carry out your daily activities with the same level of proficiency as you.   \n\n\nThis idea is a hodgepodge of various movies: The Matrix, Psycho, Total Recall, and Click.  Let’s say that you wake up one morning and decide that you don’t want to go to work.  You tell your alternate personality to “take care of today”, and you’re immediately on your fantasy island. Spend the day on the beach with your “perfect” romantic partner, sip margarita, have fun in the hot tub with your partner, eat whatever food you want (which would all have 0 calories), go dancing at night, and when the day is over, wake up and return to reality. Your fantasy world is whatever you want. You could be a war hero, an adventurer, a king or queen, the captain of a starship, or whatever you want."
lkljsa,FPS with changing gun.,"I'm sure we've all played a fun FPS and said ""I wanna be a sniper! Shooting people from long range and doing quick kills!"" but the game just doesn't give you any actual snipers, and the ones it does give you have low zooms and are semi-automatic. \n\nThis idea is essentially a fix to that. You're givensome sort of special gun, wihch essentially gets a number of points that you can spec into increasing certain aspects. You can put points into a silencer, points into damage, recoil, fire rate, reload, whatever. You change it at your base, and it can go as a default of any of a number of weapon types. Snipers take less points for accuracy or damage, but more for fire rate and reload. Machine guns take less for fire rate or damage, but more for accuracy or reload speed, etc. \nThoughts?"

lkaji2,Want some feedback on this simulation/slow idle mobile game Idea I have.,"So I've recently thought about my favorite book trilogy and believe that I finnaly found an Idea to gamify the core concept of it.\n\n# Short summary\n\nThis post went way bigger than I wanted it to be, so here is a short summary\n\n* it's an management idle game with a focus on real life time\n* it's based on the idea of multiple persons sharing the exact thoughts\n* currencies are: People, Money and Chips\n* Persons have various attributes and can do different tasks\n* there are special persons with unique attributes\n* goal is to grow as fast as possible \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# General theme\n\nOk, so the theme is based around an being called ""Kohärenz"" which is basically an connection of People via an BCI (Brain Computer Interface, that is actually something that is [worked on right now](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/05/elon-musks-neuralink-bold-ideas-hurdles.html) by multiple companies). But instead of connecting themself to machines to remote controll them, they connected one brain directly from on to another. At first this does nothing, but after a while you get a thought that is not yours, but from the other person instead. Over time this is going to be more intense and you start not only sharing your thoughts but also the feelings. You can feel when the other person walks, you can taste what the other person eats and so on.\n\nThe interisting question is: If two people think the exact same, share a brain if you want to call it so, are they then really two persons, or one person in two bodies?\n\nI probably talked to much about the theme behind it now, but I just love the book so much. Ok, here is how I plan the actual game to work. As I said it's going to be an simulation of the given scenerio while also gamifying it as an idle game.

lk8l9j,Ideas for a game that can take advantage of being made as a self-contained gadget,"Basically, what if those mini arcades had unique control methods, original games, and a design that can only work in this form.

Go nuts, if you're good with electronics make a proof of concept, I want something INSANE."
lk83nt,Body part splitting on death,"I'm imagining this in a dungeon crawler for example.\n\nYou come down the mouldy flight of stairs, encounter your first enemy, and unceremoniously die. But instead of a game over, your upper and lower body split.\n\nYou can partially move and attack with your upper body (dragging yourself, slashing with a sword), and move and partially attack with you lower body (running, kicking). Each body part could perhaps even get its own turn.\n\nEach time your parts split they would have less health, but you could get more actions out of each.\n\nSend your hand into.a stealthy mission to another room to fetch an item, while your foot and other hand carry your brain and eyes escaping from an enemy. Some items could probably bring body parts back together as well. \n\nHands activate, grab, and slowly move, arms power hands up.\n\nFeet move and can do some limited actions the hand can do, and are powered up by legs.\n\nThe loss of the brain is the game over, protect it.\n\nAbdomen/stomach to consume various items.\n\nConnecting the torso to arms/legs powers them up even more.\n\nHaving an eye somewhere lets you see the surroundings, but eyeless appendages must feel their way through.\n\nConnecting the head to the torso also gives the head a boost in some way.\n\nHaving a skull/ribs can give those important parts a sort of shield or extra health.\n\nBlood meter where all body parts must connect back to the heart or other source of blood to keep it alive.\n\n\nOf course these are just some of my ideas in how this mechanic could be implemented, but feel free to comment any of your ideas as well."
lk7wfv,My idea for a zombie game,"Let's start by getting some things out of the way. I'm not here to ask for money or resources, and I'm not here to pitch an idea to an indie dev in the hopes that this game can become reality eventually. I'm here because I think that this could be an interesting game idea, and I want to make it. But before I do so, I want some other people to bounce ideas off of.\n\nSo, I'm currently playing They Are Billions. For anyone who doesn't know what that is, it's a zombie survival RTS. There are 2 game modes: survival, where you play in the typical RTS style and try to survive a set number of days, and campaign, where you travel a map doing missions. Campaign mode has 2 main mission types: one where you follow the RTS gameplay loop of building to collect more resources and collecting more resources to build (which in and of itself has several goal types, including taking over infected cities, having a certain amount of colonists, and surviving a number of waves), and the hero missions, where a hero you choose at the start of the campaign delves into dungeons to collect artifacts or save survivors. This is the part that I want to focus on.\n\nSee, I was playing one of these missions and I had a thought: ""This would be a lot more fun if it were like Borderlands."" Changing these missions into a looter-shooter style would probably be the single biggest improvement to the game that anyone could make.\n\nI don't know how possible it is to mod that into the already existing engine, but I'm guessing not very considering that the devs didn't do this to begin with. The idea for this game is that there is an absolutely enormous procedurally generated map, with several sites that allow you to go and change from an RTS game in much the same vein as the Survival mode of They Are Billions, into more of a first-person looter-shooter that plays a lot more like Borderlands. While in the main map, you progressively grow your colony, collecting resources to enable yourself to collect more resources and survive the zombie horde. While in the dungeons, you take control of a single character, running throughout them in first person, trying to complete the mission you went in there to do and get out before the horde kills you.\n\nThoughts on the idea? On more specific things I could add to tell the story of the game world? Of things for the game world, or ideas for an art style? They Are Billions is steampunk, so I don't want to just copy and paste that. Maybe modern, or perhaps futuristic?"
lk6ltd,They are Billions + Borderlands,"Recently I've been playing through the campaign mode of They are Billions, a steampunk style RTS where your opponent is a horde of zombies and your goal is to survive. The campaign mode switches between 2 gameplay styles. One where you build up units and gather resources in the typical RTS gameplay pattern, and the other where you take the role of an explorer delving into a dungeon to collect items for the colony. In both versions, you use the same RTS control scheme.\n\nAnd I just got the idea while playing through one of the missions, ""What if this was a looter-shooter?""\n\nIn this game, missions would alternate between building and defending a city from a horde of zombies in the same style as survival TaB, but with much less of a time investment as you would be going only for a few days at a time, on an enormous map and with a single, continuously growing city; and dungeon missions, where you would take control of a single character and play in a first-person looter-shooter style, with the end goal of these missions being to collect schematics or free and escape with survivors of otherwise improve the colony. The schematics would give your main city access to more technology. And perhaps for city missions, there could be ones every now and again where you build a separate colony that's nearby to a resource that the colony wants to collect."

lk23gu,A game about going through historic battles and other adventures with a special magnifying glass,"**Story:**\n\nYou are visiting the old mansion of your dead father, who was an old adventurer/archeologist, and you find the old trophy room of his, filled with many showcases. In these showcases you see many models and sculptures of battles, old temples and more adventurous things.\n\nAt the end of the room, there is an old and locked wooden door which you can't seem to open. The only thing you find, is a mysterious magnifying glass.\n\nAs soon as you look at one of the showcases with that magnifying glass, your body seems to get drawn into it and you find yourself in an huge naval battle.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe gameplay would be about living these scenes, as if you were a part of them. You could play different characters and also different sides, all depending on what you are looking with the magnifying glass. You could be the captain of one of the ships of the mentioned naval battle above. You could be one of the native people, defending an old temple of yours, that you don't want to get robbed.\n\nIt would be a mix between an action adventure, filled with shooter and roleplay elements and also very story driven. The player could get as creative as they want.\n\nThe main quest of yours is finding a way to open the locked wooden door, the levels are filled with hints and items you can take with you, when you leave.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe whole idea got into my head on one sleepless night and I thought it might sound like something original.\n\nMaking everything of this real, would probably be impossible with all the different ways I describe above, but I hope that I can give someone an idea.\n\nThank you for reading and sorry if my english was bad at some points."

ljzuau,Mega man/highlander inspired battle royale,"A battle Royale, but each player starts with a unique power, of which there are as many as there are players in any given game (say, 50)\nKilling a player gives you any powers they have at that time, and you fight until there is only one.\nPowers can be powerful weapons (where the ammo works like in mega Man and powers up the one you currently have selected), or a passive skill, like regenerating health, more defense, or make it so when you take damage you hurt the attacker as well.\nThere are also reserve weapons as well, but none are as powerful as the best powers."

But first, they need to figure out exactly who can hear who. And they'll need some information relayed to them because they (probably) can't hear everyone else. The IT person will draw a graph of persons/connections and submit this ""IT ticket"" when they're done. Objective is to submit a correct IT ticket as fast as possible.\n\n**Task chaos**\n\nKinda like Spaceteam, where people are constantly shouting instructions at other people to complete their individual tasks. Or it could be like a whisper down the lane/telephone style where one person is given a riddle and another person has the answer.\n\n**Hidden Eavesdropper**\n\nEveryone is given a unique secret key. One person is assigned as the eavesdropper, who can drop in and out of conversations of any connected group of people. Everyone else is a ""secretkeeper"". The eavesdropper needs to collect all of the secret keys, and secretkeepers only need maybe about half of the secret keys. (The eavesdropper does have the information about who can hear who from the start.)\n\nAdditional elements?\n\n* bi-directional connections only, or also allow one-way connections\n* change the network of connections periodically during a round\n* add talking bots for additional persons"
ljxbeb,"insanely big fantasy simulator, maybe vr","you know how in video games you always play as the hero, or the king, or a guard at the kings castle, etc. etc. etc..

ljx37n,Turn based strategy game with a necromancer,"You'd be something like the last of the necromancers and for some reason, your goal would be to expand/evolve your skills. In order to do so, you'd seek out the tombs of dead necromancers and use your skills to speak with their corpse, so that they give you their knowledge of some skill. \n\nBut to get there you'd have to fight, and that would happen like in the X-Com games : you move, get into combat mode, and when that happens, you can use your mana points to cast spells, including raising units (zombies, specters, skeletons etc...) to fight for you and also some other skills like buffs, damage over time skills and stuff like that.\n\nGetting new skills should be as much a challenge as fighting so maybe there would be some traps to get to the tomb, or you'd have to chose the right dialogues to gain the trust of the revived necromancer and acquire his knowledge.\n\nAnd of course there'd be some epic story explaining why you have to save the world (or doom idk, you're a necromancer, you could be the bad guy), and why only a necromancer can do it (and since you're the last one you gotta do it)."

I'm a big fan of birds and so is my artist -there's a few cockatiels and budgies flying around my workspace as we speak- so something revolving around tropical birds would be amazing!

It's more that it's helping you to make a choice when and if you're torn between several good ideas.\n\nUltimately, the decision should come down to supply and demand of the idea you're planning to make. There's little chance that another standard 2D platformer will be massively popular, for example.\n\nI appreciate this is not a concrete idea, but feels super relevant to the community of this subreddit. We're literally doing it as a hobby to help indie devs. :)"

liw35h,Ideas for a game with simple art.,"Looking for ideas for a mobile game that could be made with simple art. I am a decent programmer, but my art skills are kinda lacking. So hoping maybe I could get some ideas that could do with simple art.  \n\n\nAnd yes I know you could make a game with objectively bad art and still be good too. But I don't know, I like my games to look nice too. Figured if it has like very simple objects, or basic shaped and particle effects and stuff it could look nice without needing great art skills."
liteww,Looking for developing partner,"Hey guys, this is my first ever reddit post! I was just wondering if anyone would be interested to teaming up to create a 2d game? \n\nI would like to make some as catchy as possible but while also make it as simple as possible. For example, like floppy bird. I'm open to any offers and ideas. I would just like to know what position/role you would want to take on. I would like to do most of the programming and would really prefer someone who wants to do the design/modeling and texturing. Lmk if anyone's interested"
lirnck,Escaping latinoamérica: the game,"The game is similar to Don't Starve. You are in a set post apocalyptic-esque world (based off latinoamérica, but it's not supposed to be a huge map) and you have to survive (some areas are more wild, others in destroyed city scapes) hunting for food and defending yourselves.\n\nI imagine it being a small multiplayer game. 5 players per game. Probably Lan or user generated servers.\n\nThe game lasts like an hour or two, before either the whole of latinoamérica gets destroyed (maybe Europe decided Latinoamérica and its people is way too big of a threat?). (As someone from Argentina I imagine Europe wants to destroy it because they think Peronism is way too much of a threat haha, but it could be anything!) So the objective is to get out before that.\n\nYou can try to build boats, air balloons, stuff like that.\nSome NPC may try to take those down.\n\nThe main mechanic tho, is that although all the players can all survive together, individualism (or dividing into smaller teams) and stealing from others is the better strategy (and thus encouraged).\nAs in: it's easier to get food for one and to build a small boat than to do all that for five persons.\n\nThe ones that get away from latinoamérica win, leaving the rest of the group in game over.\n\nOf course, the players can try to win with teamwork!... Or to sabotage the team at the last moment for the sweet taste of winning!\n\n\nJust thought it would be quite fun. I think the idea has room for improvement but I also like it as it is... So, what do you guys think?"
lirf7h,MMO forest management/fire fighting simulation set in Big Dumb Open World™,"There are a couple major firefighting games, most of which focus on limited squads and structure fires. I would love to see this sort of a concept expanded to the suppression of wildfires (by way of helicopter, firetruck, on-foot firefighters, etc), but also wildfire prevention through controlled burns, firebreaks and the like, to first aid and rescue for injured and trapped firefighters.\n\nI think to make this sort of a concept really feel alive, a local and constantly evolving weather system is essential. Snow or rain here dampens the spread of flame, wind there pushes the fire in such-and-such a direction. Long periods of pleasant, sunny weather make an area more likely to catch flame in the event of a lightning strike, etc. Could go so far as to implement fire tornadoes and similar extreme weather if such-and-such conditions are met."
l0wds5,Post-apocalyptic game where you scavenge procedurally-generated abandoned houses for supplies and in the process get a glimpse into the lives of the people who used to live there,"You play as one of the few survivors of an apocalyptic event that wiped out most of humanity, wandering around a deserted city trying to scavenge supplies to keep yourself alive against the threats of the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nWhat makes the game stand out is that the supplies are found by breaking into any of the (hundreds of? thousands of?) long-abandoned houses and apartments in the city, whose insides are all procedurally generated. While you are searching the rooms you catch small glimpses of the lives of the people who once lived there: a family picture with one of the faces scratched out, a diary hidden under the daughter's bed, an engraved wedding ring on top of a dresser, a grave for the family dog in the backyard.\n\nThe exact nature of the apocalypse and the threats you need to face can be anything: weather, zombies, monsters, etc. They are mostly there to add challenge and give you an incentive to go scavenging inside the houses, and to create a contrast between your character's present life and the lives of the people who lived there before.\n\nOf course, the game would rely heavily on the writing and on the procedure for randomly generating the houses, which would have to avoid repetition and strive for some degree of realism. It would be nice to have some variety between houses in terms of previous inhabitants: families, couples, single parents, bachelors, elderly people, people of different economic backgrounds. Ideally there should also be some interconnectedness between different elements within the same house; for example, in the house with the dog's grave in the backyard the daughter's diary might include the day her parents brought the dog home for the first time. There could also be interconnectedness between neighboring houses; for example, an engraved wedding ring matching the one on the dresser might be found on the floor of their next-door neighbor's bedroom, indicating that they were having an affair."
l0urp5,"Horror, Action game","I have had this idea for quite a while now and I only really think about it while I am walking my dog.\n\nMy game idea is a Single player / Multiplayer game based in a small rural village. There will be A runner and 2 or 3 farmers (the chasers) I have not thought of the main objective but the goal will be to access something inside one of the 3 farms. \n\nAs the runner you will have to collect weapons, food and other general supplies. You will have to hide and most importantly, run from the farmers. You would be fast and weak.\n\nAs the farmer you will have to find the Runner, you will be big and strong but slow, there is a chance of having a quad bike, you must track down the runner and catch or kill them, you could set traps or distractions. The 3 Farmers could either work together to catch the runner, or they could work alone.\n\nThe runner would have to remain quiet and would have to leave clue to where they are, they can hide in houses, sheds, inside a school or in the woods. Their resources would be limited, limited ammo, limited food and water, limited storage, you get the point. Looting houses or shops would be almost essential so you could not spend the whole game hiding. The runner would have to be careful. Footsteps can be heard. Tracks can be followed, and any lights you leave on or doors you leave open can and will give away your position.\n\nThe Farmer(s) would be able to have an update every few minutes of the rough area the runner is in. On the odd chance the Farmer will have a quad bike the runner will be aware of this by the noise and the headlights that would beam in the sky.\n\nIf you were to play this by your self you could be a runner with AI farmers, or the other way round.\nI think the multiplayer is pretty self explanatory, Real people will play the Runner and the Farmers. Proximity chat is optional.\n\nIf you are wondering about the type of landscape I am thinking of you can look at ‘Spittal in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire’ on google earth\n\nThis is my first time so please be harsh, I need constructive criticism\n\nPlease give your view on this idea in the comments👍👍"
l0tb4s,"A game where you platform up towers to rig a bomb to the top. However, you must also get down again in 30 seconds or you’ll die in the explosion.","To get down fast enough, you have mini-bombs to blow up pathways in the floors and fall down. You have to space them out a bit, too many will kill you from fall damage.\n\nBasically, you need to plan to get down in 30 seconds with your mini-bombs without causing fall damage. There’ll also be new hazards along the way. Every 5 towers there can be a Boss Race, where you must race the CEO down and keep them at bay with more mini-bombs, but make sure they don’t help them down."

l0nsuy,Reverse Post,"Hi guys! I'm in a bit of a predicament. Unlike most posts on this sub that have an idea and no game, I actually have a game and no ideas! I have implemented many of the things I wanted in my game but I don't feel like its enough content. Therefor, here is your opportunity to bounce some ideas off me and maybe have them implemented. Here's the game so far.\n\nYou control a colony of ants, managing their actions. You unlock different tiers of buildings, and I research tree governs how and when you unlock things. You need to gather resources and put your ants into different buildings to research new things, breed more ants, forge new items, or produce new foods. There are currently three tiers of buildings/rooms, each one getting progressively more difficult to set up and produce. However, I have run out of ideas for cool mechanics or ideas that make the game worth playing longer term. If this was a game that you were playing, what would be a super cool end game goal? What would make you keep playing and prevent the ""get resources and build stuff"" loop less boring? Also, if you have any ideas that you think would be really cool, let me know and I'll see what I think.\n\nSome gameplay and reference footage can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/kyovwv/the_pathfinding_of_your_ants_make_some_crazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
l0il1c,Gunblade + Shield VR Boomer Shooter,"It would be a bullet hell boomer shooter with the controls should be as simple and intuitive as possible. Run, jump duck and intuitively user your arms to attack and defend.\n\nIn your dominant hand you've got a gunblade and in your other hand you've got a small shield. Despite the simplicity the combat could have quite a lot of depth. \n\nThe shield could deflect projectiles (back at enemies if you aim well). Powerful projectiles and attacks would require you to use the shield's momentum to fully block and you could also shield strike enemies. Maybe the grip button could be used to throw the shield like a boomerang causing high damage but leaving you vulnerable until it returns.\n\nThe gunblade could be swung like a sword as well as using the trigger to shoot, maybe the grip button could be held down for an alternate fire mode such as charged shot or autofire. The blade could also be used to block/deflect it could potentially hit projectiles back at enemies faster than the shield but would require more precision.\n\nIn Melee the blade would do more damage than the shield and have more range but the shield would stun enemies and leave them more vulnerable to the blade.\n\nTo keep things fresh and fun there would be upgrades and temporary powerups in various places but never in a way which interrupts the flow of combat."
l0iaaw,An RPG where each Party Member's sanity effects battle,"Every party member's abilities cause them pain or side effects, affecting them in different magnitudes  corresponding to the power of the abilities.  \n\n\nSanity affects each member differently according to their personality, a more aggressive character would have higher damage but have defense drops corresponding to their sanity, while a more passive character may lose heart in battle and slow down, or weaken their attacks. Like emotions in OMORI.  \n\n\n(Maybe some abilities can have a configurable power used, where effectivity increases along with Sanity lost.)  \n\n\nAt a certain point, you might lose control of the characters due to their sanity, and may attack party members or harm themselves.\n\nTo counteract this, certain actions can be done in and outside battle to ease each members sanity, such as taking a break, meditating, et cetera. There should be some items or actions that can be used to calm members down in battle, some more effective only for a certain party member due to their personality traits or personal likes/dislikes, so learning each character's personality is useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe some abilities can be extremely powerful, but permanently affects the user's stats or minimum sanity threshold. Think like the JOY pills from LISA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSanity may not need to be completely negative, think of it as stress, an acceptable of amount of stress would focus a person, making them more effective, although too much can break them.  \n\n\nThats all from me, have a nice day yall :)"
l0d8m2,Apocalyptic/Post apocalyptic game set in our timeline.,"So. To make the idea work in a timeline compatible with ours, instead of Covid, we got a different virus, more viral, but instead of causing an infection like Covid, it causes people to lose their minds.\n\nA sort of viral mental break, if that makes sense. Driving it's victims slowly hysteric, paranoid, and eventually, psychotic.\n\nPretty much unstoppable and passed on by careless human transmission.\n\nThis would cause everyone, including the world's leaders to go into a full on nuclear attack on each other.\n\nOnly the most isolated populations would survive.\n\nSome Amish, potentially.\n\nSome communes spread across the world.\n\nThe Faroe Islands, maybe. Iceland, maybe. Greenland, maybe.\n\nSome other small countries, maybe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point of the player in this game would be to either partake as a member of any of the factions standing. Taking on a role or multiple roles in helping their community survive, evolve, as well as taking on the struggles and adaptations necessary to survive in a world gone to shit.\n\nI could very well forsee the first 50-100 years happening in almost total darkness, which would mean only the ones well prepared and equipped to take on this kind of event would be the ones to prosper. That might upon further inspection rule out the Amish as their lack of technological awareness would most likely be their downfall."

kzzcvc,A new type of RTS (possibly),I’ve noticed that historically their are conflicts between two states with the goal of gaining a third entity as a client state as opposed to conquering or annihilating the third entity. I think this could be a fun core mechanic for an RTS game where players don’t get eliminated but instead when their army is defeated in battle they become the client state of the conqueror.
kzu02n,Game idea I once had (simplified),"So before I get into the idea I want to make it clear that I have given up on game design a few years ago so if anyone likes and wants to use this idea for any reason feel free to do so.\n\nThe game would be set in a future setting (the world would contain both magic and advanced technology) where a dictator has declared war on the world and has taken over almost everything. you play as a specially made soldier who doesn't remember his childhood and was trained to be the very best. You had been tasked by this dictator to lead an assault on the last 3 areas that haven't been taken over.\n\nThe areas would include:\n\n* a few small villages surrounded by mountains with a huge forest that separates them and is protected by a powerful Guardian of the forest (The Sanctuary)\n* an advanced city of hackers where hacking has become so advanced that they use hacks in the real world (Hackcity)\n* a stronghold where refugees are protected by a once rich yet mysterious man that has tried his best to save as many people as possible.(The resistance)\n\nThe game would have a unique mechanic where you choose which area you go to first, second and third but the order of which would impact the other areas, and the ending.\n\nThis would be a game similar to dark souls where you equip your character with gear and weapons and you will be able to hire people to help you take over these territories while fighting bosses.\n\nAs previously mentioned the most unique mechanic would be that the order tou take would impact the ending of the game kind of imitating undertale in a way)\n\nIf the game was made this would now go into spoiler territory (but since it isn't it doesn't matter).\n\nThis is how each area would go:\n\n**The Sanctuary**\n\n* The main story would be that as you slowly take over the city the forest Guardian sends beings to stop you. At the beginning he would simply make the forest attack you, send small tree creatures, basic stuff. I won't put in too many details so I'll just get onto the bosses.\n* Boss 1: the hunter and his wife from the first town who would use his shotgun and his wife 2 revolvers to shoot you while sending wolves at you.\n* Boss 2: a giant living tree sent by the forest Guardian to defend the third town\n* Boss 3: a damned spirit that was brought from hell by the guardian after the take over of the first town to try and convince you to stop(follows you almost from the start), when seeing that his efforts weren't doing anything after the take over of the third town he would grow to a massive size and begin to fight you (a boss a few minutes after another boss to out simply)\n* Boss 4: a powerful weather serpent made of thunder clouds that prevents you from going to the last town safely forcing you to climb a mountain where 3 statues of the godly serpent reside. There a battle would start where the serpent would take over each statues to protect its weak body from projectiles until finally being defeated.\n* Boss 5(final boss): the guardian, after the take over of the final town all that is left is to kill the forest itself which the Guardian lives in and protects, this would be a 2 stage fight that would have 2 endings if this is the final area you took over, if not the fight would be a 1 stage fight where the guardian dies at the end ( the ending are one where you kill the guardian and another where u end at the first stage by realizing what you are doing is wrong and joining the guardian to end the reign of this tyrannical dictator)\n\n**Hackcity**\n\n* this city would be a heavily advanced tech giant ( a massive developed city) where almost everyone is a professional coder and is run by the master hacker, to get to the master hacker the player would need to make his/her way into the places with the core computers to put themself in the virtual world and destroy the guardian programs that create a field protecting the master hacker's tower. Now onto the bosses.\n* Boss 1: a Virus with a material body that would duplicate and use stuns and slows in the fight\n* Boss 2: the player would enter being surrounded by 4 literal trojan horses that would send slow moving homing projectiles. To defeat the boss you would need to attack the correct trojan horse in order to break it (there would be a small difference that indicates which is the correct one)\n* Boss 3: This boss would start with the game crashing and an error message would pop up, if the player didn't exit the game after a few seconds the player would be able to move again but with an error message still on the screen, if the player keeps moving you would see behind the error message, the boss battle against the glitch  would occur once the player starts shooting at the error message destroying it and revealing a glitched orb. The battle would be simple with the orb spawning enemies and turning into an error message to gain a shield after taking damage\n* Boss 4: This would be a battle against the program itself, rather than fighting a physical boss it would simply be you trying to exit the virtual world while the program changes your controls every minute and occasionally spawns an enemy or 2\n* Boss 5(final boss): the master hacker, the final battle would have the master hacker use various hacks such as aimbot, walking through walls, invincibility, flight, teleportation, etc. The master hacker would actually be aware that he is in a game and at the half way point would freeze your character forcing you to enter the source code and delete the freeze character code to continue the fight. If this is the first area after the final battle you would actually have to try and kill every enemy in the entire city as the master hacker would program this objective before death so you can't escape. If it is the final area he would also abuse the load and save mechanics of the game aswell as change your items to make you weaker.\n\n**The Resistance**\n\n* this area would be less taking place in the stronghold itself and more the player taking out he major people from the resistance. Now for the bosses.\n* Boss 1: the resistance army general, this boss would have you take on the biggest army in the resistance that includes tanks, armoured trains and helicopters, the general would be a buff soldier with an upgraded machine gun acting as a one man army, he would also use grenades and a shotgun.\n* Boss 2: the engineers, the main weapon makers they would hop into a massive mech before the battle that is heavily armoured with a flamethrower, missiles, plasma blasters, and a shock shooter.\n* Boss 3: the mistress, this would be a woman skilled in sword fighting, you would have to fight her and her apprentices as she uses her high tech dual sword and throwing knives to fight you.\n* Boss 4(final boss): the leader, this fight would take place on the elevator taking you down to the stronghold as the leader attempts to stop you from entering, at the start he would disarm you from all your long range weapons in a cut scene so this would be a purely melee 2 stage fight with a physically strong man skilled in melee combat, in the second stage the man would reveal that he is a cyborg and would have all his stats buffed significantly aswell as using laser eyes aswell as a shockwave by punching the elevator floor. If this Is the final area the elevator would having hazards such as saws and electrical fields. Once the boss is defeated he would explode. The ending if this is the final area would also have a cut scene with the elevator stopping and as your character makes his/her way into the stronghold the leader would stand up to crush your neck from behind with his cybernetic hand, killing you and saying ""you can't defeat me"" in a menacing yet tired tone.\n\n*I didn't want this to be too long so I left out many details I thought of, feel free to ask any questions and any feedback is more than welcome as I know that this idea is by no means amazing and I possibly didn't explain it too well. Thank you for reading*"
kzjyhn,I want to make a game with a Cupid/Angel Character. Do you mind if I get some feedback?,"So basically I want to make a game for Valentine's day about love. I'm currently designed around the Cupid character. So far I only have a few gameplay concepts.\n\nA Hack and Slash/Platformer with Cupid. The main goal would be to reassembled the shattered master heart and killing depression. The player would take control of cupid along with cupid's bow, Sword, shield and wings. Cupid would only have one HP before death and enemies would be designed to fall to certain techniques/combos.\n\n I have had many ideas with this concept with one having the player control two characters with the analog sticks and using combinations of team attacks/synergy to fight such as using the 2nd character's launcher move to launch an enemy up in the air for the 1st character to dash to. this could also help in platforming with using team up moves. this also gives story ideas such as Cupid's heart being broken or maybe its a classic spin on Cupid and Psyche. \n\nA Final idea I have is a 3D Bullet hell game sort of like this [example](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222050/Touhou_Mechanical_Scrollery/). Now this game would take advantage of cupid's wings and arrows. I would also give cupid a mini shield ability for obviously reasons. This would share some mechanics from the hack and slash concept above with the difference being the enemy design, flight being the focus and move set being more aerial moves.\n\nI did set up on my base character controller but I kind of struggled with nailing down what the game's core actions would be there's just too many possibilities but I think playing as cupid and spreading love/hope in a way sounds interesting to me. \n\nI would love to hear any thoughts and opinions on this and especially on these concepts or maybe what you would find fun."

kz7o8s,"Casual mobile game: randomly match two or more players and show them a set of choices. If they all make the same choice, they all get a reward, else they get nothing. They cannot communicate.","Basically, a coordination game. Perhaps there's tags like in Omegle. As for what the choices are, I can see this being used for any kind of polling, as a way of gamifying it. One obvious notion for a prototype is to just get random imgur images from the internet, maybe four at a time (can those be filtered to get rid of NSFW ones?), and have the players choose from among those - likely the funniest or most aesthetically pleasing would tend to win. With more than two players, unanimity may not be necessary - rather, the reward may be proportional to the number of other players who made the same choice.\n\nWhat I'm not sure is, what the reward should be or why it would motivate someone to keep playing. It seems too simple. Collectibles of some kind? Resources for use in other minigames? I dunno, give me all your suggestions. If enough people think it's a good concept I may actually try to get a team together to build it."

kytxq6,(AAA) The Flash,"Basically you play the flash with star labs and all of central city in the game aswell, the story would be played out in a structure like spiderman ps4, obviously a different story but in the structure. There would be speedster races like in the show, quicktime events could be use to capture the other or avoid capture during the races. When killed or taken, there could be a cutscene like batman arkham. Like spiderman Ps4 there could be small crimes, like thefts that you could stop. For dlc or something you could go to earth 2, and cities surrounding central city on earth 1. There could be a skill system or some sort of system where the more you run the faster you actually get, i know this might make the game seriously laggy because it would have to load the city really fast but these are all just ideas. There could be appearances of the green arrow and supergirl. Again like spiderman ps4, there could be alternate suits, maybe not suit powers but suits for sure.

But now, again, I need your help in deciding the whats and the hows. I'm thinking bullet-hell with bosses. What comes to mind when you invision this with combat?   \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXZM4S4yGVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXZM4S4yGVU)"
kyswm3,A mobile beat rhythm game,Ok so you start the game off by selecting a music and hitting play and the game waits for you to hold your character to play. You then have to follow the beat by going in the beat sections with your character. There are obstacles (lines and various shapes of beats you need to go through) that block you along the way and if you fail too much the game will stop and tell you that you have failed and you must restart the level.\n\nYou gain characters by playing the game and completing various levels or by purchasing them outright. You can also watch an ad if you failed a level to continue playing from where you left off.\n\nI was also thinking that you could play on various difficulties where the hardest difficulty you would have to use two fingers to play the game.\n\nHere is an example I drew up quick of what I am talking about\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cuFV2pa](https://imgur.com/a/cuFV2pa)
kyrgny,fusion of niche: a genetics survival game and spore with some new mechanics. im open to critique and suggestions on this,"so firstly; the game  would be a turn based strategy game like niche. it would also have a similar genetics system to niche; but it would also have the stages of spore although they would be much less clear cut. also your creatures would never stop evolving throughout the whole game unlike in spore. it would also lack spores creature creation system.\n\nyou would start out in creature stage, witch would have very similar gameplay to niche. you would also have only two resources to manage at this point; food and nesting material. the starting island would be relatively large and have enough resources to last until tribal stage. \n\ntribal stage starts when you get a creature of high enough intelligence (witch is more or less randomized, but the average skyrockets during tribal stage and stays the same afterwards), you can craft a simple tool out of nesting material. only three tools would be available to you right off the bat; a flimsy spear (can be given to a creature and used by them to deal more damage in combat; but can only be used once because of how flimsy a spear made out of nesting material would be), something to allow the creature its assigned to to gather more food at once (i assume this wouldnt normally be being thrown at or hitting something so it can be used more times) and a flimsy axe (witch can only be used one time). the axe unlocks the 'wood' resource. with enough wood, you can craft better, longer lasting versions of the previous tools. but it also lets you craft a pickaxe, witch unlocks the metal resource. maybe there would also be a system where resources could drop from killed enemies/prey/rouge creatures that would be necessary in upgrading your stuff\n\nthe metal versions of these tools are the best versions available; the other resources are different.\n\nwith enough wood, you would be able to have your creatures craft a house. if you have your creatures sleep in a house, they cant be attacked during the night or be effected by any other hazards that might come about. eventually, you would also be able to craft stone and metal houses. you can never change what a house is made of, but you can upgrade it to make it more comfterble for your creatures. the different house types have different upgrades (some of witch would require the other resources), but a fully upgraded house will always give a creature that sleeps in it an extra movement point (in niche, creatures can only move or perform actions three times before they fall asleep and become unusable for the day) for the next day. i feel like it should also have some form of bonus related to reproduction and birthing, but im not sure what exactly.\n\nif you get enough wood (metal boats might be a thing but idk), you can craft a boat and put some of your creatures and a portion of resources on it (the more wood used, the bigger the boat, the more creatures and resources). this boat will sail off to a new island, but unlike in niche the creatures on the old island dont just vanish from your game when you sail off.\n\nwhen you sail away for the first time, you unlock a button that lets you switch between your islands. with enough wood, you can build a peir and connect it to any other island (only one island per pier, you dont have to build one on the target island), allowing you to ferry creatures and resources between islands. when an island no longer has any of your creatures on it, its removed from your list of islands. however, you can still use any peirs connected to it to recolonize the island.\n\ngoing back to resources, when a rock is mined, it will produce some resources, the amount always being a multiple of three. rock is the most common, metal is uncommon, and coal is rare.\n\ncoal can be used to upgrade houses (and maybe other buildings if i make those a thing) with coal stoves and stuff. i dont have many other ideas for civ stage but electricity is a thing.\n\nwith enough electricity and metal, you can have your creatures build a spaceship. it functions similarly to boats, but the ship itself works as an island of sorts. instead of just being a travel mechanic, you still play your creatures while theyre on theyre on the ship. you have a chance to come accross planets to beam a portion of your creatures down to.  these colonies start in civ stage, but otherwise it basically works like the game before space stage. you can switch between your planets and islands still.\n\nthere are sapient alien creatures on the other planets. diplomacy is a thing, and you can breed with the aliens for new genes.\n\nthe alien worlds would have biomes the features of witch are essentially randomly generated. so you might get a biome where it snows sometimes, but you also get wildfires and puddles that spawn clouds of mosquitos. this is not how it works in niche.\n\nconcepts that may or may not be things:\n\nother groups of creatures and diplomacy on the homeworld\n\nwar\n\nagriculture\n\nbuildings other than houses"
kyqfai,"What would you expect from a Game, where you are a Druid, fighting back civilization to protect nature?","I am currently exploring this concept as a game after reading it here.\n\nIn the Game you will be a __Druid__, and civilization is destroying ever more nature for its progress.

kyjnym,A game about exorcising a ghost,"So I got massive inspiration from phasmophobia and had a dream about this, I think it’s pretty cool and would love to potentially make it a reality:\n\nThe game is more or less a ghost extermination game, there are several parts to it the first part is you’re given a random objective to collect things that the family left behind or that you need to get rid of the ghost, this could be money, objects, files, toys, ritual items like skulls, candles, salt, etc. These things can be found as you explore the house/map and look for them, be careful though because the more things that you remove from the place the angrier the ghost gets.\n\nThe second part of the game happens after you’ve found all the objects, depending on what type of ghost it is, which you do know at the beginning, depends on the way you are supposed to get rid of it. The different ways are a ritual, salt, exorcism, etc. once you complete this part the game ends and you’re given a score based on the value of objects you collected in part one as well as how fast you completed the entire thing.\n\nThere is money around the map that you can collect for later use in the game. You can purchase different things that you may need that can take time to find in the game like extra flashlight batteries or starting with some salt.\n\nYou can never actually see the ghost, the ghost is always invisible, sometimes though you can see the shadow of it. It can do things like hide under a bed, whisper/yell in your ear, turn on and off lights, even open, close, and slam doors. The more objects you take from the house and the longer you stay in the house or around the area that the ghost is in, the angrier it gets making it more likely to do the things mentioned above. As it gets angrier it’s more capable of things, such as writing things, speaking to you, throwing things across the room including items that are required for you to advance, making items seem to disappear (the item is relocated to a different room), and even shaking the entire house if it’s really upset.\n\nThere are also puzzles in the game relating to the exorcism of the ghost, in order to get rid of the ghost you have to do a puzzle, these care given to you though an object that you find in the game which tells you what you need to rid the ghost in the form of a riddle. It tells you things one by one so as you collect stuff it gives a new riddle until all items for the ritual/exorcism have been collected.\n\nYou can also interact with nearly every object in the game. You can wind up alarm clocks, pick up noise makers, Jack in the boxes etc. which can be used to draw the ghost to one room, giving you some time to explore other parts of the map, the angrier the ghost is the quicker it will deactivate something that makes noise."

ky7qs0,Ark survival evolved with clash of clans formula on mobile,"If you ever played ark survival evolved then this would actually a pretty good game to have the clash of clans style on mobile. You could build your base/walls with the same materials thatch/wood/stone/metal/Tek. Have the defences like turrets and different types of villagers with melee or weapons in ark. And when you attack you can use all the different dinos in ark including the mechs, titans etc. clans would be replaced with tribes. Just an idea I had and thought would be cool to see one day."
ky6dnk,Vampire's Creed (Assassins Creed + Vampires),"Ofc the name is just a nice pun but here me out:  \n  \nImagine a game with Assassin's Creed like mechanics and the fantasy of being a vampire.\nI noticed there are not many freeroam vampire games with solid mechanics. The new Bloodlines game looks ok but worried about the development from rumors I head.  \n  \nOk so let me go down a few things:  \n  \n*  You are a vampire, hence you can climb buildings, the setting could be an urban or city enviroment, lots of allyways and people. The combat will be a mix of action and also the ""counter"" style gameplay seen in some Ubisoft games, the counters will be dodges of bullets and silver weaponry. There would be a stealth element of course and is the main way to feed, however you can also do combat feeding if you counter perfectly.  \n  \n*  You seem ""human"" so you can walk around and blend into the enviroment, however your bloodlust decreases overtime and you have to escape to an ally or out of sight before your ""vampiric charm"" wears off and people start noticing you.  \n  \n*  The game is about luring people and feeding on them, battling different clans, the more you feed the greater your ability points. I had the idea like you can ""climb buildings"" but after a while, you gain a dash to make it quicker, then eventually you can run up them.   \n  \n*  If you attract too much attention you will get chased by authorities then the ""vampire hunting"" association, they will send advanced weapons and usually wont stop until you are dead or if you go back into hiding, they might also crack down on the whole sector and you will witness your clan fighting them in random areas. \n     \n*  vampire hunters use weapons that are more effective on you and are more deadly, however you can take advantage of their weapons to fight other vampires too. Vampires clans maybe have their own ""wanted system"" and their own weapons and abilities.  \n  \n*  A multiplayer aspect could be either a fully open world experience with clans fighting each other or perhaps a more intimate Vampire Hunter mode where you have to find 1 vampire as 4 vampire hunters.  \n  \n*  I want the roleplay aspect of a being a vampire to be a part of it like how AC Black Flag made you feel like a pirate. So the story should have that fantasy be realised, maybe have a different story based on which clan you pick or maybe as simply as a good or bad vampire.  \n  \n*  Each clan will have their own signature abilties and maybe their own looks. They have their own territories and I am imaginging the ""post end game"" to be basically a game of territory claiming, kinda like with GTA San Andreas. There could be dynamic quests to hijack a bloodvan and also to disrupt vampire hunters and vampire clans operations. Maybe even a dynamic hunting mechanic where you have to find 1 specific human and feed off them.\nMaybe as well, you can have a ""Blood Council"" faction of Vampires that are the ones that internationally keep watch on all other vampires in order to try and keep their existance secret. They can maybe be the ones that send vampire agents to try and kill you if you have too high of a profile, having their own unique equipment and their own powers.   \n  \n*  Perhaps a day-night cycle could be implemented, where you have to keep low profile in alleyways, but it might also just be a nuisance to gameplay and feel like an un-needed hurdle. There would need to be something you can do during the day that at night you can't. Perhaps an underground  section of the city opens up as vampires retreat for the day? Like sewers and stuff? Who knows.  \n  \n*  It would be cool to find like, other mythical creatures hiding in the city, I even through of a ""werewolf"" character that maybe can be a DLC mini-story afterwards that you can play through. It doesn't just need to be vampires, could be the whole spectrum and all having their own abilities!  #\n  \nSo yeah what do you think? I've had this idea for the past couple of days."
ky62e6,Need a multiplayer horror game idea,"I am a programmer working on a project making a game on unity for me and the boys. I want it to be a multiplayer horror game but I cant think of something. I am looking for something similar to Phasmophobia, that has that scary puzzle aspect to it. Any ideas would be appreciated."
ky3j58,My post apocalyptic survival game idea,"You start as a Gunsmith entrepreneur and survivalist expert, you're at your shop one day when on the television you hear a broadcast explaining that there's a giant asteroid heading for the planet and its too late to do anything. That there is approximately 76 hours until impact. You have 60 hours to gather any supplies you need and get to the bunker that you had built just in case anything like this happened. Then once you gather everything you need you go down, you had it specially made to go 40 feet underground. You already had enough food to feed 2 people for 6 months comfortably, but your wife divorced you 7 months ago. If you do choose to ration the food you have, it could last you 2 years. \n\nYou can have a look outside every two months to see if it is safe to go out and look for supplies or weapons, but until then you have to keep your senses and skills somehow. So you use the small gym that you have in your bunker to stay in shape, and the small rock climbing wall to keep up those skills too. You also maintain a small garden down there so you have fresh stuff, because most of the food you bought was not very healthy but was high on calories and lasted a long time. \n\nOnce you are abel to go back outside, you see that the world has gone into a state of nuclear winter. So if you're going to be outside, you need a base to protect you from the elements. You first need to check your surroundings for supplies, tools, weapons and to see whats left of the small town that you once lived in. So you go to grab your winter gear and any weapon that you have, no telling what dangers await you. You shortly find out that an alien race has come to your world and made base domes and took any surviving people as slaves and prisoners. \n\nNot too long after you make that discovery, you are knocked out. You wake up in a place you recognize, it's your old buddy's basement. Where you and him would spend hours together, working on projects or playing video games. He doesn't recognize you, because from you being underground for 18 months it has changed the way you look just enough that you're unrecognizable. However you somehow convince him that its you, and that you aren't trying to hurt him. So he tells you whats going on and anything else you need to know. You have a choice to stay together and have better chance of fighting off anyone or anything that comes, or stay separate and only together in extreme emergencies so you have less chance of getting found.\n\n\nBut to put it like that, this is my idea that i hope someone can bring to life."

kxxdmr,Small multiplayer game with a twist,"I have this idea that I can't put into a real game since I don't have enough knowledge in 3D games. Basically, it's a competitive game where the weapons are what you find in the map. It can be a pencil, a plate, even a chair. You can fight with most of the map. \n\nThe twist is that you have the power to teleport yourself around by clicking on the mini-map. Each time you teleport, you lose your actual equipment. So when you teleport next to a player to kill him, you need to grab the first thing you see. It's a bit of a decision game where you choose if you take the risk or not.\n\nI DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A GAME WITH RANKS!!!\nThe idea is made to be fun and NOT competitive. The goal is to have fun with friends or online stranger. (Maybe bots) \n\nI don't expect to have huge map. Something the size of a house is ok. I would make this game free, but you can sell it if you want.\n\nThat's all I had to say. Sorry if there is some errors, I'm not an English speaker. Thank you!"
kxwtub,My Nightmare could be turned into a game. (Ocean based),"Literally 30 minutes ago I woke up from a nightmare where the plot could have massive potential to be a unique, never before seen game concept / concept setting for a game.\n\nFeel free to create your own storyline to my nightmare.\n\nI only jotted down what I remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ocean Nightmare Concept Art](https://imgur.com/gallery/wQMwjdN)  \*\*\* &lt;--- Click Link to visualize my nightmare as I explain it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Character:** Normal human being. Can breathe water and air.\n\n**Setting 1:** Deep, Dark, Vast ocean. All landmarks are upscale &amp; massive. The waters give of a ""nightmareish"" type of vibe. Your character swims and breathes water when in the vast ocean.\n\n**Setting 2:** Bottom of ocean floor. Gives off a false sense of reality, as if you're back on land w/ clear blue skies. Your character walks and breathes air when on the ocean floor.\n\n**Transition Point:** The layers between Setting 1 &amp; Setting 2. Crossable at any point in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Game Start:** Walk into the ocean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Monster 1:** Lives in Setting 1. A massive shark/monster the size of a ship. Mouth shaped as a black hole. Incredibly viscous, relentless, and fast. It's main purpose is to locate &amp; kill you.\n\n**Civilian Puppets:** Lives in Setting 2. Any living soul on the ocean floor. They look like normal people, animals, etc. Because Monster 1 cannot cross into the ocean floor, it uses the normal civilians as puppets to kill you / force you back into setting 1. If a living soul has you in their sight for more than 5 seconds, they will transform into viscous monsters w/ the demeanor of zombies from ""I am Legend"". Their main goal is to kill you / force you back into the vast ocean (setting 1) where monster 1 is waiting to kill you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to Transition Between Setting 1 &amp; 2:** When in the vast ocean, Monster 1 knows where you are at all times. However, you can hide from monster 1 within the false sense of reality... That is the ocean floor. You do this by swimming through the transition layer (located 10 meters above the ocean floor), which passes you into the false sense of reality, that is the ocean floor. You can then re-enter the ocean, by climbing buildings / landmarks large enough to reach the transition layers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Weapons:** In the ocean, items/weapons are weightless and can be thrown at very high speeds. However, on the ocean floor, the weapons became it's realistic weight to your human character."
kxstm6,A supernatural sci-fi action game with survival horror elements.,"Story:\nYou're a space-faring mercenary that was sent to a research facility. Before losing contact, they reported had a breakthrough in their efforts to reverse-engineer the the technology of an extinct civilization of ancient extraterrestrials that harnessed an unknown fundamental force to pretty much invent magic. The last thing they reported was they may have found what caused the civilization's downfal, so they sent an expert in combating biohazardous creatures.\n\nGameplay:\nYou have to explore the ruins of the facility and the ruins it's connected to using a little puzzle-solving and parkour-based platforming, all while combating biohazardous creatures that infest them and the malfunctioning robots.\nEarly on, you discovere the fruits the scientist's research. They call it the Focus and by loading Catalysts into it you can harness all kinds of supernatural abilities like emitting energy in various forms of bullets, creating various melee weapons of altered energy, unleashing various forms of transformed energy such as fire, ice, lightning, wind, acid, poison, and gravity, harnessing a few utility based abilities like switching positions with a object, telekineticall lifting and throwing large objects, fixed-point hovering, gliding, limited flight, and immobilizing moving objects, and creating subservient energy beings called guardians. New cores are found by exploring along with HP and Stamina upgrades, and upgrades to the Focus allowing for more Cores to be loaded at once and the ability to link to Utility Cores which can modify the player's actions depending on what cores they're linked to.\n\nThe Monster:\nEventually, the player discovers what ruined the place even with such powerful technology at the researcher's disposal: an anomalous bio-mechanical being called the Selector. The Selector can't be killed, but it can be temporarily chased off, however every time you do so it becomes impervious to what you used to defeat it. You can choose to hide from it, trap it, or distract it with various gimmicks in the game world, but these only work once as well. Your only saving grace is that the Selector's body is only suited for traversing its current area, every time you move to a new one it has to load its mind into a new body with a different form and capabilities but doing so resets its immunities and adaptations.\n\nThe Goal:\nYou have to explore each area finding the researcher's data hidden throughout. You can move on by collecting a certain number of data caches in each area, but collecting them all unlocks the best ending and final boss.\n\nThe Final Boss and Best Ending:\nAfter a while, the Selector gathers enough data to evolve into a Perfect Form, and its first act upon being encountered is to destroy your Focus and all your Cores. But shortly after you realize that you've grown so accustomed to wielding them that you realize your body naturally produces the fundamental energy that they and their abilities run on, along with every living creature in the universe. After harnessing it, you have a final showdown with the Selector and upon destroying it for good you go onto teach the rest of humanity how to wield the energy and they go on to colonize the rest of the universe and eventually create new life to populate it."

kxr87g,"A game like the modern Hitman games, except with ""silent drop-in multiplayer"" (you aren't told how many players are sharing your world or who they are) and any player can get bonus scores for making another player get caught.","It's a stealth game in levels full of NPCs and you start each single-player mission with a randomized character appearance. **It's not an assassination game;** rather, your story mission objectives range from things like stealing documents and finding a target's password, to planting bugs in a room and reverse-pickpocketing to plant evidence on an NPC. You still have some non-lethal combat options which are mostly used to steal disguises.\n\nThe twist is that you can be dropped into a level that already has other players hidden in it going about their own story missions.\n\n####You can't assassinate each other.\n\nInstead, if you spot some NPC acting like a human *you can report them.* You see, a main feature of this game is the ability to mislead guards (and other NPCs) by walking up to them and reporting suspicious activity. You get a prompt to give them a description and/or location, which leads them investigate or call it in (which in turn might clear a path for you if they leave). If your shenanigans lead to them getting caught, you get a sweet bonus. You might even disguise yourself as a guard NPC to scare them into trouble if you're confident they won't realize you're just another player.\n\nThere are other ways to mess with other players, such as throwing something loud near them, locking doors on them or planting a tracking device in their pocket (inventory), to name a few examples. Finding other players is a little rare (especially since they tend to be blending in as best they can), but it's just common enough that you're always on edge."
kxoe8q,"Alright... let's try this again, shall we?","#Hey there. So uh... I think there was a misunderstanding with my recent thread. I actually need suggestions for additional ideas. So I would be happy if you had any to share. This is the main point of this post.\n\nSo I had this idea for a while, which won't ever happen because of the amount of resources it would require, about a Final Fantasy-inspired series of JRPGs. Among other things, there are 2 features that stand out the most, and are a staple in every entry in the franchise, those being the probability-based combat system and the discovery system which is how the player discovers new things in the games.\n\nFrom what I have realized, all the discovery systems that I came up with fall under 4 categories\n\n**Standalone Object Discovery (SOD)** - There are\n\n**Combination-Based Discovery (CBD)** - A system where the player takes 2 or more object and combines them, resulting in a unique effect.\n\n**Observation-Based Discovery (OBD)** - A system where the player is required to observe their environment and choose an\nobject of desire. This system, for the most part, requires the player to use their imagination.\n\n**Time-Based Discovery (TBD)** - A system where objects reveal themselves to the player based on real time.\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nAnyways, I'm trying to come up with new ideas for both the combat system, which is based on a real-life aspect that already exist, and the discovery system. The problem is, I am dry out of ideas at this point. So I would like to hear what kind of ideas you, my fellow Redditors, might have with the prerequisites that I have set.\n\nThis is more or less the entries that I currently have in the series. It is a summarized version of how each system works, since if I had to describe them entirely, it would take more out of me.\n\n\n\n\n#1st Entry\n\nCombat System: Dice; higher rolls means more hits\n\nDiscovery System: 200 characters; just go around and find them (SOD)\n\n\n\n\n#2nd Entry\n\nCombat System: Unique system of combinations with 3 types and 3 numbers with 27 different results\n\nDiscovery System: 8 characters go around and place objects in designated locations to receive a summon, with 27 different summon per character (CBD)\n\n\n\n\n#3rd Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on Poker; different hands yield different effects\n\nDiscovery System: Characters (amount to be determined) go around and transform objects, either everyday or peculiar, into creatures. Approx. amount of creatures: 200 (OBD)\n\n\n\n\n#4th Entry\n\nCombat System: Most likely based on either Pai Gow or just Dominoes\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. There are 21 statuettes to collect; two can be combined, for a total of 210 different results (CBD)\n\n\n\n\n#5th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on Chess; a deviation from the usual probability-based combat system\n\nDiscovery System: Most likely has 2 playable characters. The player goes around and places objects in peculiar locations to summon mercenaries (OBD)\n\n\n\n\n#6th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on Russian Roulette\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) gains different powers based on how long they waited in real time from a designated location, up to a maximum of 216 hours (9 days) (TBD)\n\n\n\n\n#7th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based around the Gregorian Calendar, most likely to be probability-based\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined.

kxdcub,Why does health or mana have to have non-negative real numbers / integers as values? Some more exotic choices...,"The most obvious choice would be to allow negative amounts of health or mana. Negative health might have something to do with undeath, a weird perverse state of being where healing potions bring you closer to death (defined as zero health) and damage from enemies makes you stronger. Maybe a world with living and undead beings side by side, with a matter-antimatter sort of relationship - the undead can harm the undead by attacking, the living can harm the living, but perversely, when either tries to attack the other, they heal instead.\n\nMore weirdly, you might try using values in a cyclic group - the most obvious choice being the circle group - which for non-mathy people is ""pretend that 0=1 and the number line rolls up into a circle"". Then full health = no health (i.e. death), and healing too much would actually damage you - but if an enemy tried some sort of overkill attack, it would actually heal you instead by wrapping your health around ""below zero"" to a high number close to 1! This could be the outcome of an eldritch ritual that makes you a creature beyond standard laws of nature.\n\nAnother choice would be a two-dimensional health bar. (Health square? Health circle?) The origin, or a small circle centered on it, would be death, and every other point would be a distinct health state. Attacks or healings would be vectors added to your health, with attacks tending to move it closer to origin, and healing tending to move it further away, but by some sort of ""life force rotation"" mechanic you might shield yourself, diverting an attack and turning it into something that heals you - but of course, your enemies can too. Or, if they can manipulate your life field, an enemy could curse you to take ""damage"" from a health potion this way. That said, you could ""spiral around the drain"" indefinitely without actually reaching death at the origin, if you're very careful!\n\nWeirdest of all, perhaps, might be health (note, any of these could apply to mana, currency, or any other value also, of course) that takes values on a tree - such as the free group on two generators. (Set of all expressions with two types of symbols that look like ""2a+3b-a+2b"" etc.) Reaching zero / death (the empty string) would require going backwards on the tree, retracing every step your health bar has taken all the way to zero, which would require the enemy to know your history - but of course, the same thing goes for damaging them. I can't even imagine how to describe that in terms of worldbuilding or meaningful analogies. But it's cool as heck.\n\nFeel free to use these ideas or not use them, however you like. But I love putting weird math stuff into game designs!"
kxbp5e,The King's Chef - Medieval Fantasy Cooking and Combat in VR,"Worldbuilding: In a toon-like medieval fantasy world where fruits and vegetables are animate creatures and meat is primarily sourced from large untamable beasts, those who walk the culinary path are revered as champions of flavor, hunger, and thirst. In this world, agriculture is limited due to the trivial number of domesticated animals and ""safe-to-grow"" produce. Lower class cooks may purchase their ingredients from the local markets, but the highest quality ingredients can only be found in the wild. To the best chefs, cooking is only half the skillset; hunting, trapping, prepping, and transporting fresh ingredients is the other. It is common to find experienced cooks in the wilderness donning culinary themed armor and weapons -- for example: half-plate and leather on top of a chef's uniform, with a cast iron shield and sword-sized kitchen knife.\n\nIntroduction / Tutorial: as the King's personal chef, it is your sworn duty to prepare whatever meal or feast the King and his royal family request. At first, this can be accomplished by hunting for ingredients in forests and meadows surrounding the royal castle, serving as an introductory tutorial for the game's primary mechanics (hunting, trapping, combat, prepping, transporting, and cooking).\n\n* Hunting: searching for and tracking down ingredients by following footprints, unique sounds, etc.\n* Trapping: many of the smaller creatures can be trapped in devices you can purchase from vendors around the map. These may resemble foothold traps, deadfall traps, cage traps, etc. Just set the trap in a viable location and wait.\n* Combat: physical swordplay similar to Blade &amp; Sorcery, or really any VR game with melee combat. Could also include physical archery (with either unlimited or purchased arrows) similar to any VR game that has bows.\n* Prepping: after trapping or slaying a creature, it may need to be skinned, chopped up, etc, in order to store it in a medieval ""food truck"" cart pulled by a trusty, un-killable horse. This cart follows you everywhere you go while outside the castle walls, and serves as an infinitely large storage box to hold your ingredients.\n* Transporting: in addition to serving as a storage box, the aforementioned cart is also used to cook food for yourself and peasants (similar to a modern day food truck) while on the road. Cooking for yourself will provide food you can eat to heal yourself, and cooking for others supplies you with coin to purchase traps and upgrade equipment. This makes transporting ingredients more engaging than simply a long walk between towns. Additionally, sometimes bandits will try to steal your ingredients on the road, forcing you to fight them off lest they steal your hard-earned loot.\n* Cooking: physical cooking in VR. Let your imagination run wild, but keep in mind it is not meant to be a hyper-realistic cooking simulator. Think Job Simulator with a bit more detail.\n\nPlot: after the tutorial section, the King and royal family fall ill with some plague-like disease. The castle is blocked off to prevent further spread, and the King's chef ventures to the hut of an eccentric Kitchen Witch to query about a cure. Luckily, the Kitchen Witch knows of a cure which comes in the form of an exotic stew. The stew requires many ingredients, some mundane (as explored in the introductory section) and some dangerous, the latter taking the form of grand boss battles. You must now travel far and wide across the open-world kingdom to collect these rare ingredients, transport them back to the castle, and cook up a life-saving stew to restore the King."
kxbmev,An RPG where your character's face get's destroyed shortly after going through character creation,"I just randomly had this thought that it would be cool if the next Fallout game had your character be a ghoul (basically a man with melted flesh). I think it would be an interesting twist to put on an RPG where your character experience some form of disfigurement to their face. So players don't feel like all their effort is wasted, maybe the disfigurement works around the facial features and stil produces a somewhat unique look based on the character created. Or it could just replace the face entirely with a default face that is the same for all players; maybe the game has some kind of running theme with finding your identity or something.\n\nAnyway, just thought it would be a cool twist on modern WRPGs."

kx8vox,Master and Commander game,"Sailing Game set during the Napoleonic Wars. *First Person Perspective with no HUD*. Hardcore realistic ship simulator. 1:1 scale of the actual ships in the early 1800s.\n\nI envision a game where you take command of a ship in the Royal Navy and as captain you call the shots. You would have a full crew of interactive AI that move about the ship working and maintaining and creating an atmosphere of actually being on a ship. \n\nYou can play solo or you can play with your friends who will take the roles of the various officers on your ship or you on theirs.\n\nAs Captain, you and your officers (friends) would be responsible for things such as hiring a crew, filling the ship's inventories when at port, and deciding on a voyage, as well as obviously commanding the sip while at sea. \n\nYou start off with a beginner ship and the more successful voyages you complete the higher your rank will climb and the more money you will make. You can then start to acquire newer bigger and better ships. If you are constantly having unsuccessful voyages, then your rank may fall and you will only have access to  smaller/slower ships. Your standing will also dictate the type of AI sailors/marines that you can use for your ship.\n\nYou will also have access to your house while in port and obviously the more money you make the larger and more opulent your house/estate can become. \n\nYou can join a Fleet (clan) that participates in large scale battles or can form convoys for delivery missions, etc. The Admiral of the Fleet will have to purchase a Guild Hall that members can pay into and then congregate at whilst at port. Your Guild can even host Balls where other members of other Fleets can attend in full Battle Dress and meet.\n\nWhen playing as a solo ship by yourself or with your friends the list of voyages you can partake on will be obtained at the Navy Office. Example voyages can include: Escort delivery ship from port a to port b, track and capture a specific vessel, find and eliminate pirates at this location, locate and rescue a damaged ship, patrol this area of water and ensure no enemy ship gets past, help relieve an attack on a port, escort marines to a new fort, bring a naturalist to an island to explore, deliver a messenger to a new prospective trading partner, the possibilities are endless. \n\nDuring a voyage you will have to instruct the crew on the heading to sail, where to stop and resupply, how to wage battle, etc. You will have to delegate to your friends to command their specific sections so for instance you could have a friend in charge of the marines, a friend in charge of the cannons or a section of cannons, a friend in charge of the sails, etc. When you issue a command with the command interface menu the AI crew will then immediately carry out the orders.\n\nYou will have to rely on reading charts to navigate, and weather, sickness, battle with random French/ pirate ships, mutiny, and more will all play a part on determining the outcome of your voyages. Sail too far North and you could be trapped in ice, land on an uninhabited island for resupply and you could be attacked by natives or wild animals, sail into a storm and risk losing you ship and being marooned, run out of supplies and starve... \n\nThe ships can be customized to a large extent and each officer will get their own room. The Captain's quarters/great room at the rear of the ship is where the officers gather in down time or for meals or debates when planning anything. \n\nI could go on and on, but if you've read this far you get the gist of what I'd appreciate in this type of game hopefully. Think Master and Commander movie/ The Terror show. Being able to walk around on those old wooden ships packed to the brim with a bustling crew and sailing with your friends would be extremely pleasing. \n\nI have played SoT, Naval Action, Age of Sail, etc. and none come close to a FPP sailing game that I wish was on the market. Sadly, I know this game is more than likely too large and too complicated to probably work, but I feel like having it on this thread is at least cool for others to read and dream about. Feel free to add other ideas for this game in the comments."
kx62cx,"In a hypothetical universe, I have unlimited time and budget to make a series of JRPGs with special features. But I ran out of ideas and want some of your suggestions","So I had this idea for a while, which won't ever happen because of the amount of resources it would require, about a Final Fantasy-inspired series of JRPGs. Among other things, there are 2 features that stand out the most, and are a staple in every entry in the franchise, those being the probability-based combat system and the discovery system which is how the player discovers new things in the games.\n\nFrom what I have realized, all the discovery systems that I came up with fall under 4 categories\n\n**Standalone Object Discovery (SOD)** - There are\n\n**Combination-Based Discovery (CBD)** - A system where the player takes 2 or more object and combines them, resulting in a unique effect.\n\n**Observation-Based Discovery (OBD)** - A system where the player is required to observe their environment and choose an\nobject of desire. This system, for the most part, requires the player to use their imagination.\n\n**Time-Based Discovery (TBD)** - A system where objects reveal themselves to the player based on real time.\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nAnyways, I'm trying to come up with new ideas for both the combat system, which is based on a real-life aspect that already exist, and the discovery system.

kx4mpp,"A ""detective"" game with ""after-death consciousness"" as a one of its mechanics","This is a very loose idea I had after playing return of the obra dinn (on the idea of a detective with ""supernatural"" powers)\n\nBroad concept:\n\n- narrative/exploration game, lots and lots of dialogues, point'n click mechanics maybe\n\n- 3D First person\n\n- A mystery to be solved in a small town with crazy people and a negative attitude toward strangers\n\n- player is a detective of some sort and has to resolve mystery\n\n- player has some powers at its disposal\n\n- One of these is the ability to remain conscious after dying; this would be used when the town's people would eventually kill the detective when he puts its nose too deep into the town's affair.\n\n- Consciousness means: hearing people talk and maybe even looking through player's eyes; the player becomes a ragdoll and npcs will start doing what they want with the corpse (eventually bury/burn it)\n\n- Death are mostly dealt by individuals/small groups; most people would have a reason to make the detective disappear. Public execution could be a scenario\n\n- After some time being dead (when he's buried for example) the character would begin it's journey again with full memory of what happened. (time loop essentially)\n\n- Death is not the main point of the game, only one of its mechanics, the player shouldn't be compelled to die. Mostly he should talk/explore; people will try to ignore him rather than be agressive unless certain circumstances are met.\n\n- Player may have other powers: ask the dead, hear through walls, detect lies... He might use them from time to time but they should remain secondary to the intrigue.\n\nWhat do you guys think of this? Ofc the execution is very dependant on the quality of the story/writing but I haven't seen this mechanic yet and think it's cool/interesting."
kx3wzt,Horror mechanic game idea,"Hey, I'm stuck on a project, its a side-scroller horror game. There's not much decided as for the story yet, but it takes place in a forest, I'm thinking of using a sanity mechanic. Something follows you, to proceed you've got to go right but as you go your sanity is starting to drop. To refill it you've got to look behind you with your flashlight (just to check if there isn't anyone there), you cant move and look behind you at the same time so each time you look behind you you've got to stop moving. At first nothing will be behind you, but as you move deeper into the forest you start to see ...things.\n\nWhat do you think about this idea, and would it make a fun gameplay?"

kwy96y,"New game idea, any feedback appreciated","Ok so, I had this idea of a racing game borrowing many elements and mechanics from other games because those inspired me.\n\n\nThe plot: You, the player, are a student going fresh into college sometime in the late 90s to early 00s. You’ve just gotten your first car and decide to start racing. After a while, your car is destroyed during a race against the top dogs new recruit, whom they bet big money on to have him win. You encounter a student at your school who shows you a junkyard to get yourself a new car to race again as he’s also involved in the racing scene (by now the players 2 or so hours in so he’s/she’s made some money). The player now has to climb up the ranks to make his way to the leader of the top dogs, a business owner and local member/leader of a violent gang. (More details about the plot available if you’re interested).\n\nTransportation: it’s a racing game so you’ll have access to many vehicles, such as:\nCars, bikes, boats, aerial vehicles, trucks, etc.\nThe player can also move on foot, in which he can walk, sprint, jump, crouch and even fight.\n\nCharacter: the player has a wide range of customization, like gender, hair, facial details, build, height, facial hair, tattoos, piercings and clothing. The player has three or four fighting, walking, sprinting and crouching animations possible. Nothing too complicated just some variety.\n\nThe map: the map is divided in 4 sections:\n\nThe city: has a grey filter to it, depressing, polluted, kind of like the cities of old tony hawk games, like New York. More stuff to buy, newer cars, clothes, and safe houses (to store cars, manual save, change up outfits and save them, etc). There’s a highway to do pulls\n\nThe forest: the forest is more saturated and colourful to make it nicer and happier in a way. No dealerships, stores or anything like that. Players can do off-road racing, find collectibles, hide from cops, buy a safe house or two and play some missions/side missions. Nothing much to do because of its remoteness. Can drive up the mountain and drift down it though.\n\nA smaller island beside the main map:\nYou can access it with a boat that you can get anywhere. On the island, there are jeep races and old nascar-esque races on the beach. It’s a section because it’s still pretty big and I think from the drawings I have it looks pretty sizeable. Players can buy the mansion located on the island if they have enough money. Players can unlock some cool exotic items, which are shipped to the port, in the city. This mansion is customizable as it’s an end game item which gives the player more of a sense of accomplishment. \n\nThe suburbs/university district:\nMost safe houses located here, plenty of unlockables and the university is here for the player to attend school (more on that later). It is where some gang members hide so the player must be careful until he’s completed the game not much going on here, rather peaceful.\n\nMechanics:\nThe cars:\nThe cars have a perma-death of sorts, if they’re crashed too badly or something along those lines, that car is gone for good, players can still load up an original save or restart the mission if they want. They can overheat or have the tires pop so the player has to be mindful of that. It can also be impounded if busted. Car parts can be ordered online or purchased at a store and then they’re either shipped to your safe house of choice or you can load them up in your car.There’s limited storage in the trunk of a car for parts. Used car dealerships have cars with reliability issues, all random. New car dealerships have cars without issues. Import dealerships offer imported vehicles unavailable in the USDM. Junkyards have cars with immense issues and horrible reliability, they require a lot of fixing, all damage is random. Everything is modifiable, visuals, functionals (components for engines and such) and interiors. There’s a button for headlights if the player wants to toggle them (looks good on cars with pop-ups)\n\nThe player:\nThe player can be arrested and fined for speeding or street racing and fees are added for evading arrests. The player can fight the police or try and break free to try and escape or get back in their car. The player can also use a skateboard or a bmx bike to get around when not in an actual vehicle. The player doesn’t have a voice, adding to a more rpg feel. There’s dialogue options for cutscenes, just leading to other answers, nothing special. The player has to go attend school, go to parties, etc because they’re still a college student and need to go there. There’s, math, science, all the basics.\n\nThe World:\nThe map is semi destructible, little objects, traffic lights and all that jazz are breakable but they do do some damage to the car. There are marks left with burnouts, npc’s react to the players actions. If a wall is hit by a vehicle, there’s cracks and little pieces that will fall out. There’s a day-night cycle, the weather has rain, overcast, sunny, sunny with clouds and thunderstorms included. The dorm rooms are accessible at the university if the player buys or rents one. Police come by waves and reinforcements the longer a chase goes on.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I haven’t figured everything out yet. For example, I haven’t figured how I want the driving style to be, maybe more Arcady like the old nfs games or sim-cady like Forza horizon. The damage model I’m looking at is similar to gta IV’s or beam ng’s. \n\nI’m not gonna start this project for a while because I have to get used to the game engine I’m using, the codes required are quite complicated and long because of what’s necessary. I also don’t really have anyone other than me on this project so I’ll probably have to wait until I’m done with school and have some time to work on it. If anyone’s interested in this project and wants to take over be my guest. Just let me be able to help here and there as I’ve been thinking of this project for a while now. It’s pretty daunting and don’t have that much spare time to program due to school and other stuff. \n\nAny feedback is appreciated, I really want to hear your opinions on this.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCamska"
kwurzs,I need some simple ideas for a game for a beginner!,"I'm a beginner with unity, I've made some games before with it but nothing really good or polished or, fun really lol. If anyone has some relatively simple or small scale ideas to share with me, I'd super appreciate it!"
ksp02i,A game where you are alone in a spaceship and have to survive until the heat death of the universe,"The player would pass millions, billions of year waiting for processes to complete or for travel times by sleeping in a stasis pod.\n\nMost processes would have to be programmed by the player, for example turrets would could have several input variables of the velocity of your craft and an enemy, the speed of the projectile from the turret and distance. The player would have to take those into account and make a targeting script.\n\nSensors would be based on reflection of visible-light lasers, radio waves or visual contact rather than abstract targeting.\n\nI acknowledge this is a fairly loose bunch of idea but I think this could be *cool*."
ksnryu,"A driving action-adventure game with fixed camera angles. When the camera switches to the next section of road, you'll have to quickly react to what shows up. It's not a racing game though...","The idea was inspired by the trailer to [art of rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQiukq82xs) (a fantastic indie BTW) to which I started imagining myself controlling the game through the cinematic camera angles used in the trailer.\n\nThis game idea wouldn't be a racing game however. Instead it would be an action-adventure game set through the winding roads, streets, alleys and backroads of a strange mountain borough. In a sense, the control and camera system is akin to the original Resident Evil, except zoomed-out to an eerie mountain township. The slower-paced moments would be punctuated by scripted action setpieces with you chasing down or outrunning pursuers.\n\nFor example, one action setpiece might have you trying to escape into a mountain tunnel with the camera pointed back at your pursuers, then the next shot points forward to reveal an oncoming train, then again backward to help you avoid the ramming attacks by your pursuers (but now you don't know how close the oncoming train might be) until nearing the tunnel exit the camera switches forward once more with barely enough time to let you decide which way to steer out of the train's path."

ksco2d,Openworld Time Travelling(Environment Adaptation)single player game,"This game should feel like a God of War 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima and some of the other popular 3rd person single player games.\n\nYou (Bruce) will be a cyborg very early in the game that will lead you to find a 9yr Old Ancient Egyptian girl (you can't understand her at all even with your translator) in 2100 where you will go on a time travelling journey that Bruce can't properly control and so visits multiple timelines in different countries.\n\nEach timeline and country will force Bruce to adapt to the culture around him by generating specific clothing each time that gives different play style and abilities that will give a different and unique new experience to each timeline you visit. \n\nFor example, in a visit to ancient Japan, you'll go to different parts of it, one in which you'll fight like a Samurai, one on one, no sneak attacks and just your katana and arrow and bow. The other part, you'll play like a ninja, sneaking and throwing shurikens and smoke bombs! Medival England, you'll fight like a traditional Knight \n\nBruce has certain constant abilities. Primarily, you have a constant ability in which you pick a weapon from the enemies or surrounding or buy from someone, when you hold the weapon, it is upgraded to a technologically advanced weapon, for instance, holding a katana will make it a lightsaber like Katana. \n\nYour Dog(Rex) acts as a guide, instead of having to open the map every time, he leads you to the main objective. Since you are a Cyborg, you also have beams of different colours showing what tier this place is(Main or Side quest) and you can also choose the location to go to in which your dog will lead you there. No need to open the map and try to navigate through it all. \n\nBruce will do a small sidequest at the beginning that is mandatory so he's able to buy food, which is needed for him to charge his time machine(2100 is a bit more futuristic than now but nothing crazy. Bruce is the first cyborg and is infused with nanotechnology that functions like his normal human cells, as in they aren't charged rather take glucose and other food minerals to produce energy to maintain themselves and reproduce when necessary)\n\nAlthough in 2100, it looks familiar to ours, back in the past like in Medival England, Scotland,etc. you might face some mythical monsters such as were Wolves, Vampires or Lochness Monster, Dragons,etc. Laying traps to hunt them and many similar mechanics from Horizon Zero Dawn. (But these monster huntings are rare and not overused)\n\n(The game preferably would be a trilogy with around a total of 180hrs, 60hrs of average gameplay per game)\n\nSome of the locations you'll go to and their timelines include:\n\nStone Age\n\nAncient Egypt \n\nMedival Japan\n\nMedieval England\n\nAncient China\n\n2019 America\n\n(There are so many different times and locations that'll be visited, these are only few examples)\n\n(The following is just the brief story- not much details)\n\nGame opens with a cutscene of you (Bruce) and your best friend (Dwayne) in year 2100 recieveing a mission as secret agents. You start playing with quick and efficient Tutorial on how the gameplay works, picking up a weapon and fist fight combos (similar to Spiderman and Miles Morales hand to hand combat) and during the game you are overpowered, killed and see Dwayne running to you, the character's eye close. Cutscene starts and Bruce opens his eyes to find he has cybernetic parts and freaks out seeing scientists working on his body. He breaks free and is mad but Dwayne holds him down and Bruce's Dog (Rex) calms him down. Bruce talks to Dwayne while the scientists are covering his cybernetics with artificial skin to look normal. \n\nBruce's boss walks in and is giving a new mission to them, Bruce tells him to fuck off and he leaves the agency for good with his dog. Minutes later he is hit by thieves and goes into a comma. When he wakes up he finds out they took Rex with them. He is mad and while trying to find those crooks, you get another hidden tutorial to discover your new abilities as a Cyborg, such as UV Vision and laser beams, Plasma Canon, etc. You'll fight 2 mobs before you face a mini boss, once you defeat him, a cutscene starts and you force him to talk. Bruce then chokes him and you go to the location he said your dog is kept at. You kill multiple hordes of crooks. Find your dog and then you scan there computers to find that your agency are behind this as a way to get you back in the job. Rex is barking at a far distance and you follow him to find that there's someone crying. It's a 9 Yr old girl. \n\nA cutscene starts and Bruce tells Rex to come along so they can leave but he doesn't want to and keeps signaling to him to free her. The girl looks at him and he frees her. The girl's cloth look nothing like any modern clothes. Bruce is going outside and he is then attacked by his old agency and they capture him. \n\nScreen goes black and then slightly opens to a wierd dream in which it would be shown the reason he freed that girl was because she looks alot like his daughter who was captured alongside his wife and both killed by an enemy agency. \n\nBruce then wakes and you are in control now, you hack the technological handcuffs that hold you and free your dog who's in the same room. Rex functions as an easy guide to follow to achieve the main objectives and you go into rampage mode where you kill anyone that tries to stop you. \n\nYou reach to where that girl is kept and find Dwayne guarding her. You find that she's a 9yr old girl from ancient Egypt with some interesting abilities that were the reason the agency kept her- for study purposes. You fight Dwayne and when you pin him down, he accidentally shoots Rex, Bruce changes his Arm into a blade and scars Dwayne's face and rushes to get Rex and take the girl while they are running away and he goes to the lab where he quickly grabs a time machine(in a watch format) that infuses in his skin and he quickly escapes with Rex and the girl. They jump into 2019 first and he tries to help Rex sustain the wound which he accidentally heals through cybernaticlly fusing Rex with some of his Nano cells that make Rex have special powers as well as better guiding system.\n\nFrom this moment forward you wander each timeline to find a place that you can buy food from and each time you eat, there will be a small cutscene of you eating and overhearing some people talking about some stuff that will be mapped as side quests, most sidequests are ones you aren't forced to do, but you can do for a benefit in gameplay efficiency later."
ksbpcr,"A new 'X-Files' game but with graphics/art style of a PS1 game, like the original Silent Hill","Been binging the show a lot so came up with this idea.\n\nThe concept is just to create a new mystery in the style of one of the 'monster-of-the-week' type episodes, with a spate of unexplained murders, which Mulder and Scully investigate.\n\nHas L.A. Noire-type investigation, but your prompted responses differ depending on if you're Mulder or Scully, with Mulder being more focused on some wild theory, and Scully trying to find a more down-to-earth rationale. \n\nMaybe pepper in easter eggs throughout about a greater conspiracy, but keep it a short game adapting just one monster mystery."
ksb7gs,An action-based hack and slash reverse-Pokemon styled game where you combat and capture creatures to make yourself stronger.,"As the player progresses through the game, they can unlock more areas to serve as hunting grounds to either kill or contain a gallery of creatures and beings both original and folklore and myth inspired. Exploring hard-to-reach areas or fulfilling certain conditions can reveal different creatures of various rarities, with rarer creatures being harder to fight and contain but tending to offer better abilities.\n\nAs for the abilities themselves, one could draw comparisons to how Final Fantasy VII's Materia system. As the player progresses, they unlock more slots which captured creatures can be loaded into. The loaded creatures can offer weapons, active abilities, passive abilities, abilities that trigger under certain conditions, or just stat boosts. When the player kills creatures with creatures loaded, they can level up to offer more or enhanced capabilities.\n\nContaining a creature is very similar to Pokemon in that you have to weaken it first, but you have different methods available that can affect the margin of capture. The simplest would be a beam that adds to a meter that scales with the creature's current HP that once full contains it, however ""boss"" or ""legendary"" creatures would be impervious to this method unless certain steps were taken first. Some creatures need to be ""flushed out"" by fulfilling certain conditions. Some creatures live in ""lairs"" that feature gimmicks that either need to be interrupted to capture or kill the creature or can make it vulnerable to capture or death. Some creatures need to be caught in certain traps to be made vulnerable to containment, but will break free if left unattended for too long.\n\nExamples:\n\nSalamander:\n\nFireball: Can be changed to explode in a radius.\n\nBurning Claw: A slashing attack that burns.\n\nFire Elemental: Fire attacks heal, take double damage from water attacks.\n\nLiving Armor:\n\nSteel Blade: Equip a slashing sword.\n\nSteel Spear: Equip a piercing polearm.\n\nSteel Shield: Equip a shield that can neutralize all damage from the front when raised. Vulnerable to electricity.\n\nWood Elf:\n\nElven Archery: Equip a bow. The longer it's drawn, the greater the power.\n\nPhantom of the Forest: If among foliage, become invisible.\n\nFriend to Beasts: Create either a Bear, Eagle, or Wolf familiar."

ksa3y5,A progression-based action psuedo-MMO with platforming and RPG elements.,"It's primarily a mission and instance-based and set across various world types, each with their own distinct gimmicks, events, and galleries of NPCs and enemies. Each mission can be as simple as reaching a goal at the end, finding or accomplishing multiple objectives, completing a dungeon with multiple puzzles scattered throughout, a boss fight, or something else entirely.\n\nThe player has a gallery of playable characters at their disposal acquired through progression, each with their distinctive weapons, fighting style, super/magical abilities, and at least one unique ability. Most of a character's capabilities scale off of their level, which range from 1 to 100 and can be upgraded through rewards obtained from completed missions or gathered within missions.\n\nThe RPG elements in accordance to stats aren't expressed as numbers but are more described as tier-based, in order of Extremely High, Very High, High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low, Low, Very Low, and Extremely Low.\nThe stats are as follows:\nHP:\nThe ammount of damage a character can take before needing to switch to another in the party. The player has many opportunities to restore a character's HP.\nMP: The resource needed to perform the character's abilities. Filled as segments of a bar through standard gameplay.\nDefense: the number of times a a character can neutralize all damage through their Guard action. If depleted, puts the character in a Guard Broken status where they can't attack, Guard, or move until they regenerate one Guard Point. If a character raises their Guard for a moment instead of holding it, it becomes a Deflect instead which deducts an enemy's Defense on contact.\nDefense Regeneration: How quickly one point of a character's Defense will regenerate. At low HP Levels, a character will enter a Pressed state where Defense Regeneration is greatly diminished, same for enemies.\nAttack Power: The ammount of damage a character's standard attack can do.\nAbility Power: The ammount of damage a character's abilities can do. An attack-based Ability with an Extremely Low Ability Power will always do slightly more damage than an Attack with an Extremely High Attack Power.\nAttack Resistance: How much of an enemy's Attack power is deducted from the character's damage \nAbility Resistance: How much of an enemy's Ability power is deducted from the character's damage.\nMovement Speed: How fast a character moves.\nAttack Speed: How fast a character can attack or raise their Guard."

ks80gm,AAA Co-op,"As I’ve been searching for a good game for me and my wife to enjoy together, I’ve come to the realization that, there really isn’t much AAA game experience. When I say AAA experience I am referring to games like Assassins creed / last of us / cyberpunk etc. this excludes mmo gamers like destiny, and battle royal games. Those games typically are very repetive, have little or no engaging story, and are convoluted. Not great if you want an in depth game with story narratives and varied gameplay that you could spend over 100 hours in.\n\nWhat I have not found many of, are games like fallout 76 or dying light. The fact that fallout 76 is the only open world fully co-op/multiplayer RPG is mind boggling to me. It’s no where near perfect but we can craft, build, or play what is similar to a single player version of fallout. Dying light has similar appeal but not as much content to keep going for100+ hours.\n\nIn addition, none of these co-op games strays too far from the standard themes and gameplay elements of multiplayer. For instance, most survival games are similar while, many of which are post apocalyptic. However, non try to take on things like rebuilding society, or utilizing the relationships with “co-op” characters in any meaningful way. A lot of times you get a silent protagonist that seems to not be important in any way yet the game try’s to make you feel like they should be. The base building is mostly geared towards multiplayer defenses but offers little utility beyond that or crafting. If fallout 4 was multiplayer I feel like it would be a bit closer in touching on the rebuilding of society, but even then I feel like we are missing opportunity for some really fun co-op. Also sharing the experience of a story and it’s events is really nice. \n\nI apologize for the word vomit as it’s late, but I’d really like to see someone focus less on mass multiplayer games and more on deep co-op and multiplayer experiences. I’ve got lots of ideas I wish I could see. Like a mass effect style rpg with the ability to build, craft, and form a society. Maybe some of the multiplayer aspect is like death stranding, where random built items can populate someone’s instance, maybe there is a strong choice system and various ways to either form or be part of a society."

kryyls,I need ideas for a pixel 2d game. It is my first major 2d game.,"Edit: As request I have some more info \n\nGenres like Adventure, Strategy, or Management.\n\nI want people to have freedom in it like if it was a city builder they can place things where they want, or an adventure game where you choose what to do next."
kry310,"A metroidvania where the character gains allies with different abilities, rather than skills of their own, in order to progress.","I love metroidvanias - they are my favorite genre of game - but they always seem to be solo affairs, with a character alone in a new world having to learn and become powerful in order to explore further. But in real life, developing relationships with other people is the primary source of progress and success.\n\nSo suppose that what your character can do, is absolutely static and unchanging, but you can interact with other characters, developing relationships with them (through some kind of quest arcs where you prove your worth to them), and getting them to join you on expeditions to explore new areas. These new areas themselves contain resources or treasures or information or etc which can be used to convince other characters to ally themselves with you, and so on. The goal is to develop, and maintain, your network of allies, and with their aid to move through whatever the overarching storyline is.\n\nPerhaps along the way you have to choose your allies in such a way that some people will become enemies instead, and this permanently influences where you can go and what you can do in the game, so that you'd have to play it through again to see what might have happened if you'd made different connections. This could be a way to gate different endings etc.\n\nNow that I actually write all this out, it sounds a bit like Mass Effect!"
krxj9l,A mechanic to make infections in zombie games actually means something.,"Usually in games being bitten by a zombie means you just take damage, even though for everyone else being bitten means inevitable infection. A way to balance this out so bites aren’t instant death but still carrying danger is this:\n\nIf bit, you’ll unlock an infection meter. An infection meter is like health, except that it very very slowly rises. If it reaches the top it’ll transform you into a zombie, killing you. Being bitten again only makes it go faster. How do you prevent being killed by this? You scavenge a specific medication that lore wise was made by the government before the fall. This medication lowers your infection, but it doesn’t cure you, meaning that your infection levels will rise again. This means that for the rest of the game you’ll have to always be looking out to scavenge this medication, because going to long with it will kill you. This will also make the medication rare, who knows, maybe others will try to raid you for it."
kru4ek,Most ideas here are like backstories,"I try to keep an open mind while browsing the ideas posted here, some give me inspiration, but most are more like intro to a game - like with a narrator telling you a story about why your character is there. Then there’s nothing. \n\nAnd the scale. Why does it have to be impossibly big? Adding infinite features to the idea doesn’t make it great. “A rogue-like minecraft-y cyberpunk post-apocalyptic open-world multi-planet system, with zombie-like vampires and werewolf mario-looking pokemons, with customizable weapons which you craft by harvesting and magic system which combines elements to make 100+ spells, played in a turn-based battle royale MMORPG survival mode.”\n\nMake the idea simple. “An apple fighting worms to survive”."
krtsnj,Archery Castle Defense FPS for mobile devices,I have an idea for a game where the player is an archer that defends a medieval castle from an enemy assault force. The player shoots arrows from a FPS perspective but moves by clicking on fixed defensive positions in the castle from a top down map. \n\nEach defensive position will have a limited field of fire and repositioning between different positions to cover the current phase of the enemy assault will be an important game play mechanic. As the enemy takes over parts of the castle the defensive positions the player can redeploy to get fewer and fewer until the player is forced into a last stand or the enemy morale breaks and the assault routes.\n\nThe alternative movement mechanic is to enable compatibility with a touch screen device.

krs3az,A first person battle royale with customizable abilities,"(I’d like to preface by saying I’m not too well versed in gaming so if a game like this already exists please let me know :) )\n\nI came up with this idea and thought it could be fun\nIt’s a battle royale with 100 players meant to be played with 1-5 friends but you can go solo if you want. You can find weapons around the map but the pièce de résistance is the ability system\nEveryone has 4 abilities that they can choose at the same place you’d apply cosmetics:\nYou have a passive ability which sort of runs in the background and doesn’t have a cool down\nYou have a minor ability which do small but useful things \nYou have a major ability like a minor one but more powerful with longer cool down\nFinally you have an ultimate with big reward but an enormous cooldown.\n\nAbilities are categorized by what they do and can be damage, defense, or support. Simply put, damage abilities are for taking health, defense abilities are for preserving health, and assist abilities are for giving health. Passives have a movement category that allows for gliding, double jumps, and faster running.\n\nThe core mechanic as previously mentioned is letting players fully customize their build to find what best fits their play style. You can also choose from presets if you prefer and save builds you like.\n\nI think this could allow for some fun game modes like a scramble where your abilities are chosen at random, a mode where you can’t use abilities, or a mode where you can only use a certain category of abilities (i.e. only defense or only damage)\n\nI’ve explained it the best I could. If you have any questions, ideas, or criticisms please comment them.\n\nTl;dr: Overwatch but battle royale and you can choose what abilities you have"

krm1l3,Bones management,A game where you have a limited amount of bones to insert in your body (would start with a human character but it would shift to more complicated and fantastic creatures) and you have to fulfill tasks that require certain limbs. Maybe in a level you need both arms to pull some levers but you wouldn't have to be standing because you can crawl to the exit. In another you need at least one leg and one arm because you have to reach a high positioned lever.\n\nI imagine it something like Saw's escape rooms but for zombies and undead creatures
krk41w,"A battle royale game with few players per match (around 20), maps set in a single large building (think a hospital or a prison), few guns with most weapons being melee, and an alliance system that allows you to betray teammates.","Since this game is going for a more grimy tense feel, the theme reflects that. Bombs in the neck, run down settings, a mysterious announcer on tv telling you what to do. Anyways, the game would start off with you waking up in a random area of the map, maybe close to other players. Only one player can win. You can choose to send out party invites to any players you see, with a max party of 4 players. Being in a party with someone means no friendly fire, can see your teammates through walls and you can trade with them. Players can also leave their party on the fly, as everyone has an understanding only one person can win.\n\nThe gameplay mainly focuses on melee combat, as guns are rare. There is a limb system similar to fallouts, with legs, arms, head and torso all taking different damage and causing different effects. Blunt weapons would do bone breaking damage, causing players to become slower wherever they were hit if it was arms or legs, causes concussions if hit in the head, causes you to get tired quicker if hit in the torso, and also makes you cry out in pain whenever you make sudden movements. Blades do cutting damage, and will cause you to begin to bleed out if hit. If bleeding you’ll leave a blood trail and take damage. Bleeding out will either stop on its own or if severe has to be stopped with a medkit. Medkits have tourniquets and bandages to stop bleeding as well as painkillers to restore health. Each one has a unique animation, meaning you can’t pop them in the middle of combat. \n\nGuns are pretty straightforward. They cause massive bleeding damage and regular damage. Only issue is guns are rare and bullets even rarer. There’s be 3 types of weapons. A handgun, the basic gun, shotguns, basically being an instakill in close range, and machine guns, which shoot a lot but use lots of ammo. Guns can also stun and cause concussions if used to melee.\n\nThe inventory system would be pretty realistic, at first only having what you can carry in your hands. Eventually you’d find new items that’s give you more inventory like duffel bags, backpacks and Fanny packs . These would have a resident evil style inventory where you have to piece them together Tetris like to maximize efficiency.\n\nFinally, this game wouldn’t have an equivalent to the storm, but it would have other mechanics. If a player moves very little for a long time, their bomb necklace will begin to make loud noise, if they still don’t move it’ll begin to flash, and if they still don’t move the necklace will blow up. Once there’s only a few players left or the match goes on for too long, death match mode will be enabled. Stronger weapons will be spawned around the match and players will be able to see other players through the TVs around the map."

krerpd,"A ""role-playing game"" in the truer sense of the word","I've played almost all popular videogame RPGs (Fallout 1-4, The Elder Scrolls 2-5, the Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Mass Effect 1, you name it) and although I LOVE videogame rpgs, I have to say: they are NOT role-playing games. The game industry has forgotten what tabletop RPGs were all about: Immersion, creating your own story, being whoever you want. For example, lets take a look at Skyrim (the game that basicly set the standard for western RPGs) - sure, you can customize your character and give it whatever name and stats you want, but you always play through the same story - Alduin will always be defeated by the end, the thiefs guild will always be there in Riften for you to join, you're always the dragonborn, etc; It feels like a linear game with a single gigantic level.\n\nSo, I have a solution for that: a game with no main story whatsoever, but rather a really complex popularity system with lots of kingdoms/cities on which you can get jobs/contracts that after completion would give you a reward and a change of relationship you have in the world (for example, if you do a job for the king of a city, you gain popularity with them but lose with that cities enemies; if you become a assassin you lose your popularity with the peasants; etc) that not only applies to guests - if you become too rich you lose your popularity with the lower classes, if you travel enought/do heroic acts your fame will increase making more guests available. And of course, character customization.\n\nThis could work really well in a procedural world, but I'll leave that for you, the reader"

kr7pm7,Flying cafe where you travel the worlds and collect different recipes,"I want to make this idea come true so badly, but It would take so much time to do everything alone. So here is what I'm thinking.\n\nThis would be a story driven 2D, top-down, pixel style game (looks something like Stardew Valley). You start by working in small cafe in some village, and you find a secret notebook that your grandfather left, which has all sorts of rumors, drawings of other planets, species and their delicious foods and where you can find those recipes. At the end of the notebook you find hidden message which says that cafe has a secret dashboard, where you to put coordinates from notebook and your cafe takes off. The game takes place both in the air and on the ground. While you are flying, you can walk around your cafe and sometimes encounter random ships passing by. These ships can dock next to you depending if you like them to or not and you can have customers who could tell you more about your journey, or you could get robbed by pirates, or you could encounter a merchant which could sell you some furniture, fuel, or tools like axe, hoe, pickaxe, etc. These tools can be used when landing on planet and you have to find fuel, or you would like to craft some furniture. When you land on planet you always encounter other native species, which tells you more about their culture and share their recipes with you. When you finish gathering all recipes you come back to your home planet and share them with everyone else. And in short that's it. \n\n**IN SHORT: You have a flying cafe which you can upgrade and decorate by gathering resources on other planets and your goal is to travel all the planets and collect all recipes.** \n\nSorry for all my grammar mistakes or if sentences don't make sense, cuz I'm just too tired to fix them.

I am just here to give you an general guide of how the game is thought of when I created it, how I think about I will play it and nothing else. Feel free to destroy my work and replace it with something you feel like is better, it is YOUR game, do what you feel is right and fun to play.\n\nAlright, now that that’s out of the way, lets start with the basics. What is the general idea of the game and how do we even start playing?\n\n**Chapter 1: Starting your game**\n\nOk, so you found this guide, and you want to read more, either because you think it’s interesting or just a plain stupid idea. But what is this game even, what do you I have to imagine playing it? Well, lets start at the beginning. In this game, the main idea is that you are playing a role in a story, sort of like D&amp;D, but my idea is to not only play with things that are made up, or in a fantasy story. Rather, I have this idea of implementing things from all around you, take a look around right now, what do you see? Anything that’s here with you right here, right now could be implemented in your game. But how we do this, we will talk about later. First we need to settle a few things. How do YOU want to play? Do you want to write everything down, draw pictures and make progress on paper? Do you want to search for images, and play your story online, on for examples Word, Tabletop Simulator or all over the web? Do you want to play everything in your mind, so you can instantly make any move you want right where you are, without have to have anything with you? Of course, you can also mix these thing up, to make you playstyle more fun, or easy to play with!\n\nYou will also have to set some basic guidelines, at least, if that is what you want. You could just skip this part and make up rules at any time or at any move you make during the story, or just play without, and let everything flow as you want! But if you do want to set some basic rules, Here are a few examples:\n\n· Never, will a player, objects or any other asset in the game, will have the power of infinite life, invincibility or another factor that will be considered “overpowered”.\n\n· The amount and level of loot found, will be generally determent by either a die, random number generator or (insert your method here).\n\n· “Safe Heaven Tokens (SHT’s)” will have to be acquired only in boss fights, marketplaces or (Insert your method here).\n\n**Chapter 2: Making characters and places**\n\nSo you got a general idea of how to want to play, and with what kind of rule settings you want to work with. Now lets start forming a story and a character. In the starting period of the game, my advise, if you don’t have anything to work with of course, is just to start rambling some things out. They do not have to make sense, let alone be actually played with, just think about some random stories you find interesting. Now is also a good time to start thinking about maybe if you want to play by a certain genre, or multiple genres at once. Maybe you want to play a Horror story, adventure story, action story or maybe even a horror adventure action story, I don’t know, you decide. Do you want to make something realistic, or something even World of Warcraft, Neverwinter or Path of Exile didn’t think of? Maybe you’ll outwrite Lovecraft at his own style, who knows what your imagination will create! \n\nStart thinking of a place. This can be an enormous universe, a world, a city, a house or even just a room you want to start playing in. You don’t have to create everything at once, except of course if that you playstyle. You can start really small and let in evolve into something bigger as you go. Or maybe your story fits in just that one room, that can lead into some interesting options as well. But don’t forget you can also just use a place you already know! Like a place in a videogame, movie or maybe you want to start your story in your own backyard, or that park you visit every morning to walk your dog. Play in the city you always wanted to go, at the club you used to go with your friends or the classroom you have to go to first thing tomorrow. Really, your choice.\n\nThen for your characters. You can start with the character, or characters you yourself want to play with. These can, but don’t have to be the main characters of your story. The main character can also be the god, or for examples end boos of the story. But you can also start with creating, maybe monsters you’ll face, if you want to add those. Whatever you want to make first. If you go for, let’s say, one character that you play as the main character of the story. Think of what is character is. Is it really you, as in the one writing this? Is it even human? Is it an animal or a different kind of lifeform? Maybe you want your story to play out as a group of cells, then you follow your species of cells as it form a bigger and bigger for of life. Maybe you want to play as a character from a movie, or the game you’ve been playing for years. So let’s say your character is human. Does your story involve magic? Are you a master of the mystic arts or are you just starting your learning program, for example: are you Dumbledore or are you first year’s Harry Potter? Maybe you want to play a game in a Medieval world, are you the King of a big kingdom? Or do you start out as the one who cleans up the mess others leave behind? Other things you might add are:\n\n· Personality\n\n· Things your character is good or bad at\n\n· Things your character carries around everywhere\n\n· The history of your character\n\nThese are all optional, and you can add everything else as your story moves on.\n\n**Chapter 3: Implementing objects**\n\nObjects can play a big, or a small part of your story. And there are different ways of using items in your game. Some items may not need really in-depth information about them, depending how what it is, when you use it or what impact it has on the game. If it fits into the game you could just say that you quickly ate an apple on you way to the castle, it doesn’t have to be a big deal. But you can also say maybe, you quickly ate an apple on your way to the castle, which refills your hunger by 10, and then threw it on a dog that’s sleeping on the side of the road, who then got angry at you and tried to attack you. Then it’s a bit of a bigger deal. Maybe your at a market, who sells apples. Then you want a price for the apple(‘s), and maybe what kind of quality it is. Does it have side-effects? Or does it just refills your hunger status? Now this was just an example of an apple, but this can be done with anything. Potions, weapons, technology, pets, houses, to just name a few.\n\nMaybe with every item you get, buy or find you want to write down a quick overview of that item, so you can remember the info later, and carry it around for a while. This can be a really short or really long description, depending on how you want to play, or what the object is. Maybe for a potion, you’ll want to write down the name of the potion, what it does, how many times you can use it and any side-effects it may have. Maybe for a weapon you can note the quality of the weapon, how much damage it does and what the durability of the weapon is. This can also be done with enemies you might face, places you visit, contacts you have and characters you play.\n\nHow do you get items? Maybe you start with some, but maybe at some point, you’ll add new ones. You can find items as you travel, when you defeat an enemy, buy them at a store or a market or maybe you trade your items for new ones.\n\n**Chapter 4: Playing with others**\n\nThere are two basic ways of playing with others, either starting a game together, or join someone in their already made story. Lets discuss both in separate parts.\n\n1. Starting a game together.\n\nLets say you have a group and want to play the game together, this one is easier then if you want to play in a game that has already been started by others. Just talk about what everyone’s ideas are, and form a story together. Are you all main characters? Are some of you the players and others the enemies? Are you two kingdoms facing each other for ultimate glory? Are you a group of special soldiers that have to take on a big enemy together? What rules do you agree on to make it fair for everyone? Are you going to play at a table with the group, in a D&amp;D kind of setting? Or is your story taking place in the real world? And do you meet, and travel to places in real time? Will you design your own map to follow your quest and story or do you go where ever Google Maps takes you? If you play in the real world, there are of course rules and laws you have to keep in mind. Don’t go into places you are not allowed to, and don’t disturb others when you are playing the game. But aside from that, go explore the world! Make the adventure as real as it can be in the world we ourselves live in! \n\n2. Joining another’s game\n\nThis one may be a bit more complicated. Since you’re joining a game that has already started, you will have to follow the rules and settings the Host has made. Don’t mess with the story of another player, as they designed it the way they want their story to go. Let the Host explain what rules there are, how they play and what the story of the game contains, make your character that makes sense in the story and follow the guidelines the Host gives you to do so. Go with the flow of the story and the rest will follow, as there could been made a lot of decisions already. Maybe when you join the game, the host was just about to start a war and now you’re in the middle of it! Maybe the war is just over and you come in at the point that the whole village has been destroyed. You don’t know, so ask the host for any info you need to play, and make sure everyone is enjoying your stay, especially yourself! Maybe you just want to play in the Host’s story for a little bit, if so, make sure you end your part of the story well, and not with open gaps. \n\nReally it’s up to you with how many players you want to play. If you enjoy playing with a group, make it a good time with everyone! But if you’d rather play alone, go for it! You can always decide later if you want more players, or else just create wonderful, amazing worlds and stories by yourself! \n\n**Chapter 5: Overview**\n\nSo, there it is. A sprinkle of what this game is, how it can be played, where and when! I will write more topics later, maybe going more in-depth into certain topics, and giving more examples of them. But for now I just want to give the basic idea of the vision I have when creating this game. This is only the beginning! There is an infinite amount of things I could talk about, stories to tell, characters to create, enemies to imagine, worlds to explore and items to be found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I could make you interested to read more! I’ve had this idea in my mind for a long time, and now is the time to let it out! \n\nPlease leave your own ideas below, as I am really interested in ways you imagine playing this game!"
kr2r3h,Sonic Burst: A Sonic Racing Game,"I don’t Know how to make actual games at all but I do love making up ideas for games so here’s my idea for a sonic racing game please tell me your thoughts \n\nSonic Burst: Sonic Racing Game\n\nMain Idea:\nA Sonic racing game where sonic and friends(and enemies) are racing against each other for (an powerful item) that a (person) has and is making them compete for it.\n\nStory:\nThe main story/ending is the sonic heroes (sonic, tails, and knuckles) working together to make sure no one else gets the (item) and use it for evil but there is multiple alternate stories and endings based on the team/characters you use a example being team dark were shadow is racing for Marie back.\n\nRacing Mechanics:\nInstead of racing in cars like Team Sonic Racing or have them all run in a straight line like in Sonic Forces(the mobile game) it’s has the movement of Team Sonic Racing (free roam) well also having all the characters race in different ways examples being sonic running, tails flying, and jet using extreme gear/board. \n\nRace Tracks: \nMaps in the game are fairly simple with laps, rail grinding, dodging obstacles etc.\nAlso in the maps they’ll have unique parts to it like jump pads, secret paths, and loopy loops.\n\nItems:\nIn Sonic there are a variety of items in the games that are used for Sonic to help him in completing it. Items that I think would work in the game would be rings to prevent being hurt for a certain amount of damage depending on how many rings you have (up to 3), speed boots to give you extra speed in your movement, invincibility to make you immune to all damage, the chaos emeralds which turns you super making you faster immune to damage and deal damage if you hit other players, and there’s more items still that can be put in.\n\nAbilities:\nEvery character will have unique abilities to them like Sonic will be able to have a spin dash that dashes him forward, tails will have a mega buster that will shoot slow moving energy balls that will slow enemies, and knuckles will grab a boulder from the ground and throw it forward if it hits someone it will stun them. Your abilities will charge faster or slower depending on what place you are, hitting enemies, and doing tricks\n\nMultiplayer And Co op:\nIn co op you can play together with people on local play off or online in the story or just regular online play \n\nGame Modes:\nThere will a variety of game modes to play in online and local play like the regular 3 lap race, catch the chao were you have to grab the chao that’s running away from all the players and hold onto it for the longest, team battle and free for all were you have to knock out all the players against you, a tournament mode which could be a rank mode or just a regular mode where you have to qualify to get to the next part of the tournament"
kr2k6e,"The further you go in the game, the more insane the loot becomes","I don't mean like you get better weapons and armor, no, I mean at first everything seems fine, but as you go you end up finding really weird stuff where it should not belong.\n\nIt's like when you find an iron pot in a dead bear's body or gems in potery pots. The same thing but exaggerated. It would probably be completely useless, but it would be fun at least."
kqzsy6,FPS Idea,"I want to make a unique fps game. It can be like a mashup of several games or something new entirely, but what is an idea for an fps game that makes it new or interesting? All ideas are appreciated."
kqzoe8,A game idea I was chipping away at before developing an RSI,As an amateur game dev I was always aware the scope of my idea was beyond what I could do on my own but I enjoyed working at small parts of it anyway.\n\nI can’t work on the game any longer but the concept is something I still find myself thinking about daily and thought I’d share with anyone willing to have a read.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNmUGR7qFLvjNwUwAYOEMHMohgNo7Hrgjzvlbtc2Llc/edit\n\nIf you do manage to get through it please let me know what you think :) \n\nHope everyone has a good day!
kqzenw,Life Sim where the NPC's dialogue is powered by GPT-3,"For those not familiar with [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), it's a language model by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). It's a neural network that has been trained on a buttload of written data, from tweets, to classic literature, to fanfiction. You can get a good idea of how it works by playing around with [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, onto the game idea! Imagine a mashup of The Sims, Fable and Animal Crossing in terms of gameplay and world interactivity. The catch? All of the dialogue is written by GPT-3. This allows the player to type (or even speak) their own responses to characters and have their own unique conversations. The AI could be finetuned and told to remember certain aspects, such as personality traits, likes, dislikes and catch phrases. All while keeping track of the relationship status between the characters and the player!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concept was explored in 2006 indie title [Facade](https://www.playablstudios.com/facade), in which the player attends a dinner party with a couple.  You can say whatever you like to the couple and they will respond appropriately (ableit, with a lot of drama) and if memory serves, their responses are even voice modulated. It was impressive for its time and I believe the system used can be pushed much further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all I have for now, just wanted to get this written down somewhere! I'd love to hear any other ideas or expansions upon this."
kqz3vu,The game concept I’m posting here has been something I’ve chipped away at over time however have never fully committed to.,The reason for never committing to it has been the fact I’m aware the scope of the game is beyond just myself as an amateur game dev who has now developed an rsi injury\n\nHowever I still find myself thinking about it daily and hoping for something like it some day. So I thought I’d share here just to see if anyone has the patience to have a read through what I see as a basis for my ideal game.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNmUGR7qFLvjNwUwAYOEMHMohgNo7Hrgjzvlbtc2Llc/edit\n\nLet me know your thoughts if you actually do read through it :) \n\nHope everyone has a great day!
kqyp8q,Open World RPG idea,"Here's the idea. It's open world as in the title, but it has many dynamic systems.\n\nFor instance, let's say there was a village in a tundra that relys on the wood from the forest to create fire so that they can survive the winter. Burn down that forest, and everyone either dies in the winter and some migrate. But in doing that, a nearby village now has more space and resources to grow and prosper in the absence of the old village. Maybe if you help them enough, they trust you so much that they swear allegiance to you and you begin to create an empire.\n\nOr you could be a dungeon Explorer, and defeating the monster imprisoned in one of the dungeons releases magic back into the local area or something, amplifying everything natural in that area.\n\nMaybe you could be mining to the bottom of earth to find the strongest materials, only to break through the bedrock and create an opening to the nether or hell. A few days later, demons begin to set up outposts and nests across the world as they prepare for a massive invasion. Maybe during the invasion angel's get involved. After the battle, much of the land is barren, resulting in a dark age of sorts.\n\nIdk just throwing some ideas around. This may be pretty hard to make though seeing as it may be extremely complex. \n\nThoughts?"

kqqrre,Lovecraftian Style horror game where your PC crashes if you see a monster,"Lots of horror games try and fail to capture the mind breaking depiction of the Cthulhu mythos, I think it could be interesting to implement some out of game consequences for encountering these reality defying creatures such as your PC crashing or your copy of the game being deleted etc."
kqosj5,GTA should collab with Cities: Skyline to create an infinite amount of maps to play on,Each city built would have its own strong suits and flaws in design and maybe gta could center its story around the corrupted urban development and have dynamic quests that take the stats and layout of your city into account.
kqok68,HOW To Make YOUR GAME IDEA worth considering/better.,"Now I know there is Pinned Post but i want to add my part to it.  \n\n\nSo there we go...(wall of text ahead)  \n\n\n1) Make sure your Idea doesnt belong to a Copyrighted IP.  \n   But what is an IP you ask. A Games (or Franchises) IP is but not limited to:  \n \n\n* Source code\n* Characters\n* Choreographies\n* Buildings\n* Maps\n* Conceptual art\n* Box design\n* Soundtrack and sound effects \n* Script, dialogue and the storyline   \nBasically anything that is an identifiable characteristic of a game or franchise e.g The Mandalorian,Jedi etc from Star Wars. Middle Earth from LOTR etc.   \n\n\nAnything like that is off-limits because it requires a license that comes with a hefty price and for most indies coming here its not an option(and probably not worth it).  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\n2) Now i know there are people that might disagree with this and want an idea to be much more ""free""  \nbut trust me some guidelines help on the imagination.  \n\n\nFor Example: I have an idea for a Single player (campaign) Shooter Game either FPS or TPS where the Character is a Commando and he and his Squad fight Aliens/Terrorists/Invaders where the bond of these men and them misssing their loved ones is expressed through their voice lines/or they are tough and badass AF and they just steamroll throught endless waves of enemies.  \n\n\nYou could also explain other ""mechanics"" that the game might have.  \n\n\nLimited Ammo/crafting etc  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\n3) Preferably has to be original.The competition and amount of games being made is enormous and for a game to shine and make profit (or just be played if free) it has to be entirely original or have that ""something special"" about it that makes it different from the others.  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\n4) And Last but least and probably MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL is imagine if you or your friends would play/enjoy that game for a considerable amount of time.  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\nThat's all i had to say i hope this post helps some people get some good ideas out or any gamedev to make his own mind because trust me its really hard to find something original that you like and can implement (not just as much as bugfixing tho that just sucks)."
kqm9ez,Chibi Style Life Simulator,"Hello!  \n\n\nI would like to work on a mobile game where you can create a large number of customisable chibi characters, and much like the 3DS game 'Tomodachi Life', you can look after these chibis by feeding them, buying them clothes, playing minigames with them, etc.  \n\n\nMost importantly, though, I would like these chibis to interact with eachother and form a social life based on predetermined character traits. The player themselves has very little influence on how well two chibis get a long, all the player does is watch the chibis live their life and make sure they are being looked after.   \n\n\nMy problem is that I'm a begginer programmer, I would love to develop this idea more but I would like some help accomplishing this.  I would also like help with music and sound effects as an optional thing, but I want to focus on getting the game working first."

kqcttj,FPS “tower defense” game,"Before you enter your match, you can decide on what weapons you want to use. You also decide what kind of spells you want to use. You can unlock more... with more gameplay. \n\n\nYou need to defend against waves of “enemies”\n\nYou shoot enemies to stop them.. when it gets intense you use your spells. Spells varies from big blasts, to freezing, etc \n\nYou can constantly be moving around the map since it’s a FPS, get the best angles. Best choke points. Decide what spells your gonna use to work best with your teammates.\n\nCertain enemies (randomly) will drop bonuses like CoD zombies, ammo refill, nuke, spell cooldown halves, etc \n\nThis game is similar to dungeon defenders. But certainly different.\n\nYou have guns &amp; spells. You don’t place turrets on the path. The game is very open on how you play each round."
kqazff,An FPS game where you play as info_player_start in Hammer.,"Take Valve's Hammer Editor for Source, or GoldSrc or whatever, and place the player inside of the info\_player\_start entity. You're tasked with going around different maps shooting and destroying entities (e.g. light\_environment, etc.) The caveat is that each time you destroy an entity, its function also stops. For example, if you destroy a light entity, there won't be light there anymore. If you destroy logic entities, then their purposes won't be fulfilled and whatever was in their I/O system will stop. This makes the player have to plan out how to beat each map, since if you destroy certain entities first, it will make things harder or even impossible.\n\nHowever, this comes with the downside that maps might have only one set way to beat them, which you can't really get around of except something random being added, like random spawns or random weapons you use, or multiple weapons to choose from, some only destroying light entities, etc. You'd have to search around for the weapons, but then that could make it boring having to search the whole map for a certain weapon just to destroy a few entities.\n\nNaturally, there would be a level editor for people to make their own levels and maps. Yay.\n\nWell, there it is. I'm not good enough to make it, and it requires more planning work also. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\n(I guess this is a dream idk)"

I’d like to design a 90s retro apartment but beyond that I’m stumped. I could go with a horror game but that’s not really my interest and escape rooms seem overdone. Anyone got any ideas? \n\nI like the idea of a more casual relaxing game like the Sims where the goal is to earn money to pimp out your apartment. I like games where you need to maintain health and happiness stats. But without having an open world, this would likely get boring really quick."
kq050r,"I made a little demo for a space shooter, what kind interesting things could people like to see out of a space shooter?","I made a small demo of a space shooter game when I was first learning to program. Here is a short clip of the gameplay: https://streamable.com/no0j7c\n\nThe health bar was intended to be tied to a score that increases with enemies killed. It's the circular bar on the left. When it reaches 2 different levels it will add a sentry to fire with the ship. \n\nThe bar is just a visual representation of the firing speed.  And the symbol on the inside is showing the weapon type. I imagined the player being able to switch weapons during gameplay similar to Ranger-X. \n\nI had an idea maybe to make a space shooter rouge lite, but was not sure if it was a good idea or even how I would go about making it. \n\nDoes watching this video and seeing the mechanics spur any ideas? I am interested in all ideas. I'd love to make something more complete with a better idea to follow."
kpz2ye,Alien Hunter*,"Game where you hunt aliens.\nPremise: You (MC) live in a world dominated by aliens. You with a small group of rebels to wish to free their planet. The planet itself is set in a futuristic post-apocalypse where the only main civilizations consist of aliens and human slaves.\nThe explorer/scavenger in your group finds a alien who managed to die in an event (tree falling on them, collapsed building, hit by car, etc.). He grabs everything he can and radios in for the researchers to come to the location to get the body for analysis. He delivers the “goods” back to base. The alien researcher notices that the explorer brought back a strange watch. This watch, which was wore with the face facing the incide of the wrist, turned out to be a weapon, or rather a prototype weapon the aliens were developing. It apparently, besides giving the user a minimal hud (vitals, etc.), had the ability to mimic/copy other alien weapons.\nThe watch itself, besides having a holographic hud (used to swap weapon type and ammo type), is holographic, meaning it produces a gun hologram. This is fine because the alien weapons are all energy/plasma/gauss (electromagnetic) based."

kpwrfs,"Ok, so hear me out: contra but in other video games.","Basically your standard arcade run and gun at the core, but each level/world is themed after (and has a gimmick based on) other video games.\n\nYou start out in your home game but then end up in a  homage to super mario bros. (Of course with the names and characters changed), where you can stomp on the unique enemies (but not the enemies that work for the main villain, say, a computer virus or a character from a failed mascot platformer in-universe), get a mushroom that makes you grow big, and the weapon pickups look like flowers. Then there's an rpg level where you have a recharging magic meter that works like ammo, but also a melee weapon for certain enemies and in other stages where you have limited ammo (like the fps and survival horror stages), and enemies get weaker the more you kill in the level (Complete with a level up window). Then there would be a puzzle game world where you climb a tower of falling blocks, like that stick figure animation with the tetris blocks. There could be a rhythm game world where you can only shoot to the beat (think crypt of the necro-dancer), a fighting game world where you fight a bunch of mini-bosses 1-on-1, the aforementioned survival horror stage (where you are relentlessly pursued by the level's boss), and finally, the console's OS, where the final boss is fought. Basically, the levels are different genres, usually with a specific game in mind, that each have gimmicks, enemies, and level designs that bring to mind that genre/game."

kpvoe5,A battle royale but lava rises from the floor instead of the circle shrinking,That’s it
kpvg81,Open world kart racer based on an original IP,"So basically my idea is to start from the ground up with an original IP for a kart racing game, and have it be open world much like the later Need for Speeds. I like how for instance Splatoon has it's own unique style and visual design within the team shooter genre, and for me every kart racer outside of Mario Kart kind of just seems like a way to milk an already established franchise. \n\nBest concept I can come up with is a large island inhabited by puppets, fairly similar to the Jim Henson/Sesame Street style. Maybe they've been created by an actual human and exist on an island of make-believe that's developed into a full blown metropolis. In my head I see a central area of the city with a park and a large statue in honor of their absentee creator (he'd probably look like a Fred Rogers or a Walt Disney type). Perhaps on their own the puppets found out that something on this island works fantastically as a fuel source so motorsports becomes their big past time.\n\nYou'd drive around the city, maybe doing deliveries at first, then illegal (sesame lol)street races, and work your way up to the big leagues from there. You'd have the option of creating a crew, perhaps being able to create one of each weight class(probably just 5 weights to start out with), with the weight classes having their own perks and abilities beyond just being heavier and having different stats. Maybe they can choose from their own pool of ultimate moves like so many games have for characters nowadays. \n\nWith the puppet aesthetic, creating custom characters in a myriad of visual styles should be relatively easy. More like a Mr Potato head than something like Cyberpunk or an MMO. Heavy weights could look similar to Sully from Monsters Inc, or even Big Bird, with the middle weights at about Grover's size, and the smallest like maybe sock puppets or something.\n\nKart modification would be deep, but not overly complicated. Not using full sized cars with full size body panels let's you have more control over the visual narrative (sometimes too many options can look messy, Rocket League cars are guilty of this when players just throw the most obnoxious things on). Performance enhancements would be visually represented with exposed parts, along with affecting stats like acceleration, top speed, handling, etc.\n\nThe island itself would be big enough to have varying environments, drawing inspiration from real world racing clichés. Centrally located and perhaps sightly north would be a distinct mountain/range allowing for ""touge"" racing, and leading into a snowy northern section of the island. Basically dead center/East of the island would be the main city with plenty of urban areas for street racing, and also an elevated highway like Japan's Shuto expressways/ Wangan-sen. Further West leads you to a very LA inspired area with concrete slopes like the LA River, along with desert racing/salt flats. South of the island would be very European/Mediterranean, reminiscent of race locales like the Monaco Grand Prix. \n\nThe environment including the cities, streets, and landscape in general would be cartoony and exaggerated adding to it's make-believe nature. Driving around the city should feel lively, yet restricted in terms of not being able to just get out of your Kart and run around on foot (less interaction than GTA but more than NFS). Designated areas could let you get out of the kart, say to visit ancillary characters, or to sit on a beach and watch the sunset.\n\nGameplay would be about what you'd expect from a kart racer, ""official"" races would cut off certain streets of wherever you are to create the tracks, the racing itself feeling very arcade-y but with a skill curve, like learning to get sparks and boosts in Mario Kart.  I also really miss the different race types feeling distinct from each other in the first 2 NFS: Underground games so I'd probably use that idea too, perhaps you'd need differently built karts to compete in straight drag races vs drifting/touge. \n\nWhew, that's about all I can think of at the moment."

kpt99b,FPS based on old Netrek mechanics,"Admittedly I don’t play video games anymore but I’ve always had an idea that I haven’t ever seen deployed in a first person shooter.  When I was younger at university, online gaming was really only occurring between colleges, cmu, Texas and many others with extremely limited graphics so games has to be imaginative to utilize the very little bandwidth available.  One of those games was a 2d 8v8 game called Netrek, I’m not trying to revive that game but have a lot of good memories of the competition.  There is a wiki to get a concept of the play but basically you had to kill opponents in dogfights and each kill allowed you to pick up armies which you then beamed down to opposing planets to gain territory.  Zero kills? No ability to pick up armies, 1 kill? Two armies could be picked up, 2 kills, 4 armies and so on.  The class of ship you picked affected your maximum payload, top speed, fuel and weapon power.\n\nI’d like to see if this would catch on as a variant to battle royale in a first person shooter, like a better version of capture the flag.  Netrek was won and rebooted anytime one side was able to capture all 9 of the opposing planets in the opponent territory and since players spawned next to their core 5 planets after death, each last planet was increasing harder to take.  The game would proceed with players joining and quitting at will, basically an ongoing war front which could last 10 minutes or days depending on skill of the teams.\n\nThis game hooked a lot of smart people in comp sci and related fields from undergrads and graduate students and while the time has passed for it, the format would be interesting to see in a modern adaptation.  I hope someone runs with the idea and not looking for any credit."

kpquaw,I'm looking for an interesting puzzle mechanic,I'm thinking of making a puzzle game. The story is about a guy who met a shady person which granted him a wish to be hot. All girls find him attractive but he is chasing his crush before she leaves the city. Later he finds out that he is actually dead and that the world in which he was wasn't real and much more but I think this is all that matters about the story. I thought it would be cool to have a hot guy with an umbrella  so I tried making a mechanic around it.\n\nI made a box pushing puzzle where you summon a strong wind and it moves the whole row. The goal would be to get from point A to point B without being seen by guards (in our case girls)  with moving boxes so you create the path and block their vision.\n\nI'm afraid that this mechanic is just too generic and I don't know if I can make interesting puzzles with it so I'm thinking about something else.\n\nI would appreciate  all suggestions.
kpph8v,Black Flag but a BR,"I played assassins creed black flag a few times and was thinking what if they made pretty much the same game but multiplayer, so a lot like sea of thieves. Not about that but make it a battle Royale. Im pretty tired of every game coming out being a br but I feel like making a pirate game like black flag and adding a battle Royale element would be very unique and fresh. Imagine starting out at your own cove and setting out looking for enemy pirates. You could fire on them with your cannons and board them for sword fighting. The winner gets ammunition and maybe better weapons. Being able to get off your boat and take refuge on an island would also be a good way to force close combat and be a good place to find better equipment for your boat, crew, and captain."

In addition to that, they rob banks, stores and raid rival gang residences in a linear storyline and world, with non-linear game design. His dream is to ultimately found his own movie production company, but know he can't succeed in his gang. He and majority of his gang have been wanted for most of their lives and the premise of this stops him from leaving his gang. Not to mention, his loyalty to his family and friends. But as all his friends begin to die and go to jail, he tries to convince his fiancee (who is also part of the gang) to run away and start a new life in another city in Sygmus. However, a day before their runaway his fiancee is killed by a rival gang and he decides to live as a professional gang leader for the rest of his life, killing and murdering in cold blood, without regard of the value of life, including his own.\n\nBut with the contemplations of him staying in the gang and leaving far more difficult. The world would be somewhat inspired by Star Wars planets, but Sygmus is a planet with perpetual snow every year, except for north-east of the world where it's a pure sand desert. Vehicles and buildings appear different from the ones on Earth and in Star Wars. The main mechanic of the game is shooting and other forms of combat, with driving and the ocassional, odd games in Starrington.\n\nThat's all I've come up with so far!"

kpje5o,Music based magic system,"I just got idea for magic system based on music. Basicaly players would cast spells by playing various melodies. The musical aspects as tone variations, chords, rythm, key etc would all define the effect of the spell. The more precise one is in replaying the spell, more succesful the spell is. Players would try to acquire various musical intruments to be able to cast new spells. Certain spells could interact and harmonize same as real melodies would. The spells does not have to be neceserary preestablished by developers, instead developers could define effects of various aspects of melodies and then let the players to compose their own melodies. You could also incorporate possibility for singing. The players could create music of all genres. For example you could specialize as a techno necromancer. You could also acquire some powerful ready to use scrolls with real life songs. Also I could imagine this game to have various forms. open world rpg, pokemon go style or just graphics simmilar to stardew valey or nintendo pokemons but I think it should be multiplayer so people can meet together."

kpgwht,A space rogue lite similar inspired by Star Traders: Frontier and the Starsector,"**Gameplay:**\n\nThe game is divided into space travel ,planet exploration and space combat .\n\n* *Space travel* is turn based, moving a one turn usually  takes one in-game day(at least in the beginning) and consumes Helium-3 and Supplies (how much depends on the ship engine type, number of crew-mates and their condition and number of equipment).Traveling through jumpgates also require a lot of Helium 3.As player travels through space, they encounter  merchants, law enforcement, mercenaries ,pirates, etc.\n* *Planet exploration* is also turn based, except  that one turn only consume Supplies and the random encounters are mostly text based.Random encounters vary from encountering other explorers(either friendly or not), discovering a mineral vein, encountering wild alien lifeforms, etc.\n* *Space combat*  is in real time and is very similar to Starsector.\n\n**The Player:** \n\nThe player begins the with a single multipurpose mothership that would serve as the player's mobile base.The player can't own more than one mothership and motherships are only sold by the major factions at an extremely high price.The mothership requires Helium-3 and Supplies The mothership is extremely customizable , so the player can turn it into heavily armored cargo ship, rather fast destroyer or even a mobile factory ship.The player can also hire escorts to protect the ship and if the player has combat shipyard and advanced habitation upgrade, they permanently hire mercenaries to their fleet.If the mothership is  completely destroyed, the game is over.\n\n**The Universe:**\n\nThe universe of the game is divided into mostly randomly generated sectors. Each sector contains about 5 to 25 star systems connected by jump gates, with many trading orbitals, outposts and often rarely, fully colonized worlds.Each sector is also inhabited by mostly randomly generated factions. Sectors can be heavily populated with a strong central authority (most of the time this central authority is major faction) or mostly sparse, with the sector mostly inhabited by isolationist hermits, veteran explorers, pirates clans, cultists or **\[REDACTED\]**. \n\nThings the player can do in a sector:\n\n* Trade commodities between colonies (Mining colonies have high demand for agricultural products)\n* Land ,mine and explore on planets and moons (At first you only limited to barren worlds with a surface. As you gain better equipment and more crewmen, you can safely explore more types of worlds).\n* Become a bounty hunter or a pirate (The player can automatically gain money from killing pirates or any rival faction of the ruling authority of the sector if they have a bounty hunting license.The player can also hunt Galactic Bounty, who are high value bounties given by the major factions.However the player can also get  a bounty on themselves if they piss off a faction too hard).\n* Do Missions (Most of the missions at start are going to be rather basic like delivery or mining.The missions given by a faction  has more rewards, but they are  a lot more riskier).\n* Gain points with a factions by doing mission for them or through defeating their rival factions (Sadly you can't actually join the randomly generated minor factions, however they would give you a  reward in form of perks, like major discount on upgrades and free repairs in the station or even  allow the player to hire some of their ships to be permanently part of your fleet ).\n\nTo leave a sector and travel to another sector, the player has to travel to the local Hyper-gate. All sectors have at least two Hyper-gates.Travelling through Hyper-gates are costly and they require a lot of Helium-3 and a special jumpdrive , so first prepare yourself in your local sector before venturing out.\n\n**Major Factions**:\n\nWhile the most of the factions the player going to encounter are randomly generated and only exists in their sector, some special factions are large and powerful enough have to presence in many sectors.These factions are not randomly generated and the posses equipment not available to other minor factions.The player can join major factions, though it can only be achieved late game.\n\n  **TL;DR : Turn based space roguelike set in a mostly randomly generated universe, inspired by Starsector and Star Traders:Frontier.**"
kpg9fg,A game based on the 2019 Hong Kong protests,"This game will literally never come about due to china's tyranny on free speech but it still should.\n\nThe game would be faithfully based off the 2019 Hong Kong protests for independence and would go through the real events using a cast of mostly (possible completely) fictional characters. The biggest bit of the game would be [the seige of polytechnic University ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_Hong_Kong_Polytechnic_University) which would probably engulf 85% of the main campaign. The university itself would be a main hub area where you can progress main missions, side missions or engage in other optional activities. You can also enter into underground passages to escape back into Hong Kong as a city, the city wouldn't be a big open world but it would have collectibles and secrets to explore, think the open world of God of War 2018. Big enough to give you stuff to do but not completely overwhelming. T\n\nhe Gameplay would be split between base defense in polytechnic University and stealth scavenging in Hong Kong, stealth would be based around understanding your environments and utilizing pathways, the world will be designed so every street could be a stealth arena, in them your only option is to escape as the ability to take down police officers would be few and far between.\n\nBase defense would be MUCH more personal than most games, your controlling a single character not an army so you'll have to manage your own recourses and have to account for the time it takes to pick those recourses up, rocks will be a constant necessity to breakdown car and other situational things, to get these things you'll need to travel around the university mid seige meaning you'll have to split your time wisely between getting material and using material.\n\nThe Story would follow a rag tag group of protesters from ideally hoping for the best of their little camp to realizing how it's fall is inevitable, the main character could have growth between idealism and nyalism ultimately settling on an unpleasant realism. it would end in a monolog while Free Hong Kong would quietly build up in the background culminating in it being the song of the credits."
kpg7c7,"Political, Decision-Based (Open World?) 3D RPG Set Around the Presidential Palace and Political Institutions","Seeing the success of a certain newly released political game, I think the time is ripe for a (First Person?) 3D political game based in the presidential palace and other political buildings/institutions (Situation Room, Party Headquarters, Congressional building) where you mostly hold meetings in the palace and shape the country however you see fit. Maybe the player can visit presidential palaces from other countries during diplomatic visits (depending on the devs' budget), as per the storyline. \n\nThere should be no set way on how the player could shape the country, although of course, a strict planned economy will probably make the country less efficient, or a laissez-faire economy with no intervention can have frequent economic crises and sky-high inequality. The player should be able to see the effects of their policies, either through the news showing the changing landscape of their cities, interactions with other characters, or by visiting cities on their own (in presidential style). The possibilities are endless, and I would be very interested in hearing what devs or fellow players think about this :)"

kp618v,Classic RPG with a Twist,"A standard medieval turn-based rpg similar to Fire Emblem, but with a more realistic battle mechanic whereby depending on how much of a character’s hp has been lost (percentage-wise) further damage increases. For example, an enemy knight deals 5 damage to my wizard with 20 hp. Now that my wizard  is at 15/20 hp, or 75%, that means he’s lost 25% of his max hp, so if the knight attacks the wizard again, the base damage would still be 5, but it would increase by a factor of 1.25, becoming 6.25 damage — rounding to 6. I think it would be cool because realistically on a battlefield, having sustained more damage a similar hit would hurt more."

kp0y0j,IDEA: idle game that requires players to actually be idle,"Before I begin, I am posting this solely as an idea that may help others come up with other ideas. This game, if actually created, would most likely be a complete failure. However, I do think the concept is interesting and explores how games can effect our world.\n\nConcept\n\nAn idle game that only awards points for idling if the player is actually idle. The game would require a player to wear a Fitbit to track steps and heart rate. If the player takes no steps, they will earn points for idling in a traditional sense. The heart rate would merely be used to ensure that players are actually wearing the Fitbit and not just leaving the Fitbit somewhere as they do other things. Points are earned so that players can purchase upgrades similar to other idle games. If players wish to not be idle and still earn points, they can purchase an Active Idle Boost using in-game currency. This would award players a set amount of time for them to get up and move without penalty. The game would have a global leaderboard, awarding players who are the least active.\n\nWhy\n\n-The game is less about playing and more about creating. It would serve as the outer limit that an idle game can be pushed to. I like to see the creation of the game as a statement as opposed to an experience. It would be the most extreme idle game in existence. It takes the over-saturated idle genre and creates something truly one-of-a-kind.\n\n-The concept of the game is rooted in nihilism. It takes a Fitbit, which is designed to make people healthy, and subverts it into something designed to make them sick. It is a joke that the people that play the game would be in on. It is a celebration of self-destruction. The people who play the game would see the people at the bottom of the leaderboards as the actual winners as opposed to the people at the top.\n\n- While I personally think that the game would be destined for failure, I do think that the game would appeal to certain segments of society. The extreme nature of the game would potentially lead to some publicity and many people checking the game out. The nihilistic and ironic attitude of the game could also lead to the game being seen as a “meme” which could generate players. The people that would be drawn to the game would play it ironically.\n\nIssues\n\n-Requiring players to have a Fitbit would doom it to failure. That is a steep price to pay for a item that is rendered nearly useless in order to play a meme game.\n\n-If the game is played properly, it would potentially lead to the shortened lifespans of its most hardcore players. This threatens the longevity of the player base.\n\n-Technical limitations may hinder the game from working as intended. Having a game sync with your Fitbit in real time 24/7 may not be possible as far as I know.\n\nIf anyone actually would want to make the game, all that I ask is that I get mentioned in the Credits. “Conceived by SwoopDoza” would work fine. Feel free to provide feedback."
koxove,Scattering extra lore in translations,"I just heard that French translation of Super Mario Galaxy reveals some extra information about Rosalina's father. This kinds of translation differences from different games pop up from time to time, and I think they are at least mostly unintentional.\n\nBut what about if the game makers would intentionally reveal different pieces of extra lore in different translations? The translations would seem like legit translations from the surface, but little choises of words in different translations would reveal little things about the lore. \n\nI think this could bring the gaming community all around the world together to solve the complete lore behind the game.\n\nAnd just to be clear: The overall gameplay would not revolve around this and the players wouldn't be informed about this in any way. It would be something that some players interested about the deeper lore could find out by themselves."

kow0um,Alien Abduction,"I'm trying to refine a story for a point-and-click adventure game. The influence comes from [*Flight of the Navigator*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091059), however I'm trying to work in a buddy comedy too. Essentially, it would encompass a sci-fi story like [*The Dig*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dig) with the gameplay/writing of [*Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/sam-max-hit-the-road).\n\nAt this point, I'm trying to map out the act/structure. So far I have...\n\n**Act 1:** The protagonists are abducted by an Alien AI. They awaken aboard a space craft, which has suffered damage and is in a low power state. They player solves puzzles while they explore the ship, trying to figure out what is going on. As the player progresses, the AI gradually awakens.\n\n**Act 2:**  The player is tasked with helping the AI restore power/repair the ship and decipher their location. The protagonists can be beamed to local planets and solve puzzles in the form of errands.  \nBut I'm not sure how to make this fit the narrative, e.g. are the planets populated with civilisations? Do they speak english? Do they not freak out when two humans/earthlings arrive? How does this help the AI? ... Am I over thinking this?\n\n**Act 3:** The player solve some puzzles relating to restoring the ship, and the AI agrees to return them to Earth.  \nAn alternate idea, is that the AI doesn't intend to return them to Earth. It had manipulated the protagonists, in order for their assistance in restoring the ship. This could then result in an additional puzzle for the player to out-power the AI and gain control of the ship.\n\nAny suggestions, ideas or inspirations would be appreciated. Even some puzzle ideas would be of great help.  \nThanks in advance."

kordcn,A teddy bear game,"You are a teddy bear protecting a child from nightmares. The setting can be in a bedroom with the kid sleeping, and you have to go into the kids nightmares and kill the nightmare beasts without being caught by the kid inside of their dream, and without having the kid get attacked by the nightmares. So kind of a stealth roguelike game because there could be as many, hard, and wacky monsters you could fight. Also, get creative with the dreams! Are they in the wild west, having a duel with dad, or are they in dreamland, with ponies and dogs everywhere? You decide!"

koqupv,A game idea about a revengeful corgi,"A game where you, a corgi, are playing in your backyard when suddenly, your hooman throws the ball a little bit too far, and a squirrel takes it and runs to wherever you decide. Space, the edge of the galaxy, a mountain that looks like it is in a ninja anime, wherever! But you, the corgi, gets geared up with whatever, could be guns, could be a katana, could even be a magic wand. But you go on a bizarre adventure, and in the end, have a huge battle with that dang squirrel that took your ball away from you, but before you end him, he turns into something. You decide. A transformers/power rangers mech, an alien of colossal size, a necromancer who summons the remains of the roadkill, a literal lord of demons, or whatever the heck you want, but all for your tennis ball. Make this story as wacky and goofy as you would like and I would love to see a game like this."
koqe7y,A scooby doo game idea I just came up with,"A game the opposite of Scooby doo where you and the gang have to hide from the villain who sets traps around an environment/arena and you have to hide from him/her/it. Each member of the Scooby doo gang have special abilities, like Velma making contraptions to help her hide and or escape from traps, Daphne can be less suspicious to the villain and/or help out a team if you ever make it multiplayer, Fred can make game plans for the team, if you make it multiplayer, or be able to find traps and make more complicated hiding spots/ costumes due to the plans to make it more to what you want and make it so you don’t fly around everywhere trying to come up with a hiding spot, Shaggy is the fastest and time can slow down when traps are activated so he is the one who is best against traps, and Scooby can be more flat in his hiding spots and go into smaller holes, and fit into more places. The villain can change depending on what map is chosen and at the end, you can trap the villain and get away, with Velma being the best at making the traps while Scooby is the worst, or you and your gang get caught maybe with the iconic “lets see who this really is” phrase."

konnj7,Manic Energy at Maximum,"So this just came to me as a fever dream. I want someone to take this from me and just run with it because honestly I want to play it.\n\nSandbox medieval fantasy MMORPGs, an idea done to death and back but I've been playing MMOs since Ultima and I'll likely spend the rest of my life playing them. I'm tired of the gear treadmill formula, I'm tired of the NPC bosses and the months without content waiting on the next patch. I want a game where the players are the bosses.\n\nLets say the game revolves around cults, the players in these cults slowly performing rituals and such to funnel into the cult leader who after reaching a point can use their cults power to transform into a giant dragon, demon, titan, whatever. This suddenly makes them the global threat. Several cults could be working towards this goal, there could be several of these player monsters at a time. Maybe they're working together, as tends to happen with mega clans maybe one decides he just wants to use his new status to kill everyone else.\n\nThe transformation is permanent, once you become a giant dragon you can't change back and the way you interact with the game is permanently different. When you log out the giant monster remains static, sleeping in the world and still attackable. It becomes your cults duty to protect you while you're offline. If you are killed as a giant dragon your cult is immediately disbanded, and your character is reverted to level one.\n\nAs a mitigation for cults bullying solo players they could be able to pool resources themselves, and after maybe a month transform themselves, creating a dynamic of constantly studying your agressors and learning their routing, and storming their leader when he logs off to try and decimate them while they sleep.\n\nTear it apart, tell me I'm dumb and why players are never given these options on their own, start a kickstarter I don't care. I liked Conan Exiles, if you're curious and its obvious what my favorite feature is."

K here is my idea; You start the game playing in regular medieval Hammerfell. You beat a couple dungeons and come across some challenges. In one of the dungeons, You find a journal... your long dead wife's journal. you read it and find out that you and her had a child you didn't know about and that she sold him to a group of marauders for 90 septims. you get a quest called ""The 90 septim son"" which sends you to find your son. You save him but are killed on the way out of the cave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to 878 years later.... You wake up in a bed. You now get to customize your character and name yourself. You are in Hammerfell but in the future. Argonians riding cars, Redguards with their face in their phone (much more high tech than today's phones.) Orcs in a wrestling ring. It would be weird and maybe too similar to Fallout and too far from TES but i dunno. I just play games, I don't make em."

l4v89u,A game about evolution and natural selection,"The game would be based around a number of core mechanics. First, it would be split into a number of servers in the style of an MMO - for each server, everything about the player’s creature is saved. Second, each server would be wiped after a set amount of time. Thirdly, directly after a wipe, a set of randomly generated “species” are created with random stats and traits (both of which are explained later). Upon joining a server, a player is given a random set of these creatures that they can choose from. From then on, the objective is simple: work together with others of your species in order to become the dominant species of the server by earning more points overall than other species. Points would be earned by completing milestones before other species and of course by eating/combat. Points can be lost for your species from dying as well.\n\nEarning points for your species would allow you to upgrade stats and traits. Stats would refer to basic values like your health, armor, speed, etc. which would merely be increased by upgrading, this would simulate aging in the game. Traits would be special abilities or effects that would be applied to your creature; like the ability to fly, block hits, inflict bleeding or poison, and/or perform special maneuvers like a charge or something. This would simulate unique features of your species, and upgrading could do a multitude of things; unlock new abilities, or increase a value like damage or duration.\n\nThis way, after each wipe, the meta changes; it never remains constant, although certain traits could certainly match well together."

l4j5kf,SENSE," \n\nGame idea\n\nSENSE\n\nYou awaken in a building unable to  see, touch or smell. \*It's not covid don't worry.\* All you can remember is an experiment that you were put under for by a strange company. Awakening you hear a voice tell you that something went wrong and “ they “ are loose. To regain certain senses back you need to find the right syringe escape and succeed in the trial you were actually here for. To make this a fair trial,  the voice will allow you to keep your hearing and tells you that the only way to regain your senses is to  find the other syringes. To do this all  you need to listen for is the radio static. However the voice also warns you to not be lead astray as not every sound is friendly and you are not alone in the building. \n\nThere are 4 creatures in the building with you, each one is hunting you based on its ability. \n\nThe creature of Sight preys on those who cannot see, mimicking sounds mundane as electric humming to the radio static and human voices. It stalks along the halls and is purely an ambush predator. It is a gigantic wolf-like creature with long claws and very very sharp teeth. It is entirely deaf and relies on its ability to mimic to lure in its prey. Hiding as well as avoiding suspicious out of place sounds is the best way to avoid this predator    \n\nThe creature of hearing preys on the deaf, listening in to the stumbling of those who cannot see with its massive dead eyes in the dark corridors. Like an aye aye it clacks its hands gently against the walls to guide itself. While it cannot see it can hear amazingly well so hiding from it would be your best best. It looks almost like a gigantic mole with the eyes of a blind cave fish. \n\nThe creature of touch is blind and deaf, but unlike others it can open doors and feel  around so hiding behind doors is no safety should it decide to look around where you happen to be. The easiest way to avoid this horrid creature of tentacles is to simply hide and pray it decides to move on. \n\nThe creature of smell is a creature blind deaf and consistent of a single desire. To feed. The creature follows single mindedly a scent trail it picks up and follows relentlessly at a slow pace until it finds what is following and devours said prey. From this horrid monstrous hungry slobbering creature you can run, but you cannot hide.\n\nEscaping the facility requires the use of different use of your  senses and you can only use one at a time. Each sense can be found via a syringe in different areas as well as finding and opening doors that require the ability to sense an active sense of touch. The surgery has blocked your ability to feel what certain items feel like and the facility has many false access cards. You can only hope to use the right sense strategically staying alive while trying to escape."

There can be the typical waves and gets harder with time and also Easter eggs and little fun things to do but the other team is playing the same map and with money you accumulate from killing you zombies you can sabotage the other team. Like for instance you can pay to close an room or pay to swap a perk. Or pay to summon stronger bigger zombies. Winner is who can survive longer. I’m sure this can be expanded so it’s not dry maybe could also be whoever does the Easter egg first wins but ultimately it’s a game of sabotage.

Maybe a few ads, potential for you to monetize certain aspects unless you wanted to make it with no IAPs. \n\nA cool mechanic would be a way to pay for gene results (dna tests) where you could see the potential outcomes for each breed pair. \n\nI really personally think this would look good as a pixelated game, but that’s just my own personal opinion.

Please feel free to criticise and all advice is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The world**\n\n* Set in mega city 1\n* Mega city 1 is split up into sectors and when the game opens up you only have access to one as the game introduces you the mechanics and how it works - but the sector limit goes away quickly and you get a promotion from which you are granted access to the entire city\n* All buildings can be explored\n* It is fast and easy to get around the city and explore\n* Can go to places such as New York and Washington DC\n* Npcs will give you advice and ask for help as you patrol around the city\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gunplay**\n\n* First person\n* You can lean around corners similar to games like rainbow six seige\n* You start off with a basic pistol but it can be upgraded and use different ammo types, which is also true about every other weapon in the game\n* You end the game with: a pistol, an SMG, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, grenades and a grenade launcher\n* You can dual wield the pistols or the SMGs, you can also chose to put a grenade in your other hand instead of one of those guns which reduces the time it takes to throw one\n* Helmet visor also offers night vision and thermal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gangs and enemies**\n\n* If you focus on a sector crime rate will go down and make it more peaceful and safer\n* You can make crime rate go down by fighting crime and doing side quests and main missions will also affect this as well\n* There is many different gangs throughout mega city 1, with some being very small and inexperienced and others being bigger and more skilled and more powerful\n* If you take down a gang settlement  other nearby gangs will take it over, which can lead to gangs fighting in the streets and other judges going after them\n* Different gangs do different crimes and have different techniques\n* Gangs will also have different enemy types and use different weapons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DREDD**\n\n* Certain scenarios will have dialogue options - this can lead to good and bad consequences\n* Can choose what kind of judge you want to be - by the books or riding the edge\n* The more violent you are the worse reputation you will have which will lead to NPCs not being as inclined to help you and vice versa\n* If you are injured you will start to take damage overtime this can be reduced by taking pain killers but these injuries will eventually stack - you can fix this by  going into the medical menu where you can patch yourself up using a med kit  (think MGS3)\n* Can unlock and wear different uniforms and helmets\n* Can wear body armour to reduce chance of injury\n* Depending on what you choose to equip and take on a mission your appearance will change for example if you take a lot of ammo you will wear a bandolier or if you equip a lot of grenades they will be attached to your chest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Vehicles**\n\n* Motorbike - the vehicle you will start off with, fast and nimble (can mostly go anywhere)\n* Car - not as fast but offers protection against crashes and gunfire, you can also use vehicle weapons and you can also store items and guns\n* Truck - slower moving but takes very little damage and has the most variety of vehicle weapons as well as a canon, can store  more weapons than the car\n* Hover craft - an endgame unlock which you can use to fly around the city, only the judges have access to these so not many vehicles in the sky\n* Dropship - not drivable, what you use for fast travel and can be called at specific points throughout the city, what judges come in to help you and what co-op partners use to spawn into your game with\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Co-op and online**\n\n* You have a customisable co-op judge used for when you join your friends games, you can also use the co-op judge in free roam and do certain side quests and activities with\n* Customisation for the co-op judge will not be too detailed (not dark souls levels of customisation)\n* In co op mode you can free roam and do side quests and activities with them\n* Can do a main quest with a friend as long one of you is dredd\n* Can do 1v1s and 2v2s in a judge HQs\n* In offline, you can choose from a list of select judges to help you with a mission, including your customised co-op partner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Side activities**\n\n* Criminal activity you can tackle: drug busts, riots, hostage situations, robberies, car thefts and thievery, missing people, kidnappings, dirty cops and crime scenes\n* Other activities: shooting range, paperwork, training, other judges and finding collectables\n\nThis is my second time typing this up as I deleted my whole first draft when trying to copy it but anyways... thanks for reading :)"
l3mi1p,Camping Sim - Survival,"I've played games like the Long Dark, RDR2 and various road trip games (like Jalopy and The Long Drive) and I would really love a camping game.\n\nYou'd pick a route on the map, it'll show the general terrain (giving you hints on what gear you'd need), any locations (like small stores or abandoned areas that can be used for shelter), the length in miles and estimated how long it would take. You then choose which backpack you use and you're off.\n\nYou can get money by collecting plants/hunting/creating trinkets and other stuff from the world and selling them at stores, where you can buy supplies and gear. \n\nThere's an intricate fire system where you position your items so the fire can increase, with the dampness making it harder to light. You can use lighters, matches, hand-made fire lighers, firecraft gear. Fires can be used to access skills / skillpoints which you can pour into Firecraft, Bushcraft etc. \n\nYou need to eat, sleep, drink, possibly even piss and crap, as well as regulate body temperature. \n\nThere'd be two main modes - 'Camper' and 'Survivalist'. \n\nThe Camper mode will be more relaxed, with extended starting supplies, money, easier gameplay mechanics - it'll be for those wanting a game to simply relax to where they can just set up camp and do a virtual hike for a few in-game days.\n\nSurvivalist will increase risk and have only fewer starter supplies. When hiking, you may encounter hostile animals and get sick easily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA game like this would be that one game on steam I'd have 10000 hours in. I'd say, if one needed a AAA idea, that it was openworld with a bus/taxi/plane system to travel about."
l3mhil,"An idea for a masou game, Crusaders, Romans and other soldiers of European culture, historical European figures against yo kai's","I know this idea is not much, But I would like to see such a scenario where every form of soldier and historical European figures invade Japan and the yo kai try to defend it from them., except idk what flair to apply in this, but anyway, I want hear peoples thinks about my idea"
l3lo5k,A programmer looking a game that incorporates the movie tron with a shooter...,"I love tron the movie and I love shooter games, and I make games but i really can’t think of how to incorporate them, so I figured why not come here and ask for how I could incorporate them! thanks in advance"
l3ldba,Interesting idea,I have a idea to make it better! You can get rid of fire and you can create fire!
l3kdtt,What I think is a really good idea for a game,Basically take ea’s Star Wars battle front 2 and make it avengers endgame like. So there would be the kree and the ravages and thano’s army trying to do objectives or capture points while special heroes like captain America iron man Thor and etc cost more points to play
l3jc5a,VR/Keyboard Multiplayer Game where the PC Players try to survive against VR Player in Horde Survival,"A game where a giant VR player is playing a MOBA/Tower Defense game trying to stop multiple FPS players from advancing by spawning enemies.  I think something like Left 4 Dead but with a currency system for the VR player to spawn enemies, definitely some kind of upgrade thing like in COD: Zombies for the FPS players too.\n\nI think this would give VR players more games to play with their friends who might not have a headset.  And with there needing to be way less VR players to play there wouldn't be a bottleneck for people with headsets."
l3jb1r,Looking for ideas for features in my game.,"I am making a 2d game about cartoony dinosaurs in a spaceship that are travelling the planet to reacue other dinosaurs from ""extinction"" events. You control one dinosaur. I am looking for ideas as to what you should be doing on the ship while travelling from one point to the next. I am looking for short tasks that will slowly overwhelm you. For example, you need to put out fires on the ship, or charge the batteries for a machine, or grow plants to create biofuel to power the ship, or fix damage outside the ship with a blowtorch. \n\nDoes anyone have any other ideas as to what small things one might do in a space ship?"
l3bjzq,USA Versus Japan,Please suggest to me ideas for my Game Idea [https://gameideas.fandom.com/wiki/USA\_Versus\_Japan](https://gameideas.fandom.com/wiki/USA_Versus_Japan)  In order to qualify every character has to represent their respective country.  American made series can only have American characters.  Japanese made series can only have characters who are Japanese by their canon.
l3b0nz,Can somebody help me with and idea for a gamejam?,"So, I'm participating solo on my first game jam. Its the Blackthornprod game jam, and the theme is ""Less is More"".\n\nI've though about a post man, that would have to deliver as many letters as it could, and the lesser letters he would return to the station, the more points/money he would gain.\n\nBut I could not find any fun Gameplay to that.\n\n\nCan somebody help me find an idea, or develop this one?"
l38ycj,Side scroller MMORPG meets Ori and the will of the wisps.,"Basically MapleStory with the graphics and game play gameplay of ori and the will of the wisps.\n\nLots of different classes with unique skills in a beautiful, but simple side scroller setting with interactive and fast paced gameplay which you can lose your self in for hours grinding.\n\nI can’t find a game like this, but I’d definitely play it."
l35tdz,An FPS shooter set in the Spanish Civil War,"Of all the wars in the 20th century, WW2 has been the most over-saturated setting in gaming. It's time we try another conflict that's more interesting, the Spanish Civil War.\n\nImagine a game where you play as both the Nationalists and the Republicans across several battlefields in Spain. It would be an FPS shooter with fleshed-out characters and moral choices.\n\nHere's my concept of how it would look like: The Story mode would have 2 campaigns for both the Nationalists and the Republicans. On one side you play as a soldier fighting for the Nationalists, while you play as a female on the Republican side. Over the course of the story, the two protagonists would fight in all the notable battles across Spain while having stories of their own, such as bonding with their comrades or falling in love with someone. The ending would show the 2 becoming old and reflecting on their past actions to future generations.\n\nThe multiplayer would be a mix of Battlefield and Call of Duty. You can fight as an infantryman, drive a tank and armored car, and fly a plane in the vast maps. Game modes would be similar to all the other games in the market. There would also be a game mode BF1's Operations where both teams would fight over territories on the map.\n\nThere would also be character customization. You could design what your soldier would look like and make your own class instead of picking one.\n\nOverall, the game would be also educational as it teaches the player about the war."
l35q79,Game where you try to enable an anti-virus while malware shuts down your computer.,"This is inspired by when I thought that was happening to me. Turns out my computer was simply glitching. Oh well.\n\nAs time goes on, your computer would get slower and lose more and more functionality. You might need to find alternate ways to solve problems to combat your computer growing more and more glitchy.\n\nDepending on the difficulty, things like whether or not the antivirus is already downloaded, the efficiency of the virus, and other things would be influenced.\n\nThis probably wouldn't have a whole lot of replay value, but still might be fun to see."
l35a5i,Hidden object game inspired by endless morning hunts,"I have a terrible time in the morning trying to look for things. My morning routine usually begins with me looking through the folds of sheets and blankets to uncover my glasses. Then checking through the laundry basket for keys. And ending with me sticking my hand through every crevice of furniture for my wallet. I have a bowl to keep my essential items, but it usually remains empty.\n\nWhy not a hidden object game, where you have to find items in your apartment by tearing up the place. Every item can be interacted with. From taking the cushions off the couch to emptying the recycling bin (Maybe you need to find an important document). Clues will be audible, which would be the player's recollection of last know events or whatever.\n\nHow would you make a ""Hidden Object"" game unique?"
l347zi,New FPS/puzzle game about Aliens abducting you,What I’m thinking is a FPS/puzzle game about aliens abducting you for some reason (Idk the reason yet put ideas in the comments) and you have to escape to a space shuttle to get out but to get there you have to fight aliens and do puzzles to open new areas in the game
l343xa,Virtual concert, I feel.right now a game that a person can go see a virtual concert . Each artist can figure what visual style they want .  People make there own avatar and go to the concert  pay small fee for tickets  . You also receive special token or special visual ticket you can check later and share with other fans . The pandemic is the perfect time to  try something like this .it's safe and a perfect way to support bands or groups people you like. I would like to create this idea with some peoples help or expand  the idea more!
l31t76,Huge game event idea,"I have this idea for a while but wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit. Anyways, my idea is about Escape from Tarkov. The maps are huge already but what if a special event was arranged as 2-3 maps combined (or it can be each map) and the best and most famous streamers/players around the world ( Doesn't have to be tarkov players, can be any fps player) were given full decks that they can arrange anyway and made to fight till death?\n\nI know the game's concept is not rather battleground but the idea of an event where we can see full decked out famous players fight till last one survives, with the tense atmosphere and realism of Tarkov would be just like the movies where a bunch of rich people bet on some ex-marines on a fight till death. (There are quite a few movies like that). If legality was arranged we could even bet on these guys just like the rich guys in movies. What do you think?"
l31fbk,Three realm first person supernatural PVP,"Here's a game idea that's been brewing for a while. There are of course lots more details in my head but this is the short version:\n\n**Game play:**  \n\- First person ""goth""-flavor PVP with focus on balance  \n\- Three competing realms each with a distinctive theme.  \n\- Realms spells and abilities are mirrored for balance, only names and visual effect differ\n\n**Play as:**  \nVampire or Witch/Warlock of the Blood Realm  \nWerewolf or Druid of the Sylvan Realm  \nDemon or Dark Angel of the Nether realm\n\n**Features:**  \n\- Characters doesn't level, they age one year per real time day.  \n\- Character appearance/size/abilities/powers change as they grow older.  \n\- Character select size, which determine in game stats  \n\- Characters can fall in battle and be resurrected, or soul killed (very hard) and need to be reborn/restarted  \n\- Every real full moon, each realm elect a Realm Master with special PVP abilities.  \n\- Spells are not ""casted"", words are read from a book, forming incantations that generate effects  \n\- Players can ""breed"" their heir, that inherits traits and becomes playable if/when they die  \n\- Possible to play as human hunter, able to hunt all realms. Easy to kill and limited life span  \n\- Collect souls from players/NPC's to refill power and keep ageing  \n\- In combat, enemies aren't targeted, but affected by cone/point blank/AE spell/melee-effects"

l2xgfs,RPG game.,"You get incredibly random skills. That could either be truly terrible. Or god tier for fighting. And you can have 2. And it could literally be anything. It rolls from random Whens, ifs, hows, Why, And whos,  \nExample.\n\n&gt;If \[Die\] And \[In party\] (Explode) \[Dealing\] \[10\] Damage\] to \[All\] \[Enemies\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If \[Die\] And \[In party\] (Explode) \[Killing\] \[All\] \[Party members.\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If \[Hurt\] And \[Not in party\] (Kill) \[1\] Enemy\]   \n&gt;  \n&gt;When \[Enemy killed\] (Explode) {Random} \[Party member\] {Other then you}\n\nYeah. Extremely random. \n\nIt would also be a game type which i no joke forgot.\n\nIf all your party is dead. Game is over. And your party members most leveled character turns undead. Gets his stats leveled up 4X, Turning it into a boss. And drops a Armour that has his skill fused onto his Armour. Or weapon. When killed. That way you can regain your most leveled characters skill.   \n\n\nFor the multi skill thing. It would be trough Skill fused items. And chance. And sometimes skills work together really well. Cancel out each other. Or are so incompatible that the character wielding the skill instantly dies.   \n\n\nThe ultimate frustrating RNG game. Along with noita."
l2w3zb,Expendable crewman space battle,"I was thinking about a coop game about being an expendable crewman in a large warship durring a space battle. The players' job would be to keep a ship at optimal fighting capacity during a space battle. The players would run around the corridors of the spaceship in FPS mode grabbing stuff from wall mounted dispensers and moving it to where it needs to be. \n\nWhen the crap hits the fan there will be jobs all around the ship from moving shells from the armory to the guns, putting out fires, hauling injured crew members to med bay, and repelling borders. The speed and ability to prioritize will determine if the ship makes it through the battle or not.\n\nThere will be no external view of the larger space battle, but the AI captain will shout orders, give status updates, or warn of impending damage/ boarding action."
l2vhki,VR Puzzle game that uses voice commands to create objects.,"It would use your microphone and speech-to-text to pull from a pool of words that correspond to 3D objects that have functionality. You can also add attributes to the objects by saying adjectives before the object. I will admit it borrows from Scribblenauts, but the art style could be distinct, and the item creation method is different. The puzzles should also avoid being Scribblenauts like. Instead of helping people with a problem, you could have to use locomotion or teleportation to get past an obstacle or station that has clear objectives or functionality. There could be plot that reveals itself through your adventure through the physical space. The puzzles should require the player to think creatively and come up with their own real world physics solution to the problem. The player will also learn their own strategies that they can employ when needed. \n\nThe biggest challenge would be getting a big word bank and creating the 3-D models and properties of objects. Lots of objects will have very simple or nearly useless functions and may serve simply as shapes. There should be regular daily objects like cars, weapons, food, as well as objects that can be given magical properties through adjectives and even verbs. An object could be made to be flying or angry. Players should be able to make animals and different types of people. The art style could be similar to job simulator. It would be a lot of work to think of enough fun, creative ideas for what each object and person does. A simple AI would be a component. The puzzles can involve everyday problem solving or trying to get from one place to another, or moving a lot of things with a unique vehicle or method.\n\nYou should be able to die, and have adjectives applied to yourself. There should also be options to cheese puzzles with silly powerful objects that the player will have to choose to avoid for their own enjoyment. A sandbox mode is also necessary so the player can build something of their choice with objects.\n\nI think this sort of game, being VR, couldn't quite be $60, but it could be sold in early access and then have levels added as time goes on in development and more words are added. Players could also suggest items that the developers didn't think of. There could also be a level maker where the player can create 3-D spaces and walls, adding their own objects and win-states."
l2t9bb,Pikmin combines with Seaman,"The game would have you growing creatures from the ground and nurturing them using scheduled feeding times and cage cleaning. You then get the creatures out on a hunt for more materials or eggs by using a little robot to lead them. The creatures will attack anything that they are told to attack or will pick up any single item while going on with the scavenging missions. There are hazards like deep water, frost, poison gas, wind, and sticky sap that will hinder or kill off your creatures. You can however get materials to create said hazards and set them up in a different cage and put some creatures there. Eventually, the creatures will adapt and become immune or tolerant of the hazards (being able to swim, fire coat, flight, etc.) and can be added to the main squad. The creatures will grow up and become stronger over a course of real time, going from small blob, to having more facial features, to having limbs, and end up as buff,strong, tiny humanoids. \n\nThere is online play where you can combine your cage with another person’s cage to get breeding going or to get materials or you can invade someone’s cage to steal resources. Same can happen to you so you you must put up defenses like sap or fire.\n\nI was thinking of using this for myself but I have no motivation to use this so..."
l2roud,Score Frenzy Arena Shooter,"So, If you've ever played a shooter game that has different game modes, It's obvious that everyone has a favorite mode. TDM, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy, CTF, etc. \n\nI had an idea to make everyone happy simultaneously. Basically it's your standard 6v6 shooter game, Different classes/weapons and so on, but what makes this game unique is in it's core game mode. \n\nThe objective of the game is to score the most points, while playing all the game modes at the same time.\n\nAt spawn there is a bomb to plant on the enemy objective. At the enemy objective there is also a flag to capture, as well as a hardpoint that periodically changes position around the map.\n\nYou score points by doing anything. If you successfully plant and detonate a bomb. The bomb respawns and you get a point bonus. If you capture the flag you get a point bonus. If you kill an enemy you get a point bonus. You get points for holding down the hardpoint and so on.\n\nBasically the game is a super fast paced shooter on crack."
l2rn20,Best open world game idea #2!,"make a game where in the beginning you can pick and custom your own character,(this involves real life money to pay for some clothes/characters)\n\nAfter your done with customization,\nYou get to walk through the city.\nyou can pick 3 options,this is how you get a sidekick \n\n1.)You see this lady standing by an atm trying to fit all her money into her purse,from the street ally you notice a guy stalking her and walking out the ally  slowly this is where you can run over to the situation.You can beat up the guy and the lady thanks you.(She Is Good with cash!she has a big purse)\n\n2.) you see this dog getting mistreated by a man who is taking a dog to the pound,running over will allow you to say the dog is yours and from there you can choose what breed of dog you want\n\n3.)you see this homeless kid dropping his shopping cart full of items and a car is coming down the road you can run quickly over and take care of the boy for the rest of the game\n\n(-and of course you can make more companions along the way and disband the ones you don’t want-)\n After you choose you are automatically by a tv and the tv turns on with a warning to leave the city and then you see buildings catching on fire and cars crashing and people screaming.you and your companion run you have no idea what’s going on and you realize planes flying over and instead of hearing police sirens you hear big military vehicles coming and honking \nThey are picking up people and taking them to safety.You realize that in every video game you always go to the bunker,so you run the other way into someone’s random yard this dog begins barking this is where your companion is in danger you have to stop the dog and after stopping the dog you see this plane from another country drop a giant bomb and you run into someone’s basement and into the wooden door in the floor to go the pipes there you hear giant explosions  and the screen goes black and all you hear is ringing you wake up to your companion waking you up they already dug a way out you crawl through the hole and hear broken sirens and buildings erupting and smoking this is where your survival starts.\n\nPeople who was hit from the bomb was turned into half bone half flesh and the radiation melted the eyes and ears and fingers off.\n\nYou and your companion out of the broken city to find a new beginning.\nThis is where the game starts to be open world.\n\nyou find this guy on the side of the dirt abandon road and he ask your name this is where you can custom the name that is known for you by ncps.\nHe asks you where are you from and you tell him the city down the road and he said how long have you been there you tell the man since before the war.he tells you that the war was over 200 years ago and the world has lost all of its power,there’s no president there’s no laws,there’s just civilization and kingdoms and the richest kingdom is our leader.\n\nThe man then takes you to his kingdom and you are showed how to build and how to prepare for war and how to shoot and how to combat.he also gives a journal that gives you all the basic \nCrafting and cooking recipes+every recipe you learn can be added to the journal.\nAfter you complete the basic tutorial you are brought out into the open world to start on your own.\nYou and your companion journey begins here.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nMake your own character,pick companion (woman/boy/dog)\nThe Tv comes on the war is coming.planes are flying over your head.bombs are falling!into the basement you go,200 years later, the undead is among us and a new civilization is born.The Leader is the richest kingdom of them all,the kingdoms are the only government/law.Open world.pvp.so grab your gear and go to war!"
l2pacu,"If you can combine any/all games, what games you choosing? What’s the end result like?","This is my design: \n\n(Action-Adventure Hack and Slash Sandbox MMORPG) \n\nWhen you lock on to the battle zone or enter the battle zone, you will hear all the microphones of the players participating in the battle.  Players will also hear your microphone during combat.  Outside of combat, you can lock on to any player and listen to that player's microphone.  The player can also listen to your microphone.  All parties / guild players can always hear each other's microphones, even if the players are in completely different locations.  You can mute anyone's microphone at any time.\n\n To hear a person's mic outside the battle zone, lock on to another player or create / extend one open mic zone.  You can create an open mic zone only if you are not in another player's open mic zone.  The open mic zone creates an invisible barrier that surrounds the creator, including players within the radius of the barrier, without blocking anything.  The open mic zone allows all players in the barrier to participate in open mic parties.  Join with the push of a button and you'll hear all players' microphones from all players in the open mic zone.  Open mic parties are different from regular parties and guilds.  When you leave the open mic zone, you are no longer a member of the party.  For microphones, all mute options are always available.\n\n There are customizations for height, children / adults, fat / thin, clothes, equipment, armor, appearance, weapons, abilities, movements, skills, magic, and summons.  Customizing the appearance of the character is similar to the game ""God Eater 2"" and the game ""Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization"".  You can create up to 4 characters.  You can switch to control one character or one of ""your"" other created party members.  The character's AI can be set in the same way as in the game ""Star Ocean: Until the end of time"".  You can play the game with any character you create.  You can switch control of the party character at any time.  If you don't want to control your ""own"" character during battle, just set the character to AI.\n\n There are several specific places where you can talk to different NPC characters and enter different servers to advance the story.  These servers warp / teleport ""your"" different party characters to any section of the current story.  Each server has a limited number of players, and each server has all players of the same level within 10 intervals (eg Server 1-Level 1-10, Server 2-Level 10-20).  You can always enter a server above your level, but you cannot enter a server below your level.  You can earn certain things by completing different parts of the story.  There are many side stories, hidden ones, and optional ones, which are not part of the story.  There are also many gates and portals similar to the game "".hack: Infection"", where you can choose different servers and experiment with different dungeons.\n\n To engage in combat, you can either attack someone / something or be attacked by someone / something.  A character / player will not gain experience unless that character / player hits an opponent at least once.  The hit must be a hit even if the damage dealt is 0, not the damage caused by the status effect.  During the battle, the radius of the battle zone is automatically set according to the position of the first participant.  Only the first combat participant can lock the combat zone at any time.\n\n Locked battle zones have invisible barriers that keep battle participants inside, blocking entry into all other zones.  If the battle zone is unlocked, other players / characters outside the battle zone can join the battle zone and gain experience points.  You can only gain experience points if you are in the same battle zone as the enemy you defeated when you defeated it.  All different enemies have different amounts of experience points that players earn during their defeat.  If the enemy is defeated by multiple participants, the experience points will be evenly divided among those participants.  If there are no players in the battle zone for more than 2 minutes, it will no longer be an existing battle zone.  There are harsh environments that your character may not be able to tolerate.  The item ""Magic Battle Zone Lock"" creates a locked battle zone that surrounds you, including all players within the radius, and blocks fire, water, etc.\n\n Players cannot attack another non-enemy player unless one player achieves ""G"" status or offers a player-versus-player challenge option.  To provide player-versus-player challenges, get close enough to ""lock on"" to another player, select challenge options, and extend one battle zone barrier that surrounds all players / targets.  ..  All player-versus-player challenge participants must be within the battle zone barrier.  All players in the battle zone must select the option to accept the challenge to start the battle.  The battle music option for this battle allows you to vote / agree or randomly select one playlist from one participant.  ""G"" status is achieved when the bar / meter is full, either by attacking the target or by being attacked for some reason.  ""G"" is a ""special"" that all players can ""use"" with the push of a button.  If you achieve ""G"" status, you will not be an enemy of other players until you attack.  Once you reach ""G"" status, you cannot be attacked by any player until you attack that player or participate in a player-versus-player challenge.\n\n If a ""G"" attacks a non-enemy player in a battle zone, that ""G"" cannot lock that battle zone.  ""G"" gains all experience points from the defeated ones, unless those ""Gs"" do not attack allies.  The ""G"" status lasts for 11 minutes.  When you defeat a ""G"", that ""G"" loses its ""G"" status, is no longer an enemy, and anyone can revive the player.  ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are ""King"" / ""Queen"", ""Boss"", or ""Elite"" characters.  Also, ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are participating in a player-versus-player challenge.  If four or more ""G"" s attack an ally in a battle zone, that battle zone achieves ""Frenzy"" and all players can attack all players.  The frenzy battle zone can only be locked by King / Queen, Boss, and Elite characters / players.\n\n When a player dies, that player can wait to be resurrected by someone else.  Alternatively, the player can choose the option to return to the entrance to the place where the player died, choose a server to return to the open world, or go to the equipment graveyard.  If you die more than 10 times, the option to return to the entrance to the place of death will not be available.  Your mic still works while you are dead.  You cannot earn experience points or items while you are dead.\n\n There are many continents on the map.  All continents are made up of zones.  Each zone has its own enemies and neutrals.  In most cases, all enemies and / or neutrals in each zone are at about the same level within the zone.  When all enemies in the zone have been defeated or all achievements in the zone have been completed, the last remaining players must fight each other.  Anyone who conquers a zone has the title of ""boss"" for that zone, and that player can choose the enemies in that zone.  Players select those enemies based only on all enemies defeated in the game, except for all defeated players.  Also includes boss enemies (different color schemes for boss enemies).  Players also select the level of those enemies, but only up to the highest level of enemies they have defeated so far.  If a ""boss"" player's zone is conquered by another player, that ""boss"" player loses the ""boss"" title.\n\n There is one king / queen per continent, either as a player or an NPC.  All Kings / Queens will now have 4 elite characters.  Defeat King / Queen in battle to earn his / her crown and title.  Kings / Queens can choose an elite character from their list of friends or from AI characters created by King / Queen players.  When you become a King / Queen, you can get a special item ""Crown"" that raises your stats.  You can keep the crown equipped even if you are not a king / queen, but you cannot wear it visually unless you are a king / queen.  Elite characters are kings / queens, as long as the kings / queens who made them elite remain kings / queens.  Kings / Queens can enter any battle zone at any time, even if they are locked.  Kings / Queens can attack any character they like at any time, including other players.\n\n When you reach a boss / mini boss in a dungeon, temple, story progress, cave, castle, etc., the battle zone may be locked by another player who is fighting the boss / mini boss.  You can go up to something that looks important nearby.  Example: A small statue nearby.  At the push of a button, you will be given the option to fight the boss / mini boss alone or with other players on another server.  You will not be able to rematch with the boss / mini boss unless you re-enter the entrance.  You can enter the server with various parties.  Any part of the game can be completed solo or party.  A party can consist of all players and all AI characters created by the player for that player's party.  There are servers with lobbies for dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc., and players in those lobbies have to wait for the lobby to fill up so that they can enter dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc.  ..\n\n There are summons obtained by leveling up, summons obtained by achievements, and summons obtained by defeating enemies.  When you defeat the big bosses you face in the game, most of them will be earned as ""summons"".  You can only have a limited number of ""summons"".  The Summon option allows you to summon one ""summon"" to perform one of the most powerful attacks, or control the ""summon"" as an AI party member.  When summoned as a party member, you can switch between the control of the summon and the control of the created character.  Summons are only summoned for 4 minutes.  If you unsummon a Summon, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the Summon option again.  If you complete a very powerful attack summoned with the Summon option, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the summon again.\n\n There are mounts you can get.  Traveling with mounted beasts etc. makes traveling much easier.  You can get a ""mount"" for travel by tame them with items or defeat them in battle.  While moving with a mounted beast / ""summon"", it can take some damage before the player is knocked off or the mount gets confused.  At higher levels of speed racing, you can be attacked by racers.  Also, at higher levels of speed racing, others who are not racers can attack you.  If you tame the same species many times, it will be available as a pet or ""summon"" and can be summoned at any time.  Some mounts can move on / in any terrain, including water, walls, mountains, and even trees, so you can reach hidden areas, hidden treasures / enemies / ""summons"", and more.  Some species have the ability to fly.  There are also cars that you can drive for an easier trip.  ..\n\n You don't need a beast / summon to fly.  There are items you can get that give your party the ability to ""fly"".  With these items you can ""fly"" for 10 minutes.  There is a way to permanently acquire the ability to ""fly"".  In flight, it's the same as in the game Kingdom Hearts 2, unless you select the Ascend option.  Select the Ascend option to allow you to fly freely in all heights and directions.  There is one button you can hold to automatically fly towards a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  With the ""fly"" ability, you can reach floating or hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".\n\n There are competitive flight races and other races that you can participate in to win valuables.  Your character can gain the ability to transform your character's visual form into a variety of obtained visual forms.  One such visual form that your character can get is the form of a beast.  These visual forms are abilities.  You can unequip these abilities and select other options such as double summoning.  You can customize your character's race, color, appearance, and more at any time, except during combat.\n\n There is an ability called ""Unlimited Jump"" similar to ""Double Flight"" in the game ""Kingdom Hearts: Fragmented Passage"", but it is not limited to double.  Like the anime ""Bleach"", there is a function called ""Ground Lock"" that allows you to land in the air and run around as if there is an invisible ground in the air.  It turns off every time something / someone hits you.  With these two abilities, you can reach floating and hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".  There is another ability called ""teleport"".  Teleport to a random location next to a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  Every time you use this ability four times, you have to wait four minutes before you can use it again.\n\n All player characters can be leveled up to a maximum level of 370.  There are several level 400 optional ultimate bosses.  Some of these bosses always leave the player with a legendary object when the Ultimate Boss is defeated.  There are a wide variety of legendary objects, including crowns.  You can level lock your character whenever you want.  This will prevent your character from gaining experience until you turn level lock off.\n\n Tournaments vary.  Players defeat players, players defeat computers, teams defeat teams, teams defeat computers.  The status of players such as bosses, kings, and elites will be displayed next to their names if those characters are locked on by other characters.  As long as the other player is not an enemy, you are guaranteed to be able to see the other player's health bar.  There are items that can be used to warp to friends' locations, etc.  These items can be purchased or obtained.  When you warp to a friend's location, you will be teleported to the entrance to that friend's location or where the friend is.\n\n Equipment graveyards are places where all equipment lost / discarded by all players is scattered everywhere.  There are no enemies other than the player or multiple players who can attack you.  You can also approach a weapon or equipment and challenge it with the push of a button.  This allows you to fight the ghost copy of the player to whom the weapon or equipment / armor once belonged.  This includes the player's level / stats / abilities / skills / ""summons"" and more.  The ghost's weapon / equipment is in the same state as when the owner lost / discarded it.  When you defeat the ghost, you can acquire the weapon / equipment, and the weapon / equipment will be in the same state as when the ghost used it.  Only the player who challenges the weapon or equipment can get the weapon or equipment after defeating the weapon or equipment.\n\n All weapons / equipment have levels, stats, and optional qualities / effects.  All weapons / equipment can be leveled up and changed through the ""Inner World of Equipment"", as in the game ""Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"".  The color schemes of all enemies and all bosses are different there.  You can reset your weapon to level 1 if needed.  Doing this will reduce the statistics, but the appearance, quality / attributes, and ""effect"" will remain the same.\n\n You can always get things or buy things for their appearance.  With the exception of abilities, skills, ""summons"", crowns, and trophies, you can ""hold"", discard, exchange, or sell whatever you like.  You can give money to anyone you want.  You can get or unlock ""optional visual appearance"" stuff such as pointed ears, tails, various wings, wing colors, accessories, glasses / shades, jewelry, markings, tattoos and more.  All ""visual appearance"" combinations, except the character's visual form obtained from ""abilities"", can be achieved as soon as you start this video game.  Not all varieties are available for immediate sale, but any player can acquire, trade, or sell them.  Most of them are for sale from the beginning, and many are ridiculously expensive, but any player can give you free money or get you to get it.  You can't buy or get anything with real money.  Strictly speaking, it's just in-game money.\n\n There are different types of items, weapons, equipment, and cards with the same name.  These types include differences in ""look"" / appearance, statistics, abilities, effects, and attributes.  If a player uses the ""player skill"" ""steal"" / ""mug"" against another player, only weapons and equipment can be stolen.  You cannot use the ""player skill"" ""stealing"" / ""mug"" against other players who are not enemies.  Stealing attacks / techniques / skills can only be used during ""battle"".  When used against a player, the chances of ""stealing success"" vary between 5%, 10%, and 15%.  If you use it against non-players, your chances are much higher.\n\n You can collect cards and have the ability to turn enemies into cards like in the game ""Final Fantasy VIII"".  You can play card games with other players, exchange cards, get cards from enemies, treasures, prizes and more.  Cards can be converted into items.  Strong and rare cards can be turned into the best and rarest items.  You can challenge random players / NPCs to ""card games"" except during ""battle"".  There are card tournaments held in various places.  You can listen to or mute the microphone while playing cards.  You can also skip directly to playing a card game from the title menu, which has a server that you can enter just to play cards.  All cards and items are shared between characters in the actual game and in the title screen card game.  There are different card game rules in different places.  If no rules are set, players will either play with the agreed rules or the rules will be randomly selected.  The player who becomes the ""boss"" of a zone can choose the card rules for that zone.  Players who become ""King"" / ""Queen"" can choose the card rules of the card game that ""King"" / ""Queen"" plays.\n\n Author Jeffrey Robert Palin Jr."

l1mftr,A Black Friday game where you throw the items as weapons.,"The mechanic aspect of this would not only be the fact that you can throw items to damage other players, but the higher worth of an item, the more damage it does. The caveat of this is that the items break as soon as they are thrown at another player. This implements a good balance of choosing between damaging other players at the cost of your score or getting the highest score but being defenseless.\n\nWhile this could be for a Black Friday game, I could see this mechanic being adapted for other games as well."
l1md66,Another game idea I had where there is no way to change what happens,"So this is yet another game idea that I had in the past but I decided to think about it more to flesh it out a bit.\n\nThe main premise of the game would be that u are an Archeologist on the hunt for rare and unknown artifacts of the past, but unlike other Archeologist u decide to go into ancient places rather than dig up such artifacts.\n\nThis game would have u go into many places such as:\n\n\n* Ancient egypt; Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the desert during a sandstorm.\n* Japan; ancient temples, and Sacred forests\n* Africa; Exploring the wild jungle and caves\n* Ruins of castles in countries like Poland, Germany, Russia, etc.\n\nThere could also be DLC (or main game if not feeling like adding DLC) areas such as:\n\n* Mount Sinai in Egypt\n* Stonehenge\n* Easter Island\n* Atlantis\n\nEach area would have treasures that could be found along with some have ancient artifacts with mystical powers. After finding an artifact the player would leave the area and would be meeted by a shady business man in a white suit and body guards who's intentions are questionable. Then you would be met with a choice to either give the artifact or fight this man (this would happen everytime that u find an artifact and each fight would get progressively harder. Eventually in some of the later fights the business man would start using the mystical powers of his own artifacts to fight u)\n\nIf u manage to defeat the man, u would keep the artifact where u could do one of 2 things, sell the artifact for a hefty price so u have money for better equipment or keep the artifact in Hope's of uncovering how it works and using its powers to help u in battle. If u lose to the man however he will beat u unconscious and u would wake up in the same place u lost with the artifact taken (furthermore if in later fights he starts using artifacts he will start using the power of the artifacts that u have lost to him).\n\nIn each area where artifacts can be found there would always be a powerful boss protecting it that u need to defeat in order to get it: (this is a rough example bosses there could be for egypt)\n\n* Ancient egypt; Pyramid 1(A mummified wizard of the sun), Pyramid 2(A giant golden scarab), Sphinx(Cthulu), Sandstorm (A massive Cobra).\n\nThe story would revolve around you and that business man who claims to collect artifacts.\nEventually his intentions would be discovered if u managed to keep all of the artifacts and not sell any of them as that would awaken a powerful beast that he desperately tried to keep at bay but u managed to keep.\n\nThis game wouldn't have a canonical ending (unless u want to count defeating the final beast and collecting its artifact as an ending), there would also be a multiplayer game since this would be a free roaming world u could if u wanted to challenge your friends to see who gets more artifacts or simply battle them to see who's superior (or play with randoms).\n\nThe most unique mechanic would be that if u lost your artifact to the business man there would be not reloading to try again, the only way to get that artifact would be through reading with other players online or restarting the game completely (as unlike in WOW which this game idea might be compared to the boss and artifact would respawn, they are a one time thing per game)\n\nAs I said with my previous idea I am not a game designer I only have a creative mind, so if anyone wishes to use any of my ideas feel free to do so"
l1le65,Aetherian Lore,"This mind-bending story from the Aetherius Society is a gold mine for a game plot in my opinion. Sci-fi/fantasy crossover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Completion of The Alien Mission**  \n""A non-human alien intelligence, fabricated by entities outside of this Galaxy, was discovered in the lower astral realms of Earth. This alien ""android"" was programmed to take control over all life on the physical and subtle realms of Earth and had the power to do so! It was almost indestructible and had the capability of creating huge and deadly thought-forms. It had been dormant for millions of years but was shaken from its dormancy by the Primary Initiation of Earth in 1964. Because the position of Earth was considered to be strategic from a military point of view, the entities who made and programmed the android intended to make a base on Earth for future use as a striking point against the Solar System and other parts of this Galaxy.  \n\n\nThe battle took place in the lower astral realms, taking eight months and 24 sorties into the hells by the Adepts. For the first nine Phases, the Three Adepts battled alone but in later Phases, They were joined by Adepts Nixies Zero Zero Four and Nixies Zero Zero Five; certain Members of the Great White Brotherhood; and an ally in the lower astral realms, the ""Prince"" and his army.  \n\n\nAfter a horrendous conflict, the Forces of Light prevailed and the Five Adepts and Their helpers were able to evict the alien from its lair in the lower astral realms and send it out of the Solar System. The final battle in this Mission took place on January 22nd, 1966, three months after the alien was evicted."""

l1f3y0,A massive multiplayer 3d and or 2d undertale game,"small spoiler for undertale warning.  Ok so my idea is good in my opinion, this idea is a pvp undertale game, you start out with nothing but a few spins for a character or two, this game would be where you get to play as any undertale character in any au/alternate universe or the original game, as long as you win a character when you spend one of your spins for it. the game would probably have no microtransactions either. one concept of the game i have thought of was having to gain currency with the character you are lucky enough to unlock with your ""spin."" but the cool concept in my opinion is that once you unlock a character you have to upgrade every aspect of your character, from the dialogue to the personality to the attacks. did i ever say this game would have 2d multiplayer boss fights, in which one side plays a monster or a human and vice versa for the other side?   i never explained what a ""spin"" actually is though. it works as a spin the wheel but it's a wheel with every character from the au or game you are spinning for. it would be a really long-term project but it would be awesome. feel free to ask questions about the design of the game because i believe i haven't elaborated on the mechanics and gameplay, etc, enough."

I want to add great illustrations, find a emotive background story (challenging for an abstract game like this :), but fun), immersive art.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts:\n\n- Looks like a cool idea for hyper casual game?\n- Which art style do you think would be great?\n- Am I breaking any intellectual law for porting one mechanic of a commercial game to another?\n- Is there something similar already?"
l17flt,"You are Giant Sentient Candy whose only purpose is to be eaten. You can frolick around getting eaten bit by bit while getting smaller, lighter, and able to go more places.","So basically it's a reverse Katamari game, trying to get as small as possible. The starting size and shape is probably about the same as a large dog.\n\nA 3D game. You're in a foresty area. Some larger animals will come up to lick you, and that will shrink you by a little bit, but any creature in the game will eventually be satiated and lose interest, even ants (you need to find MORE ants.)\n\nMostly, though, you'll need to break off parts of yourself in sensible quantities for smaller creatures to chew on, by crashing against rocks and the ground. Human campers are sometimes around to eat your forest-floor-leftovers too, but they will run away if they see you.\n\nAll in all, the game is kind of an environmental puzzle. There are things you can only do while big, like reach certain heights. There are things you can only do small, like fit through holes.\n\nDifferent stages offer different actions to figure out.\n\nFalling from higher heights breaks off more bits of you, which is good if you find a spot where it can be consumed by lots of beasts, but if no animals are there, it goes to waste and lowers your final score. Falling from a VERY high height will crack you asunder, and the game will be over, likely leaving you with a low score. The score is mostly calculated from the percentage of your body that was eventually chomped. But there are additional bonuses, for example, map completion and managing to distribute yourself among more and more creatures. Don't just get chomped by a couple of large ant colonies. Spare a chunk of your sweet butt for the deer and raccoons and little girls. Record time will also be recorded, but wouldn't count against you. Maybe a time bonus.\n\nAh, if you accidentally break off chunks in the wrong section of the map with no animals around, you have a mouth that can pick up candy so you can drop it elsewhere. But you have to be careful because when you drop chunks for the third time, the mouth crumbles away, too. (In other words, you can use this skill three times, and the third time includes the mouth chunks too, so plan carefully!)\n\nNow, the reason you can move around is that your whole body is hard candy, except the four joints where your limbs meet the torso. Those are made of gummy! An important note about the gummy joints is that even though ants are your number one reliable consumer, if you stand around ants for too long, they'll crawl all over you and eat your gummy parts. If this happens for a while, eventually you'll fall apart where you stand. Then they WON'T eat big sections of the candy because they can't carry it back. Your score for the round will be low when large body parts are left over. So break off bits of yourself in their vicinity, but respect the distance!\n\nWater is also slowly dangerous. If you can dissolve yourself a little in a puddle safely, a creature might drink it. That's a valid strategy. But if it's deep or flowing water, say goodbye to the sugar. The good news is you at least float and can swim to shore.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the candy character shrinks EVENLY as it breaks apart and melts. It doesn't get one long leg and one short leg or whatever. I guess that could be fun in a challenging way, but probably aggravating to play and plan.\n\nWhen small enough, the game will alert you that you've reached Itty-Bitty Status! Now that you're really small at the end, skittering around like a twig-legged gobstopper, I want there to be Stylish Finishes. At this point anything can eat you as long as they aren't already full, but don't just get dragged off by a bug. Fall INTO the anthill from above, nothin-but-net style! Stylish Finish! Ride a leaf on the river to a secret scavenger's den! Uncover the super-elusive dung beetle in advance while you are still large, then track him down again later to get rolled off! Or dissolve away inside a little water-filled tulip to be drunk by a swarm of hummingbirds! Or roll onto the hand of a napping hiker at the base of a hill who eats you in his sleep while dreaming aloud, ""Oh, my sweet Marcy, baby! I found your wedding ring at last! Here in the grass, glistening like the day I put it on your finger! Please don't be angry anymore! Please don't throw it away again in tears! All this time I've been wandering the wilderness to get my mind off your fading love that became my own broken heart. What did I do? What did you ever need? Take me back, my love. I'll do anything! Wear my ring again, I beg you. And I seal it with a kiss... How sweet it is! The sweetness of your hand still lingers on this ring after all this time, all these years! ..."" Lick, crunch munchy-munch. "" Zzz, mmpphrrr, Marcy... Don't go...""\n\nYou get more points for this!\n\nThe name of the game is, well, ""You are Giant Sentient Candy"".\n\nI have no idea why I thought of all this, but now you've read it. So there."
l148ly,A good one for pc gamers,"What if someone makes a game were you create your very own PC setup using real life licensed products from companies like (hyperx,razer...etc) were you first add a background that is the room and then start customizing your desk with a large selection of cases, desks, keyboards, monitors... .In addition to community made setups found within a system in game or even something similar to steam's workshop to allow people to get as creative as possible"
l12dw0,Horror game(missing dad),"Monologue/story: it's raining and getting dark. The main character(boy) is looking through the window waiting for his dad to come home from the office. He's sad. And alone. So the boy goes to dad's office to find him. \nThis is a short game idea, you add rest."
l0yegl,Apocalyptic Randomizer,"""I knew it. The signs were all there. Maybe it was the dream that pushed me, but I knew it. The destruction of the world nears.""\n\nThis is an idea that I've been playing with for many years. I can't find quite the right game or have time to create a mod or obviously have the resources to develop it myself. Maybe you work at a AAA or something I don't know. If I put this out in the world maybe someone will pick up this game so maybe I can play it and the fun will never end.\n\nThe idea developed a bit from the best part of Fallout 4 for me, the settlement building. I would purposely set out to find the settlements so I could style a new place with a new theme and be able defend it as I see fit. Although clunky at times and an inability to test my defenses, just something about breaking down a car and some trees in the area to remake into a post-apocalyptic dream home was something so fun.\n\nTo the nitty-gritty. There wouldn't be an overarching story per se. This is something that the player would create (much like Rimworld). I will share more of this idea as it comes up. It would be much like a Civilization or Crusader Kings type grand strategy with the idea to ""conquer"" but not necessarily in the same way. It would be city-building much like Fallout 4 or Surviving the Aftermath that could be done in 1st person or 3rd person much like Metal Gear Survive.\n\nThe map would be a randomized open world (like what Civilization could do two-dimensionally) complete with a multiple climates including Tundra, Jungle, Forest, Plains, Desert, Islands, Urban, Suburban, etc. Although it could be possible with the way they do open world games with procedural environments (like a No Man's Sky), it might be difficult to be randomized because of how good I'd want the graphics to be (like Last of Us or AC Valhalla). Although The Forest got close, it's roughly the same idea in certain instances. The randomization of the world and scenario would be important because this would greatly raise the replayability because of what other similar games lack.\n\nMost of the game would be 1st person especially when fighting and exploring except when determining certain structures (optional) or what area you choose to take over next as you will read in a bit. \n\nThe major difference in this game is the **Prepping and the random type of Apocalypse.** \n\nThe Beginning\n\nYou can choose where you start, the type of person you are, amount of money/resources, and even the type of apocalypse or you just randomize it all. So maybe you're neurosurgeon relaxing in your weekend cabin getaway when everything goes down. Maybe you're with your wife and kids in an apartment. But when it happens, it happens. There'd be a predetermined amount of time to ""prep"" getting together all the different types of things you may need. This could help or hurt depending upon the Apocalypse. Perhaps you decide to start on a island and the oceans overflow. You wake up on a boat with only a few of the things you prepared with. Maybe you're perfectly set up in your weekend cabin and not in one of the many resource-rich, urban cities when the Zombies attack. That's much of the fun!\n\nThe Middle\n\nThe Apocalypse happens. Depending upon which one determines how you survive, thrive, and reclaim the world for the rebuilding of mankind.\n\nThe different world enders and some of which make them unique:\n\n1. Alien Invasion - (Difficult Enemies, Easy to Recruit \[make sure they aren't copies though\], Quicker Access to High Technology)\n2. Ocean Rise - (Easier to reclaim world \[smaller area\], Harder to get material \[flooded areas\]\n3. Financial Collapse - (harder to recruit lower class if starting in medium or upper class, Difficult Mercenaries for the rich enemies)\n4. Zombie - (Easy to recruit \[as long as they haven't been bitten\], Difficult enemies that evolve over time)\n5. Solar Flare - (Most old electronics unusable, slower settlement build)\n6. A.I. Takeover (aka Skynet) - (Easy to recruit \[make sure they aren't cyborgs\], Difficult enemies that learn over time, Easy access to high technology)\n7. Nuclear War - (harder to navigate areas because of radiation, Difficult Foreign Enemies and Marauders too)\n8. Plague - (Hard to recruit \[mistrust\] and lack of people, settlement building difficult because of possible outbreaks, difficult marauders)\n9. Asteroid Impact or Super Volcano (basically a long Winter Event) - (Hard to navigate except in certain climates because of the cold, settlement building difficult, lack of food resources\n\nOnce the event happens, that's when the real game gets going. You are now THE leader, sucks to be you. The goal is to establish settlements/defendable structures in a zoned area. Much like Civilization you can't build too close to another. So there's basically a grid to work with and they vary in size depending on the type of climate zone. Only one settlement determines a vast open area outside of it. If it's a pretty big area like plains or something, a zone wouldn't go any bigger than a certain size. So there might be several zones in the plains. How well you prepared beforehand can really come in handy. Like practicing how to work with electronics in order to send out a call to others who might come to your settlement. \n\nThe idea is to build a settlement that can meet the needs of everyone and be defensible. You deconstruct items or find raw material to be built into new structures. You recruit people (this would be finite and limited depending on the world-ender) and assign them tasks depending on their skills. This is similar in concept to Survivalist: Invisible Strain. A high building skill raises up your defenses and structures faster. Some of them could seek out and find resources, other people, or conquer areas. A high recon skill or fighter skill raises the chance better resources are found or a new settlement could be taken over or founded (much like a Civilization). **That's one of the main goals of the game.** To reclaim the world from other societies either by alliances or conquering. An area cannot be claimed until a settlement reaches a certain point. So if you nuke a neighbor, it'll take that much longer to clean up the fallout and build a new settlement. It's also harder to defend a settlement that's growing.\n\nThere are benefits to building settlements quickly as trade can help more settlements build quickly and also word can be sent faster to get more soldiers if another settlement or area is being attacked or if an larger force is needed for a new area to conquer. You can also provoke an enemy to attack thus weakening their defenses for a later attack. Remember all fighting is done 1st person or I'm willing to make it more like the battles in Total War.\n\nThe End\n\nMost scenarios end the same way. Either the entire world is claimed or time runs out and you get a score based on total settlement size, human population, etc. Some scenarios might have multiple end game. For instance, building a missile that could take out the Alien Mothership instead of just wiping them off the Earth.\n\nThen you do it all again!\n\nI know I would love something like this. To be immersed in world that may seem bleak is all the more fun when you work to rebuild, whether that be in a good way or a bad way. The choices are yours! So someone please! If you can do this. Make it happen!"
l0xw42,"I More ""Empire"" GTA Game","I wish there was a game like GTA, but where the real fun comes from building an empire than furious grinding, it's about literally taking over the city. It offers a lot of ways to commit crimes.\n\nFor example, the ""generic player"" may start out homeless, get a job, and run drugs on the side. Overtime, he either decides to move up the Drug Organization ladder and have a squad, and eventually runs the organization as a right-hand man. Or, you could quit and form a new organization. Start from solo-running and then withing a few dozen hours, you're a drug lord.\n\nAnother option would be governmental. You become a politician, win elections, and then sell out to corporations.\n\nThere would be plenty of other ways you could play. You could be a malware coder, hitman, jewlery thief, bank robber, identity thief, or other. Ypu could embezzle money from a company and commit corporate crimes. Commit fraud on the board of a company ot as an executive of a company.\n\nFurthermore, the game would also give you the ability to run a legit life. You could get a job or start a company. Or you could be an investor. The game would have a realistic Stock Market, housing market, etc.\n\nPretty much, a money sim that portrayed as a GTA-like crime game. The reason for the Crime is most people need to be hooked in, but the investing mechanics and alternative forms of gameplay would keep you hooked. I get bored of GTA (especially online) as it's all grind and no content."
l0xt8k,A Horror game where you are being chased by farmers in a small rural village,"\n\nI have had this idea for quite a while now and I only really think about it while I am walking my dog.\n\nMy game idea is a Single player / Multiplayer game based in a small rural village. There will be A runner and 2 or 3 farmers (the chasers) I have not thought of the main objective but the goal will be to access something inside one of the 3 farms. \n\nAs the runner you will have to collect weapons, food and other general supplies. You will have to hide and most importantly, run from the farmers. You would be fast and weak.\n\nAs the farmer you will have to find the Runner, you will be big and strong but slow, there is a chance of having a quad bike, you must track down the runner and catch or kill them, you could set traps or distractions. The 3 Farmers could either work together to catch the runner, or they could work alone.\n\nThe runner would have to remain quiet and would have to leave clue to where they are, they can hide in houses, sheds, inside a school or in the woods. Their resources would be limited, limited ammo, limited food and water, limited storage, you get the point. Looting houses or shops would be almost essential so you could not spend the whole game hiding. The runner would have to be careful. Footsteps can be heard. Tracks can be followed, and any lights you leave on or doors you leave open can and will give away your position.\n\nThe Farmer(s) would be able to have an update every few minutes of the rough area the runner is in. On the odd chance the Farmer will have a quad bike the runner will be aware of this by the noise and the headlights that would beam in the sky.\n\nIf you were to play this by your self you could be a runner with AI farmers, or the other way round.\nI think the multiplayer is pretty self explanatory, Real people will play the Runner and the Farmers. Proximity chat is optional.\n\nIf you are wondering about the type of landscape I am thinking of you can look at ‘Spittal in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire’ on google earth\n\nThis is my first time so please be harsh, I need constructive criticism\n\nPlease give your view on this idea in the comments👍👍"
l0xcu9,Kaiju Battle Royale,"All players start out as tiny monsters. The more you eat, the more nutrients you have. Once you have enough nutrients, you can evolve into a bigger monster. You are vulnerable to attacks while evolving, but heal greatly once the evolution is complete.\n\nWhat kind of monster you turn into depends on what you ate. If you ate mostly birds, you’ll turn into a bird monster. If you ate lots of lizards and charcoal, you’ll turn into a dragon monster. You can eat anything, from wild animals to other players to fruit to wood to steel. \n\nYou can evolve multiple times, growing larger each time. There is an evolution tree that determine what you can evolve into. For instance, once you’ve turned into a bird monster, you’ll only be able to evolve into different variants of the bird monster. By the end of the game, you should be left be left with all the biggest and strongest players around. Any smaller players that are still around may be able to help take down a bigger player and then feed on them to gain a bunch of nutrients really quickly."
lrqnbt,Limited ammunition question,"I've started making a Ninja Platformer where the player can jump off walls to scale the level. The main attack is by throwing a shuriken. I also want players to use the shurikens to hit triggers that for example enable a platform for x amount of seconds. Because they will be a core tool in completing levels should this mean I should have unlimited ammo? I am kinda against this because it means the player could just easily outrange most enemies, but at the same time if the player runs  out of shurikens he couldn't complete a level. Any ideas on how to balance it?"

lrj2rq,Damage Control: Real-time FTL style combat with a focus on repair management and survival,"First Person Format/FTL style combat\n\nYou are the captain of the damage control team aboard a small battlecruiser amidst an interstellar war. There are 10 souls aboard this vessel. Your job is to keep the systems running, keep the ship flying, even if you're the only one left.\n\nGameplay is split into two states:\n\nBattle Stations:\n-Ship has engaged enemy. Damage control team monitors damage received with the Damage radar and repairs. \n-Battles are timer based. A battle will take an amount of time (5min for example). As damage is taken, the time is extended. Causing critical damage to enemies or repairing damaged systems causes time to decrease. The aim is to make battles as short as possible to limit the amount of damage your ship takes.\n-Player Ship will destroy the enemy ship if it can survive until the timer reaches 0:00. \n-If the ship reaches 0% health, it explodes. Game over.\n-After battle, ship commander will approach you to ask whether they should land on a station or planet for repairs\n\nRepair and Resupply:\n-Ship lands on planet or station. Damage control team scouts to look for supplies or missing replacement parts. Repairs to Catastrophic Damage can be done.\n-Planet: Catastrophic Hull Breach can be repaired. Replacement Parts can be crafted with refined minerals. Catastrophic System Damage cannot be repaired. Salvage can be gathered to barter in stations\n-Station: Catastrophic System Damage can be repaired. Replacement Parts can be bought. Salvage can be sold and traded\n-After Repair and resupply, next jump into battle can be taken.\n\nKey Systems:\n-Navigation\n-Engine Control\n-Weapons\n-Defense\n-Life Support\n-Damage Radar\n\nDamage Control Team:\nPlayer starts as team captain. There are four additional team members. AI controlled. They'll constantly repair damage inside the ship the ship even without player control, but will not willingly space walk without command. Player can also delegate repairs via the Damage Radar system. Potential here for the damage control team to be real players via online multiplayer.\n\nThree types of damage: Hull Breach, System Damage, and Part Replacement. If damage goes unserviced, Catastrophic damage will result\n\nHull Breach Damage: \n -Supply Line Rupture: a fuel line, o2 line, or general pipe or cable has ruptured due to enemy fire. Space walk to patch hull\n -Vacuum Creep: a hole in the hull is causing air to leak from the ship. Bulkheads have sealed to protect the crew. Space walk to patch hull from outside. Once done, bulkhead will release and breach must be patched from inside as well. \n\nSystem Damage:\n -A ship system is damaged and must be repaired to resume function\n\nPart Replacement:\n -A key part of a ship system requires periodic replacement before failure. Replace with a spare from the ship inventory.\n\nCatastrophic Damage:\n\n -Catastrophic Hull Breach: A hull breach was not repaired before being damaged again and a large rupture has formed. Area is locked off by bulkhead seals. Must be repaired on a planet.\n -Catastrophic System Damage: A system was not repaired before being damaged again and it is permanently damaged. Must be repaired at a station. \n -Catastrophic System Event: A part was not replaced and failed. Possible events: Reactor Meltdown, Hostile Life Support, Navigation Blackout. All systems are shut down until Events are resolved.\n\nCrew Members: \nThe ships has a crew member responsible for each system as well as a ship commander. When in Battle Stations, the crew has a chance to die if a system is taking damage. If a crew member dies, a member of the Damage Control team takes their place. As the game progresses, the damage control team gets smaller and smaller until it is only the player. If the ship commander dies, a crew member takes their place. If there are no available crew members, the player becomes the ship commander and gameplay switches gears\n\nShip Commander: \nAs the Ship Commander, the player must control the ship systems.\n\nNavigation:\n-aggressive tack: more regular attack damage on enemy less chance for critical attack damage. More damage to player's ship\n-defensive tack: less regular attack damage on enemy. Greater chance for critical attack damage. Less damage to player's ship\n\nEngine Control:\n-Run Hot: faster ship, harder for enemy to hit. Less damage to player's ship. Causes part wear leading to Part Replacement damage\n-Run Cold: Slower ship, easier to hit. More damage to player's ship. Better chance for critical attack damage\n\nWeapons:\n-Manual Reloading: requires travel to weapon systems room to load weapons. Guaranteed Critical attack damage.\n\nDefense:\n-Shield Overload: requires travel to defense systems room. Ship is completely invulnerable to enemy attacks during current Battle Stations state. Catastrophic System Damage to Defense and Engine Control\n\nAs Ship Commander, player is still responsible for damage control."

lrepwx,Maneater,"A real-time stealth tactics game where you play as a tiger with a taste for human flesh.\n\nThe opening cinematic scene would be some human hunters killing your mate. You then seek revenge by killing and eating humans.\n\nLevels would be quite large, something on the scale of Shadow Tactics' larger levels. They would include both village and overgrown vegetation terrains with lots areas to move through and hide. There would be non-hunter human villagers that you need to capture as well as hunters who will shoot you if they find you. As you proceed through levels, your notoriety increases which draws more hunters and more experienced hunters.\n\nIf a non-hunter sees you, they will run and get a hunter who will investigate. You leave tracks as you walk that eventually disappear. If a hunter sees the tracks, they will follow them. Some terrains don't leave tracks and if you move onto that terrain, the hunter will lose the trail. You can kill hunters but they are much harder to kill and you risk being shot before you can attack.\n\nThe goal of each level would be to kill any non-hunter villager and drag their corpse to the stage exit. Dragging slows you down and leaves a large trail that will take longer to disappear. You can drop a corpse to get away if needed, but if other humans find the dropped corpse they will remove it for burial and you will have to find and kill a new target.\n\nI think this game would be a lot of fun to play but I think it would be difficult to be balanced. It seems like it would be either really easy to kill and take away a villager or impossibly difficult."
lrep5r,Simulation L.I.F.E.,"The definitive life simulation: you're literally the brain of a living being, taking decisions for him. You decide whether you need to eat right now or search for water, if you need to fight, flight or freeze.

The branching neural processes need to be programmed, with a simplified and diegetic coding system. For example: 'when you follow many times a specific sequence of actions it's memorized and becomes a function, mirroring the reinforcement of the neurons' I already have ideas about how to manage and utilize the functions, and how inputs and outputs would be met.\n\nFirst level may be guiding an animal, then a human, a futuristic AI and so on."
lrd8vv,Suicide King: a gwent-like trading card game that uses normal playing cards that is easy to understand and get into,"so i just came up a game like this when i woke up. it's a two-player trading card that without the trading part: it uses the good' ol 54-piece playing cards, aces to kings four suits, and two jokers. i call this game **""Suicide King""** because i like the nickname for King of Hearts.\n\ni always feeling the entry barrier of tcg tend to be very steep, you have to learn all the weird mechanics, collecting different cards, often cost you real money in order to play decently. so in this game, no grinding is needed, the mechanic is so easy to learn that even I, someone who barely played any card games can explain to you in a single reddit post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe objective of Suicide King is this:\n\n* to win more rounds than your opponent (like gwent)\n* one game is divided in 3 rounds, whoever wins 2 rounds, wins the game (like gwent)\n* whoever have higher points after the round ends, wins the round (again, like gwent)\n* your point is the sum of all number cards on your part of the field \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe playing field looks like this:[https://imgur.com/a/zzQMF4H](https://imgur.com/a/zzQMF4H)\n\n* there are two rows that you can place your number cards on (remember gwent?)\n   * on the right is the deck, there is a number showing how many cards left (start from 26)\n   * on the left, you can place special cards for special effects (more  on that later)\n   * each row houses 5 cards, plus a special card, a total of 11 cards can be played for each player\n* a big yield button because sometimes you just dont feel like it\n* an end round button to end your round\n* click the deck to draw a card\n* a point counter between your rows (i forgot to add)\n* maybe a history window of some kind idk\n* a win-lose marker like gwent would be helpful\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is what the cards do:\n\n* number cards:A - 10\n   * you can place them on both of your rows (except A), the sum of their numbers are your points, front and rear doesnt affect the point. \n      * (eg, you have a 5 in the front, a 3 in the rear, you have 8 points)\n* special cards: A, J, Q, K, Jokers. They stay on the special card slot to the end of the round, until the player replaces them.\n   * Aces are both number and special cards. can also be played on your opponent's row.\n      * you can play an Ace on the row, by doing so you can choose its point. it could be 10 or 1 (as in blackjack). choose 10, the card shows 10A, it's a 10-value card. choose 1, turn into 1A, has value of 1, and making neighbouring cards suit the same as the Ace's.\n      * or place it in the special field, double the value of the cards of the same suit. (ie. double the points of all spade cards if you play an Ace of spade. turning a 10 of spades into 20 of spades)\n   * Jacks are warriors, they can either defend your field or occupy the enemy special card slot. they work differently depending on the colour.\n      * when playing on your special card slot, a J can protect cars from Attacks. (as in hearthstone)\n      * you can also play it on your opponent's special card slot to occupy it, they have to attack it to remove the card from the slot, so they can use it later. if the slot is occupied, remove the card and occupy the slot.\n      * a Red jack can take 2 attacks from a black card, but 1 attack from a red card.\n   * Queens are magicians, they have special actions depending on their suits.\n      * these actions are available right after playing the card, and later each move.\n      * Diamonds: select a suit, add the number of cards of the suit in your field as value to your point. (including Queen of Diamonds itself and the Jack in the opponent's special card slot)\n      * Clubs: swap cards depending on the target. if targeting a card on the field, you can swap a card on your field and your opponent's. vice versa. or when targeting a card in your hand, swap it to a random card from your opponent's hand. (cannot targeting special card slot)\n      * Hearts: shuffle cards in on of the hands or rows. the total of cards stay the same, but the cards could be different.\n      * Spades automatically draws a card whenever you played a card on the field. if there is no cards left in your deck, sacrifice a random card on the field and conjuring a new card in your hand (passive)\n   * Kings are schemers, their effects are only activated when a round is ending.\n      * Kings are invisible in the slot, your opponent wont know you played it. but can be revealed by Jacks and King of Hearts.\n      * you can play a king within the same move. (ie before and after playing another card)\n      * diamonds: all cards on 4 rows are annihilating each other, the difference is randomly send to each player. ie, if your opponent has 7 cards on the field, you have 2, all cards get in to a fight, and 5 cards left, randomly distributed among players. if it's an odd number, you have one more cards than your opponent, in this case, you get 3 cards, your opponent gets 2)\n      * clubs: (i dont have an idea yet)\n      * hearts: remove cards from the field place them into your hand, also makes you lose the round. (suicide king, winning by losing)\n      * spades: all number cards that got destroyed in the round are played accordingly in the field in the next round. (including aces)\n      * if both players has a King in the slot, whoever plays the King first activate before another one.\n   * Jokers are ultimate chaos maker. unlike irl playing card, in Suicide King, Jokers come in two colours: red and black.\n      * when red Joker is played, randomise all cards on the field and conceal their numbers and suits. only colour is visible (reveals kings). you can also see the colour of cards in your opponent's hand. attacking your opponent's card with your red car, your card have 50% survive the attack. at the end of the round, reveal all numbers and suits.\n      * when black Joker is played, ditto with red Joker. but instead of making red card stronger, when you attack a black card, there is a 50% chance that rob the black card to your field (which ever is available, if none, to your hand) with half the value. 2 will turn into A1, odd number will be (+1)/2, aka a 9 becomes 5.\n      * if A, J, Q, K are revealed on the rows, they are treated as 10, 11, 12 and 13. \n      * Jokers cannot be replaced or attacked, not even Jacks.\n\ngame mechanics:\n\n* game: a game is played in 3 rounds, whoever wins 2, wins the game.\n   * if a player have no cards on their field, their hand or the deck, they automatically loses the game.\n* round: a round is ended when both players ends their round, the points will be tallied and determined the winner of the round.\n* resolving a draw: if both plays' point is equal, whoever has more cards on the field wins the round.\n   * if both has an equal number amount of cards, the winner is determined by the order of the special card on their slot. Joker&gt;Ace&gt;K&gt;Q&gt;J\n      * if no special card is present, a winner is determined by the biggest number and suit combination of their cards in the row. ie 10 of spades vs 9 of hearts, 10 wins.\n* point: the sum of all number cards' value in your rows. with other modifiers.\n* value: the number on a number card. it can be modified by other cards, making a card that doesnt exist in real life. aka a 20 of spades. A is can be 1 or 10, as in blackjack.\n* ending the round: the player can click the button to end their round. the player needs to perform at least one action to end their round.\n* move: within a round, players will perform an action one after another, normally only one action per move.\n* action: playing a card on the field, attacking a card, draw a card from the deck, or spells from the Queen card\n* field: 4 rows of number cards and 2 special card slots\n* rows: 2 rows of slots, divided into front and rear. number cards can be played on the rows, each row houses 5 cards. whenever there is a card in the front row, all cards in the rear row is Protected.\n* special card slot: A, J, Q, K, Jokers can be played on the slot. the card stays in the slot until the end of the round, or replaced by player. special card cannot be attacked, only Jacks and King of Hearts can remove them.\n* deck: a standard playing card deck with 52 cards and 2 jokers. at the beginning of the game, all cards are shuffled and divided into 2 decks of 26 cards for each player.\n* draw(action): the action of retrieving a card from your deck to your hand.\n* hand: cards that available to play on the field for each players, at the beginning of the game 7 cards are drawn for each players.\n* graveyard: the concept of spent cards doesnt not exist in this game.\n* attack: the player can use a number card to attack an Unprotected number card on the opponent's rows. the process destroys BOTH cards (with exceptions) (just like hearthstone, but no health or attack value)\n* protect: a concept taken from hearthstone. cards in rear row is protected by ones in front row, whereas all cards is in turn protected by a Jack. the attacker cannot attack a protected card without destroying the card which protecting it.\n* destroyed cards: the result of number cards' mutual destruction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat's all i have in mind, all numbers are very not final."
lr9okm,I am a mobile game developer and I'd love to hear your simple ideas for a casual/recreational game you'd love to play.,[deleted]
lr7zci,Ticking bomb mechanics,[https://imgur.com/a/iMijCpb](https://imgur.com/a/iMijCpb)  \n A game where you have to plant bombs and time them correctly in order to push a box through the obstacles and put it on the objective to pass the level.
lr7u5t,Stories from the past,"Hey,\n\nhad this idea for some time now.   \nEveryone knows, that the older generation is slowly dying, which means, all their stories die with them. so why not make a story driven game, where you can play through them, thus not only preserving the stories but also making them fun for the new generation so experience and learn from them (maybe).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you could make a good fundation, it could be very easy to add new stories to it that you could download with one click via a launcher or ingame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust thought this might be nice, since like i said, the older generation isnt around that much longer and it would be nice to atleast preserve the stories they could tell"

lr2ldv,Game idea,I've been thinking about a survival game that is about the earth just freezing everything is frozen like the movie the day after tomorrow and I need suggestions on what the story will be about and how the game starts
lr23u4,New competitive MOBA,"So MOBAs are great and offer a lot of strategy. LoL is unappealing to many new gamers because of the top-down view that it doesn’t share with many top games. SMITE does better with this with the third person over the shoulder view. But the problem with both of these games is that they are simply too hard to watch/get into playing. \n\nMy suggestion would be a MOBA with minimal graphics resembling Fortnite/Valorant with the 3rd person view of smite. Couple this with dumbing down the buying systems to have much less clutter with items and reduce the amount of stats each player needs to keep track of. \n\nIn my view this would result in a game that is easy to understand and start playing, as well as being easy to watch and follow esports. Thoughts?\n\nEdit 1: Would like to add that having fewer characters in the game would help too. Like limiting it to maybe 25 and maybe it could expand to 50"
lr0wts,A battle royale food fight where players throw food at one another to win,This will take place in a pretty big school where the players can explore and find foods to use and defeat other players. The school would either have to be really big or just have fewer players in it per game. Different foods will have different projectiles. For instance a bag of chips would have projectiles like shurikens or burgers would have a slower but harder hitting projectile. Students can also had different attributes to their foods like hot sauce/spicy to make their projectiles have a burning effect. \n\nInstead of a circle that gets smaller it would be teachers and faculty (cpu) who will catch students and give them detention(tbd). I liked how warzone gave players a second chance of life with the gulag so in food fight students can do a mini game to slip out of detention to try again (tbd). If the player is eliminated again they will be expelled. \n\nLet me know what you think. It’s my first time really voicing any of my ideas.
lqu136,"A game where the player can’t walk, but can control physics and use momentum to get around.","So here’s how this would work. The player’s legs are either paralyzed or broken (TBD) and he/she are in a wheelchair. But the thing is, every (TBD), an explosive is dropped on them from the sky. The player could be able to control the bounciness and friction of everything in the world using the right and left joysticks (this could be a console game), which means they could slide and bounce around the map to evade explosions and other things. In their wheelchair."
lqtcx8,Five Nights at Freddy's Fangame plot.,"This fangame takes place before even Fredbear's Family Dinner. The player stumbles into a strange funhouse - They have a hazy memory how they got there, not being an employee there. It's unexplainably vast and everything is made of sickeningly bright plastic. Each section resembles different outside areas; A garden, a farm, a camp-sight and scrapyard. The individual sections have its own humanoid animatronic, that matches the stereotypical theme. Like the farm, of course, having a farmer animatronic.\n\nFor gameplay, the players enter a new section each night. It's not like the main series where the player waits in one location and utilise their resources to seal off multiple enemies. Instead in this fan game, the player needs to sneak around the single resident animatronic and escape. They need to observe the animatronic's routine and finds creative ways to sneak around without detection.\n\nThere is a suspicion meter that goes up the longer the player is in the animatronic's line of sight. Unlike other stealth games, where enemies' AI is comedically unrealistic, forgetting they spotted the player within seconds - The suspicion meter will never go down. The animatronic will remember where they saw the player and search these areas more frequently into the night.\n\nThroughout the game, two mysterious robots stalk the player from a distance, though never tries attacks them. Until the fifth night. The player stumbles into a new section with a countryside cottage filled with robotic parts. At the end of the night, the player is ambushed by the two mysterious robots, pushing a device into the player's head.\n\nThere, the player's vision suddenly changes and the plot twist is revealed. The player is an animatronic; programmed to falsely believe everything else is artificial. The two mysterious figures are William and Henry as young adults and this cottage is their home.\n\nThe player is Henry's grandmother, who he escaped his troubled household with. The best they could afford was a small cottage since the grandmother was retired and Henry was in college. In college, he met William, joining them as a roommate. The boys were so distracted tinkering with robotics for their future business, they failed to realise the house was unsafe for an elderly person. Until one day, the grandmother snagged her foot on a beta springlock laying on the floor -\n\n[She collapsed on top of Proxy, the promo-type of Henry's animatronic designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalFNaF/comments/bvv0jv/new_animatronicin_the_game_files_toy_proxy/)\n\n('Based on 'Proxy the boll', a test model in Fnaf VR)\n\nThe grandmother's spirit possessed Proxy, which was how Henry and William discovered animatronics could be possessed. Fearing the potential consequences, the boys trapped Proxy in the cottage. Though she grew dangerously agitated, so Henry changed her programming, tricking her into thinking she was alive. However, it worked too well, making Proxy think she was the only living thing, breaking out of the cottage in fear. In reality, the gameplay was Proxy running through random locations, trying to avoid humans, including Henry and William in pursuit of her.\n\nThe sixth and seventh nights serves as an epilogue: In the canon pizzeria simulator, when William/Springtrap burnt with the last of his victims, it's assumed the last souls have been put to rest. However this fangame would show, that's one side of the story. There's still the tragic deaths that can be tied back to Henry's springlocks.\n\nSo when Henry going through his Fredbear antiques in his attic, after destroying Sprintrap - He wonders what he should do with it, since they're the last surviving relics. Unknown to Henry, three spirits still linger on the scattered pieces of animatronics. Sensing Henry remorseful for the first time in decades, the threes spirits manifest. First Proxy, but then Shadow Bonnie and Freddy, two employees who were crushed in the suits.\n\nSince the springlocks victims are adults, they're more calm compared to William's murder victims. The springlock ghosts are even capable of limited communication. Since Henry didn't directly murder them, they don't want to kill him to gain their peace. Instead, they demand that Henry burns his life-long creations, so they can never hurt anyone again.\n\nFor the gameplay of the sixth and seventh night, the player is now Henry. The difficulty is higher, due to the player adapting to having two enemies for the first time. On the seventh night, Shadow bonnies joins them as a third enemy. The player must sneak around a small woodland mansion and collect the Fredbear relics. While this is Henry's home, he has sneak around it, since the three spirits are making it as difficult as possible. While they won't kill him, they'll have their fun tormenting him. When a spirit jumpscares the player, they'll drag Henry back to the starting point.\n\nIn the final moment the seventh night, the player must set the pile of relics alight. The three spirits float up like embers, finding their peace."
lqsmuy,My Own Battle Royale Game,"I like battle royale games like Apex Legends and Spellbreak and decided to make my own battle royale game. The problem was that I couldn't think of one until I thought of my other favorite game genre. I call it ""RPG Royale"". Everybody can hold 3 primary items and 1 off-hand item at the same time (be aware that items can break!) This game has five different classes:\n\nKnight- Knights are good at both Damage and Defense. They use swords and shields.\n\nMage- Mages are ranged fighters. They use wands and books (Books give you damaging, protective, or supportive spells.)\n\nCleric- Clerics are useful on teams because they are healers. They use staffs to do some damage and healing items to do better healing.\n\nPirate- Pirates are all about damage. They use blades and damaging items (Guns, Bombs, Traps, etc.)\n\nHunter- Hunters are people who are sneaky but also give effects. They use bows and defensive items (Traps, Gear, etc.\n\nPlease give me other ideas for this game."
lqrut1,My idea,"What is bethesda made a mobile Battle Royale game were you spwan infont of a vault with you three teams when the game begins you have to loot and kill enemies like bloat flies, radrcoaches,mole rats and rarely deathcleaws. Once you geard up you'll probably run into enemies team better take cover ore you'll be blown to bits with laser gun and rifles  but out of nowhere you see a virtibird in the sky it's dropping something yah you and you teamates say but you have to still take cover from those enemies do you dash to the air drop loot that airdrop and you get battle armor chest plate and you tell your teammates you got the best weapon and you say a a a your teammates shut and tell us I got a danm miniguns you teamates cheer for you as you kill evey enemy but you dead you got sniped so it's up to your teamates in no your teamate died online more friend left so your teamate pulled out a pan!!! And when that sniper bullet bounced back and your teammate one it all... So would a moblie Battle Royale game be a good idea you tell me in the comments.."
lqqwcn,Mario maker 2.5D,I saw a post on r/switch about stickers in 3D world and I got an idea for the ability to put down pipes in odyssey like levels that lead to those 8 bit sections but they are player made (optional online mini game like balloon world but if switched on you just find them randomly)
lqpee5,Anyone here ever play rainbow six siege?,"It started off as counter terrorism game with a team of 5 operators. There’s a terrorist hunt game mode which is basically you and up to four other people against AI of different levels of difficulty and a pvp game mode of 5v5. Both game modes have three different objectives with the terrorist hunt version has both the attacking side and defending side of versions accessible. The three different objectives are secure area, defend/extract the hostage, and bomb mode. \n\nWell me and my friends like to play the game casually. Our issue is, the game has been more geared for the pro league and higher levels of play. We were discussing how cool it would be if someone had created a Gary’s siege, basically giving the player access to the non game breaking variations of each operator, and their load outs with the buff/nerfs related to whichever variation chosen, ever released as well as specialized playlist where you could choose the maps you wanted to play and any variation of the maps that were released on the test servers and the live server. You could play any of the special game modes that were released for the game on any map, aside from the kill confirmed one on specific maps as most maps are really easy to spawn camp.\n\nThe game has had several special limited time events with special versions of beloved maps. Sadly once they’re over you can no longer have access to those maps anymore.\n\nThe cosmetics in the game are nice but not really necessary.  I know this is a pipe dream but man it would be amazing to be able to play the game and have fun on what ever map I wanted to play on."
lqpb6u,The Corruption: Trapped with Demons,"**Horror Survival Game**\n\nYou are stacked up against 6 demons and you have to try to find a way out of the Hybrid Factory. This factory is 8 floors tall with 2 of them being underground and 6 being above ground. You need to try to find a key to the exit and also some tools to shut down an electric forcefield. \n\nThere are 6 demons that are after you and that want you dead and each of them have different traits that you have to work your way around.\n\nJosh Curtary: Josh can teleport onto any floor he wishes but its always in the same spots, he runs at the same speed as you so you can outsmart him easily. He can't hear well but he has good eyesight so he can see you from 20 feet away and start a chase.\n\nSage Alamari: Sage can teleport just like Josh but she always spawns 30 feet away from you and you get an indicator when she teleports to warn you, she is faster than you and she has terrible eyesight she can see you from 10 feet away but she can hear very well.\n\nShawn HP: Shawn is slower than you and he can place spike traps and if you hit one it decreases your health and alerts Shawn to you location. He can see you from 15 feet away from you but he has terrible hearing.\n\nCorey Klenton: Corey is faster than you, but he always lets you live if you survive 20 seconds in a chase with him, he can see you from 10 feet away. Corey has decent hearing so he can pinpoint the area that the noise was caused.\n\nTalah Curtary: Talah is faster than you but she will only spawn when the timer reaches 5 minutes. She can always see you when you're within line of sight. She will leave every 5 minutes for 1 minute. She can hear really well and she will start spirting down the halls toward the noise, so don't knock over something and try to enter a corridor.\n\nTyler Grantor: Tyler can throw blades at you but he moves insanely slow so he is easy to outrun but if he hits you with a blade he will track down your location for 2 minutes so stay in the same place for to long.\n\nThe Hybrid Factory is experiencing a blackout but the electric forcefield is on a back up generator. Even if its hard to see in the dark it makes the demons easier to see because you can see their red eyes glowing in the dark, you also have a flashlight but if you use it to much the demons will use the light from your flashlight to find you. There are some lights in the building that are all line up from each floor and when a demon gets near them all of them will flash red for a second to warn you someone is in that area but they could also be on a different floor but you never know if they are near either.\n\nIf you take to long you will start hallucinating, first it will just be cracks on the walls will start to form, next the walls will have blood running down them. After that the cracks will start glowing red, and after that fire will be everywhere but they don't hurt you. The more you hallucinate the more aggressive the demons become where they will start to jog or sprint down the halls to find you.\n\nThere are three different stages in how known you are in the factory.\n\nUndetected means the demons have no idea where you are.\n\nNoticed means the demons heard something an are now checking it out\n\nHunted means the demons are in pursuit and are after you so you better get running.\n\nWith each stage different music will play with Undetected being the most creepy but but also most calm. Noticed, the music speeds up a bit and along with the music you hear screams and snarling. Hunted would have music that is very fast-paced and meant to get your blood pumping and you can hear pounding behind you as you run for your life as the demons get closer the pounding will get faster as well.\n\nBtw I know this would take a lot of time to make, and it would be difficult. I got this game idea from watching gameplay of Saiko No Sutoka and I thought instead of going against a single person you are against demons from my book series considering at some point they all had bloodlust so I thought they would be perfect for it. I do understand though if no one wants to make something as big as this or if it isn't possible for only one person."
lqodx3,What would be your ideas for .io games?,
lqngh2,A game with a “reality” world and a “dream” world,"Here’s the idea. The player can travel between these two dimensions using a doctor strange-style portal. In reality, you interact with npc’s and accept quests, which require you to enter your own mind, in the dream world, and bring strange items from your head back into reality. The main threat will be a person who was able to find a way to enter other people’s dream worlds, and you have to fight his minions inside of your own head. If you die there, you will wake up in reality, with all of your items missing. There will be a huge plot twist where the player realises that the person behind all of this is his friend from childhood-who was injured in a severe accident while they were seperated-and grew jealous of his friend’s ability (the player). For the gameplay, reality will be like reality, but in the dream world, you can use strange mechanics to do things like fly, or run up walls, or turn invisible. The player has to unlock these things by “realizing” they can do it by finishing a certain amount of quests. Both worlds will be large, detailed open worlds that the player can explore freely."
lqm8yh,Monster game concept and idea,"So I have a very vivid imagination and I thought up this monster, has the gram of a lion kind of but it has four limbs in front and two in back, it has long hair in the front half that slowly changes to the like scarily armor of a pangolin before it hits the tail. It’s tail will be longer than itself and will be used in combat and as a shield because of its armor, it will be able to thin out its tail to make a larger area of protection, this could work if the bone structure of the tail was like a pangolins tail, and if you add the rib joints and ribs of a flying lizard towards the upper half of the tail. You will be agile and quick and leaping will be a big thing in the game. You will be able to scale walls and jump from them, even jump onto other walls making a chain of leaps. The environment will be a huge forest, like I mean trees the size of act scrapers and big enough to hold a family of people. You’re back legs will be muscular and shaped relatively similar to either a lemur or a pangolin, so that it can support the tail and everything, it’s body will be slim. I sound really dumb because I am horrible at explaining things but I would love to this come to life, would anyone maybe help me make it, if not then can someone teach me how to use unity so I could try making the model at least?"
lqm406,An RPG for people who don't like RPGs (very lengthy),"I don't like RPGs. It would seem like their purpose is creating an immersive experience to role play in, but they end up being filled with so many clunky stats and mechanics that I never get into it. They're also super grindy which sucks. This is my attempt to conjure up an RPG that I would enjoy.\n\nFirst Person game or close camera third person ie GTA, AC, GoW, etc.\n\nCharacter creator with starting classes. Game starts in media res in character class story, different backstory per different class. Backstory has nothing to do with main gameplay rather just starting lore that the player can role play with.\n\nSmall player inventory based on size rather than weight resident evil style. Few weapon slots on character. Rest of inventory is at a roaming base ie ship or car or horse or something.\n\nOnly stats for \n\nSpeech: higher level gives entirely different speech options in encounters leading to different outcomes\n\nStrength: increases stamina and inventory size slightly.\n\nAim: aiming a gun is floaty in early game. As game progresses, aiming gets sharper and sharper until it's 1:1 movement with the mouse, simulating your character getting better at using a weapon\n\nWeapons and items don't have levels and only practical attributes. A sword can be dull or sharp and that can affect damage or dismemberment. A sharp sword gets progressively duller. A fancier sword might be ""finely honed"" and therefore never lose its sharpness.\n\nWorks with guns too. Maybe a cleaning system. A clean gun operates correctly, a dirty gun jams and misfires. Cleaning it at a base or gunsmith restores it. A ""finely machined"" gun won't get dirty.\n\nGet rid of health bars over heads! Damage can be brutal. If you didn't parry in time, your arm can be chopped off vice versa the enemy. Guns are one hit kills all headshots. Gun caliber will affect how many center of mass shots it takes to down an enemy ie stopping power. Bigger calibers are also more likely to dismember. \n\nTo balance unforgiving combat, gameplay is focused on interaction with environment rather than combat. Think Outer Wilds (not Outer Worlds) type gameplay. A lot more reading lore and contextual puzzles than Fallout style shoot and loot. Players who lack the skill for combat can gain satisfaction out of avoiding it as often as they can. Players who pick up the knack can go for a run and gun approach.\n\nOpen world with resources to allow sandbox gameplay. Think Achievement Hunter's GTA V heists. Completely custom based around the vehicles they could find, the map, and the Police AI reactions. \n\nI don't think skill trees or levelling up are necessary. The main gameplay would be based on sandbox problem solving and character relationships rather than linear quest lines and fighting stronger enemies.\n\n________________\n\nI'm biased towards sci-fi so I imagine a Firefly type story. Captain of a ship, get jobs, keep flying. The rest of this is my personal pipe dream btw\n\nFlying the ship is like in Outer Wilds, seamless transition between ship and world. Flying should probably be on tracks more or less as if there's an interstellar highway to follow. That way the game world can be separated into smaller chunks that you can fly between without having to render whole planets.\n\nShip is small and claustrophobic like a submarine. Few crew members that control engine room, weapons, etc. As they die you have to hire new crew or pilot by yourself.\n\nIf your ship is damaged in combat, you have to get out and repair whether in spacewalk or on the ground.\n\nMoney and fuel would be main resources to trade with. However materials to repair could be scavenged or mined ie basic survival elements.\n\nPlayer can choose to do whatever they want with their ship. Smuggling, bounty hunting, piracy, freight. Maybe there's a military storyline. Maybe there's a storyline without a ship, or maybe you can abandon the ship altogether. The game doesn't need to end when the ship blows up, maybe on-the-ground quests or living a frontier lifestyle idk.\n\n_________________\n\nIf you haven't noticed by now, this is really just a collection of my favorite existing gaming mechanics. I've never seen them all together to create this RPGish experience. However if someone else has, let me know cuz I'd love to play it! \n\nI know this is an absurd amount of content especially for an indie creator, but I thought I'd just get it out of my head. This subreddit is just a repository for ideas and if any of what's above trickles into someone's thought process, that's cool enough."
lqjxhm,RPG spanning different times trough history,"If anyone has ever read the Clarke-Baxter novel Time's Eye, this game would be based on something similar. For some reason humans from many different time periods exist on the same world. Each time period is separated by the creators of the world by barriers nobody can cross. \n\nThe player is one of the few (or only one, still undecided on that point) of people who have the ability to actually cross the barriers, although from the start the player can only cross barriers close to their own native time, which would be very close to the beginning of civilization. Also at the start he can't bring any items from one time to the other, but as he levels up he can start bringing items across, gradually, which are close in time to that period, like he can perhaps bring a 12th century sword in to the 10th century, but nor a WW2 rifle. At very high levels (an possibly some story unlocks) any items could be brought over.\n\nPossible backstory would be that a certain group (aliens/future humans/ascended beings) wanted to see if humans would stop fighting each other, so they took historic enemies and put them in the enclosures where they would fight endlessly, all dead being revived the next morning, could feature just the army camps or limited supporting infrastructure like small settlements."
lqjlx9,Any old farts remember that cheesy board game from the 90's Crossfire?,"https://youtu.be/rCwn1NTK-50\n\nI think this commercial is burned somewhere in your brain if you grew up in the 90s.\n\nI had an idea for a top-down bullet hellish roguelite that's physics based.  \n\nso basically instead of finding a sword that's +3 damage, you might find a longer sword (though it would swing a bit slower), or a shield that is shaped like a bowl so you can store up projectiles from enemies and fling them back at them, or you might find a pinball flipper.\n\nLeft click and right click activate whatever is in your left and right hand respectively. So you could have two pinball flippers to use the previous example.  Swords or stick like weapons with swing. Shields would be brought from the side to the front of your character while holding the mouse button.\n\nAnd of course you could find projectile weapons yourself to live that crossfire game experience. though I would think I would tour around with balancing it around absorbing or capturing projectiles from the enemy or otherwise having limited ammo.\n\nPower ups or upgrades could modify the shapes that you found like giving them bounciness so your Shields could deflect projectiles with extra momentum back at the enemy, or stickiness so you could glue things to your weapons for a moment. \n\nI'm not sure if you would die by taking damage or getting pushed into hazards by enough projectiles or enemies.  but either way or both could work depending on how you balanced the game."
lqhyt2,Nueral network dogfight,"You and a nueral network each control a ship in a simple 2d top down map. You both have the same ship, the same stats, and the same guns. Once you kill the nueral networks ship (which should be super easy at first), you get a point and the stage resets. Over time, the network will learn how to control and shoot the ship more effectively, and become harder to defeat. Once you are killed, the game is over, and your score is how many times you killed the AI before it killed you. Getting a really high score might involve really interesting strategies about intentionally teaching the AI bad strategies, before exploiting them in later levels. The number of times you kill the AI will be your final score, which will be put on a global leaderboard."
lqbxqu,Pick 2,Hey all! thought experiment here for you: \n\nIf you could take 2 unique mechanics/ features from 2 games and mix them which ones would you pick and why? \n\nMy picks are to take the portal gun and the first person parkour of mirrors edge.\n\nWhy? \nGiving a character with such high mobility a portal gun would allow for some insane parkour puzzles and mind bending level design!
lqbm7d,ON THE WAY *Concept*,"PITCH\n\nOn the way is a tactical first person shooter/vr shooter where you and your friends must take control of accurate Tanks and artillery pieces, fighting through historical battles ranging from world war 1 to the iraq war. On The Way requires team work as each member takes up a single role as a part of a tank crew, just like real life . (Driver, Gunner, Loader, commander etc.) Each role will have its own challenges and its own advantages equated with them.\n\nEssentially the game would be like DCS with tanks, having varying degrees of difficulty, spanning dozens of Tanks, each with unique designs and histories. It would have a pvp mode, a pve mode, and a stories mode, taking players through different important tank battles throughout history. Im not sure how accessible i would want it, either for a casual croud or a hardcore milsim croud."
lqa1dv,UNDERSCORE: Escape the 'Situation',"This is an idea I've been developing for some years. Though I haven't had the time to develop and really need to hire/find an artist and handcraft multiple immersive levels and voice actors for this to actually meet it's potential (its a little out of my solo-scope... tried several times).  \n\n*Looking for feedback &amp; collaboration mainly.*  \n\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nPlayers find themselves in a seemingly open world. Throughout the setting, objects and npcs interact with the environment creating a chain of causalities leading up to an effect. The player must investigate the environment and find the correct causes that lead up to the effect.\n\nThe player is limited to seeing what happens around them only, and only at the time it happens. If a player misses something, they must restart the time and go view it again. To see two things happen on different sides of the world would take 2 playthroughs. Players can fast-forward to get back to a certain time, or just observe the setting.\n\n**Interlude (Tutorial Level):** \n\n""Welcome to 'UNDERSCORE', Agent.""  \n""Now, I know you don't know a lot about what we do here, but I'll try to fill you in as you go.""\n\n""Due to the terms set in your execution hearing, you've essentially signed up to spend what's left of your life - saving someone else's. Yes, that does mean I'm asking you to be a hero; so meet your C.A.P.E.""\n\n""*CEREBRAL APPARATUS of PARRALLAXAL EXPERIENCE.* You're in one right now. Everything you see and feel is a computer's representation of data we scraped from a single photon's memory within a single hour.""\n\n""We can talk about that later. In about thirty seconds the event you're here to stop will occur. Each time you fail to stop it, you will be redistributed exactly one hour before the event. You can fast-forward, or reset the hour, but you can not rewind.""\n\n""Stop the event than we will take the data you recorded and overwrite the photon's memory. Good luck, Agent. And again, welcome to 'UNDERSCORE'"".\n\n**Event Examples: (plan is to draw from actual historical events)**\n\nPreventing assassination of a speaker on stage.  \nPreventing the launch of a space shuttle.  \nPreventing someone from getting in line before another person to get a winning lottery ticket.  \nCausing a royal matrimony (February Holiday Expansion)  \n\n\nThanks for checking it out. I hope to make it one day, but would really enjoy playing it regardless if self-made."

lq700r,Bathroom Wars,"You and probably someone you know brings their phone to the bathroom. Well why not play against them online, Super Smash Bros style while you do your business.\n\nYou load up the game, you choose your character, you're immediately dropped into a battle with bots while the game queues up a search for real players. Once real players are found the bots get switched out seamlessly. The player cap is 4 for now as mobile screens are too small to scale the camera out enough. Players fight each other, picking up randomly spawned weapons to build up the damage percentage to make you explode off screen.\n\nMaps could be procedurally generated since they are small. \n\nGame play variants include random bosses that can spawn, players instead work together to defeat the bosses. Random trash mobs could also spawn which would allow to help build up your specials.\n\nThe graphics have a anime / cell shaded stylistic look.\n\nThoughts?"
lq6wns,The Paradox: A mind breaking horror game,"You wake up in a bed in a room you've never been in before.  The floors are red and damp, and the walls are yellow. It's brightly lit and there is a large green cube on the floor. A recording plays over it telling you that you signed up for an experiment regarding the human mind. You also find a piece of paper telling you to not trust HourGlass, (the company that you ""signed up"" to do an experiment for). You also get some honey, bread, and water. This is the begining of The Paradox. A survival horror game. You wander through a maze of hallways always being watched by skull shaped cameras and finding strange notes hidden in walls or ripped up carpet or even the ceiling. Eventually you see a locked fire exit in the building. You keep walking and find a hub room. Here there's a record player, (you can find songs to play everywhere throughout the game), a bed, and some more food.  After the hub you go to floor 2. The walls are purple and the carpet is green here. There is an optional doorway before level three that leads to a large, changing maze. You are being slowly followed by a terrifying creature in the distance. It is very dark here but you must go in if you want to find every record or note. After leaving you move on to level three which is mostly filled with puzzles. Around floor 6 you come into contact with the Solomar, a large blue creature that is blind but has very good hearing and only attacks you when you make noise. There is also a crafting system in the game so you can make weapons to fight back. It's mostly straightforward until the final floor, the 17th floor. This floor is called Black rock tower and is much more rugged than the rest. At the final room you see a portal out, but before you get to it a demon made of an ash like substance appears and you have a boss fight with him. After getting through the portal and locking him on the other side, you must escape the HourGlass facility. Right as you get out the demon escapes and begins to destroy the building. You beat them one last time and send them back to the Paradox. This is a very rough explanation of what i have in mind so if you need more context then please tell me. I skimmed over basically the entire story too so if you want that, also just tell me."

However, during the intro when the theme music plays with all of its violins and pianos, the rival stops time with a record scratch sound and talks to the 4th wall expressing their dissatisfaction with their theme and requests something ""Upbeat and uplifting"" and when they start hearing it they approve, get back into position, and the battle starts.\n\nAny thoughts?"

lpmnly,Ideas for a Treehouse building type game,"Hey,\n\ni have this idea about a game where youbasically just live in a treehouse you can expand, like in the game raft but with a treehouse instead of a floating platform in the ocean. I thought, maybe there could be other treehouses around you that you can take over and make your treehouse bigger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni just dont know if thats enough gameplay (or i do know its not enough), so does anyone have some ideas that could make this more interesting?"
lpk03u,Small Town Simulator/Toy,"Something in between a city simulator and the Sims. You build/manage a small town with as few as 20 citizens, as many as maybe 500 (at the absolute biggest, and even that might be too many). The game would take place in the modern era.\n\nEvery citizen is modeled and has a schedule. They leave home in the morning (if they have a job), go to work, go shopping, come home. They have days off, occasionally stay home sick, and sometimes leave the town on vacation (vacation time determined by a policy at their work location). Children have different schedules related to the school year (which you can control by setting policies on the school building). Elderly retirees would stay at home, occasionally shop or work part-time jobs.\n\nThis idea is motivated by my attempts at creating a viable small town in Cities:Skylines. I felt a bit hamstrung by the population requirements to unlock more advanced buildings. Having grown up in a small town with many of these buildings (schools, police stations, firehouse, etc.), it felt a bit artificial that my in-game town couldn't also have those amenities.\n\nBut it is not just a matter of modding Cities to change those requirements - I feel that the focus of Cities is still a bit too high-level. I want the citizens' lives to be more richly modeled - maybe not quite as detailed as a Sim from the Sims franchise, and less focused on interpersonal relationships/drama.\n\nI should be able to walk around my streets like in Streets of Sim City or the console version of Cities, and observe daily life in a small town - people popping into shops to buy things, saying ""hi"" as they pass others on the street, sometimes arguing, occasionally committing crimes (more common things like parking/speeding violations to less common stealing/vandalizing, to very rare serious crimes like murder).\n\nThe ""goal"" of the game would be less on expansion and more on maintaining harmony in your town (or a dysfunctional one, if that's more your speed) - it would be less of a game and more of a toy, but could be played like a game if you're the type that needs goals.\n\nI think the Sims 3 came close to what I envisioned, and then they kind of ruined it / dumbed it down in Sims 4. But I felt that the Sims games were a bit lacking in the city-building aspects. I always hoped that Sim City and the Sims could meet somewhere in the middle but I don't think this was ever realized. I am aware of Sim Town but that game is very old and could use a modern take (it is also my understanding that it was fairly limited)."
lpj0f4,"New Rainbow Six game, R6: Green Shadow Rising","Game would start with long dark hallway with a dark room at the end with a person tied up in a chair their back turn  row of flickering tvs that are displaying Rainbow operators  some conducting their games and others in their homes. camera slowly  you than hear a male with a heavily accented english speaking. *We have sat in the shadows  as governments  have taken the rights of their peoples. We have stayed silent as the cries of the poor have gone unheard, we have watched as corporations plunder our earth and poison our air and we have asked where are those who are supposed to protect us? They are nowhere to be found instead content to play their games and feed off the scraps of their masters tables.*  \n\n*Today that changes today we no longer wait to be saved  today we claim back what is ours....  camera reaches the room as  the Tv screens all of sudden show explosions and figures dressed in all black shooting at the rainbow operators killing several  the figure tied up is revealed to be 6 who looks in horror as he sees his operators get killed.  all of sudden you hear the sound of hammer being pulled back and you see a gun pointed at the back of  6 head as  the mysterious figure speaks again.  We will build our world on the ashes of yours* Loud gunshot is heard as your see 6 slump on the chair and the  mysterious figure standing watching the screens. \n\nThe Game will than take you to the character creation screen where you will design a new rainbow recruit who will join the remaining members in a variety of missions across the globe as they try to take down this new radical group called Green shadow. You will conduct recon misisons,hostage rescue, vip escort and terrorist eliminations. you will be able to customize your guns and gear as well as clothing, each mission would unlock more items. you will face a variety of enemies  from Hackers who can disable your high end tech to lieutenants who can command and organize their troops to react to your team as well your standard heavy and light soldiers."
lpgidy,"IDEA: A space-survival game that takes place on a single abandoned space station in the middle of a vast void of unknown outer-space. (warning, long, super long, post)","(In advance, I want to make this an actual game one day, when I become more experienced in programming, so please don't copy the major theme of this game if you could. Of course I can't stop anyone so credit me if you do anyways. Thank you!)  \n\n\nThe game starts out by showing vast, moving shots of nothingness. Nothingness in space though. It's just an infinite void of stars and darkness giving off a deep malice. On the last shot, it shows a small hunk of metal floating around in this void. It looks miniscule compared to the emptiness. The camera slowly zooms in on this space junk reveling it as a small space station, almost small enough to be mistaken for a large, square\~ish ship. It is beaten up, torn up, some parts are smashed, and others are even missing.  \nThere is no sound yet, until it cuts to a shot of inside the space station. Where you (or your team if you do multiplayer or co-op) are wounded and wearing damaged space suits. The advanced tech, although beat up, implies this game takes place in the future. You all get up. nauseas and disoriented. You don't immediately get anything like a task or a quest until you interact with a broken terminal as sparks fly out of it. It barely works but it manages to stutter out some information  \n*Station: 629;  Vulcara. Welcome, Captain*  \n*Hull integrity: Severe Damage*  \n*Energy Production: None*  \n*Shield Status: Offline*  \n*Weapon Status: Offline*  \n*Fuel: Offline - Thrusters: Offline*   \n*Gravity Control - Online*\n\nThe only thing that is working is the gravity control, allowing you to walk normally in the station. It appears the station name is Vulcara, and it's designation is 629. The terminal has a few options, including Logs, Status (again), and mechna-arm control, and repairs. The Logs reveal you and your crew used to have a much bigger space station. The space station also worked as a space-ship that was launched into space. Many logs are missing and you are not sure why you have been stranded, where your crew is, and why you were launched into space. Now using the mechna-arm control, you can control a large and expandable robo-arm on the outside of the station. It is also badly damage and doesn't extend much.   \nYou see a metal box surrounded by much debris that you can just barely reach with the mechna-arm. When you grab it the arm retracts to the inside of the station and within a few second it is now in your hands. Inside the box is a gun and a futuristic looking tool. Inserting the tool within the terminal allows you to build new parts to the ship, or you can use the tool with the repairs section and fix pieces of the ship.  \nUsing the mechna-arm you can grab the debris and fix the ship. You can use the tool outside of terminal to fix items inside the ship, using this you know have a repaired hull (of what you do have) and a working terminal. A UI appears showing health, thirst, hunger, and effect.  \nSo for the rest of the game it's you trying to make it back to Earth. Doing this is a dangerous task, you need to build new parts to the Vulcara and keep a steady supply of energy, fuel, food, water, and make sure the parts of your ship is always up to standards. You can build station attachments like more generators, weapons/turrets, more thrusters (will be required for heavier ships), and other things like radars. You can build labs to study aliens and ores, and better ores make better things.  \nYou can build terminals and rooms for things like navigation, farming, weapon/ammo building, etc. You will have to land on planets that you come across (when you build the shuttle) and collect water/hunt alien creatures for meat. You can also mine on planets or mine meteors. There would be many other features, like upgrading attachments, terminals, weapons, and the ability to craft better and more advanced gear and suits. Your station will be attacked by space creatures known as ""anomalies"" and a good radar and can tell you what parts of space and which planets are more dangerous, but the more dangerous, the better the minerals, loot, and food quality. There's even a very hard to fight boss called ""The Queen"" which is a massive planet sized anomaly that gives you lots of good loot and a secret ending, if you meet the requirements. You can even find and travel through worm-holes (at the expense of some hull integrity.) There's a lot to do in this game, explore, craft, fight, mine, upgrade, study, etc. The story/lore is never full explained and will require you to upgrade the main terminal to unlock more logs and restore more logs using your lab. many of the logs have  accompanying cutscenes. Some lore is even seen through alien studies from alien settlements (which can be found! Although not all are friendly.)  \nThe game also has an endless mode that you can choose at the star or you can choose when you find Earth. (Like it implies, the game doesn't end, or keeps going after you find Earth with the station you have.)  \n\n\nThe story/lore (but short but also not really)  \n\n\nTurns out the current year is 3024 and Earth has been chaos for years. Pollution, global warming, poverty, war, and over-population. The poor stay poor while the rich get richer, as in the rich are very corrupt, nobody cares, people are dying and governments have no remorse, governments also only care about war now and none of the efforts to stop and of the issues on Earth. Some countries, including Sweden, Sudan, and Brazil have been torn apart and no longer exist due to the war, and governments have raided towns and killed million of innocents to ""fix"" over-population. It got really bad in 2097 and the lower class/lower-middle class on Earth started a revolution that began with a group of rebels in England. America and Canada decided they liked that idea and began revolting as well, led by Jason ""Strider""   They were under-manned and didn't have enough power so lost all of their fights until military defectors smuggles weapons to them. War was tearing apart the world. It turns out in 2086 there was a dangerous disease called Plague 31-X was actually cured using a rare mineral found in deep space called Quettrenium (an ore you will find a lot in your journeys) cured the disease instantly. It also was used to make great machines and technology that could have been used to solve Earth's issues. But you know, corrupt government and war, also the fact that humans already mined up too much of it and can't find any in their general area of space. NASA and ECRO (Earth Crisis Response Organization) are the only two government funded organizations left that aren't used for making weapons, although NASA is on the brink of being wiped from the history books. They decide to secretly send a manned mission to deep deep deep space to find more and illegally make these machines. You were the Captain, and your crew ran out of fuel before you found anything. An anomaly  attack destroyed your station and gave you a mind-wiping concussion. Your crew (or a lot of it if your playing with others) died. At the end of the game, when you make it back to Earth, you land in the middle of a city surrounded by soldiers. But the soldiers have the rebels crest and you learn that the rebels won against the government, although Earth is still suffering. There are three different endings depending on a few things.  \nBad ending: You make it back to Earth but you have 300 or less Quettrenium. Not enough to build any machines and every human on Earth dies out eventually due to all the bad stuff and an attack from the Queen.  \nOkay ending: You have 301-1.9k Quettrenium. Earth get's sustained for the next few couple hundred years but eventually Earth does fall to it's inevitable doom due to bad stuff and the queen.  \nGood ending: You have 2k- Quettrenium and you are able to rebuild NASA and ECRO from the ground up. The Queen attacks but Earth does defeat it, although due to the attack a lot of Europe has been destroyed. You build Quettrenium machines that sustain Earth.\n\nSecret ending: During you expedition kill the Queen in space. Have 10k or more Quettrenium and have collected an ""Strange Orb"" (a very rare item found in alien settlments). The Queen never attacks and the machines are built as well as NASA and ECRO are put back together. The orb is studied and actually creates a new livable planet that begins to orbit the sun. It forms unnaturally fast, within about 80 or so years, and it massively helps with the over-population issue."
lpazvg,Zelda/metroidvania combination,"Recently I saw a speedrun of Link to the Past/Super Metroid combo randomizer. This completely blew my mind that this is possible - but also I'm surprised that nobody yet had an idea like this.\n\nSo, here is my concept for a game: basically that randomizer, but as a standalone indie game. The plot would follow a fantasy world, where in the dark ages, a demon was summoned, and the protagonist is a monster hunter trying to destroy the monster. However, demon opens a temporal rift that allows that person to communicate with their direct descendant in the cyberpunk future (still fantasy - think Shadowrun) who is now a street samurai down on their luck. It turns out that the demon returns every 1000 years (the descendant and the hunter are exactly 1000 years apart), and is unbound in time - to kill him permanently, he has to be killed in both time periods simultaneously. So the monster hunter enlists the help of their descendant, and they both work together to destroy the demon in their respective time periods.\n\nThe dark ages would be a sidescroller metroidvania, similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, with a focus on melee combat with swords and such; while the future would be a top-down game, like Zelda mixed with Smash TV. The player could switch between both games at any time, and because of the time rift, items and upgrades from both periods would be seen in all ages - so for example, the street samurai in the future might find a new sword for their ancestor, while the hunter in the past might find a new gun for the street samurai.\n\nThe game would take place in the same location - the Agares Forest, filled with giant petrified trees. However, while in the past it'd be just a forest, in the future there would be either a city built around the giant trunks, or the trees are cut down to make place for skyscrapers, whichever the person who wants to use this prefers.\n\nThe final boss would be designed so player has to fight two fights at once - on the left side of the screen, they would be platforming as the monster hunter with the arrow keys (in the monster hunter past gameplay up is used for jumping and down is used for a downstab attack, like in the indie game Super House of Dead Ninjas) or the left stick to avoid demons attacks, while on the right, you would play as the street samurai in special setpiece section, a first person rail shooter played with mouse or the right stick - and you would have to kill boss simultaneously in both screen, or he will respawn in both with 25% of health."
lp7511,"An anime esque 3rd person roguelike fighting game with fully customizable characters, high stakes combat, and lots of strategy and base building involved.","So ok, I've been watching a lot of naruto shippuden and while I don't want the game to be limited to ninjas I've got a really cool idea. So basically your main character grows up in a village, and while you're a kid you get you character stronger by learning new moves at the academy for kids who'll be soldiers when they grow up, (like naruto). There's a lot of moves that do different things and you can have as many skills as you want you just have to remember them all.\n\nWhen you're old enough you can finally start fighting, this is important because during this time all of the villages are at war and you grew up in a time of war. From this point you join a team of fighters who do missions for your village as you slowly rank up over the course of years. If your main character dies it's game over and you have to restart (this can be toggled) If any teammates you have die they stay dead. Until you're the chief of your village you don't have any say in what your tasks are. Eventually you can be the leader of a team if you want and level them up so when they fight they're less likely to die.\n\nThe combat system is kind of hack and slash but it's really easy to die so you'll need to use diversions and underhanded attacks to win. Imagine the typical fight scene from naruto where it's very easy to die, but everyone isn't a ninja and they can basically do anything provided they're level is high enough. Players can do things like fight enemies several levels higher and come out on top if they play their cards right. The characters will have a lot of movement depending on thier build, with some characters being able to run up walls, teleport etc. Players can often turn the tables on enemies with witty thinking, so let's use this as an example. \n\nYou're some kid who's new to the job and you're out doing some recon on an enemy village. Then boom an armored knight jumps out of nowhere trying to kill you, all of your weapons aren't doing jackshit to him. But you remember that you have a lighting ability that enchants your weapons with shock damage, so you give your knife the shock element and throw it at him, the electricity then fries the knight in his armor.\n\nEventually you can get married and have a kid, this basically means if your main character dies you can play as your child. If you have multiple kids you can choose who you play as."

lp0m2z,Okay listen up Nintendo..,"Imagine if The Legend of Zelda was a full on RPG.\nSo with Breath of the Wild they were inspired by Skyrim with the whole “anywhere you see, you can go” idea. Which is great. But what if they took it further.\n\nLets say for timeline purposes, the game takes place 100-200 years after the event of BOTW (and probably BOTW2).\nThey use the same overworld because of the size. BUT with no evil in the world for so long, Hyrule is just thriving. Lots of towns to explore, characters to meet, sidequests. \nHere’s the crazy part though. \nYou don’t play as Link.\nYou play as a descendant of one of the Champions. \nHowever, you get to choose which one. \nYou pick a race like, lets say, a skyrim type rpg. Hylian, Goron, Zora, Gerudo, whatever.\nAnd the game opens with a 4-6 hour intro where you kind of get to learn more about whatever race you chose. Spend time in that race’s region. Meeting characters. Learning about their legends and myths and elders. Doing quests around Deathmountain if you’re a Goron for example. Then obviously the story progresses and the game opens up and let’s you explore the world.\n\nI’ve had that idea long before BOTW even came out. The idea of exploring a big hyrule and selecting your race. Just happens that the BOTW map was huge and amazing to explore. BUT it always felt pretty empty to me. \n\nTake the idea I had when i was a kid and apply it to that map, maybe expand it a bit, and boom. Its a beautiful idea but lets he real. It’s Nintendo. They don’t think of things like this."

lowh53,First person labyrinth game,"It's a first person game where you have to find the end of the labyrinth. That's the base of the idea. I've been thinkin about putting rifles in it with different effects (like moving objects, teleporting or maybe shooting). I thought it could be about surviving a bit, like you have to eat, drink and sleep enough. Basically it would be a 2D labyrinth, but that's because of the easiest implementation. I have to make it for a class, and I would be glad if you could add some ideas or reflections. Thank you very much, and sorry for the bad English."

You can adjust how brightly to glow (and maybe use different colors) to better see your surroundings and to catch prey that are attracted to the light. Beware! As predators are also attracted to your light and have a few glowing tricks of their own. Swim fast and glow wisely.\n\nWas thinking 2D scroller, but I suppose you could also go 3D Slender man style. \n\nI can do some basic photoshop and illustrator and would be interested in giving some art input on design, however you'd probably need a pro animator and I have no idea how to code.\n\nI was thinking a far-future or alien world in a rainforest with above and below water elements.

lor3j3,"Retro First Person Adaptation of ""Call of Cthulhu""","The game would follow the story of the book in the format of old SNES adventures games(i.e. ""Eye of the Beholder""). I really like Lovecraft and I felt the official game didn't really capture the story, so I thought this would be a relatively easy game to make. I decided not to go through with it because it would follow the story a little *too* closely, and essentially just be walking. I think the bit near the end where they \*spoilers\* awaken Cthulhu could be interesting by implementing non-euclidean layouts. I just felt like I should post it here, in case there are any Lovecraft fans looking for something to do."
lonch0,Some loose metroidvania ideas,"I know indie devs come here to find ideas for games, so I figured I might dump a bunch of smaller ideas into one post.\n\nBasically, I believe that since 2009, the metroidvania genre has evolved very little, and might be slowly becoming stale (I can think of at least 4 different games that try to do ""metroidvania as 2D Dark Souls"" thing released in recent years). So, here's some ideas on how to make your metroidvania game stand out from the herd! (Note that I'm using very loose definition of metroidvania, the goal is to create something interesting instead of following the definition exactly)\n\nTo be fair, most of these ideas are inspired by various metroidvania games I played.\n\n* Instead of having single interconnected world, have multiple locations connected by a top-down world map. This is actually pretty common in retro metroidvanias, like Zelda 2, Gargoyle's Quest, or Super Adventure Island II. While this loses some of the sense of being in a coherent location, it allows for a more epic scale to the story, as player can explore an entire world/region. Modern game that does this is Super Win The Game.\n* Sequence breaking! Add hidden mechanics to your game that you don't tell your player around, or hide that knowledge. This will make your game instantly appealing for speedrunners (for example, that's why speedrunners love Super Metroid and Zero Mission), which gives you extra exposure.\n* Puzzle platformer metroidvania. I can think of only three games that do this, and each approaches it differently.\n* Instead of gating progress by locking it behind abilities, lock it behind obscure game mechanics that player would never guess on their own - and player is taught these mechanics at key points. Toki Tori 2+ does this really well. Similarly, you can make player solve puzzles to progress, and hide puzzle hints instead of abilities. This also automatically solves the need for sequence breaking mechanics.\n* Related to above idea, you can have the game feature notes and NPCs using multiple different languages, which will be gibberish - but player character can learn new languages (or upgrade their translation software). This is loosely inspired by La-Mulana, but in it that occurs once at the start of the game - but you can make it a regular occurrence. Idk, set the game in Tower of Babel?\n* Instead of ability or item gating, you can lock the progress by giving player switches that open doors and enable lifts and so on. Flash puzzle platformer Redder does this. [https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/529992](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/529992) \- you will need Newgrounds Player (only works on Windows) to play it since Flash is deprecated.\n* Mix Ikaruga with metroidvania! Little known flash game called Antichromatic took the basic idea of Ikaruga and applied it to a metroidvania - first ability lets you switch colors between black and white, later abilities let you interact with objects of certain color. You can take this idea and polish it into a full game! [https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/618881](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/618881)\n* You can take a page from Zelda, and have player enter smaller ""dungeons"" inside the main interconnected world, separate from the main map. Several games do this, including Knightmare 2 on MSX or Castlevania 2 on NES.\n* In addition to above, take the page out of Blaster Master and make the dungeons drastically different in gameplay from the main game. Getsu Fuuma Den uses first person dungeon crawler, Goonies 2 uses a first person adventure game like Shadowgate, and Blaster Master uses a top-down shooter.\n* Add linear platforming levels as intermissions between open world exploration. Kid Icarus on NES kinda does this.\n* Tactical Soul System from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow games is brilliant, but for some reason only indie game (I know of) to copy it is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. What I recommend is not just copying it, but using ""souls"" as the main collectible in the game, found instead of items or upgrades lying around, and not for killing enemies. This will reward player for exploration with something that is always useful (because no soul in Sorrow games is the best, they're all lateral to each other) instead of the disappointment of finding a sword that is two times weaker than your current one. And it gives the completionists another statistic to 100%!\n* Run'n'gun metroidvania! Make your game a run'n'gun shooter in style of Contra or Metal Slug. So far we only ever got two games like that, Alien Infestation and Mummy Demastered, both by WayForward.\n* Shmup metroidvania! Even more obscure, I can think of only one game that does this - Hero Core by Daniel Remar (creator of Iji and Hyper Princess Pitch).\n* Do you want to make a metroidvania but can't think of enough ideas for upgrades? Take a page from one of the first metroidvanias ever made, Montezuma's Revenge, and make abilities consumable/disposable after use! This way, with 2-3 ability ideas you can still make a long game!\n* 3D platformer metroidvania: There's plenty of 2D platformer metroidvania, but only game that kind of qualifies in 3D is Banjo Tooie - and it still mostly uses collectibles for gating. This is an interesting direction now that 3D platformers are back in vogue!\n* 2D collectathon: Instead of ability gating, give player access to the entire game world from the beginning - and ask them to either kill all the bosses, or collect every single object of a certain type, to win the game/unlock the final boss! Jet Set Willy, Pitfall 2 and Rogue Legacy do this.\n* Hacking metroidvania: Gate progress not behind abilities, but behind passwords that player has to input into computer terminals. Password pieces are strewn around the world, and player has to arrange them  as a puzzle to progress. Impossible Mission for C64 does this.\n* Rescue your friends: Instead of magically gaining new abilities, make a 'tag team' platformer like first NES TMNT game, or Super Mario 64 DS, where you can switch the character you're playing as at any time, and each character has different abilities - you start as one character, and as you rescue more of them, more of the game world unlocks due to your rescued friends abilities!\n* Sandbox game metroidvania: Just like modern sandbox games, or cRPGs, instead of just finding abilities, ask player to complete quests/mission in the game world that award them these new abilities as a reward!\n* Pure platformer metroidvania: Almost all modern metroidvanias are action platformers, in equal measure about platforming and combat. But what if you focused entirely on platforming with almost no combat, like in Mario, Super Meat Boy or Sonic? VVVVVV almost did this, though with no ability gating.\n* Speaking off... Sonic-like momentum platformer metroidvania. While there are modern Sonic clones, like Freedom Planet, I don't think anybody tried to tackle this idea yet. Sure, some common design trends in metroidvanias would need tweaking - for example, you couldn't just have hard boundaries between rooms, since that would require player to stop running, but I think if you solve those design quandaries, running as a Sonic-like character in a large interconnected world could be really rewarding.\n* Cinematic platformer metroidvania: There is an obscure subgenre called cinematic platformers - games like Prince of Persia, Flashback, Blackthorne, Another World or the modern Deadlight. Instead of unrealistic movement like air-control and double jump, they focus on injecting realism into platforming, by having committed jumps with no air control, focus on climbing ledges, and realistic combat. All of these games were linear level-based affair - but what if you made one that was a metroidvania?\n* Idle clicker metroidvania: Inspired by youtuber Ingeniousclown Gaming, who likes idle games and metroidvanias. So, you start the game with a gun, but no ammo. After the first screen, you get to the room with the ammobox - a coinbox you have to hit by jumping into it to get ammo. Eventually, you will upgrade it to get more ammo per jump, or to get ammo automatically. As you progress through the game, as ability gating, you unlock new types of ammo and weapons, that create new 'ammoboxes' back in the ammo room that you have to hit and upgrade to get that new types of ammo (rockets, shotgun, machinegun) - these new ammo types open certain types of doors like in Metroid. Minor collectibles are efficiency upgrades that will provide you passive income of ammo that doesn't require you to do anything, like in Cookie Clicker. Similarly to Diablo 2 Town Portal, after first leaving the room, you will have the option to teleport straight to the ammo room - and after you teleport there, you can teleport back to where you were in the world map.  Goal of the game is to install final ammo factory upgrade, to tie the game back to the idle theme.\n\nAnd that's it for my ideas. Just wanted to share them here since there is 0% chance I will realize all, or even most of them, in my dev career."
lolu2o,Pokémon Souls Game,"I’m not a game maker, but I’d love to see this made.\n\nSo my idea is for a Souls style arena battle-style fighting Pokémon game. If you were playing on a console controller, it works perfectly to have the four abilities be on a trigger or bumper. \n\nThe stronger abilities would cost more endurance (PP). \nYou’d still get a small dash to evade abilities with the dash distance or maybe end cost scaling jog with the stat. \nYou’d have the effectiveness from types still work. \n\nThere’s a lot to work with honestly. It’s like dark souls meets league of legends in the sense that the abilities are set at the start of the match. I’d love to hear others ideas and I think this would be super fun to play."
lolq33,Domino Pathways,"Up to 8 players would take turns placing dominoes, moving along the dominoes already placed, capturing other players' dominoes and fighting each other. You play with a domino set (double-6, double-9, double-12, double-15, or double-18), and a pair of dices (D7s, D10s, D13s, D16s, or D19s). Each player starts with 7 dominoes and a certain amount of HP (from 40 to 120 depending on the domino set you've chosen).\n\nYou can play either until one player runs out of dominoes to place (Expansion) or no more dominoes can be placed (Attrition).\n\nAt the start of the game, a 0-0 domino and a number of other dominoes (from 12 to 36 depending on the domino set chosen) are placed.\n\nEach turn of a game goes as follows:\n\n* Roll the dices\n* One of two things can happen:\n   * Draw the domino matching the dices' score (if you rolled a 5 and a 3, draw a 5-3 domino)\n   * Add up the two dices' score, and then you can make that amount of moves at most along the dominoes (with the above examples, 5+3=8 moves maximum). If you have points left after moving, you can try to capture the domino you're on. Depending on your remaining score and the domino's score, you either capture the domino or take damage based on the difference. If the domino you land on is occupied by another player, a fight occurs (both roll dices, lower score takes damage, higher score captures the domino).\n* Place one domino whenever possible. Usual domino rules apply, but dominoes can also be placed vertically:\n   * perpendicular to the end of a domino\n   * sideways onto a double domino (or on either of its borders)\n   * across the middle of a domino with a 0\n* Draw a domino after placing one (Attrition) or if you can't place one (Expansion).\n\nAs mentioned above, 0-0 dominoes are neutral zones (no fights or captures can occur on them). If a player runs out of HP, they start their next turn on the last 0-0 they crossed.\n\nOnce the game is over, scores are tallied: add points from dominoes placed/captured and from damage dealt to other players (this accounts for fights and capture attempts on your dominoes) ; subtract points from dominoes still in your hand and from damage received from other players.\n\nAny feedback on the idea is welcome!"
loixod,Card Based World Generator,"You start out with a small blot of land surrounded by water. In your had you have some cards like rain, more land, or wind. Playing the rain card on your land will start plants growing. Playing wind with the plants will spread there seeds, and allow for more growth. The more land card will increase your island size. As time goes on, you will unlock more plant species, and eventually an animal species to feed on those plants. Playing your cards to keep a careful balance between your ecosystem will allow you to continue to unlock more and more advanced animals up the food chain, while continuing to expand and make your island more complex (mountains, deserts, lakes, etc). Playing your cards wring will lead to extinctions and starvation. Eventually you will unlock species up to human. At the end of the game there should be an extremely complex and diverse island you build from the ground up."
lofg26,A survival game where you are being constantly followed by some kind of slow moving being (like It Follows) while trapped on a large island.,"I’m not surprised if something exactly like this has already been done, but I just like the concept of desperately trying to survive in a harsh unforgiving environment, while having to be constantly vigilant of this creature that would be always walking towards you slowly but never stopping. You’d also have to not stay in one place for too long, I don’t know how sleeping would work maybe every time you sleep the monsters is suddenly way closer. I guess I’m just a sucker for the intense feeling you get while knowing your being hunted in a game."
loedb2,Sentient Balloons Rimword,"Yes, you read that right. Imagine a type of alien that lives in gas giants. Weird sentient balloon creatures (eg drifloon). They build weird spiderweb structures and have complex personalities and societies. They become spacefaring. Then imagine a lost ark ship of theirs crashing into Jupiter. You play as one faction of the aliens, with a Rimworld-esque AI dungeon master generating challenges for your small colony. Key differences to RW being the layers and constant flux/float of a gas giant environment, plus the tangled web of behaviours/needs driving the alien behaviour (eg, not eating enough of nutrient x increases aggressiveness). At some stage humans discover the colony and lose their sh!t. I imagine the UI initially being in alien symbols which gradually ‘decipher’ the more you play. Multiple win criteria - eg unite the factions or conquer all, but steep curve of survive or die."
lo5ye1,3d stealth metroidvania,"Why can we have a full 3d steath game with metroidvania elements? Imagine: you are in a single huge map fully explorable from the stat but with abilities gate.\n\nImagine a Thief game but you start with nothing, you need to find the lockpick, the screwdriver, the grapple, the water arrows, ... in the level to progress. You avoid fighting and avoid being spotted at all cost because you are weak as hell. As you unlock new abilities, it gets easier to roam in the map but later place have more enemies and more perceptive. You naturally have shortcut to avoid redoing the same room again and again (for example, vents that are unlocked from one side). Naturally, tons of secrets and also optional upgrades (more max ammo for example).\n\nA side thought that I had would be that there is a general alert level for the world (a bit like Chaos in Dishonored). Being spotted and generally making guards wary increase the general alertness; spawning more enemies. Even the abilities could be playstyle dependant: For example, if you didn't get spotted retrieving the vent opener, you get the screwdriver: stealthy but you need to do it each time (uncrewing and rescrewing); if you made the guards wary without being spotted, you get the crowbar: a bit less stealthy but you only need to open the grid once unlocked. But if a guard check the grid, he will see it and become wary. If you went full commando, you get explosive: not stealthy at all and guard see from afar if a grid is open but it always fully open, making it easy to got fast."
lo4ij5,A tactical superhero RPG (and why isn't there one already?),"So this one probably isn't that original, but I cannot understand why no one has made a game like this in the last decade. \n\nSo the idea is this: A tactical RPG set in a world with superheroes. You control a team of superheroes by sending them on missions, with combat being either turn-based or pausable. Think XCOM, if you will, but in a different setting and with unique characters. \n\nI should probably say that I mean ""RPG"" in a loose sense. Your heroes gain xp on missions, that they can use to gain levels, which lets them gain new abilities or upgrade existing ones. Each hero's leveling has to be unique though, given that they all have different powers and/or skills. This means a semi-unique set of abilities for each character. Is this a problem? It likely either requires slightly longer game development, or limits the amount of different heroes you can recruit. But with maybe 10-15 different heroes, it shouldn't be completely undoable.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: ""This game already exists. It's Freedom Force from 2002 by Irrational Games"". And you would be sort of right. I actually want a sort of spiritual successor to Freedom Force. I agree that it is a great game, and I've played through it and its sequel several times. But why did no one make another game like this for over 15 years? Super heroes are more popular than ever, and so are tactical RPGs. Just look at the success of Dinvinity: Original Sin, Pathfinder: Kingmaker and so on. I feel confident that the same people that play those games would be interested in playing a game with super heroes.\n\nAlso, looking at modern RPGs, lots of features could be added/changed to set this game apart from Freedom Force in a positive way. Like:\n\n\- Choices and branching story lines. Make the story non-linear by giving your heroes a choice of what to do. This could lead to branching story arcs, with several possible endings for any given quest line. Does your hero investigate a lead given to them by a certain shady character, or do they trust the chief of police? Upon finding the villain's layer, do they take a stealthy approach or go in guns blazing with a team of heavy-hitters? Do they discover a specific clue or scribbled note, which lets them find the hostages in time? Do they go back into the burning building, not knowing what will happen in there? There are so many (imo) cool possibilities. \n\n\- Personal side quests. Each hero could have a personal quest line consisting of several missions. These missions could see them evolve, interact with people from their origin story, fight their personal nemesis, and similar. These quest lines could potentially again have different possible outcomes, possibly giving your heroes access to different new abilities depending on choices made. It could also possibly lead to romances between characters (for those of us that like that sort of thing).\n\n\- The possibility of failing missions. This could be another way to have non-linearity to the story, and there are a few ways it could be implemented. It could be that civilians die during a mission or the criminals/villains get away, leading to the city distrusting you more. It could also be that your heroes can be defeated, but with the story continuing, but with the permanent death or injury of one of your heroes. Or it could be that failing an optional objective during a mission leads to trouble down the line, with a villain resurfacing to cause trouble. \n\n\- Freedom to explore. Patrol the city with you team and discover crimes in progress or speak with your contacts in order to get leads on what a super villain's plans are. Go around and meet people, potentially meeting new recruits or discovering new missions. It opens the possibility of letting players do meaningful things in between missions/combat.\n\nI should make a note of saying, that these features are really just suggestions. I'm not sure a game would work with necessarily all of them implemented at once. It's just ideas for making the game more interesting and exiting.\n\nSo what do you think?"
lo2qqi,I have some ideas that may be very controversial.,"I recently had an idea for a survival game. I know, super exciting.  But I do want to create some differences from other survival heavy hitters like Rust and Minecraft. There's one idea I have that I think is interesting but also might rub a lot of people the wrong way. Potentially millions of people if it were to be implemented in a popular survival game.\n\nThe enemies in this game would be goblins. They're kinda dumb but sentient creatures with free will nonetheless. This controversial game mechanic would be players having the option to enslave goblins. Like strip them of their weapons and armor and make them harvest crops and mine for resources. You'd have to feed them and keep guards on watch duty so they won't revolt. \n\nHow do you guys think this would go over today especially with America's dark history and the current political climate and social commentary surrounding racism and blm? Should I just scrap this idea?"

Possesses a pretty standard fighting game moveset inspired by the likes of Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, and Sakura with some elements of Shantae as well, using her hair for some attacks obviously.\n\nRapunzel Schlösser: Inspired by multiple incarnations of Rapunzel, this is more like a composite Rapunzel with a few aspects of the original, Disney's Tangled, Rapunzel's Revenge, and more. Moveset is more of a master of long ranged physical attacks with her long magical hair, but they have some start and end lag at the cost of that disjoint. She also has a short ranged but heavy damage dealing Frying Pan.\n\nHoney Hive: A Girl with bee-like features and powers. Has an army of bees are her command that live in her beehive hairdo like it was a real beehive as they have so much honey in it that it grows back very quickly. Attacks are mostly based on summoning a swarm of bees to do small damage over time and honey, helped by her possessing some power over nature as she can create plant-life anywhere on any surface. Usually making flowers for her and her bees to make honey from. Also can attack with her stinger and fly with her wings for a good aerial attack game.\n\nTressé Perruque: A short haired boxer girl (Note: Short compared to everyone else) who enters to prove her skills to the world, braided bunches of real hair into her own hair to allow enter the tournament since it’s long haired girls only. Uses the boxing style known as Savate, a French kickboxing combat sport that uses the hands and feet as weapons combining elements of English boxing with graceful kicking techniques. While she’s a master of close quarters rushdown combat with incredible speed, she’s not used to fighting with long hair, which tends to throw her off a bit. If cut, it doesn’t grow back instead she becomes much faster in both movement and attack speed, though this is temporary as she will pull off the cut braid and braid it back into her hair, making her one of the few characters who is immune to the negative hair effects and one who actually gets a benefit from her hair getting cut off.\n\nMagia Capillum: An adult magical witch. Possesses an amazing variety of magical spells, but she hasn’t learned any actual offensive spells besides some wind spells spells, forcing her to use a bunch of misc spells in unconventional ways and they have some downsides, like summoning a barrier around her foe to trap them for a moment, but it halves the damage they take as long as the barrier remains up. Like most witches, her power comes from her long hair which she can grow at will.\n\nDame Godiva: A female paladin knight with incredibly long messy hair who has fought many battles and comes from a lineage of long haired paladins known for their extreme hair growth gene. She fights using a dull wooden sword and a wooden shield (as a less lethal replacement for her sharp metal sword and her heavy metallic shield). A very tanky fighter, but one that’s not impossible to get around.\n\nKosy Zamki: A former russian female soldier who has very long fast growing hair due to a failed experimental serum that was supposed to make her stronger, which it did to a very small extent. She was a master of both versions of Sambo (Army training and sports/wrestling versions) and decided to combine her training with her newfound hair power to create a style of combat based on grappling to create a deadly long range grappling type fighter by using her braided hair like a whip, lasso, and/or rope.\n\nDJ Fro: A Dancer and DJ for a nightclub called “The Tower” with a very big afro as big as her love for Disco. As it turns out, like how music makes a plant grow faster and healthier, music made Fro’s hair grow into her large thick afro, to the point where it has absorbed so much disco, it just grows back quickly. Her fighting style would be best described as something similar to Wii Fit Trainer in Smash Bros, using the power of disco to fight and attack her opponents. As well as attacking with her afro in a few moves.\n\nDr. Makrýs Tréses: A very brilliant teen scientist who was trying to give herself rapid hair growth because her best friend who she has a crush on has a long hair fetish, it accidentally gave her prehensile hair that she has full control over instead. Has a few moves inspired by Millia Rage and Filia. Not very strong physically as she has the lowest amount of health or defense but her hair is very powerful and deadly.\n\nHuíyīn Dòushì: Mähne’s best friend who also has her hair grow very long very fast in a single day which is how they met and became friends when they learned that they shared very similar interests. While not a master of martial arts she learned how to perform a few of her friend’s techniques to an extent and did take a few classes for karate. Her fighting style is best summarized as, if Mähne is the Ryu of this game, then Huíyīn is somehow both the Ken Masters and Dan Hibiki. She looks like a joke version of Mähne with worse versions of her special attacks but she has a lot of taunts and some unique abilities. Though her attack power is worse than Mähne’s, both her movement speed and attack speed as well as her durability are much higher than Mähne. She can also jump farther by taunting in mid-air and has a dodge roll technique.\n\nKyōsei Kankei: A very shy young adult teen girl who accidentally got her hair possessed and merged with a demon girl named Kotsída who is known by her kind for her long hair and incredible power, she was trying to escape Musafif Alshaer. Both her and Kotsída decided to become friends that can benefit off each other. Kotsída feeds off the power stored in her hair, while in return she helps her win the brush in the tournament. Her fighting style is more inspired by JoJo HFTF stand users gameplay style, being both a stance and puppet fighter with a few moves inspired by Filia, Venom, etc.\n\nMétallique Coiffeuse: A robotic girl built to be as close to human as possible and is still learning. She was made to be a hair care stylist and was given long hair that is just like the real deal, even being able to grow it out quickly so she can try different hairstyles out on herself of varying length. She has a bunch of hair care based attacks and can even use chemicals to weaken her opponents hair attacks in various ways.\n\nBosses who would need to be balanced for playable use\n\nMusafif Alshaer: An ancient demonic monster posing as a professional hairstylist. Has an insatiable desire to cut and/or shave long haired women that whenever she can because she feeds off the magical power and memories stored in the hair. Because she’s the one responsible for styling most of the fighters hair to make sure they’re all untangled, she fights like a composite character with attacks from almost all the playable fighters (With the exception of Tressé Perruque). Her fight is very easy due to her being a straightforward fighter who tends to tunnel vision, she also has many attacks based on her hair stylist nature taken to an extreme thanks to the monster nature. Most moves are designed to weaken hair based attacks or outright cut their hair short temporarily.\n\nKami: The goddess of hair herself and the final boss of arcade mode. A very cheap boss reminiscent of the SNK bosses among others. Possesses incredibly long hair that she can control like tentacles and a plethora of magical attacks like a screen clearing magic wave, regeneration with a full meter, and more.\n\nFeel free to give me feedback, ideas for other characters, and more. Please don't take this super seriously."
lo1n98,Foraging Simulator,"I want to spawn in the forest with basic gardening tools. I want to learn where to look for certain plants when I forage, their names, effects, if their edible etc I also think it'd be fun to make recipes like teas, healing aloe balms etc. You could get crazy realistic and informative with it if you wanted to and I would be all here for it. I would like to be able to actually harvest, make cuttings and plant them at my cottage or grow a whole new food forest that's made up of native flora and is cohesive with the animal life."
lnvg6q,Slavery/Civil war as the forefront of a game?,"I'm just throwing this out there but I have never seen a true successful intepretation of slavery in a video game. If I were to make a game, all the countries would be made up but continue to have some of the timelines and events that have happened in the past in realtime. Slavery of africans would still be one of the events that is present in this alternative universe.  What would the opinion be on a game about an escaping slave roaming through a now ""Civil War"" esque world. There would be other elements such as creatures and other factions that rise later but that's pretty much the lore of the story. I'm just asking if slavery/the civil war as a background would be something a player would  have some interest in playing through. We can have a civil discussion abou t this topic without any hate hopefully."
lns17p,"Among us, but Detective show","Ever seen the Korean variety show; runningman or Busted!—\n\nThat, but among us style.\n\n♧I'm talking about little games that everyone plays, while there's a ""murder or phantom thief case"" going on in the background.\n\nGoal: find criminal or finish games\n\nSounds fun, right?  Let me know what you think."
lnnsuh,Need culture suggestions for a rpg idea,So I am working on a concept for a rpg where there are multiple fictional races with thier own distinct cultures. I want to have them loosely based on different cultures and mythologies to give them a more relatable feel. I wanted to represent maybe some interesting and obscure cultures that I maybe haven't heard about. So if you know of or are apart of a culture that is not common or widely known I would love to hear about them. By the way the different races live in all sorts of different areas a d climate so feel free to suggest a wide range! :) \nThank you all and I look forward to your suggestions.
lnlmyi,Killshot golf,"This is a turn based golf battle game. One player takes a turn trying to hit the other with their golf shot. If they hit, it's a ""KILL SHOT"" and the other player is defeated. If they miss, they are teleported to where the golf ball lands, and it is the other person's turn."
lnigb6,Just A Totally Legitimate Question,"So I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I absolutely love the idea, this gives people the ability to express their creativity without having to go through the process of making the games themselves.\n\nHowever, I do have a question about the people picking up these ideas.\n\nAre you guys/gals picking up the person along with the idea?, or just taking the idea itself and forgetting who came up with it? I have a ton of ideas I could share here and will probably be doing so in the future for other people to possibly use, but there are a couple of ideas I would love to be a part of the development of them.\n\nI understand just taking the idea itself if the creator has nothing to truly offer in development, other than being there, but what if they have some skills, just not enough to do it themselves? \n\nMe personally, I'm a creative writer and plan on learning some c# soon so I could help with both storyline/dialogue and hopefully some of the scripting eventually.\n\nJust some thoughts I had, what do you think? Should the creator of the idea be a part of the development of it? Or do you think posting in this sub relieves them of all rights to the idea?"
ln9z1t,First person jungel shooter,"So i had this idea for a first person shooter but you play as different amphibians in a temple/jungle area. Each race (Tree frog, rattlesnake, toad, gecko, ect) has different stats like health and speed, one passive ability like climbing or no footsteps and one ability you need to activate like a super jump or camouflage. You will be able to carry two weapons at a time and the weapons are far from normal. From snake launchers to a nut gatling gun I want the guns to feel unique. I want the gameplay to be fast sorta like titanfall with hyper aggressive game play. I like the idea of having the target be a ball that you need to take to your goal so 90% of a game is spent in high speed cases and bullet dodging trying to shoot down whomever has the ball. Of course making a competitive shooter is obviously hard for indie developers so this idea is one of the most unlikely to be turned to reality."
ln8jnq,An idea for a carrion style scp 106 game,"Alright, after playing carrion, I now have a need for more games of the style and I thought that the scp universe would work great with the gameplay style. (A dev with relatively good scp knowledge would be optimal for this)\n\nSo I think it would be really cool if it was a rogue like where you played as 106 trying to escape the facility. He would have the abilities described in it’s file, going through walls, causing decay and pulling people into its pocket dimension(it would be super cool if you could actually control the dimension and shape as you see fit rather than the kind of lame room with a few corridors in most scp games). Perhaps instead of gaining new abilities throughout the game(if you can figure out a way to make that work in 106’s lore be my guest) you could instead cause containment breaches of other scps, thinning the foundation’s forces out making them easier to deal with. The main way of dealing with enemies would be pulling them into your pocket dimension and killing them there, or maybe you could implement a way to torture them i to fighting for you(maybe if they already have knowledge of what 106 does you could simply threaten them into fighting for you). As far as a “health” system goes, maybe it could simply be like its energy, dying when it becomes too tired too keep going and resist the femur breaker. You could also regain energy by “feeding” on humans (how this occurs will differ depending on how detailed you want the pocket dimension to be)  I feel like recontainment would be a good “death” system in this game since 106 can’t really die. The roguelike aspect would be there for lore reasons, as usually after feeding 106 enters a state of inactivity when recontained, which would be plenty of time for the foundation to fix a breach. \n\nAny devs who are willing to pick this up, if you want more ideas I will provide them."
ln6uit,SCP game like X-COM,"So I got this idea while ago and now constantly thinking about it. So there global SCP coordinated attack and humanity fights back and funds SCP headquarters to hire bunch of  scientist, military personnel to research, study and defeat waves of increasing threads. So in core mechanics players should establish network of labs and do recruiting, base management, fight missions, mini-games like piloting fight craft to bring down breached SCP and later perform ground operations of capture and/or eliminating.\n\nI already thought about few design elements and more and I think more I like that idea. As for actual combat, it will be third person view for tactical moves, but actual combat ( shoot, throw grenade, cure etc) will be FPS. I may also decide to make this VR title. What are your thoughts guys?"
ln6nys,3rd Person Gritty Post Apocalyptic Freedom Evolving RPG,"I love open world games and the post apocalyptic genre. While there are a number of games that fit the bill, none of them feel just right. So here are just some things I'd like to see. \n\nStart by letting the player create their character. Use a gritty combat system similar to The Last of Us, put it in a open world designed using an engine like Red Dead Redemption / GTA, with a choice based system like in Fallout New Vegas where you can shape the events of the world.\n\nI like 3rd person for this because when you make a character it always loses value to if you can only see them in a cut scene. Customization of face, clothing and equipment to have a look you want only to rarely see it defeats the purpose IMO.\n\nThe Last of Us combat is what I reference because the PC and NPCs really are giving their everything to survive. That bottle on the ground, can be a distraction in the corner or a weapon, creative use of carrying capacity and crafting whatever you can to help you survive while every fight feels harsh and brutal.\n\nRed Dead Redemption and GTA are the open world I reference, because the world is always fun to travel. Horse, car or helicopter allows you to get from A to B with speed and the places you travel to, through and from are properly populated and react to the mayhem the player causes. The fallout games really lack here IMO because you go to the biggest city in the region and it will only have 20 inhabitants and your choices of travel are limited to either slowly running to your destination or jumping across the world with fast travel. Also, going based on the online aspect, co op would be amazing. Have your friend join into the same world you have been shaping would be a lot of fun.\n\nFallout New Vegas is what I reference for choice making, because you can pretty choose how everything ends for you and everyoneone else. You, the player, get to choose what factions you like and don't, who wins, loses, survives, flourishes and more. \n\nFor the RPG aspect, the player character itsself gets better as it uses different skills, but there is no level up, no notification saying you've unlocked a feat and no bar saying how far you've progressed with your efficiency. When you make your character, you choose a boost in a few skills and after that the player and character have to learn The more the character uses a skill, the more efficient it becomes. \n\nExamples: You go into melee combat often. The first time you try to parry an attack, the number/ types of attacks you can successfully parry are limited and can still possibly stagger you. As your character gains more experience using these actions, ""it becomes more natural"" and what might have just deflected the attack in the beginning will eventually turn into the character immediately following up with a devastating counter.\nReloading or clearing a jam in your gun, starts off slow with your character's inexperience. But after going through 100 magazines your character will learn how to do it more quickly and efficiently. \nDialogue choice will evolve with how many people you talk to and your reputation, giving the player more choices of what to say depending on how practiced they are in dealing with others, so that as the player feels more confident in the world the character also reflects that. \nBartering should evolve with what your character is able to bring in and sell and how much they buy. Reflected by vendors recognizing that they'd rather give better deals to the guy who brings in good equipment for sales and is likely to come back to spend more money at a time. Big spendor gets preferred treatment.\nUse similar leveling to enhance length of time the character can sprint, how much weight he can carry, how quickly he can scavenge useful parts from a vehicle and everything else.\n\nI've had ideas for story as well, but I just felt I wanted to write down and share the concept that has been in my head and I found this subreddit."
ln4vbk,(Licensed) Transformers Battle Royale in the same vein as the High Moon Studios’ Cybertron series,"A BR would be the perfect grounds for a Transformers game, given the methods of traversal, classes for the transformers, and the nature of what transformers do, scan their surroundings and adapt technology to their makeup. Would be a wicked BR clash up of Twisted Metal, Uncharted, and Battlefield.\n\nUsually BR’s have a gimmick to distinguish themselves, such as building in Fortnite, traversal in Hyper Scape, or Legends in Apex. \nBut the Transformers would be able to play all of these aspects up a notch and create a more distinguished platform for a BR experience especially if gameplay plays out like High Moon Studio’s Cybertron games where you can create your own Transformer Autobot or Decepticon and choose a class + Vehicle to play with.\nIn a BR you could find Vehicles to put into your traversal mode slot, and weapons to attach to your arms (I.e. A.A., infantry weapons, ordinance and covert weapons). A fully thought out combative experience and you’re already have a unique multiplayer shooter experience.\n\nJust slept in the idea last night and got pretty giddy about it this morning."
ln2uk3,Looking for a twist game mechanic for three-in-libe type of games,"I had and idea for a three in line type game, but kinda didn't worked out.\n\ni thought instead the regular candy/fruit/gems/etc.. use 'elements' as water, air, fire, electricity, metal, etc.., and once you make a line of 3 or more, these elements could interact with the other elements around,\n\nLet's say fire make water air (steam), so you change make a longer line of air elements, another example it's electricity, a line of electricity can interact with water or metal, if there is another electricity element around the water or the metal elements it can disappear nearby electricity elements.\n\nBut the problem is how could the other elements could interact with everything else?\n\ni thought something like air can put out fire without the need of have other 2 fire elements around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeed opinions if this game mechanic is interesting/ could be fun."
lcra4i,VR Story Driven Drama (you've lost your ability to speak),"VR, Life like, real life situations, telling a story of back stabbing, treachery. This is not a traditional game, where you kill or have an ultimate goal, but there would be a great story, antagonist, and navigate a different kind of game likely more geared towards adults. Keywords here are immersion. \n\nWho knows, you could rip off some daytime TV drama - and play something out, where you have to communicate without speaking (or sign language) - so that the gameplay and vr feels natural and immersive.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a good plot.. man that would be dope AF.    \n\n\nI needed to get that out of my brain, hopefully this is allowed to post, if not that was my attempt.  I want to PLAY this game, not make it lol"

lcpc0y,Partial possession,"You're a newly born imp who has a dream of rising through the ranks of the demon lords to become the ruler of hell. As an imp, you have the inate ability to posses others to do your dirty work. However, because your character isnt as naturally gifted at possession , the other imps and other demons regard them as the runt of the litter and are quickly disregarded and deemed husk fodder (food for the lowliest denizens of hell).\n\n The mechanic behind game progression is to possess different parts of an enemy in order to either beat them in a fight, solve puzzles or, once you have grown strong enough, possess them fully making them become a faithful servant who would die to make sure your dream comes to fruition.\n\nI dont really know what this could turn into but heres hoping someone can get in touch with me if they like the idea and can develop it into something amazing!"
lcpbzo,a good pirate game,"seriously. a realistic, non cartoony style game set between 1690 and i guess 1725, about pirates, that takes them seriously as the group of people that actually existed and had material reasons that drove them to piracy, without any of the silly sterotypes or strange supernatural elements. my initial idea is just 'let rockstar make red dead/gta but set in the 1710s in the caribbean' but then i did some thinking and came up with a cool, more indie friendly concept that could actually get made without an 100 million dollar budget:\n\nthe elevator pitch is this - FTL meets Crusader Kings, set in the 18th century. \n\nFTL in the way that you manage your crew when telling them to repair the ship, board other ships, fight people who have boarded, have them manning different rooms and the way you control your cannons. Crusader Kings in the sense that you have to manage your crew in the way you have to manage your medieval court in that game, making sure everyones needs are met, appeasing their wants and wishes and dealing with mutineers either in secret or in open conflict. \n\nCaribbean pirate crews often acted as a kind of rough democracy (sam bellamy, captain of the widah galley, once referred to his ship as the Widah Constitutional Republic), and trying to navigate elections and retain power and crush rivals could be an interesting wrinkle to add to the game. managing your diverse crew would be interesting as well, many of them were nationalist rebels from scotland or ireland, jacobites from all across scotland, ireland and england, or just regular ex mariners/outlaws from all across europe. if you mix too many different nationalities you need to make sure that the nationalities are represented in your officers, and that they can speak the languages of your crew. also, protestants might be averse to working with catholics, french might hate english and some whites might not be keen on working with freed slaves. the slaves had very little sailing experience so might take longer to become proficient but they make up for it by being strong and also enthusiastic at the idea of being part of a crew where the shares are equal and you are fighting against the empires, they will mostly insist that any slave ships are not sunk and their people aren't treated as cargo but dropped off at maroon hideouts (maroons were escaped slaves who recreated their african style tribal lifestyle hidden in places like jamaica and haiti). this unlocks more places to fix your ship and trade because it raises your affinity with maroon tribesmen but you can take the shrewd and morally fucked up option of selling the slaves and risking a mutiny on your ship.  \n\ni imagine two game modes, one is a sandbox where you just go around and try and amass a fortune for as long as you can, there are random events, every playthrough is different ect. \n\nthe next game mode is more in line with FTL. in FTL you have to travel across the galaxy while being pursued by a fleet and at the end there is a final showdown with the enemy fleet. In this game, I would like it if you receive word that the Royal Navy is heading to restore order to the carribbean and you have x amount of months to prepare. in real life, there was a fledgling state called the Republic of New Providence. based in nassau, it was a confederation of ships crews, with each captain representing their crew in a kind of rough outlaw republic. originally it was founded as a base for a rebel jacobite fleet but when the cause was crushed in scotland in 1715 they turned to piracy. in the game, your diplomacy with other crews would be all about consolidating power, pledging to be allies to the other crews, eliminating threats and gathering allies in the region. amassing enough wealth to bribe governors to your side, creating good will with the taino and maroon tribesmen and even drilling them in how to use guns against the incoming brits, sacking forts, arming and managing logistics for militias on various islands, taking the risk to attack the spanish as in the hopes of gaining more wealth and weapons and recruits, rebuilding old forts and furnishing them with guns to protect choke points between islands. basically an alternate history scenario where the pirates managed to get their shit together, ally with the maroons and other ex slaves and create a state out of nothing. \n\na straightforward AAA pirate game would be good too im not too picky. i just had this idea of a strategy/tactics game built off my alternate history fantasy that i got from reading a couple history books about pirates during lockdown. i dont think it would even need to be graphically any more impressive than 2012's FTL. please someone just make a good pirate game"

lcll20,Idle MOBA,"Not sure what filter to put it inder so ""dream"" as in ""i can't do this, but hoefully someone can""\n\nIf you've ever played a MOBA than you know the worst thing about it is people. I love MOBA's but i hate everything about MOBAs. My idea for a game is have a set up map like DOTA2 or LOL and as a player, you design teams of custom NPCs who you'll give custom commands to have them accomplish tasks. And y'know what, i hate MOBA's so much, lets make it a partial RPG\n\nFirst, you start with making 5 characters. Each start with 2 lines; a code or a command. A command is a prompt that the user can fill to have a character do something; ""prioritize..."", ""at....go to..."". Commands also allow for more complex immediate functions during the game, such as a player input to say ""go to..."" Which could run and then be turned off whemever. A code is an ability that a character would have like in a MOBA. They're basic, dealing a type of dmg (maybe based around 5 elements and each is good/bad against another? (Kinda like that)) and having a set type of hitbox; AOE, target, line, missile. \n\nAs the game goes on, each player defeats minions, champs, jungle camps, or turret shields and earn gold and gain exp. Exp can be spent on either more lines of code or lines of commands, or better yet, making each more complex with increased dmg ratios, dmg types, dmg, hitbox upgrades, complex functions, and more detailed or easier controls.\nGold allows for the characters to buy items, giving them new set abilities that cannot be changed at all. \n\nFights are 1v1, each controling up to 5 NPCs. Fights come down to who is better at watching the global fight, making sure everyone is doing what they need to do and can apply pressure whever needed.\n\nDumb gamemode ideas:\n\nFreebattle: go at it with randos\n\nCompetitive playground: like debating if marvel could beat DC, you take your own side, but Dennis keeps saying ""that's unfair"" so you both have an equal number of characters made and then pick your side qhile banning your opponents.\n\nCompetitive chaos: Dennis says ""well, if you have superman, i get batman AND Ironamn"", ans so you pick and ban either side's characters. \n\nGenuinely, i can see this as being super fun casually but also allowing for complex and innovative type of MOBA where you have free control and can do literally anything"

lck3ca,Deckbuilder using one or more decks of regular playing cards,"This is an idea I've had for a very very long time but can never really make into anything fun, I know absolutely nothing about making games and this might be dumb but the idea is essentially a deck builder like Ascension or Slay the spire but with nothing but a deck of cards maybe 2 and maybe pen/paper. Lmk if you have ideas."
lcjz0q,Game inspired by Roadside Picnic/Stalker,"Hey folks. I'm a programmer and intend on making this game later this year but wanted to see what people think of the idea.\n\nRoadside Picnic is a sci-fi novel about The Zone, an area where strange and dangerous anomalies occur due to aliens suddenly visiting and leaving. There was a film adaption called Stalker which shares the name of a game franchise inspired by the book/film. The game has a heavy emphasis on combat whereas I'd like to make my game focus more on the anomalies and story and be combat-free.\n\nGameplay will be first person, you'll have tools that can detect and trigger anomalies but some can't be triggered meaning you have to find an alternate path, sometimes there'll be simple puzzles to find the safe path across. You'll have a map but it won't mark your location so you have to work out where you are to find the next destination. Story will be delivered through a codec similar to the early Metal Gear Solid games, and will revolve around finding a missing science team and discovering how the government has badly handled the situation leading to the events happening (still vague on what actually happens).\n\nI know there's not much to go on but does this sound like a decent idea for a game?"
lcj6m9,Battle royale with lava rising,"Someone said something about a BR where lava rises instead of a storm, but I can do that in fortnite."
lchw8z,Hitmen (a unique fighting game),"Hitmen \n\nHitmen is a game idea I thought about but never really took the time to go into details of what it would actually be. So here goes.\n\nHitmen is sort of like a cross between Gang Beasts and Fight Night.\n\nI picture this game for the Nintendo switch. The graphics are cartoonish as the ""Hitmen"" or ""Hitters"" are their own species.\n\nThe game is a fighting game focused on striking, dodging, and movement (Much like Boxing)\n\nHitmen are very basic looking. At the core they are a round head, a round body, spaghetti  arms with round hands, spaghetti legs with sneaker shaped feet. Very basic.\n\nOne really fun part of this game is the story mode which is like a career mode. You start out a nobody fighting your way through the ranks. From street fights to in ring arena fights, to eventually become Hitter world champion. As you progress you can unlock accessories/head shapes/eyes/mouth etc. Imagine creating a Mii but way cooler lol.\n\nAccessories could be anything from chest plates (for example; Green power ranger chest plate) to pants, masks, warrior face paint, and who knows maybe air Jordan gets wind of this and you can get some classic Jordans for your ""Hitter"". As far as Color customization, everything is color customizable from the body to the accessories (in a perfect world we would have a partnership with Crayola and they would provide us with they're array of colors lol)\n\nThe game play is simple, as we want this game to be as accessable as possible. However you can learn more complex combos as you get better at the game. Online play would be a must as you would be able to enter tournaments online and Hit against people all over the world. \n\nThe way to win a Hit match (fight) is to wear your opponent down with hits, but be careful not to use up your stamina as well. Find the balance between throwing, dodging and movement around the area. When you or your opponent is knocked down and can not get up at the count of 10, that person loses the match.\n\nAs you can see this is just the basic idea of the game I have in mind, if you are a developer or like this idea and have more to add please let me know! I have very basic sketches of what the Hitters look like before customization along with a picture of what my Hitter would look like when customized to my liking also, if you would like to see that let me know.\n\nAny and all feedback is appreciated."

lc0m9r,Help ... My Japanese language learning game is ... boring :c,"At the end of February 2016, I started planning my game,\n\n&gt;a game in which you move to Japan to study abroad and learn Japanese. You can also travel around the country to explore the country and learn more about its history and culture. The art style is probably going to be in a 3D low poly style because that's what I have the most experience with... For the travelling and to decorate your appartment, you will need money which you can earn inside of the game. (Maybe small multiplayer ellement so friends can explore Japan together). Kind of like a RPG. :p\n\nThat's the main idea for my Japanese Language learning game. I actually wanted to start making it some day's ago, but whilst stitching together all ideas that I've had drawn out so far ...  I ran into a major issue as many people probably have when designing a game,\n\n**it's boring**\n\n... I can't come up with any ideas for the game to be more fun, interesting, and more engaging so people will want to keep playing. So my questions:\n\n* How can I make it more fun, interesting, and engaging?\n* How can I make the language learning aspect of the game to be more enjoyable, effective?\n* How to add some fun?   \^\^""\n* What would you like to see in a Japanese Language learning game?\n\nSo far everything has just been written down on paper, without making anything yet, and I only imagined every piece by piece separately, but when I finally stitched all the ideas together, I realized that it feels kind of boring and empty. Just walking from location to location seems kind of troublesome after some time. Not having enough interaction and being very repetitive (School, game, travel, repeat. Basically what you would do when you really study abroad. It's fun in real life, but in a game, where most people can press the exit button very easily ... yeah not that great of an idea I guess \^\^"").\n\nI still love the idea a lot, being able to explore Japan whilst learning Japanese, and it would be awesome to make it into a really enjoyable, fun, and useful game to learn Japanese, but I'm feeling very insecure right about now as I can't come up with any solutions. :c\n\nAnother issue I started thinking about, what about having a lot of NPC's running around, but even with very easily customizable characters ... to write a couple of **100** different stories that NPC's can talk about will be a huge time consumer I guess \^\^""\n\nI know about this other game called *Koe* but the way Japanese is being thought isn't one of my favorites, I want people to actually be able to reach somewhat of an *almost* fluent level using my game \^\^"" Sadly, there aren't that many language learning games which I can use as inspiration, but that's also another reason why I want to make this game into a reality. XP\n\nIs this a sign that it's a bad game idea and that I should just give up and try something else or?"
lbzbfv,"So, I just thought of this dumbass idea.",Basically a multiplayer game where 2 teams fight to protect their king and kill the other leader. The 2 teams are Monke kingdom vs Lizard kingdom.   \nMain gameplay shit will be normal fps stuff but the kings will have their own set of abilities.  \nBased of course on Godzilla vs kong.
lbyfqv,Simple yet in my opinion interesting balck and white sidescroller idea.,"Sorry guys but I won't explain it with much words but rather Ill ask you to waste around 4 minutes and go to Youtube and watch Woodkin - Run Boy Run music video.(Song is somewhat decent too) For me it looks like an epic sidescroller. Boy with suit? armor and sword. Black and white for drama and suspensss. Some cool cutscenes you can film basically at home. I already wrote this down as and side project idea in far future for myself however because Im spending all my time on my first and main project that could take years when I try this. Maybe someone else could make it before me. I understand the copyright issue,but that can be worked around(we don't need to copy assets just the style and structure) or maybe if anyone is rich enough or a charmer he can make a deal with the group. Anyways what are your toughts about this idea?"
lbxt29,Playing against yourself,"The Game plays in two Acts (/Parts) the first one being substantially shorter than the second one kind of like an introduction. \n\n\nDuring Part A, you play a person in charge to find and kill someone. During the gameplay you get to learn more about your target and why you have to kill him. You do various mission that bring you closer to the target until you find him. That's when the second act start.\n\n\nYou find out that the real protagonist is actually the target of the protagonist in Part A. During the second act you play against the Organisation you were part of in the first Act.\n\nIt is just a concept and I don't really have any story or implementation idea in mind. I'm open for your creative suggestions.\n\nI don't believe that this is a project I could possibly finish but I think it is a fun and original idea and I wanted to share it with you.\n\nTL;DR: the game is divided in 2 parts. The character you play in part one will play against the character you will play in part 2"
lbw4bt,A sci-fi horror game where the protagonist is unemployed and his home is an organism.,"I got this idea from some inspirations, the first is **Scorn**, and the second was from a Netflix series called ""**Abstract**"", in the second season, episode 2 ""**Bioarchitecture**"", where an Israeli architect created a building made of organic materials.  \nIn addition to a video of a youtuber talking about ""*the legacy of the haunted house*"", about ""*how houses are organisms that are part of the human being and of our society*"".\n\n""Control, Anatomy, and the Legacy of the Haunted House"":  \n[https://youtu.be/mexs39y0Imw](https://youtu.be/mexs39y0Imw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, taking all this into account, my idea would be that, in a future where human beings started to use biotechnology to become immortal, to prevent the disposal of materials and the pollution of the planet, ""*taking care of a home*"" does not mean you just clean it or pay your bills.\n\nOur homes have literally become living organisms. Biotechnological objects that need nutrients to live. Failing to pay your bills does not just mean running out of energy for the heater, **it means that your entire house will go through a process of decay and death**.\n\nAnd well, in this game, after a pandemic that affects humans and biotechnological equipment, you stay at home during quarantine, not only for safety but because you were fired.\n\nAnd during that time, you do everything to survive and keep your home alive and prevent it from devouring you."
lbuas5,This ones a doosey (1600s pvp combat focused MMO),"Edit: This isn't designed for anyone here to make into a game or even a fucking mod, this is merely me ranting about my ideal game and what I had as an idea. I can't program, I will not ask for money, and I'm not asking anyone even attempt something of this scale. I needed to get this idea out of my head or I was going to explode. Thank you.\n\nAn MMO(RP?)G set in the 1600s.\n\nBasic setting: Earth, 1678, there are very few changes, however, many myths and tales surrounding things like mythical beasts and bits of magic are true, if incredibly uncommon.\n\nIt would be relatively grounded in role-playing as a start, having a relatively basic create a character system if still in depth enough to be utilized by those who wish to make certain looks. Choosing where to start within the places of the earth laid out for play.\n\nThere would be no leveling system, everyone starts and ends with the same base stats, as combat between players should be an absolutely primary focus, the ""levels"" players will receive do not boost stats, they merely give them different abilities to be used in combat. Examples such as auto lock on with flintlocks, or disarming moves, this way the combat doesn't get stale.\n\nThe combat would be an absolute focus of this game, getting hit should be discouraged as possible. For this reason, dodging, blocking, and countering (a timed block, all weapons have different counter windows, and certain attacks cannot be countered) are highly encouraged. Blocking and countering cant be used all the time but will always give an advantage over dodging when they can be. Dodging, blocking multiple attacks, sprinting, and later on 'rune spells' (discussed later) will all use stamina, which can be recovered, to keep stalemates from feeling far too often. Each weapon would feel entirely different and have strengths and weaknesses. Weapons would have different damage profiles, counter windows, general swing and combo speed differences, and a light and heavy attack. Combos from light attacks will slowly lose damage, resetting after a certain short time period without attacking with the weapon, but the longer the combo goes the more stamina it will take to block. Countering a light attack combo hit three times rather than blocking it staggers the oppenent for a longer period of time. A unique thing I'd like to add is a gimic called ""weapon precision"", weapon precision is a mechanic that allows weapons with high ratings to pierce certain types of armor, disarm more easily, and do more damage with consecutive hits, rather than the standard diminishing return.\n\nAll weapon classes would feel entirely different, each weapon class has multiple different versions, some examples now.\n\nOne handed sword: All one handed swords can be used two handed, for higher swing speed, lower counter window, slightly higher damage and break guard potential (stamina loss on block), and higher weapon precision.\n\nBroadsword: Absolute standard, middle of the road.\n\nCutlass (basket hilted saber): Slightly higher swing speed, and a faster counter, lower heavy attack damage and break guard potential.\n\nRapier: Slower swing speed, only capable of piercing damage, higher damage when connecting, much higher weapon precision\n\nTwo handed sword: These can be used one handed at the cost of no light attack, lower break guard, lower swing speed, but slightly more heavy attack damage.\n\nClaymore: Standard, the broadsword of the two handed weapons\n\nNodachi: Higher weapon precision and swing speed at the cost of a worse counter window and lower break guard\n\n\nRanged weapons; these would be different, having an aiming state and a quick fire (just firing right ahead without aiming)\n\nMusket: Power, range, but a long reload, and low armor penetration for heavy armors, along with needing both a musketball and some powder to load a shot, can be quickfired, but it still needs to be pulled from the back first. Requires two free hands, meaning any current weapon must be sheathed to fire and reload.\n\nFlintlock: Shorter range, accuracy, weapon precision and power than the musket with a much shorter reload and a faster quickfire. You can also hold up to 4 of these on you unlike any other ranged weapon. These are the only guns capable of firing one handed, however you must still sheath your weapon to reload.\n\nBlunderbuss: Exactly how it sounds, even shorter range than the flintlock, lower quickfire speed than the musket, as well as lower weapon precision, but it fires multiple projectiles, all doing the same as a musket ball, needing that same ammount of pellets to fire.\n\nBow: With lower damage than the musket, but higher weapon precision, and the second highest reload rate, the bow cannot be quickfired and must have weapons sheathed to load and fire, requires arrows, must also be drawn, the draw dictating the ammount of it's damage it will do and distance the arrow will travel, if fired as soon as the draw has finished (within .5 seconds) the shot will have massively higher weapon precision and a faster upcoming reload.\n\nRope dart: With a limited range the rope dart can be used one handed even when aiming, never needing you to sheath another 1 handed weapon, it is relatively easily dodged but upon hit it will do small damage to the target, stun them for a full second, and pull them closer to you. This weapon does not require a reload, but when used in too quick a succession will have diminishing return to the point where it doesn't even effect the oppenent.\n\nArmor; every suit of armor has different values but they fall under three classes; light, medium, and heavy, the farther you go the more stamina use, the higher all of your counter windows, and the slower your base move speed, as well as swing speed becomes. However, certain weapons won't be able to properly pierce heavier armors, and heavy armors get practical immunity from flintlocks, rope darts, (and bows that aren't time-fired) beyond very minor damage. Light armor gets easily pierced but gets quicker everything, from base movement speed to dodge along with getting better stats for break guards and quicker heavy attacks. Medium armor provides significant protection at no mobility, weapon precision, or counter window cost.\n\nNow, onto my favorite part, runes and the magic system.\n\nRune tattoo diagrams can be found throughout the world space in VERY hard to reach places, another single tattoo diagram can be obtained through specific NPCs of religious significance at a high price, such as a single scertain voodoo priest, a native American medicine man, a Buddhist monk, you get the idea. There are 6 slots for a rune tattoo, palm, thumb, index, middle, ring and pinky finger, all on the left hand, the finger tattoos surround the finger and go down to the backside of the hand all the way to the wrist, the palm tattoo covers all of it to the wrist. Each tattoo gives a different ability, none of which I can think of right now, but all would use a certain ammount of stamina, and require that you are not using your left hand, along with most having a certain wind up charge time. I FUCKIN ADORE this idea, and I was very proud to have it. Once you have filled every single finger and palm your left arm becomes covered in runic tattoos.\n\nNPCs, quests, and other story related things: I'm at a loss here man, I just wanna sail the seas and fight other people and eventually monsters.\n\nEnemies: From bandits, to the undead within the rare crypt, all the way to genuine monsters in places left unexplored, I'd have to talk for hours and have someone else help me brainstorm to think of all the unique monsters and even human enemies we could have from folklore and mythology.\n\nBosses: Think of a mythical creature, that, but in one specific very hard to get to spot. Sorry, I was mainly thinking about the combat here.\n\nBuilding and other such misc things:\n\nThis is mostly an afterthought, however I would love to see a ship building and base building aspect to be put into play here, some light rts mechanics at the highest levels of it, maybe.\n\n\nThanks for reading my relatively out-there idea, im sorry for wasting your time, and have fun programming or thinking on your own time, and reply with any ideas you'd like to add or what you'd like to change!\n\n-Your least favorite pirate loving dumbass, Cullen"
lbjfbf,"Academia, school as an adventure RPG","This idea stems directly from a personal feeling of being underwhelmed with [Pixel Art Academy](https://pixelart.academy/about) by Matej 'Retro' Jan.  I won't get too far into that, but the idea was that of a sort of virtual ""academy"" you could enroll in to learn pixel art.  I still like the concept, but the execution in this case left a lot to be desired.\n\nPicture if you will an adventure game like one of the classic [Sierra](https://www.gog.com/game/space_quest_4_5_6) or [Lucasarts](https://www.gog.com/game/day_of_the_tentacle_remastered) adventures.  In fact, the overall look and feel doesn't matter too much.  A [top-down pixel RPG look](https://www.gog.com/game/stardew_valley) would work out very nicely, as well as a [side-scrolling RPG](https://atlus.com/osl/) sort of approach, or a modern [first](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/) or [third](https://store.steampowered.com/app/666140/My_Time_At_Portia/) person 3d approach would be fine as well.  Effectively any approach that gives you a somewhat open environment to explore and traverse would make for a good solution.\n\nIn this adventure RPG, you're not saving the world from certain doom.  In fact, it's closer to ""Stardew Valley"" in terms of more domestic, laid back themes.  In this case you're not building up an overgrown farm though.  You've moved away from home in order to attend a prestigious university where you hope to master [*insert desired learning topic here*].\n\nWhile there **can** be a multiplayer component, a single-player focus is key.  The solo student shouldn't feel pressured by others and should be able to advance at their own pace.  There should be enough content and NPCs around to prevent the world from feeling empty even if playing solo.\n\nThe game should begin by allowing the player to create and customize their own character. This is important to give the player a main character they can identify with, as playing the role of this character will be a driving theme going forward.  As your own custom student, you have an entire campus plus some surrounding locations of interest to explore.  As a student you are given your own customizable dorm room, and you have access to several resources including various classrooms, a library, and places of social opportunity.\n\nLike so many other life-sim RPGs, gameplay revolves around a night and day cycle, and NPCs go about their own daily schedules.  As a student yourself, you do have a class schedule you're expected to follow, but you aren't forced to.  In fact by ""breaking the rules"" a little you may discover people or opportunities that you might not have otherwise discovered.\n\nYou will have some stats to maintain, but it shouldn't be too overbearing like so many other survival/life sims.  You shouldn't be compelled to eat/drink every 20 minutes lest you die of starvation/thirst.  Staying out all night to drink and socialize should have consequences, but maybe in the form of passing out drunk and waking up on the floor of your own dorm room late for class with a lower energy level.  You also have grades to maintain, and that's where the real meat and potatoes of the game takes place.\n\nThe game at it's core is a school/life sim, and the ""school"" aspect of the game will involve an actual curriculum.  Topics should be things people genuinely would like to learn like art or programming, plus supporting content.  For example programming will involve some math, and art would involve some anatomy and color theory.  You'll attend lectures, be given assignments with deadlines, and you'll be expected to turn those assignments in for points that count towards your overall grade.  Similar to how Stardew valley takes place in a cycle of seasons and years, Academia has a cycle of semesters and academic years, and you can repeat semesters as often as you need.  Spent too long on your social obligations and trying for the high score on one of the arcade cabinets at the bar in town, and as a result you're failing a class?  Not too much of a problem, you'll just repeat the semester.  You can take as long as you need, and repeat as often as you wish.  You'll never technically flunk out.  It's a nice, low-stress approach to learning.\n\nAs far as the school itself, the more fantastical and interesting the better.  The world should be interesting and filled with secrets to unravel.  It should be populated with a wide range of characters including fellow classmates and professors and all their various quirks and eccentricities.  You should be able to develop relationships with these characters by speaking to them, discovering their likes and dislikes, gifting them things, and attaining stats and achievements that cause them to take notice of you.\n\nThe game is ""complete"" when you've successfully gone through an entire curriculum with a passing grade and can attend the graduation ceremony where you are provided with a diploma.  From there you can retake the course work and aim for a higher grade, or go for a different major.  In fact, I think there's a lot of possibility to expand the game post-release with more majors to pursue, topics to learn, new characters, professors, locations, and events, similar to how Stardew Valley continues to get content updates post-release.\n\nTLDR:\n\nStardew Valley, but it takes place in a university, and instead of farming there's an actual curriculum where you can learn actual, useful skills, all wrapped up in a life-sim RPG."

lb8b9d,Vampire Metroidvania,"In this game the player will take the role of an ancient Vampire Lord who has woken up from a 300 year sleep to find his castle over run by 20th century scientists with an area 51 paramilitary security. You kept a retinue of lesser vampires in your castle who have been captured and are being experimented on by the scientists. As their Lord it is your duty to rescue them and drive off the trespassers.\n\nThe only way of dispatching enemies will be a blood sucking melee attack which will refill your health bar. Being the 20th century most of your enemies will be armed with guns. I want the combat to be about closing distance and dispatching ranged opponents with a melee attack through speed and stealth. The vampire aspect is to ensure the player can top off their health regularly, to give some context as to why the avatar is using melee in a predominantly ranged combat setting, and a reason why the  avatar  is so good at it.\n\nOther than the setting and combat, I am planning on a standard metroidvania platformer.

lb2ldr,A Game Mechanic.....,"Ok so hear me out....\n\nI understand that this could probably be the hardest thing to do in the world when it comes to programming all of the variables but this is a place for ideas. My idea is you take a fantasy setting that is primarily ran by magic, and the idea is that you have had gods who have been worshipped by devotees and those who went against them. But the main thing that I wanted to talk about was the aspect of abilities and the magic that you wield itself, more specifically on how to acquire such magic.\n\nMy idea is that instead of just having a fixed skill tree that, in my opinion, is very boring and too linear. So instead I wanted to know if you could take multiple variables or aspects of procedural generation and turn that into randomizing magic spells. Of course before hand you would have to choose say a school of magic like fire, ice, lightning, wind, etc. However, would it be possible that a developer/programmer would be able to take the case aspect of your restricted element type and anytime you explore an abandoned area or kill a boss it will drop a spell page that is completely randomized in how it functions, it's shape, it's overall effect, it's range, cast time, mana cost, etc. \n\nBecause this idea is probably the game in of itself, just being that level of procedural generation and the fact that I have no idea how to program it, the game itself would be fairly basic in terms of graphics and the world itself. \n\nI just want to hammer in on the aspect of procedurally generated spells whenever you acquire loot. Like how cool would it be if you kill a tough boss from a raid, and they drop a spell or two that could create say a column of fire that would knock your foes in the air for x amount of seconds and another spell that could say summon a weapon made out of your element which has different effects and size depending on the level of the spell. I don't know though, just a little thought."

laz2zh,Open World Age of Sail Game,"I keep dreaming of an open world game, set during the Age of Sail. My game would build on the ideas of other games. This post is more of what I would want for the game and if I had the know-how this is the kind of game I would make. Obviously it would take a lot of work but it would definitely be possible given enough time. Funding wouldn't matter if I did it on my own time and money but that means I would need, programming experience, 3d modeling experience, illustration and design experience, and the money for a server to run the online part on.\n\nGame elements would be inspired from:\n\nStellaris (Government, Online Multiplayer)\n\nNaval Action (Ship design, open world, and combat)\n\nCrusader Kings (Government, War)\n\nStar Trek Online (Trading, Online Multiplayer)\n\nI have played several and I see their flaws expressed by reviewers and my own review of the games. I would learn from their mistakes but also from what they did well. To make this age of sail game appeal to a broader audience, i would probably make it have a little bit of everything. Which would be a lot of work, but it would be worth it in the long run. Here is what i envision:\n\nIt would be set not in a specific time period but in a broad time range. The time period would look like id say around late 1800. But the ships would range from the 1400s to the 1800s. The ships would be detailed, they would not be low-poly. But not so detailed that the game requires a high end setup. This game should be able to run on a lower end setup. Same with general graphics. I know that's ambitious.\n\nSo the gameplay mechanics would consist of these elements:\n\nCOMBAT\n\n\-Combat would be similar to games like Naval Action, except I imagine there only being 2 instances in the game. In Naval Action there are 3. Port, Open World, and Combat. I only want port and open world. I want combat to take place anywhere, and at any time. The combat will also be much simpler, with there being a general reload time based on ships stats, certain ammo depending on what you have purchased, and then damage based on the ""pound"" of gun you have. Then just sink the other ship. Having combat in open world means guns would need to work and be able to fire at all times. This would be very nice because it could lead to more gameplay choices for players.\n\n\-Firing on same-nation ships is possible but makes you a pirate and so you will face the same risks and dangers as one. If you fire on an ally nations ships then that can hurt relations between nations and destroy an alliance. If you fire on other nations ships during peace then that would add to the War Risk Meter. Firing on Neutral Nation ships makes that nation more likely to ally against your nation. Firing on all of the above will also create a penalty in the form of a fine equivalent to half the value of the damage you caused. Hopefully this will de-incentivize friendly fire and keep things civil between nations, but leaves it as an option for players who enjoy causing chaos.\n\n\-First Person combat should be possible and should be done with pistols and swords of the era. It could possibly happen on the ship, during boarding, etc.\n\nTRADING\n\n\-The trading would be more complex than just ""buy low, sell high"". You would be able to sell anything you have. Your business would make products you could sell for a price you set. It would kind of be like the Star Trek Online market. Except things wouldn't be locked to a higher rank. They would just either benefit you or not benefit you. Such as buying a larger cannon for a small ship or buying marines for a trading ship you own. Marines would only be available if you were working for the government as a trader. Otherwise you would just hire mercenaries or an escort ship even. You should be able to hire other players as an escort, and trades with other players freely, in a ""shirt off my back"" kind of way.\n\n\-Traders, whether NPC or Player, need to be VALUABLE to a nation. So that a nation is negatively impacted if a trader is sunk or killed or captured. This means Player Traders aren't just expendable money makers. Your goods are taxed, that tax goes to the government, this money is spent by the treasurer, or whatever term they will be called, to build farms, shipyards, fisheries, more naval vessels, etc. Government business would be separate from your own business, so you would have to purchase your own farms or factories or even a shipyard. I would say a limit of 2 farms, 2 fisheries, 1 factory, and 1 shipyard. The farms produce 1 product of your choice, that collects at a certain rate which you can sell at any time. Same with the factory and fishery.\n\n\-You can also use the goods you produce and not just sell them. For instance if your factory produces hull repair kits you can use them for yourself if you want. And farms could produce food for your ship, that get used automatically on voyages, such as meat, alcohol of some kind, or grains. The shipyard will be a place to customize your ship, repair it, hire crew, and also equip different items.\n\nBUSINESS MANAGEMENT\n\n\-this would follow the management simulation that would appeal to players who like crunching numbers and developing a profitable trade business. Trade would be based on licenses. Licenses would apply to different materials. You can buy licenses or bribe officials for them (this includes players). This could get you fined a quarter of the bribe amount if reported by a player or NPC for bribery. You can earn them through favors as well. Such as requesting one from a government if you have good standing. They may grant it. the licenses wouldn't cost so much that you would have to grind for days to get them. And opening a business would be free the first time, for 1 business, and would also be based on how the economy is doing. The government might want to charge more for goods or licenses if the economy is doing poorly.\n\nEXPLORATION\n\n\- the map would become more visible as you explore. In the age of sail you wouldn't be able to see where you are. So navigation tools would be implemented.\n\n\-Id say Treasure Hunting would be a great exploration activity. Treasure would be different items of different qualities, maybe a bunch of gold.\n\n\-The map would probably encompass the entire world and major trade ports in the late 1800s. The map would have to be scaled in a way that it doesn't actually take a month to get somewhere, because that will drive away players. It would have to take 30 minutes MAX to get somewhere. and im talking around the globe.\n\nNAVIGATION\n\n\-Navigating in the age of sail was complicated, but in general relied on the stars and landmarks. That means the skybox needs to be accurate enough so that navigation of that time period can be simulated. Id make an option for revealing your position on the map. Because having to navigate realistically would drive away players who want an easier experience. So id leave the realistic navigation for the hardcore players.\n\n\-Environmental hazards were an everyday risk in the age of sail. This includes, high waves, stormy weather, shallow water, reefs, and collisions. These should all cause damage to a ship. That means a repair mechanic would need to be implemented, and would work up to a point. Too much damage would lead to abandoning the ship. It would sink and the player would end up in a lifeboat, if the ship has any of course. You then have the option to fast travel back to port or wait to be rescued by a friend or other vessel. If an NPC sees you sinking they should come and help. They might end up sinking too depending on what sank you. For instance if a hidden reef breached your hull then the NPC might end up running into that same reef or a different one. This would be a hazard more common near shallow ports. Battening up hatches would prevent flooding in stormy weather that could sink your ship. Forgetting to do it before sailing into a storm could cause flooding. If your repair team doesn't bail out water fast enough then you could sink. This would be more of a risk to smaller ships.\n\nECONOMY\n\n\- With trade and business mechanics, an economy mechanic would also need to be implemented. This would have to be able to fluctuate based on supply and demand And NPCs WILL contribute to the economy. So that if a player fleet blockades a port, this will actually have a negative impact on trade and the economy. I would want this to have a negative impact bad enough to cause a player response. But I would want to make it so that it isn't easy-peasy to just blockade a port, and ruin other players trading. Which will no doubt upset them.\n\nNPCs\n\n\-They dont have to be super advanced. They just have to be able to fight, and trade. NPC ships will range from traders to privateers. An NPC privateer will attack you depending on your ship class (They wont be stupid) ,whether you are a trader or not, and what nation you belong to. Privateers will be more common during wartime. None during peace, because obviously that could start a war. Navy NPCs can chase you down and search you for contraband or chase you away from their waters. They wont outright destroy you unless you cause them to think you are a threat. During wartime contraband searches will be more frequent. These will not be done by ships of the line but more likely by fast Sloops and Schooners. So you wont have a first rate pull up to a cutter and board it. Thats just unrealistic in general. Players will be able to outrun Patrol NPCs if they are fast enough.\n\n\-NPC Trading will be based on several factors. Their nation, what goods their nations produces, in turn that will effect trading destinations. Maybe Great Britain wants a lot of cotton from America, so they would pay more for it. That means the player can sell cotton to Great Britain if they have it or if they run a cotton farm. NPCs HAVE TO contribute. Because if they dont you will see low player nations basically die off and it will be like they are non-existent. NPC traders will interact with Players, on their won accord. They will trade with players.\n\n\-I want players to not be able to tell very easily if an NPC is also a player. And I dont mean by how smart they are. The most common thing that alienates NPCs is their contribution to the players. If they are utterly useless the players will see them as obstacles and targets to their gameplay. I want players to feel like the NPCs are just as useful as a player. Even feel a connection to them. NPC traders of the same nation will warn players of the same nation of contraband searches. I feel like this could be done by having the NPC ship flag down the player in close range and the player and NPC could anchor next to each other and have that dialogue. That includes trading. NPCs should be able to do everything a Player could. That way if a solo session is implemented, the Player wont feel like they have to do everything to stir up the action. NPCs should bring the fun and action to the player.\n\nPIRACY\n\n\-Piracy needs to be more complex than the usual, destroy ship x, take cargo, sell cargo. In my mind, pirate players will need a good ship for the job. They also are not going to have a first rate. Unless they capture one. Yes, if a pirate player captures a players 1st rate or an NPC 1st rate they get to keep it. But in general first rates are only commissioned to high ranking naval officers with enough experience. First rates are basically a nations status symbol. Pirates are not going to be able to buy them. Only capture. In general only civilian vessels will be able to be purchased by pirates. But they can use whatever ship they capture without restriction. Players can then buy guns for the vessel. I would say the biggest vessel a pirate can buy outright is a brig. But it will have to be modified for combat. This way players aren't getting ""ganked"" by pirates in 3rd rates or higher.\n\n\-Pirate players wont have many rules. Its kind of a free for all. Attack other pirates, attack any nation, Attack any ship. You would be able to use other nations flags to keep PLAYERS OR NPCs off their guard until you get close and then BOOM! raise the jolly roger. You would show up as a player from the same nation to them, which would be determined by a telescope only. That would be fun. That means players will have to pay attention to ships in their area. Because they could see a US flag and then not pay attention and suddenly they are attacked by a pirate. I dont know if NPCs should use this feature as well. Pirate attacks wont be common either.\n\n\-There will be a safe haven for pirates. It will just be an island called Tortuga, and it will only be visible to Pirates on the map. This is to prevent enforcement from blockading Tortuga. If Tortuga is approached by non-pirates a severe storm will gather and it will eventually sink any non-pirate vessel. Pirates who take refuge here will have to give up 1 item from their hold and a small share of their profits. For instance if a player pirate attacks a galleon and gets some trade goods like cotton and rum, the player can keep the rum and give up the cotton and vice versa. The fee would only be 100 gold. The item given up and the fee will automatically translate into an equivalent value in the Pirate Nations wealth. The pirates just have a council that runs things. They cannot declare war or build capital ships, but their shipyard can build bigger ships than a brig like a frigate, and allow full customization.\n\n\-To keep Pirate attacks low, all nations will have a limit of NPC pirates. 2 for developed nations, 3 for undeveloped ones. And this also depends on the economy. The worse the economy gets, the higher the chance a pirate NPC will become active. Players wont be limited because that's not a restriction id want. They wont have super strong ships, so Pirating wont be ""unstoppable"". If your Trader ship has guns, then I would say a galleon with cannons could protect itself well. This will make pirates target vessels that are evenly matched, have no cannons, or smaller vessels. A pirate can get a bigger ship buy capturing it. This means success is based on skill. Or greed. Just like a real pirate.\n\n\- A pirate player is a pirate at all times. They are only known when they are reported. So as long as you aren't reported travel wont be restricted. you can still travel to a port, but if you are known then there is a probability of being found out and you and your crew being arrested and your ship taken. Then you get Hung along with your crew, lose your ship, and have to start over. And that's if you make it into the port. There will also be a possibility of being ""found out"" while sailing to port by NPC enforcers. Player Enforcers may or may not recognize your ship as a pirate vessel. Players will be able to tell, if they recognize the name of your ship, which is proudly displayed on the back. You should be able to change the name of your ship, just like with the flag. That could keep you from being recognized and should also lower the possibility of you being found out by players or NPCs. This will increase Notoriety and Incentivize players to search for you harder. This means Player enforcers may board and search more ships and patrols around harbors may become more frequent. This is to keep player pirates from being ""unstoppable"". But in a way that's realistic and contributes to gameplay.\n\nENFORCEMENT\n\n\-Players or NPCS can hunt pirates. This will be based on known Pirates. Player Pirates will not be known unless a player reports them. Then they will receive a bounty based on damages done. Their bounty will be increased based on the amount of damage done. This would be determined by tonnage sank, what ship they sank, and the value of cargo. This means Player pirates could literally be public enemy number 1 for several nations. The reward for the sinking of the pirate player or NPC will go up, and that will incentivize Enforcement players to hunt down this player or NPC and claim the bounty. Player Enforcers are allowed to board and search vessels. They can board any vessel that comes into  their nations waters. Otherwise they can't. Same with NPC vessels. Thats only for searching a ship for contraband. In wartime those restrictions are lifted. Because the only times you'd need to board a ship is for enforcement or to capture the vessel. Enforcement takes place in territorial waters at all times. Capture takes place during piracy or war. There will be an option to board a vessel outside territorial waters. But this will increase the War risk. Any negative action done by enforcement up to sinking another nations vessel during peacetime results in a higher war risk.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\n\-The player should be involved in their nations politics, but only if they choose. This means that players could have different government occupations, such as a diplomat, who can negotiate with other Player or NPC diplomats to stop a war. If the war risk meter gets too high, a diplomat is needed. Or negotiate Trade by requesting certain goods or saying ""hey your country needs x, we have x, how about we trade more of x with you, you pay more for x and we call it a deal eh?"" Afterwards, the diplomat who chooses to buy more of x gets to make it official, in which case it becomes a nation-wide rule. This means that player Traders benefit from the diplomat Players decision. Diplomats basically help improve their country relations wise. This job is done by NPCs, unless a player chooses to be one.\n\n\-Treasurer (or whatever) spends the countries money on things that improve it. There will be a set amount of spendable money that when spent wont detract from a nations Status. It will be used to buy farms for growing products that traders can sell. It can also be used to buy factories, that produce a multitude of different goods, and more naval vessels for your country. There will be a certain limit to the number of farms, factories, and different vessels the nation can buy. Probably 10 capital ships, 5 farms, and 3 factories as a limit. The farms and factories will produce money every minute for the Nation and produce more items for trade at port. Certain goods wont\n\n\-Then their is the enforcement position. Players in this position can do different things based on their rank. The highest rank, Admiral or Fleet admiral get to do war stuff. If a diplomat fails to prevent War, the Admirals or brought into a meeting. Where they decide military targets to attacks, and what style to attack them in. Their is then a vote amongst the nations players on whether to start a war. This way it isn't just high ranking players starting wars. It gives everybody a voice.\n\n\-To prevent Big countries from utterly obliterating a smaller one, Ally elements would be implemented. If Great Britain decides to declare war on the US, then France and Spain may join the US as allies. That would be really bad for Britain. But it would be the same for smaller nations. They can be ruled by other nations, or just supported by them. That means if they do have war declared on them, they can request help from  a bigger country. A small nation would be more likely Ruled over by the British, while the US would more likely just support one. The difference being a small nation ruled over by a larger one will already have a garrison to defend it. and could put up a bigger fight then one only supported by a larger nation.\n\nWAR\n\n\-The WAR RISK METER would decide when war is going to break out. The meter would add up in percent due to actions taken by players. It can also be brought down by good actions so that this way, players will not just drive it through the roof and make war inevitable. The Admiralty can start a vote at any time, that way war can still happen at any time. The players of the Nation still have to vote on it. They can choose not to, but whatever the majority decision is, is what decides it. Smaller nations can declare war on big ones. Obviously a smaller nation would not pose a threat to a big one so the larger Nation will not need to take drastic or immediate action. The war goes on until one Nation surrenders or wins. Surrender option wont be available until probably 75% of total loss. Winning only requires the destruction of high value targets. Such as ports or capital ships.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\n\-Customization would be done in both a general and personal shipyard. The general shipyard would be available to all players from the start, and would have buy and sell options for ships. Every Player would start out in a cutter. There would be smaller ships available like a rowboat for sale, which could be used for fishing, and could also be put on your ship as a kind of lifeboat or excursion vessel.\n\n\-The Personal Shipyard would have the option to purchase upgrades, such as reinforcements, cannons, sails, etc. It would also have customization options like a paint tool. Which would have different modes like free paint and sectional pain. Free Paint would let you freely paint your ship unrestricted by section. Sectional paint would divide ship sections and let you choose colors for them, such as railings, decks, masts, etc. You can buy colored sails or paint them yourself. you can also buy designs for the sails as well, depending on your occupation or nation.\n\nSHIPYARD\n\n\- The shipyard is where customization, buying, selling, repair, building, and crafting for ships takes place. Default ships are sold, as well as a separate player ship selling category for selling ships you build. Building ships at the shipyard takes certain materials, but is simple enough. Wood, cloth, and stone are the simplest ingredients for building one. It requires more supplies and some other materials like iron for bigger ones. Different types of wood can be used and those woods also translate to stats and appearance because not all woods are dark or light. So unpainted wood will have the color and appearance of the wood the ship is built with. Repair is where ships are repaired after being damaged, or cleaned. After time barnacles and other stuff collect on the ship and this can cause drag in the water, so it needs to be cleaned. You can buy a copper plating for the hull. This will also appear on the physical 3d model of the ship after its bought.\n\n\-You can change the ships name for a fee at any time. Designs for the ship are also available, like engravings and different figureheads. I want pretty much every part of the ship customizable appearance wise.\n\nONLINE/OFFLINE\n\n\-Online should be persistent, and id want it to be configured so that it doesn't have to be wiped every week or something. There would probably have to be different servers based on country that way ping doesn't get too high for everybody. But I honestly dont know much about this part so its all up in the air right now.\n\n\-Offline is just a solo version of the game. NPCs should replace the functions of all the players that would be there online. So offline mode would be a lot like a RTS game.\n\nThats all I have for now."

lavhbo,Post-apocalyptic underwater RPG,"Thinking less Bioshock, and more Subnautica meets Fallout.\n\nSome sort of grave environmental crisis/disaster/alien invasion has occurred on the surface, forcing survivors into a variety of underwater settlements.  This would include a rich variety of NPCs, and a number of different factions you could align with and/or fight against, as well as the option to eventually create your own settlements and recruit NPCs to inhabit them.\n\nThe same crisis has mutated existing sea life and/or introduced alien organisms, making underwater life more diverse and dangerous.\n\nA number of not fleshed out concepts:\n\n- Some humans are deliberately genetically modifying themselves to be more adapted to an underwater environment, which is somewhat controversial, and in some cases has unanticipated side effects.  Players can eventually opt to take on the same procedures.\n\n- You can visit the surface, but only for brief periods, due to the risk of poison/disease/radiation/aliens.\n\n- You can train underwater animals as companions/mounts.\n\n- A highly effective form of seawater based hydrogen fuel cells are developed, which provide a sort of energy revolution, facilitating new technological development avenues."

lavee3,Butter Toast,"The protagonist loves to butter the toast the moment it pops out of that toaster, melting the butter on perfectly. Nice and warm bread, no reheating it, no popping it back in a toaster oven at low temp, just that convenient action of spreading butter on your toast and having it melt nicely, that keeps them going every day. The levels start off quaint and simple, the protagonist gets the butter to their toast from farther and farther away in the environment. Like candybox.io ramp up speed(real slow), and then the gameplay starts getting more and more intense and in depth, it’s clear the protagonist is a criminal who will do anything to get to their toast on time. Y’know like mirrors edge parkour style mechanics or like some kind of highly destructive fighting challenge, idk like a GTA V mission but just for buttering toast."
lavbvv,Project 1: The Ashter,"A game that take inspire mainly from BEWARE and ALIEN ISOLATION.\nThe game will be a combination of (driving simulator, rpg, story telling with different ending depend on the player action, survival horror, open world), from my view the game will give the player a unique experience, we can give you more detail but that would ruin it, the reason why i think it will be famous is because:\nFirst: it take inspire by many succesfull game before and we take some features and mod it\nSecond: the story is still being work on but so far its looking good and there will be twist in one of the ending.\nThirdly: the environment is very interactive, dinamic weather and lighting for ex when it dark some fog will cover the road and then when the orange light are on it will give you a strange feeling and when it day the fog will still be there but the white sunlight, i cant explain it but it was beautiful.\nFourthly: the AI are intellegence, some of them are very sensitive and there will be many enemy for example ATOMIC HEART, and you will also have a weapon, crafting and did i mention about great phisics, yeah it come with the interactive environment too, i wish i can tell you more but you know, the concept is being develop by BRICK BONES studio.\n\nBRICK BONE studio is an small non official studio (YET) create by a small group of people, im the project leader and i have some doubt about it, will it ever come out or will it meet the same fate like ROUTINE."
latqh4,A greek mythology based open world RPG,"Yes, there are some games like God of War, Assasin's Creed Odyssey and Immortals Fenix Rising. All of them are good, but not very accurate.\n\nImagine a game that is accurate to the mythology (or almost).\nBy accurate I mean that everything is based on the myths and legends.\n\nIn my mind, the game is set in ancient Greece. The map would be enormous and totally explorable. Every town, village, forest, river, island. Even the Underworld, Olympus, the Labyrinth, Tartarus or Poseidon's Palace.\n\nThe player can do a lot of things like explore, fight, buy or sell items, accept or delince side quests, gather resources, build, steal, make sacrifices to the gods, talk or hang out with the NPCs or just relax.\n\nThe main character will be customizable. The customize system would be quite detalied, similar to the one from Black Desert .\nBeside the appearance of the chatacter, you can choose their background. The background defines who the character is, and comes with various buffs and debuffs. You can choose to be a mortal or a demigod. Each one has different subclasses like if you choose mortal, there will be peasant, noble, philosopher, soldier, priest, adventurer, farmer, ranger or miner. But if you choose demigod, there you can choose who your god parent is (even minor gods), and based of the parent, you get abilities similar to that god (obviously, not so powerful).\n\nAfter you created the character, the story will start.\nI don't know what story but I have some ideas:\nA. The titans want to rise again and take revenge on the gods;\nB. Typhon has woken up and wants to destroy the gods\nC. Civil war beetween the gods\nPlease leave your ideas in the comments\n\nBesides the main quest, you can accept various side quests from NPCs like to get the Golden Fleece, to catch the Cerynean Hind, capture the Erymanthian boar, clean the stables of king Augeas, obtain golden apples from the Hesperides nymphs, to travel to Underworld and bring back to life from there a person, or easier ones.\n\nIn the story would be boss battles, mosly creatures. Medusa, the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, Stymphalian birds, Polyphemus, the Minotaur, Cerberus and a few gods depending on the reputation.\n\nThe reputation system will affect interactions beetween you and the gods. Some of them would help you, and other would want to kill you, based on your actions. If you piss off a god a lot, it will end in a boss fight.\nIf a god really likes you, he or she will give you special abilities and perks.\n\nThe death would be entierly something else than in most games. After you die, the character goes to the Underworld and is judged. If the judgement is positive, you respawn at the place in that you died with all the items. If it's not, you will respawn at the last save without any items.\n\nThere would be a lot of items and weapons, some with different rarities. Some of the weapons include swords, rapiers, various shields, hammers, spears, bows, Zeus' Lightbing Bolt, Poseidon's Trident, Helm of Darkness, Ares' spear, Ares' sword, Aegis, Hepaestus' Hammer,  Hermes' Flying Sandals, the Caduceus.\n\nThat would be the first gamemode. A second gamemode would be unlocked after you complete the story.\n\nIn the second gamemode, you play as a disguised god (you can choose what god and swith the gods if you want). You can do anything. Interact with anyone,  shapeshift, provoke quarrels, control people and environment, summon creatures, unleash your wrath on the humans or integrate into the crowd trying to behave as a human"

lapczl,Pong RPG,"Concept is fairly straightforward: Basic RPG elements (i.e. stats, equipment, HP, skills, etc.) but in a pong environment. That is, the player can maybe explore the map, but the battle scene will take place as a slightly more elaborate pong match.\n\nDifferent enemies use a different ""ball"" (or balls, plural), which, when they pass your paddle, inflict damage to you, but if you successfully bounce them back past the enemy's paddle, inflicts damage to them.\n\nSome examples of this might include:\n\n• Skeleton that uses a bone as a ball, which moves in an arc instead of a straight line.\n\n• Magma golem that uses one big magma rock as a ball, and when that ball connects with a paddle/wall at a high enough velocity, it breaks into 3 smaller fragments that bounce around.\n\nIn addition to different enemy and attack types (the projectile), there might also be different environments/terrains that create a unique experience when battling certain enemies.\n\nSome examples of this might include:\n\n• Rising water levels on a beach could flood the pong ""field"" (rectangle?), wherein the ball/projectile will slow by 25-50% whenever it travels through the water. If the projectile in question is a fish (in case maybe you fight a dolphin pirate?), then maybe the projectile actually moves faster in the water.\n\n• A dark cave where the ball is a fireball or glowing light that maybe flickers on and off, illuminating itself and its surroundings.\n\nFinally, there could be alternative battle types, or simply ""mini-games"" of sorts that the player might encounter on their journey.\n\nSome examples could include:\n\n• An inexperienced archer is attempting to win the gold, but they need your help (you control the target, and the closer to the center of the paddle the arrow hits, the more points they receive).\n\n• A clumsy swabby is trying to clean some dirty spots off the deck. Moving the paddle back and forth will sway the boat in the direction the paddle moves, directing the swabby as they slowly make their way across the boat to clean it.\n\nI hope this is enough to get the ball rolling (or paddling) and spark some ideas, and I look forward to seeing any developments you make, whether they are inspired by this post or not! 🙂"
lao5sx,Game idea/story that takes place in a small area,"Looking for a game idea/story that can take place within a small area or a few small areas. I was thinking something like an apartment. I'm trying to think of cool mechanics I could use or a story to tell (nothing long, 1-2hrs max). Any ideas?\n\nEdit: I have a few loose ideas but they're all over the place. One has to do with the player doing generic things in the apartment until the door bell rings and a package is dropped off. This package contains a key to a secret room with a portal that brings the player to other, small levels. \n\nAnother idea is a player that has to complete tasks in an ever changing apartment, where things change once out of view with a Stanley Parable narration style"
lam6aq,Reverse Skill Tree,"As the title may suggest, you start as a character that is at the equivalent of a fully maxed skill tree. But due to some event like a curse or disease. Your character is forced to devolve (lose skill points) throughout the game, forcing the player to make choices as to what skills to preserve, and which to sacrifice forming the main challenge. For example, the player may choose to have lower health to preserve the power of some ability. Enemy encounters may be initially easy, but as the player loses skills, they are forced to play with more caution.\n\nNarrative-wise the character may be initially cocky and self-absorbed due to their power, but throughout the game, as the character loses their skills, the character may undergo an internal, emotional arc loosely following the stages of grief. The character may end the game humbled and more respectful, perhaps offered the chance to regain their powers but instead, choosing to return to a family (or something similar) in which the character had abandoned at the start of the game. \n\nThe main problem with this concept (aside from being the opposite of the power fantasy) is, how will the player not be overwhelmed by the skills the character starts with initially and thus be frustrated. \n\nI am unsure as to which specific genre of game this would fit under as I believe the concept is relatively malleable as many games rely on the concept of a skill tree for player progression. Though this definitely would not be suitable for a multiplayer game.\n\nI started an account just to get this idea off my chest which has been constantly niggling in the back of my head, hopefully now having written this down I will be able to put it to rest. I have little experience with a wide range of games having only seriously played TF2, R6 and recently CK3 so sorry if this idea comes off as amateurish, deeply flawed or just unoriginal."

laj9x7,i had a game idea i wanted to share, so it takes place in the future and your an astronaut that got stuck in a ship in space and you have to survive in space and the ship for 128 in game days = 2 real life days and there would be a online version where your with a crew and other crews can attack you and steal your supply's and there would also be alien attacks and if you kill them you can get extra supply's and you can use oxygen to go out of the ship to get more supply's so if you like that and would buy it plz tell me
lahuna,RNG Manipulation,"The general concept of this game is that the main mechanic is ""RNG manipulation."" RNG is primarily controlled by a timer either in the game or in the console (as most of you know).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea here is that the in-game timer for the game is displayed on screen. The various levels would use RNG in different ways, like how ""Braid"" uses time in a variety of ways. (enemy type, enemy strength, &amp; enemy position just to name a few)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RNG would probably make use of the seconds rather than the milliseconds or smaller so that the player could control it. One idea is that it could be a race to the end of the level where the last 3 digits of the timer are the boss' health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlet me know what you think of this mechanic below!"
lafzcd,VR tank game,"There is an idea that has been bothering me for a while now. Why there isn't yet one of these? Imagine putting all of your boys in to a tank and then compete against other tanks. I think it would be fun to do stupid shit in it. The less important crew members like radio operator could be optional for player control. For an example instead of needing a radio operator, the commander would be notified on the map. Loader could be replaced with AI that has fixed loading times (loading times would differ with the ammunition type and the position of the tank). It would be very interesting, because your effectivity in battle is only limited by your skills as a team. Module damage would feel super real, because if someone is knocked out, someone else has to take their job or if you've got blocked sights someone else (who has working sights) has to inform you. Also repairing your tank becomes much harder, because you can't just jump out of the tank and fix your tracks... some other tank has to cover you.\n\nI think it would be really fun and also very competitive. Skill cap of this game would be insanely high."
lafc5z,Guess the image by sound produced,So it is easy multiplayer game. Each round the player is shown a picture. He then tries to make sounds to describe the picture (But he should not speak). Other players are presented multiple pictures and guess which coresponds to a sound. You could also do it that one player creates sound and others try to reproduce it while one of the players guess which sound is original.

laek70,Help me design a 3d platformer mechanic!(Read whole comment),"Do any of you have some cool mechanics for 3d collect a thon platformers that are as versatile as cappy from mario odyssey(has to be completely original) somthing that can be chained with the movement. Something that allows players to move around skillfully using a mechanic. Movement is going to be a core focus of the game, so it needs to “blend” in and be chained with the moveset.  Look at this video if u want to know what im talking about: https://youtu.be/z_KVEjhT4wQ. I already have an idea in mind, something similar to the copy ability from Kirby, but I dont know how it would be executed. Example: in odyssey, the capture mechanic is the ""core"" mechanic, and cappy is the way it is executed. That is what I am requesting. A cool way to execute a mechanic."
ladvyz,In need of a simplistic mobile game idea,"So... I've been procrastinating for what feels like an eternity. It is about time I turn project after project into a fully functional game. Here is the thing:  \nYou know when you go shopping and as you leave the house you think of all the things you need? Then as soon as you arrive at the store you COMPLETELY forget what you wanted??... Yeah...  \n\n\nThe same kinda thing has happened to me for months on end now in terms of a game idea. Specifically, it could be anything but I'd like some sort of story-driven game or maybe a side-scroller of some kind. Storyline/plot isn't a necessity and maybe a whacky, silly mechanic on a simple idea could be enough...  \n\n\nHit me with what you got!"
lacf72,A soccer game where each player controls a single player on the field,"There are too many games where a player controls a whole team.

la9e2m,Roundbased 2d versus game to be played by AIs,"I'm working on a framework where players can, with some effort, implement their own AI for the game to play against other players. \nHowever, i have not decided on a game yet. To keep it simple I'm looking for a 2D boardgame-like idea. \n\nThe original Idea was having a team of robots fight against another team of robots and they each have their own AI. But decided to not go with this idea due to complexity.\nRight now, I'm thinking of something like 2 Robots fighting on a chessboard or 1 unit for each player and they have to color an area by circling it, but it just doesn't seem interesting enough. \n\nIf you have Ideas or are willing to discuss about some simple, yet fun, concepts please post them.\n\nI'm also planning to use this project with the framework for educational purposes in the AI Bachelor."

la1d3g,"'History of mankind', simulation of all life on earth and major historic events with the whole earth as map. Frankly, I'm convinced that this is how we'll be teaching our (grand(grand...?))kids evolution and history. But how far in the future is that?","I intentionally put the whole idea in the title. At some point we will have the full model of the earth at each point in time, reconstructed to the best of our knowledge. Only major events will be reconstructed absolutely correctly, most interactions between animals/humans will be based on statistics, according to a given framework that was established by physical and historic reconstruction.\n\nThis is mostly educational: Whenever you are looking for a historic fact, you just go to that year and that point in time. \n\nYou could also have a second mode where you can play a character that behaves according to the time he lives in, not interfering with the general timeline. Or you can play God and see what happens if you interfere with the course of history, changing events based on models to the best of our then-knowledge and fantasy.\n\nCall me delusional, but I am quite convinced that, as soon as this is possible, it will be a thing. \n\nSo I came here to ask how far we are away of this?\n\nI know life has been going on since millions of years, and to model all the creatures and their statistically possible interactions is quite something. Also, the whole earth, it's a f'ing big map. Also it changes over the course of time.\n\nI hope some can answer me this. Cheers."

l9qvct,Groundhog Day in an Impossible Game,"Basically, you have an RPG that is pretty short in terms of total length; maybe about two hours long in terms of total, unbroken gameplay.\n\nHowever, the game is impossible. Or, at least, very, very difficult, Dark Souls-style.\n\nBUT, every time you die, you keep all the skills(but not items) that you accumulated in the previous runs!\n\nSo you'd start out and probably die a few times to the first normal enemy. Then you manage to kill them, only to immediately run into a boss, which kills you instantly. You kill the first normal enemy a few more times to level up, letting you get past the boss, to run into more normal enemies - that also kill you nearly instantly.\n\nThis pattern would just keep repeating as you grow stronger and stronger, and the enemies would start to react to your unexpected strength. At first they'll kill you without even commenting, then they'll start to say 'you're stronger than I expected', then all the way to 'What!? This cannot be!' and then, eventually, to running and screaming in terror.\n\nBy the time you get to the end, you're just god-moding through the levels, crushing enemies and bosses alike effortlessly.\n\nAnd then you get to the final boss - who disables your ability to savescum. You have to kill him for real, no backups, or redo the entire game."
l9qcsb,Idea for a character in a beat em up or the like:,"The character is based on Micheal jackson in the genesis adaptation of moonwalker.

The dances include the same ones from genesis, but also new ones with other (royalty free imitations of) songs.\nHere's a good list of what I'd want to see:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuNACAf6JObZGrKCXLzfBfvwd9rfBfKB"
l9q2jl,A game like portal But its a survival horror game,"I love the portal games to death and I also love survival horror and I think a game where the evil ai guiding you through puzzles is more threatening and ominous and in a lot of survival horror games there are already puzzles but now they are the main mechanic you can get some weapons but unlike in other survival horror games you really only get 2 or 3 ""real"" weapons like pistol shotgun and a melee weapon of some sort the rest of the game you really have to think on how to get out of each situation it isn't just shooting everyone or get the red key to the red door it takes a little more brainpower.\n\nSTORY DRAFT: If you want to make this game you don't have to follow this but while I was writing this post this is the idea I got for the story you are selected as a part of the A.I.R (Artificial Intelligence Research facility) Where a Human voice tells you to go into a pod to be ""Transported"" to the A. I human puzzle initiative but when you get there the walls are all kind of messed up now (Because you learn the A.I Killed everyone)  and the robot voice A.R.E.S (Artificial intelligent Resonant Electronic System) who is like hal 9000 who at first seems friendly and almost human at times but then reveals his cold hard directives when he deems you a logical contradiction because he thought he killed everyone and now tries to kill you with lasers tiny smaller robots that are like the lasers but now can move, some robots with extended hands that try and grab you and kill you and finally just some robot grunts who have a gun but unlike portal turrets actually have to reload.\n\nI think it would be really cool to have the objectives to be to destroy each of A.R.E.S's server rooms before going into the final one his main logic center which has this big pillar in the middle of the room that is his servers then he has lasers that you have to redirect into him so he becomes stupid enough so you can regain manual controls of the doors!\n\nThanks for reading all that stuff how do you like my idea??"
kws6t4,Can I get feedback for the plot of Fnaf Fan Game?,"This fangame takes place before even Fredbear's Family Dinner. The player stumbles into a strange funhouse - They have a hazy memory how they got there, not being an employee there. It's strangely vast and everything is made of sickeningly bright plastic. Each section resembles different outside areas; A garden, a farm, a camp-sight and scrapyard. The individual sections have its own humanoid animatronic, that matches the stereotypical theme. Like the farm, of course, having a farmer animatronic.\n\nFor gameplay, the players enter a new section each night. It's not like the main series where the player waits in one location and utilise their resources to seal off multiple enemies. Instead in this fan game, the player needs to sneak around the single resident animatronic and escape. They need to observe the animatronic's routine and finds creative ways to sneak around without detection.\n\nThroughout the game, two mysterious robots stalk the player from a distance, though never tries attacks them. Until the fifth night. The player stumbles into a new section with a countryside cottage filled with robotic parts. At the end of the night, the player is ambushed by the two mysterious robots, pushing a device into the player's head.\n\nThere, the player's vision suddenly changes and the plot twist is revealed. The player is animatronic; programmed to falsely believe everything else is artificial. The two mysterious figures are William and Henry as young adults and this cottage is their home.\n\nThe player is Henry's grandmother, who he escaped his troubled household with. The best they could afford was a small cottage since the grandmother was retired and Henry was in college. In college, he met William, joining them as a roommate. The boys were so distracted tinkering with robotics for their future business, they failed to realise the house was unsafe for an elderly person. Until one day, the grandmother snagged her foot on a beta springlock laying on the floor -\n\nShe collapsed on top of Proxy, the prototype of Henry's animatronic designs. (Inspired by a test model in Fnaf VR, called the 'Proxy the boll')\n\nThe grandmother's spirit possessed Proxy, which was how Henry and William discovered animatronics could be possessed. Fearing the potential consequences, the boys trapped Proxy in the cottage. Though she grew dangerously agitated, so Henry changed her programming, tricking her into thinking she was alive. However, it worked too well, making Proxy think she was the only living thing, breaking out of the cottage in fear. In reality, the gameplay was Proxy running through random locations, trying to avoid humans, including Henry and William in pursuit of her.\n\nAs an epilogue, it's shown how the grandmother's soul finds peace. Years later, Proxy takes a puppet-like role for the victims of Henry's faulty springlock design - Which costed the lives of serval employees. Once all employees souls have been put to rest, Proxy can finally move on herself."
kwqs5n,Monster Hunting Game,"So, obviously I know of monster hunter world, but I had a different idea in mind. It’s a 2D game and you are a hunter who wants to give the monster a fair chance, so you cannot bring anything into habitat where the monster lives. You have to scavenge for food and various materials to make traps to kill the monster. The monster is only susceptible to a few traps, however, and you have to study its movement and interactions in order to decide which might work. If you fail, if will get angry and probably kill you. If you die, you don’t get any money go down a level of prestige or something that is used to buy food that you can bring so you don’t have to scavenge.\n\nSorry for the long string of ideas lol. Any thoughts?"

kwgchf,A Great Idea for a Game: Geocaching + open-world RPG,"**edit: this doesn’t necessarily need to be an AR game, your phone could fundamentally be used as a birds-eye map/GPS, where if your near a player or enemy you can click on their dot and see what they look like in 2D. Give players the ability to design the looks of the items so they have more agency to paint a picture of the story they’re trying to create.\n\nGeocaching should mix its real-world cache database with an RPG game. Maybe it would be a separate app. Make it so that players can create a customized character with certain abilities/skills, and then they can explore the real-life cache world in forests, mountains, urban environments, bridges, etc and when they find a cache, they are awarded with a weapon, a piece of armor, a magical scroll, or a written note that guides the player along a storyline created by the placer of the cache. The awards could either be: \n\n1. Randomized\n2. Higher value if more difficult to find\n3. Customizable by the person placing the cache, so they can write their own narrative/story by placing notes into the cache, which urges people who continue trying to find the caches\n\nThe caches themselves then could be made to look like treasure boxes, swords, scrolls, notes jewelry, etc. so it reflects the RPG nature of the game itself.\n\nThe game could then have their own NPCs created by the cache-placer who you can interact with on your way to finding the caches, as well as enemies who can either guard the caches, or are just scattered all over the land, so players either have to fight them or sneak around them.\n\nMaybe if active players are in proximity to each other, they could either form an alliance or fight each other. \n\nSo basically, it’s like mixing Geocaching with Elder Scrolls/Skyrim/Mass Effect/secret agent role-playing/alien investigating and/or DnD. Use real-world objects and locations to create an open-world RPG that the cache-placers themselves can customize for the players!\n\nLots of potential here! Especially when you give people the ability to create designs/stories/items/enemies themselves.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
kw7l89,Feedback on a 1v1 gulag-style fighting game,"I've been trying to think of a game idea that can be played 1 versus 1, and I believe I've got a somewhat good idea going\n\n-----\n\nBest of three rounds\nMostly hand to hand combat, most weapons are things like bricks, pipes, and rocks with occasional firearms.\n\n    MOVEMENT MECHANICS:\n        Dodging: Smoothly shift in any direction to avoid oncoming attacks, at the price of movement speed afterward. With the right timing it can be used to dodge subsequent attacks from enemies.\n        Slide: Used as a temporary speed boost, mainly to get from point A to point B quickly. Can't be performed around enemies.\n    \n\n    ATTACK PUNISHMENT:\n    Each attack will shift the player in the attack direction, while also reducing movement speed. Should the attack hit an enemy, the player's velocity goes back and they can move, while the enemy's unable to move.\n\n    WEAPON DROPS:\n    Should a round go on for long enough, a powerful weapon (such as a revolver) will be dropped into a central point of the arena to move things along.\n-----\n\nThe last fighting game I created was a bit limp and wasn't very fun, so hopefully I can find some ideas for fun combat for this."
kw7gda,Orienteering - Folklore - Adventure - Hiking Simulator,"The orienteering from Death Stranding, but rather than facing world-extinction after avoiding ghosts and looters you instead face darks woods housing a coven of witches, werewolf bandits hiding near confined pathways and wendigos lurking in the darkness. Technologically the setting should be equivalent to the Industrial Revolution period.\n\nPlayers deliver resources between settlements, complete side quests to unlock blueprints for gear that eases their traversal and helps to build permanent structures, and slowly build the attributes of their character as they do certain actions. These core goals would largely not be tied to main storyline progress.\n\nStoryline progress could reward the player with QoL benefits, but would not gate pivotal mechanics or tools behind progression. Storyline progress could however gate the advancement of settlements to their next stage of expansion, so long as it doesn't negate the progress a player has made. I imagine main storyline progress being tied to things like eliminating nests of wendigos, clearing werewolf bandit camps or burning down coven houses. These quests could make the area ""safer"" so that more people inhabit the settlement, expand its borders, increasing the resource production rate of that settlement. These quests could reduce the occurrence of encounters with the specific enemy type that was eliminated, so as not to empty the world of threats but still have some impact on gameplay.\n\nPerforming basic actions such as walking, running, climbing, jumping, and even falling would slowly progress specific stats like increasing your stamina, strength, balance, jumping height/distance, and your ""stumble recovery"" speed, just for a few examples.  Players could also expand their capabilities by completing quests for various tradesfolk that reward blueprints and recipes for equipment and items that help them better deal with terrain and the dark threats in the wild."
kw5v19,Dark Souls with Survival Mechanics,"Similar combat mechanics to Dark Souls, but you also need to worry about things like hunger. There is some pretty heavy crafting, with less durable weapons and armor. There can still be epic boss fights, and you can establish bonfires as camps to rest up.   \nThe world would also have to be more open to give the player more options. There would still need to be relatively linear regions of the world, like classic Dark Souls, but the player could technically access any area of the map at any time. The survival mechanics take a pretty difficult game and make it even more difficult, so it would be good to cut down on things like farming and boss difficulty (health, damage, etc.)"

kvzcqa,Danganronpa Spiritual Successor,"I thought of an idea for a spiritual successor to Danganronpa (this is just a concept that may or may not happen in many many years from now or ever) and this got me thinking. How do I give it its own identity and improve on the mechanics of Danganronpa? So far I have is livelier text that whizzes by fast and in a confusing way (pausing time lasts for a limited amount of time until you shoot internal thoughts), stringing sentences together in a fast-paced bomb game, an eldritch effect that makes words even more convoluted and time goes by faster, scrum debates, panic debates, and one on ones. Lie bullets were unnecessary as lying isn’t a theme (plus it smudged up the story a bit). Aside from this, I still feel like there could be more done so that it isn’t called a ripoff or a clone."
kvxkcr,There should be a Mount &amp; Blade: Warhammer,"For those of you that know the Warhammer Universe and have played the Mount &amp; Blade games (progression, army building, sieges, battles). Imagine if developers created a Mount &amp; Blade fantasy game in the Warhammer universe. Playing as an Orc to plunder, ravage and spread WAAGH! Throughout the old World, or as a Human/Elf/Dwarf each with their own power struggles and Inter faction politics. The campaign would be a lot more epic as well. The Mount &amp; Blade campaign seems underwhelming to me, no story beyond the power struggles in the kingdoms. Bring in the Warhammer universe and the posibilites are endless. The gear system would be a lot more varied as well. With each faction specializing in their own weapons."
kvvui7,The Muppet Show (Minigame Collection/Party Game),"I was just reading some Muppets comics and this came to me. Basically, the game would come down to different ""episodes,"" which are a series of minigames based on skits from the show. Each episode could be based around a certain theme, and there could be a story mode where in-between minigames, the characters talk and interact behind the scenes. It could also have Stackler and Waldorf (the two guys on the balcony) as the ones rating your performance after each minigame. There could also be some sort of audience mechanic, where if you do poorly enough, they start leaving and you're left with empty seats. Thank you for your time. And if anyone else has already posted a similar idea, sorry, I didn't see it."
kvvhwp,Idea Opinion,"I have this idea for a game i want to make... Basically you have a random shape, the game selects two points on the shape somewhere and draws a line. You have to cut the shape between the points that are generated, the piece falls off. when you cut perfectly you get points, when you cut randomly you lose points. Once you get to the middle you get coins, which you can use to get upgrades(no purchases necessary), for example the points are slighly closer together, or the line is thicker. Any ideas for more spice?"
kvu8td,MMORPG Syndicate Wars,"Basically an online community of syndicates, cults, government and anarchists fighting over a huge city set in and based on the early Syndicate and Syndicate Wars games before EA bought it. So far it's a pretty flakey idea but it'd be cool to see the Syndicate universe made as an MMORPG.\n\nAgent players participate in third or first person as a citizen and may select one of the above mentioned factions as an agent or just go about their daily lives. When joining an organization they may run around the city and gun down their opponents or blend in and try to infiltrate opposing organizations as well as make personal purchases. When their character dies they are permanently dead then start again as a citizen on another randomized server. If agents go crazy and just mow down citizens (up to a 5 or more) they are expelled from the server then have to start again as a citizen elsewhere.\n\nMultiple players (4 maybe 5 or more) act as the 'leaders' like a RTS. They buy up properties as well as install its security such as auto-gun turrets, thicker walls, security doors and cameras then delegate the building with a purpose such as a consumer store, a church, an underground club, a governmental center, a research facility, arms manufacturing, cybernetic body manufacture and so on which may reduce the cost of items, increase the amount of time used to research items then create new ones or generate an income. The leaders also approve cybernetic upgrade requests for agents at the cost of the company, delegate them money as payments for work, approve satellite strikes, purchases battle droids, vehicles or heavy artillery such as tanks."
kvqrf9,Outlast fatal frame,Take the Outlast gameplay (minus the hide and seek style) and mix it with the ability to fight ghost using a camera. I think if done right we could have a really cool game. If anyone sees this and has stuff to add on I'd love to see how ambitious this can get.

kvntqp,Strategy/Manager,"Strategy game where you are leader, but instead of you controling each and every troop, you issue orders to your commanders/champions (depending on theme) and they would control armies depending on their skill/character/loyality so you can argue that this could be considered a more manager game that strategy.\nI think these game mechanics could allow some interesting features to be added like insurgency, familiy trees and succesion (and battle for it), traitors, ... I'm personally not a fan of linear storyline, but could even easely see some story added.\n\nI personally don't have time in my hands to make game of this scale, but my hope is that maybe someone else picks this up and considering how many additional features you can add and that lately there hasn't been any memorable strategy game (that do not focus on multiplayer aspect), this idea has really great potential IMO, what you think?"
kvn5tz,Why is there no coop focused games which are like Day Z but where you don't get killed or shoot on sight?,"I was messing with my multiplayer game I'm making when I had this idea.\n\nPremise - multiplayer instanced open world where you are encouraged to play with other people not fight , when looking for supplied to take make to base.\n\nYour base will be a hub like world with other survivors that will also go out on raids, you can queue up with others at the gates to leave into the waste land together to gather resources or go it alone\n\nThe waste land will be where you collect resources like food, water, wood etc, there are I don't know zombies. \n\nThe coop element - you are all start in a hub world with venders, each vender will have an opinion about you, so if your just shooting the shit out of players they will start to dislike you and give you less money or resources when trading. if you work together with strangers you get rewarded with better loot, trades etc. \n\nJust an idea I would like to share."
kvlwyc,Chemistry/Physics game,"I would imagine the player having an open book in front of them, a textbook filled with equations, elements, and a couple examples with what they can do with these tools. \n\nThe only things that they can spawn would be a whiteboard, pencils, notebooks, a computer, a map, a watch(coordinates, time, measurement, recorder, or flashlight) and a floating TV. These would be near essential tools depending on how the player would like to play. Ex. As the player could be playing a video of Veritasium while they perform their own lab in front of them. \n\nNow, how is one supposed to create when they can’t spawn in materials? I’d have them venture for it like in Minecraft, perhaps not survive but thrive in creation and development. There would be basic measurements for nature and perhaps you can use the watch as a teleportation device to get to certain places for materials, maybe borrowing things from the school (in game of course).\n\nWith the setup of the game, what would be the goals? I think finding notebooks of physicians would be one for physics and finding all elements and a note to be discovered for when you find each element to teach the player who the first person to find that element was and possibly hints to what they might’ve done used the materials for.\n\nOf course there’s plentiful that I have in mind that could be added, but I wouldn’t want to lose your interest through my perspective.\n\nExtras/Uneeded:\n\nI’ve always dreamt of creating an educational video game. But this one, I don’t want it to have that dreadful name to it. Of course though, I can’t work on many projects right now since I still have to deal with high school for a while, but I’ll be grateful if somebody would set a good example for this great source of imagination for those who can’t afford to test their imagination.\nThough if I could work on something like this with a team I could depend on, I would be elated to help study these fields and make sure that the game is the best it could be."

I'll handle the visuals in 2D, and even have a mobile version of the game.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are the traits, or elements rather, I want to utilize or restrict myself to:\n\n\*1. Some sort of procedural generation\*  \nCould be procedurally generated enemies, so each one is different with unique traits and makes for a new experience every time you play. Could be procedurally generated map, so that I can just design the generation once and there can be theoretically infinity levels.\n\n\*2. Single player, but utilizes global leaderboard\*  \nWith leaderboards added, it'll give the players some sort of incentive to be competitive and aim to grow shoot up in ranks. \n\n\*3. Must not require too many complex assets/graphics\*  \nAs I mentioned above, it's going to be a 2D game, and I can handle creating all the art myself. But I'd prefer not to make some 2d mmorpg with drawing characters and 100+ animations, and 200 items and 50 environment packs, etc.  \n\n\nAny and all ideas are appreciated!"

kv8c8h,What if enemies could have their weapons broken?,"I'm thinking of a system where you can increase the breaking power of your weapon to destroy an enemy's weapon. Obviously would be a win condition for a lot of them, but I'm also thinking that when their weapon breaks they are forced to fight with their hands or that they simply have super high durability."
kv7p9j,How I write my protagonists and antagonists | Plot,"So I don't do... Fantasy, or that wholehearted stuff - instead I do dark stories. The stories the whole community stopped doing in favor of the stuff they do, some good and some not --- that's just the truth. But to be holy honest all are just...meh, didn't add too much. \n\nSo. How I do my plots are grim and dark stories with mature audacity, like Agony (2018), that game was mature. An had a actual good story unlike the rest on here. I don't think too happy or sad, it's more on the 'both' scale. Don't have a happy ending, don't have a special character, don't give the character a plot armor or not be special. Have that character die even if they are the main character, have them lose an entire arm and not giving it back - in return making them disabled. I do like horror, psychological horror, cosmic horror, anything that isn't like a happy-go-lucky RPG. Like 'Death Stranding', that game had an amazing story, without giving any details. and I know you're thinking ""But Death Stranding isn't horror."" I know but it isn't a plot like any other boring plots, it's a plot that is fascinating none the less, I'm not just restricted to horror genre. I make my plots like a dark but not too edgy concept, it is hard but my brain can handle such process. Oh! And the story style I like was from the anime called 'School-Live' where the main character has a psychological issue where she thinks everything is normal, and people are still alive when she's in a zombie apocalypse, and the show still goes on with the Kawaii stuff transitioning to the zombie genre to kawaii genre, that is genius in my perspective. That's mainly my inspiration of genre, the rest of my little rant of course - to clear things up. \n\nAnd now the protagonist and others: So How I write mine (S) are...well don't make them important, I know that's the main problem everyone has here, make them a mongrel - don't make them plot armor, or yeah. I like to make them...a total useless character, the one I attempt at making a interesting one without making them into a total main character, sorta like a side + protagonist= Good character in my thoughts. If I give my characters a special ability I'd give them consequences for using it, like losing a...let's say... Their jaw for using it, I like to torture my characters, so the immersion will continue with the viewer."

And you have a chance to work those careers aka work in the ranks. \n\nHave a lovely day and if there is anything like this let me know, if there is something in works let me know or if anyone wants to make this let me know i could finance it easly"

kux2lh,"An simulation RPG that starts you with a randomly flawed character, and you are tasked with role-playing your quirky protagonist through quests in ways that will complete his unique character arc.","There is no world-saving main quest storyline in this game world. Rather, the story is what you make for the character you rolled. You roleplay them toward a goal and put them through situations that will force them overcome their fatal character flaws. If you succeed, they will have completed their story.\n\nUnder the hood of the game is essentially a character arc generator.\n\nThe game starts your protagonist with two randomized character flaws, much like the [negative quirks in Darkest Dungeon,](https://i.redd.it/1flaye2lqnd21.png). You then roleplay them in such a way to succeed despite their flaws so they have something to lose, hit rock-bottom, then play out their redemption arc to conquer their flaws once and for all.\n\nIf your character is a gambling addict who can't make friends, you have them gamble away their money and look for a party companion desperate enough to not turn you away. Then you have to go on enough quests to finally make them a friend, at which point you gamble away your party's earnings in roleplay so your friend leaves you.\n\nIn a sense, it's like if Darkest Dungeon and Dwarf Fortress had a baby that allowed you to take command of a single NPC to give them their own side story in the game's world."

kuu71f,A game where dying affects the story,"This is just a game idea which i think would be fun to play\n\nThe game would take place in medieval times and be a single player game, the games starts off with a party of 5 and the group of 5 wants to resurrect their 6th member which died many years ago\n\nThe goal of this game is killing bosses, not exclusively but it would be the games defining feature. in between the bosses the characters would travel through different dungeons and towns and fight mini bosses and doing quests. in this game characters wouldn't level up as a whole but rather they would level up certain skills kinda like skyrim. and they can collect loot they can use during boss fights.\n\nI want there to be at least 15 bosses excluding the final boss. During boss fights you cannot choose which character is fighting the boss, which motivates you to invest time into all of the group. each group member would fight at least 3 bosses giving every one a chance to die. \n\nDuring each boss fight there is no restarting, if your character dies during the boss fight then in the story he dies. If everyone in the party dies the story ends with all the characters dying. but if at least one makes it through the 15 bosses and gets to resurrect his friend i have an idea for whats to come.\n\nOne of the 5 killed the 6th and no one else knows about it. when the 6th gets resurrected and the 5th group member is still alive, the last boss fight will be the 6th against the 5th. its kinda hard to explain on Reddit but i think it would be a great twist for someone who got this ending, other endings might have similar twists also.\n\nAfter you ""beat"" the game you get 5 extra bosses unlocked and depending on the results of the final boss fight you can use the 6th group members as a character.\n\nGroup member ideas\n\n1 - Barbarian / brute like\n\n2 - Knight\n\n3 - Sorcerer\n\n4 - Wizard or mage\n\n5 - Archer\n\n6 - Previously assassin, now ghost assassin\n\nPlease reply with problems or ideas you might have noticed with my story or game idea, im very curious"
kusmq5,Looking for 3D multiplayer co-op survival game ideas,"Hi,My initial idea was a co-op Survival game with a D&amp;D-like stats system (with skills/ability checks).The graphics style would be low-poly and the perspective in First Person.\n\nI didn't really want to think about all the features at the beginning as i would probably start throwing everything that pops in my mind and ending up with an MMO (which is pretty unrealistic/really hard to make as indie).\n\nBut because I'm getting close to finishing the networking and starting implementing the actual gameplay and mechanics of the game I wanted to ask you guys if you have any ideas.\n\nThe thing I need the most right now is a goal that the player(s) would pursue, but feel free to share your thoughts and ideas about game mechanics that you'd like to see in this genre or an entire game concept, and if possible keep it simple because I'm not a AAA studio \^\^'\n\nThe amount of players can be anything from 2 to 100 (preferably not more than that) and the server management would be the classic player-hosted dedicated servers that appear in a list of a server browser inside the game (basically like Rust/ARK).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Share your first-person survival co-op game end goal and/or mechanics that you'd like to see."
kurc2a,Gameidea might be a dead end,"I started prototyping a little game (my first game) and don't know how to improve it to make it actually fun.\n\nHere is the basic idea I implemented so far: There are two players, a farmer who herds cows along a map into a barn and a UFO that tries to abduct the cows. \nThe farmer  basically has to walk behind the cows which will always walk away from him and if he walks too fast they will spread out and he has to lead them together to a bunch.\nThe UFO is basically hovering and can abduct the cows with its beam.\n\nI already implemented a level and the basic mechanics, there is only one problem: The game itself is quite boring. It is a bit cumbersome for the farmer to keep the cows together and lead them on the way and it is pretty easy for the UFO to abduct the cows. In some test runs, the UFO almost always wins, cause it is too easy for it (or too hard for the farmer, depending on the viewpoint)\n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to make this game fun? I'm almost about to throw this idea away because I can't figure out how to make it fun."
kupqkr,A short monster game about not being evil but people fearing you.,"I put intermediate because it depends on how you want to go about it. You could do a visual novel, sure, or you could go a more interactive route like Unity and make a first-person deal. You can go the overt or subtle route with the plotline, it's all down to what type of monster you imagine.\n\nThe first way, the overt, is more in your face and kinda a horror. You could go about your daily life, do a few things, but you slowly start seeing or hearing things. An axe in a tree, a glimmer of a person running by, you're basically being watched by humans as you just try and live your life, never bothering them. Possible endings include being killed, hiding in your lair out of fear, fighting back and giving them reason to hurt you, it's not very original but I just thought of it while typing so you can evolve with it.\n\nThe second way, the subtle way, is more of a stealth game or a walking simulator. You go around (I imagined a town or a city in my head), watching people, spying in windows, maybe taking a trinket or two. It's never proven you're a monster, there's no super powers or murder sprees, you're just someone who's people watching, enjoying their day (or night). You could make it so you NEED to avoid detection, you could have a moment where you run from pursuers, but the idea is ultimately that you're peaceful and curious, but still feared and hunted. Think Francoeur from Monster In Paris, when he's remembering how he came to be.\n\nAs I say, it's a simple game idea and short overall. If you want to go big, like REALLY big, sell on Steam big, you can expand the stealth idea, make it an open world game in a world hellbent on murderizing you just for existing as a creature different to them. But I'm just putting out the short version as an idea, hopefully it's interesting."

kukra0,2d Mario game,What if someone remade the first 2d Mario game and made it so Mario had all of his smash brothers moves and turned it into kind of a beat em up?
kuk73h,"An open-world game, similar to fallout and GTA where the main game mechanic involves punching children and making them cry.","I hate that I cannot deal damage to children NPC's in modern games, it is soooo annoying. Make it like Bioshock where you harvest the little sister's souls or whatever, so the tears of children crying from being punched or hit by weapon damage gives you points for upgrades. The adults are of course killable and hurtable as well, it just does not give you anything except experience points. I hate that developers always chicken out on this!"
kujlo1,I have a team and we need ideas!,"Hi guys! I'm in a team of 4 developers, right now there are 3 Unity developers and 1 backend networking developer. We are looking for some game ideas that have multiplayer features involved and is directed towards 3D. Were eeger to hear from you!\n\nThanks in advance!"
kuj7nr,Fighting game but choosing moves with machine learning,"Some time ago I tried playing Toribash, seemed like a extremely fun game but with the insane learning curve it has I gave up playing on the first two hours. \nThen today I saw [this video](https://youtu.be/PYylPRX6z4Q) (for speedrunning skip to 9:20) and I'm thinking about how cool would it be to choose ""analog moves"" from a given set, not predetermined but created at the moment, instead of setting up them in advance. Sure the technology is probably pretty young and fragile but seeing it in prospect that gives me the vision of much better fighting games with more realistic feeling and less fixed moves"
kuddjr,"A Battle Royale, but its Horde Survival with Teams of Players, like COD Zombies in an Open World","I just thought about an Idea and I think Fortnite has had Halloween Events similar to what you might think of when you imagine this Idea, but I will explain my Idea nonetheless.\n\nImagine a Battle Royale with a very vertical and open map, jumping between buildings, wallrunning, dash moves etc, first person. When I think of the movement I think of something a bit slower and more methodical than Quake, but faster than COD, recently played ULTRAKILL and really think something akin to that would fit well. All around the Map are Loot Chests, Random Drops of Loot and Horde Enemies who might drop better loot, you can rush through the map with your team of four and kill as much as you can. I imagine these aren't fodder zombies either, there are tiers of different horde enemies to kill, even some that might resemble a miniboss that can actually keep up with your movement, I think most enemies will be shooting since else they wouldn't do much harm to someone who can move as vertically and fast as the players. You'd have to kill some of those Miniboss enemies to get better gear. \n\nNow I think this will be a battle royale in a different style than others, since you won't have to worry much about other players, there won't be as many. They only become more problematic when the map shrinks and you now have to work around zombies and players to survive. Still think last one standing would be the most fitting, no other win condition like many battle royales tried recently. \n\nOne of my biggest gripes with Battle Royles and why I don't play them as often is that there is so much downtime that when action actually happens, you kind of need to get back into the groove. So having action to keep you on your toes all the time without the fear of people who might not be too skilled having a bad time because they just get killed by more skilled people who they werent ready for sounds like a good idea. I'm terrible in battle royales and I always die to some dude who literally curbs-stomps me because I wasn't ready. Making you always on your toes by filling the map with horde enemies and making players more noticable by giving them insane movement will give people more time to prepare and be ready for the next firefight. hopefully giving people who originally didn't like BRs for their action cycles a nice one to play."
kuccmy,Blast Corps Mod for the newest Microsoft Flight Simulator,"Remember that game Blast Corps for the Nintendo 64? It was one of my favorite games, and all I want is to demolish real life cities all over the world with a giant death robot, is that too much to ask? \n\nPlease someone make this."
kuauxb,You're a drugged out kid escaping a sex ring,"Hallucinations and fakeouts on every corner, controls often switch around, the perspective is constantly shifting against your will . Your brain is malfunctioning but you have 1 hour of in game time to escape the complex, which includes the building, the outer gate, forest, city, and finally the police station. Possibly you can free other kids which can help or deter you?"
kua6t6,"""procedural""(?) sci-fi cooking game","ingredients are defined by their tastes, textures, smells, consistency. think about the way we discovered certain ingredients pair well with each other because of complements or contrasts, and how cooking things a certain way will change their properties a bit! the game uses real-life ingredients, pairings, and recipes as a baseline; for example, we know apples pair well with cinnamon, and stuff like rice is neutral enough to pair with both sweet (for example, anko paste) or savory toppings. \n\nthe kicker is that the game might throw ingredients at you that are COMPLETELY alien; the names, shapes, and composition can be almost batshit. however, once you get a grasp of real-life ingredient pairings, you might find something sweet, crunchy, juicy - hey, that sounds a bit like a pineapple! i know that pairs with things like bananas or mango, what's the closest ingredient to a mango? as it turns out, some kind of alien meat product. of course, some ingredients might not have good real-world analogues and it might help to think outside the box.\n\nof course, it's not perfectly realistic, and there's definitely more factors than tastes and textures that factor into what makes a dish Good in the real world. however it can be a fun, silly exercise to come up with hypothetical dishes, and it has a lot of ""sandboxy"" potential. maybe you can make up new dishes to assemble in the real world! a game like this might fit a cartoony atmosphere on a spaceship or space-restaurant, to exaggerate the goofiness of the whole thing."
kua6ng,Looking for Mobile game ideas,"Hello there, my good friend and I are try to make a game and would like some help coming up with a concept. We both have graduated college for Video game Development, so we have the necessary skills to make one. We are thinking of starting of with a more simpler mobile game, as the ideas we came up with so far are more geared towards PC and VR. Neither of us really play mobile games but it seems like a good place to start to get our feet in the door. Any game with a 2D art style is a bit our of our reach atm, but please comment your suggestions! Thanks"
ku9v4z,Tactical strategy RPG with 2D fighter combat,"Ive had this idea since i was a child playing games like Shining Force and street fighter.\n\nWhat if in a tactical strategy game like fire emblem when you use your units to attack you are taken to a combat layer where you now have to react live in limited time, giving bonuses for initiating attacks, have support units with special attacks that require classic fighting game inputs to pull off, levelling system that opens up offensive and defensive options as you progress, specialty moves, desperation moves, combo chains, different classes and character specific classes that all have distinct playstyles.\n\nIve been looking for a game like this for years but it seems like a major headache trying to tweak. Worth it?"
ku9szt,FPS Hyperdeath-Match,"The idea is a multiplayer game where the goal is to get 50 points by killing other players. But, whenever a player dies, that player can choose to either get a new weapon of equal to or greater power, or to get more health/armour. Thoughts?"
ku7lpk,Shooter Training Course,"So I recently replayed Modern Warfare and just in general did a lot of military research and firearms, aiming practice. Anyways, I would like a game that takes Modern Warfare 1 and 2's training courses, along with influence of Hotdogs, horseshoes and handgrenades when it comes to weapon variety, SWAT (tactics, technology and potentially multi-player.) Along with various obstacles.\nAnd target practice course.\n\nOf course this isnt no triple A game just a fun little thing."
ku799b,US Special Forces (Green Beret),"So I just realized there is little to no media depicting Green Berets. Both movies and video games. I mean think about it? Likely the most famous groups are the Navy Seals and Delta Force. But Green Berets, while I am sure people know of them, they aren't really... popular? Cool? Ya know? So I am curious as to why that may be. But as this is a game idea of course, I would like to offer a more unique idea. I could tell you make a tactical shooter with green berets. But then your main selling point is their green hats. So a more interesting idea would be a game about running military courses? Maybe add different levels.\nSuch as boot camp, then you can move up to US Army Ranger training, and then Special Forces. \nCould mix elements of SWAT and Modern Warfare 1 and 2 training courses."
ku6qs8,Real Life Simulator/RPG,"Single player game.\nA game that takes place in a large city. Kinda like  Sims but it’s a third person RPG. You can have different jobs, cars, activities. You can have your own house, your own family. You can even be a dog. The game changes depending on how you interact with others, if you do crimes or not. Quests and missions are basically everyday tasks. You can buy stocks and companies. You can also choose which era you wanna be in, and the city will change depending on it. (Medieval, Modern, Futuristic, etc.)\n\nLevels are like age, every level you get up, you get older, unlock more rights, things like this.\n\nIt’s basically bitlife, but open world.\n\nI think it would be an interesting concept.\nLemme know if you like the idea."
ku67hm,A realistic shooter with fully procedural multiplayer maps,"Realistic shooter meaning a game along the lines of Red Orchestra, Insurgency, Squad, Post Scriptum, etc.  Start out with procedural maps that change every match.  Start out with wilderness only maps without buildings to make it a little more feasible.  Things like trees, rivers, cliffs, ravines, hills, fields, etc. could impact every game quite a bit.  This eliminates map memorization as arguably one of the most important skills and puts all of it on aim and tactics.  I realize this is probably very difficult otherwise someone would have done it by now."
ku5nf1,Surreal horror game where your mind slowly turns against you,"You've been a victim of brainwashing, your mind now split into two pieces. PS1 Esque graphics and a gloomy atmosphere, your other half takes control periodically and attempts to help or harm your journey, all while you blacked out. Later in the game, you've discovered you done something terrible while blacked out and your other half has planted traps to impede your progress."
ku4u1n,Space Station Mystery that you must solve before it drifts apart.,"The central idea that captivated me was that most space games don’t use the void of space itself as a challenge. \n\nThe game starts off with casual life aboard a research station. An explosion goes off, breaking the station into 4 different parts that slowly drift away. As one of the last Security Officers, you must try to solve the nature of the incident, and save anyone that you can. As the game goes on, the different sections of the station get further and further apart, making it harder, to downright impossible, to travel between them all. \n \nGameplay: \nFirst person, light to no combat.  \n \nChallenges: \n1. Repair mini games that take real time,\n2. Requiring parts / key codes from other parts of the station,\n3. Everyone *seems* innocent, but clearly there are 1 or more guilty members who will accomplish *insert evil goal here* if you don’t figure out the mystery, \n4. Fix as many escape pods as you can,\n5. Finally, get as many innocent people off the station as possible. \n\nThe idea would be to fill the game with multiple times more puzzles, emergencies, people in danger, and audio logs / collectibles than you could realistically do before everything drifts apart. \n\nYou would need to carefully figure out who you should take, if saving someone was worth the time investment, if you should risk going to a far-off section with your limited jet-pack fuel, and of course, who the evil intruders are."
ku4gw6,Game that evolves,"Yesterday, I was researching genetics, and when I went to bed, an idea came to mind...\nA game that evolves.... version 1.0 would be quite simple, but imagine that the website/wherever you get the game from decides to take the games code, and ""mutate"" it, basically change a feature/add a feature...\nThis would surely be hard to implement, but it'd be interesting, as after some time we'd get 2 seperate games, than 3, than 4...\nCrappy ""mutations"" would probably develop glitches or just stupid features, and thats where ""natural selection"" comes in, these version wouldnt be played, so they'd die out!\nGood versions would be played and would continue to evolve.\nI have no idea what the story would be, or if its a sandbox, or whatever, it's just an idea my brain came up with when I was half-asleep and my brain did the ""oh youre falling"" thingy!\nPlease reply with any ideas or improvements!"
ku2l74,star wars game idea,an open world rpg where you can customise a young padawan and let it grow through teenage years to adulthood. not cannon but still not too far from star wars. just an idea i thought was cool
ku28ab,Need help refining a very basic Stealth game idea.,"First and foremost - feel free to use this idea for yourself! Yes, I am also making a game based on this, but I believe each person has a different way of thinking and will come up with something totally unique.\n\nSo about 2 months ago, in November, I got this amazing idea for a game. The character is a computer virus and their main objective can vary from stealing some files, to leaking information, creating a backdoor entry into the system, etc without being spotted and terminated. The ""guards"" in the game is the antivirus. Different levels have you infecting different machines, and as such, have different antiviruses with different characteristics. For example, one machine can have a free antivirus while another could have a paid one, with the paid one having more security features, making it a potentially harder level. Stealth I have in mind is thief and MGS inspired.\n\nA neat little ""powerup"" idea that I came up with is as follows:\n-Before deploying the virus to the target machine, the player can customize it by adding ""mods"", which are basically additional pieces of code to ""powerup"" your virus (eg. a security bypass into a specific folder, an encryptor if the virus is a ransomware, etc). Each powerup you add, however increases the virus's file size and larger sizes makes it seem more suspicious to the antivirus or the user of the machine. \n\nSo my problem: I can't for the life of me imagine what a level in this game would like. What I envision so far is that my ""virus"" is a spider, controlled in third person. However, due to a surprising lack of games taking place *inside* a computer, I have literally no idea what that would look like. \n\nHelp?\nMaybe you have better imagination than me and can think of something, or you have some totally random idea for the setting or theme that is not even remotely related to mine, please put it in the comments! Thanks!\n\n\n\n**TL,DR;** You are a computer virus and your objective is to infect computers, steal info, etc. I can't imagine how this would look, so I have grinded to a halt on the production, as I need something to work off of to make this thing."
ku0kgp,Blacksmith weapon creator game,"So I have had this idea for a while for a game in which you are well, a blacksmith. I searched for such a game but everything I've found seemed to be not quite what I wanted. Most of the games I found were like ""Fantasy Blacksmith"". While such a game has some ideas that I would like to see in the game I have been thinking about, it also vastly differs.\n\nSo getting to the point the idea is that instead of a limited pre modeled number of blades which you ""craft"" in some kind of minigame, it takes a realistic turn and you start out with a block of metal you have to heat up and model using tools as a real blacksmith would, and then be able to test them, the shape, weight and model affecting how it behaves. Also it would be nice to have something like materials from which you can choose to craft and each would have different properties, regarding it's durability or how easy it's hammered into shape.\n\n I can see how problematic to program this would be from many points of view. Some problems I thought of would be about how to make a system that lets you model a hot chunk of metal with hammers and pliers, since I have not seen anything of the like anywhere but I think this is still doable somehow. Another big problem I thought about would be about how do you calculate the durability of the blade in such a way that a very thin sheet of metal would not be the best blade to ever exist, as realistically such a thing would not be able to cut anything cause it would bend before cutting anything. Of course everything else like sharpness, force and durability are also quite hard to compute but I think they might not be as bad as the previously mentioned ones.\n\nI don't know if this is hard to program, or it's harder to get something in which you have decent FPS but nevertheless I think it would make for a great game or if not it would sure be an interesting mechanic to implement into RPGs as it would make the usually boring weapon crafting into something engaging that it could focus on a lot more."
ktwjjp,A surreal (horror...?) nature exploration game with your faceless classmate.,"A surreal (horror ...?) half- open world half- visual novel taking place in a forest-y area that appears normal on the outside, but has restricted areas only accessible by performing a ritual and doing witchcraft. The deeper you enter the forest, the more surreal the area and its inhabitants become, your goal is to document as many organisms and landmarks you come across with your faceless classmate for a school project.\n\nThe forest is divided into several areas, each requiring a more ‘advanced’ ritual to enter. The rituals range from making cute dream hangers from twigs found on the ground to hunting invasive glass deer-like creatures THAT SHATTER when they die!!! There are shops where you buy food and items, many of them offering you tasks to do in exchange for money. The game takes place over a course of several weeks, every day you will receive a list of recommended tasks you should do, but the game allows you to make your own list as well. Because the forest you’re in is a dangerous place, you will have to stick with your classmate and spend (at least a little) time with him! The game does not allow you to run off on your own for longer than a few days because that classmate of yours has EXPERIENCE and does not want you to get killed or accidentally summon some stupid evil fairy.\n\nYou interact with only your classmate, some friends over the phone, residents, and the business owners you come across during your journey.\n\n**Inspirations:** Danganronpa (game mechanics) and livinthefuture on Instagram (art and game visuals) but really I just like exploring nature because THERE IS NONE in the place I live."

ktnv07,Ideas for a ghostly puzzle platformer?,"Hi, please forgive me if this post doesn't belong here, but I wanted to get some ideas for a game I'm working on. This is a 2D platformer (made in Gamemaker) where the main game mechanic is possessing different NPCs to traverse levels. Right now it plays a lot like an early Mario or Donkey Kong Country game - though I'm still debating whether to use overworlds or have all the levels connect a la something like Tomba.  \n\nI'd love to get some feedback on what would be a fun objective (collect things? List of missions? Save or kill NPCs?). Just getting to the end of each level seems a bit stale to me. Also, I don't really have a story idea yet. Come at me with your creative plots.  \n\nIf you're interested, please feel free to share any ideas (but only if you don't mind me possibly stealing them - you'd certainly be listed in the credits but I have no idea if/when this would be finished, as it's just a passion project of mine). Overall, it will be driven by platformer controls, but I've got most of that perfected already and want to focus on the puzzles and world-building.  \n\nThanks, and happy gaming my dudes."
ktncw1,"A game like Escape From Tarkov, blended with the setting from The Division. Throw in the zombies from DayZ for good measure.","You’re a leading member of a group of survivors. \n\nIt’s New York City.\n\nIt’s winter time. \n\nYour people are cold. Starving. Can barely defend themselves. \n\nThe zombies are a serious threat, but so are the other groups of survivors fighting to stay alive in the ruins of NYC. \n\nYour goal? \n\nInfiltrate different areas of the city at varying times of the day or night (your choice), gather supplies, kill enemy players if you come across them. Take their stuff if its valuable. Then, find an extraction point and get out of there with all of your valuable loot to build up your hideout and ensure that you and your people will be able to survive against this zombie outbreak. \n\nLike EFT, you’ve got two options: \n\n1. Scav run (Call it something else if you want), every so often you get to send out a member of your group of survivors. He/she will spawn in with a random set of low to mid-tier gear. Basically no risk in sending them out because it’s free and there’s no real penalty if they die. \n\n2. PMC run (Call it something else, of course), your main character goes out there with your loadout of choice. You have a secure container that you can store stuff in that you will keep even if you get killed out in the field, which you don’t have on scav runs. But the secure container is small, so you have to decide what’s worth going in it. Other than that, same deal. Loot. Scavenge. Kill. Survive, then extract. \n\nAll of the same mechanics from Tarkov (maybe simplify the bullet systems), just in a Division-type New York City winter setting with zombies. \n\nThe zombies are slow, none of them are runner zombies, ever. If they were able to run, this would force every player into a stealth meta of staying crouched and quiet all the time so as to avoid having to get into fights with sprinting zombies. \n\nNo, these zombies just walk. This keeps running around and making noise as you usually do in EFT safe and viable. But what it means is that over time those few zombies trailing behind you can eventually start to form entire mobs, which can become a problem. \n\nIt also forces you to stay on the move. Can’t camp a perch for too long, can’t sit in a room looting for too long. Quick decision making would become routine and thinking with your feet often would take precedent. Might just have to leave that guy’s dead body behind even if you didn’t get to fully search his backpack. \n\nThe zombies themselves would be scattered all over the map, and some of them would naturally spawn in as full-sized mobs, so a wary sniper can’t simply look over at a mob of zombies across the way and automatically assume that that means a player is nearby — they’d have no clue if the zombies simply spawned that way or if a player caused that to happen. \n\nAI scavs would also dot the map all over the place, just like in EFT. They regularly get into fights with Zombies. Everyone is fighting a three-front war, basically. The other players, the scavs, and the Zombies. \n\nWhat this means is that the sound of gunfire and combat all across the map would be a constant thing. Rather than how EFT usually is which is about 10-15 minutes of pure silent looting before suddenly hearing a gunfight pop off nearby or get involved in one yourself. No, in this game action is a constant so you always have to be on your toes. \n\nThe zombies themselves have a chance to drop minor loot, usually just a few rounds of ammo or maybe some minor valuables, things you can pawn off to traders. \n\nIf you die in a PMC run as your main character, your injuries persist after death. You can either wait out an in-game timer before your character is fully healed again, pay for medical services, use your own medical supplies to immediately heal yourself, or go back into another PMC run all fucked up from the last time if you’re really that desperate to get back into the action for some reason.\n\nWeapon selection would be a little more slanted towards primarily firearms of American origin rather than Russian, though of course some popular Russian weapon type exports would still be available, such as different types of AKs and such. There’d be a greater selection of common “civilian” type weaponry— the kind of self-defense/hunting firearms you typically find in gunstores. Bolt action hunting rifles, shotguns, sidearms that Americans typically open carry, etc. Would make the higher tiered weapons of military surplus type equipment more valuable. \n\nAdditionally, throw in an optional “Hardcore” mode— Where the winter weather becomes an additional threat to your survival. You have to make sure you’re dressed appropriately for the cold weather... but the problem is, the more layers you wrap up in, the slower your character is. But on the flipside, your pockets can also hold just a little bit more loot. Have to decide just how much you want to wrap up, because no matter how many layers you have on, the cold will be a constant threat in Hardcore. Can’t risk too much cold exposure, gotta come inside or find a heat source at least every once in a while. Limbs can take frostbite damage that slowly makes you less effective in combat over time. \n\nThe upside to it? The zombies have a hard time surviving the cold, too. Mother Nature is inadvertently helping you out, a bit. Freezing zombies in place making them no longer a threat, freezing their limbs so badly they fall off and can no longer swing their arms at you or even walk. \n\nHardcore mode, fighting off the cold at the same time as everything else, ultimately results in emphasizing speed over everything else when going into raids. Grabbing what you can and getting the fuck out of there before your character gets too cold to even be able to hold his gun steady."
ktml6i,"A relaxing city builder where instead of building sprawling cityscapes of skyscrapers and districts, you focus on growing a small suburban town.","This just came to me, and I'm surprised I've never personally seen anything like it before. Imagine City: Skylines, but scaled waaaay down. You're not building a city, your building a small, middle America town with good, simple people. \n\nThere would of course be your usual city builder elements, road construction, planning, deciding on laws based on what's going on in the town, and so on. However, I think the unique gimmick would come from a focus on individual characters. Every character would come with a simple backstory, a set of stats, and relationships to other characters. Think CK3 characters, but once again scaled way down. Less feudal, more neighborly.\n\nYou would assign characters to certain roles within the city, like sheriff, and watch them live their lives. In terms of minute to minute goals, i'm imagining a sort of random event type of mechanic. You might be faced with a big company wanting to buy out a whole neighborhood to build a megamall, and you, as town leader, would make choices that affect how those events play out. Different characters would have different opinions on each event and your choices would lead to new developments in their lives. Additionally, each character would have random events happen to them individually, though the player would only be notified if these when it directly impacted a characters ability to fulfill their role within the town. Through each character's page you'd be able to see a break down of their entire story so far. \n\nIn short, the game would take aspects from both city builders and the CK games and scale them down to simpler variations. The point would not be to grow or conquer, but rather to experience the history and story of your town as it plays out. All of this would be set to a lo-fi score and minimal graphical design to make the world pop and breath for a relaxing, story telling experience."
ktjp93,100 rando survival,"Main idea:\n\n100 random players are dropped into disaster situation (ala Disaster Report or Day of Crisis) and must escape the oncoming death i.e. tornado, rising tide, raining fire eruption, etc. Zombie Apocalypse?\n\nThe game area may be urban, rural, wilderness. Many paths to take, but each one has their obstacles. The fastest path would always be the path that requires teamwork. Can you trust your fellow randos to come together and put in effort to save more than themselves? \n\nCan you sacrifice a win for someone else's?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote:\n\nNot necessarily to be a core of a game but rather a game mode on the side of a party multiplayer game. Not enough couch games that go online. Fall Guys and battle royales have so much competition and sometimes a group effort of complete strangers to meet a communal goal hits the good feelings of humanity.\n\nWe need more PvE games that aren't MMOs"

kth79b,First person shooter but with gnomes,"Basically TF2 but with garden gnomes, it would either take place in a fantasy world or maybe in a human garden where you have to defend it from monsters or Other gnomes (who can be NPCs, other players, or even both) it should have character customization and unique weapon designs like grenades being in the shape of mushrooms and mines being potatoes or acorns. It isn’t really something I’m working on it’s just an idea I had one day and I thought I should post it here."

kt8bdc,Name the most addictive mobile game to you.,"As per title what is the name of the game that took you A LOT of hour of your life (on your phone), and why was it addictive (it can be the challenge, the level up, or the collection...? You tell me). \n\nI'm not asking for a new game, I'm asking what is your actual favest game and why so in order to create something as addictive (but with a new idea)."
kt7v5v,Titan Tipper (a cross between Super Meat Boy and Shadow of the Colossus),"First off this is idea is not related to Attack on Titan or any other IP. I use the word ""Titan"" for the fun alliteration. The basic idea is the player is part of a swarm attack of tiny soldiers trying to bring down a giant single enemy that acts as both level and antagonist. The player plays as a single soldier until they die, then spawns as the soldier behind them. They get to watch the ghost image of their earlier lives as they press their own assault."
kt69fl,Either a new game or complete overhaul of Civilization where you play as a soldier.,"I honestly think this would be incredibly amazing to see.\n\nEssentially, the game would strategically operate the same to Civilization. However, the difference would be on how battles are done.\n\nInstead of just commanding soldiers to attack other soldiers like some RPG mechanic, you physically place yourself *in the war they're fighting* as one of the soldiers you send out. There would be gun or melee options, like in some FPS, depending on the technological advancement and unlocked weapons of your civilization. (Swordsmen only have swords, infantry have old gun models, jets have modern weapons, etc)\n\nSoldiers would also be reduced to numbers rather than physical units. You garrison a certain amount of units at any outpost or city, which would also double as the amount of soldiers defending that specific area. Battles would start either by you moving your garrisoned troops to enemy territory, or by enemies moving their troops toward your territory. If the territory has no garrisoned troops, it is conquered instantly. If it does, then a battle sequence will start. The ""join battle"" option will be completely optional though, and you can either fight in the battle or just leave it to the AI.\n\nIf you choose to fight in the battle, you will be controlling one of your soldiers. Whenever the soldier you're playing as dies, you switch control to another soldier still in the battle (NPCs will fight aswell). Once all your soldiers are gone, however, the battle sequence will end. If you are on the *defensive* side, this means you will have lost the city and it will get conquered by the enemies. If you are on the *offensive* side, your troops will be gone but the damage done will still remain. I'm sure you can guess what would happen if you won the war.\n\nHowever, there is also an option to send reinforcements from troops garrisoned in different areas. The only catch, though, would be on how their time of arrival would depend on their distance away. If the troops don't arrive in time, and all your fighting troops die, you will still lose the war. If they do arrive, though, then they'll obviously just join your military fighting force.\n\nObviously, this would only be when it comes to military troops. Stuff like scouts or settlers could require stuff like military escort routes (which can maybe be sabotaged by enemy troops).\n\nBut yeah, overall, I genuinely would love to see this become either a mod or (most likely) an entirely different game altogether. Civ 6 is definitely not a bad game, and is far from it, but to some people (like me) it can become boring having the simplistic RPG combat system for what seems like a military-based war game."
kt4pbi,Just an idea for a 3D superhero game.,"So . . . It's a superhero-esque game, with simplistic 3D features. you'll be a flying superman that punches giants monsters and launch laser beams at them.\n\nYou will fight monsters that invade some kind of city you reside in. Some other superheroes with special abilities will help you fighting the monsters. Finally, after each round, you will fight big monster bosses.\n\nThe huge monster bosses will be funny and comic-esque. Your character will occasionally give speeches about freedom, love, justice, etc.\n\nAfter the speech, or after you defeat the boss monster, you will return to a house of some kind, where it seems that you live alone. You can interact with some things in your house. Just for fun, not plot changing. To end the day, you can sleep in your bedroom.\n\nAfter you sleep, you will wake up in a darker version of your room, with lesser items or some kind. There will be somethings that are covered in red auras. Your character will automatically run away if he's too close. There are some auras that are dimmer. If you proceed to approach it, it will reveal red shapes that seems to have monochrome patterns, some which are random numbers and texts, some are random drawings.\n\nIn the darker room, you must search for 'A glass of water."" You must then drink it. After that, you have to exit your room, and go to the 'Cleansing Room.""\n\nYour house will be a little darker.  And there will be one or two ""Demonic Presences"". They appear as glowing red humanoids. They move randomly. If your character if too close, he will run away. You must maneuver through your house to enter this room. \n\nAfter entering this room, a loading screen appears. And after it loads, you will be out of the room. You must go to the bed and sleep. While moving through your house, you will encounter the demonic presences again, and you must get past them.\n\nLater in the game, you will be rewarded with some key items, The Book of Light, The Astral Trigger, The Holy Water, and The Holy Fire.\n\nThere will be some bosses that are creepy and grotesque, and you must fight them alone. They will insult you, or say generally bad and depressing things. After beating them, you wake up again in the darker version of your house.\n\nThe final boss, which you will fight after fighting a super big monster as a superhero, is a doppelganger of yourselves. Insults will appear on random text boxes that appear frequently when fighting him. Finally, when the main battle is over, the screen will turn into a hall of some kind. \n\nThe doppelganger will give a rant about how useless and bad are you, and occasionally talk about ""Them"", which he will portray as two evil beings that manipulate himself and you. And about how sad and miserable you actually are.\n\nThe doppelganger will then give you three offers :\n\n1. To be free from your misery and achieve happiness : You will be instructed to take the Astral Trigger, point it at him, and then trigger it. The Astral Trigger is then revealed to be a gun of some kind. He instructs you to shoot him. After you shoot him, the screen cracks, and after awhile, it goes all white. You will then acquire the **""Happy Ending""**\n2. To purify the demons which control you : You will be instructed to pour the holy water through the halls, and after that, you will drop the holy fire. Lights and aurora will appear through the hall, and soon, the screen shifts into a white screen. You will get the **""Vengeance Ending""**\n3. To reject his offers : The hall will soon crumble, and you will automatically wake up in the darker version of the world. A cutscene happens, where your character will walk to a table, and turn on the table light. He will then proceed to read a book, and finally, the screen shifts and displays ""**Redemption Ending**"". \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nAlso, should this game get a psychological horror tag?"

kt0dmg,"An open world, Pokemon RPG where you can play as Pokemon you catch and battle in real-time","Don't have anything super detailed but I'm imagining an open world game set in the Pokemon universe. You create your own character and go out on your own Pokemon adventure, similar to recent games in the franchise. Though, when you catch Pokemon, you can choose to play as them and walk around the world as them. Literally controlling the Pokemon, as your trainer follows you around as an NPC. Each pokemon could have unique stats (some can run faster, some can jump higher, some can swim quicker than others, etc). If you need to fly to a location, you can switch POV/control to your Charizard and literally fly him through the sky.\n\nBattles would be in real-time, perhaps similar to Pokken Tournament. As you do battles and complete world tasks as Pokemon, you level up and unlock perks for that Pokemon. Maybe each Pokemon has their own skill tree.\n\nI was thinking there could be several different types of missions to do, some requiring you to play as your trainer, some requiring you to play as a specific type of Pokemon. The game could include a limited loot system where you can find potions, equipment, or even cosmetics (a way to finally give your Pikachu a hat or scarf to wear during its battles). \n\nI know it's ambitious and would be a very experimental title, but I could see it being a hit. What do you guys think?"

kd9glb,Looking to develop a concept for a roguelike hack-and-slash based around i-frame abuse further,"I've been harboring and polishing a game idea for a good while now, a little over a year. It would be a top-down, fast-paced hack-and-slash, set in a dumpy urban setting. The ideas I've had and tried to polish so far are as follows (exact numeric values are mostly kept vague, as those things would require playtesting and player feedback to fine tune properly):  \n\nLevels will be comprised of randomly arranged, smaller areas, but the stage itself will be completely open, so no doors separating these areas \n\nThe player will always die in one hit  \n\nThe player can only hold one weapon at once\n\nMost enemies will use ranged attacks and will die in at most 3 hits with base damage  \n\nActively aggressive enemies will be rare to encourage the player to constantly push forward\n\nKills are optional but are the only way to get rewards (I will elaborate on this further) \n\nHitting enemies will grant the player i-frames as long as their weapon is making contact with an enemy or a destructible object, and landing hits on enemies properly will deduct from the next swing cooldown, the amount increasing with each successful hit until capping out at a certain threshold \n\nAll projectiles will be deflectable with parries (I will elaborate on this further as well)  \n\nA meter that fills up with kills but drains over time, but will grant the player a long window of invincibility alongside drastically increased damage if full, with successful projectile deflections being able to fill the meter back up to the highest point the meter reached since the previous activation \n\nThe amount of enemies killed in the stage will add up to a percentage, all adding up to 100%. After the boss on the stage has been defeated, the player will be granted a weapon, increasing in power with every 25th percentage up to 75%, 100% granting them a choice of three 75% strength weapons. The clear rate of the previous stage will also dictate the difficulty increase on the following one, increasing things like enemy movement and shot speed \n\nClearing a stage will have a chance of granting the player a special currency, the chance being the percentage of enemies killed on the stage beforehand (which would be displayed on the screen at all times except while in a boss battle), said currency will allow the player to set up temporary checkpoints at any location in a stage that can save the player from dying once or more times, depending on the amount of currency fed into the checkpoint \n\nThese checkpoints will only work within stages and their corresponding boss battles \n\nCompleting tasks ranging from very general to extremely specific will unlock costumes for the player character that only serve a cosmetic purpose  \n\nThe player will collect cash throughout their run which is dropped by enemies, the amount being randomized within thresholds determined by the toughness of the enemy killed, which can then be spent in a shop in the hub area to grant bonuses for the next run \n\nAll cash not spent will be taken away from the player upon starting a new run (a la Rogue Legacy) \n\nThe shop will be upgraded with more options to choose from by getting predetermined landmarks in the total amount of kills racked up between individual runs \n\n\nThese are all the mechanics and ideas I have had in mind, honest and brutal feedback and additional ideas would be very greatly appreciated!"
kd6svh,Is there anyone Who can give me some ideas," I want to make a story-driven action / shooter game (Like Control or Quantum Break), can you give me some ideas for the game?

kd3nj7,Cool Classroom mechanic ideas?,"Hello, I'm currently trying to develop a concept for a story based high school game and I would appreciate a few suggestions for a closed off classroom environment as the grander schools mechanics have been roughly conceptualized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese can be a range of serious to jokes, and here's an example to gauge.   \n\n\n    Permission to go to x\n    \n    Player may ask their teacher to go to places such as a restroom, and depending on the plausibility of the request may be allowed, declined, or challenged.\n    \n    Challenge mode will consist of 15 seconds of rapid fire questions the player must answer to lower their teacher’s suspicion. Failure to do this will lead to the teacher declining."
kd1xk7,Dynamic AI,"Let's say that the game consist of a small town and in that town are NPCs. In a regular game they are nameless, have a few voice lines and really don't do much apart from either run away or fight you. My idea would be all NPCs would be given names, jobs and essentially have a proper life. The NPCs would have a web of relationships such as family members, friends, etc. They will have their own set property and live in that property like a normal person. Also unlike in games like RDR2 where killing an NPC simply puts a bounty on your head and decreases your rep slightly. Instead of just despawning and being forgotten about, if the body is found there would be a funeral and people who are close to that person would attend. There would be also a chance of the family launching a vendetta, forming mobs, attacking on sight or generally being pretty vicious to you if you come near them. It would add a lot of depth to games instead of just mindlessly shooting NPCs you would have to think about your consequences and the morality of killing someone, something games seem to have a difficulty in achieving. \n\nAnother thing would be that your actions would have an impact on this town. Injure the shopkeeper? The store will remain closed for several in game days or weeks until they return. Kill the bar owner? The bar could close permanently if they have no designated successor or if their heir chooses to sell the bar. In a similar token if you give $10000 for a homeless person you could see them later with a job and a house. In short whatever you do, positive or negative could affect the gameplay and how in this case the town would change.\n\nThough such a concept would be time-consuming and costly as well as increasingly the power needed to run the game slightly, I feel like games would be a lot more deep and the NPCs more than a moving cardboard cutout of a person. Games like The Sims, The Guild and CK2 and 3 all have various elements of this concept but implanting them in open world action games like GTA or Red Dead would make a much more immersive and interesting experience."

kcycue,Ghost Of Tsushima inspired medieval Georgia 🇬🇪,"I have been dreaming about this for quite awhile, which is a true fact and would be a historical game: about a 15 year old king who gets on the throne of a destroyed country, but despite of being surrounded by all enemies (outside the country and georgian lords too) \nThe country is fully destroyed and the boy rises the country from the ashes, wins amazing battles with outnumbered army, (55,600 georgian vs 300,000 unitied turkish armies!!) and becomes one of the strongest countries in the region. The people gave him a nickname of David the Builder\n\nLike really, Georgia has an amazing history and culture, music and traditions and it would be amazing to see it as an AAA game or anything that will rise its popularity, it is my goal to one day create or found a game based on this! So expect some questions from me, i will need your opinion about it\nAand you can check the video which is about Wine traditions and georgians history ([link](https://youtu.be/ihIJfKMTLp8)\n(If you watch it, please tell me your toughts about the music or medieval part!)\nThank you very much for the attention ^^"

kcojs1,"3D Pokémon like game, needs final touches","I posted on this subreddit a week or so ago looking for ideas for a game that uses the battle and play style system of Pokémon, except isnt monster collecting. \n\nThe idea was presented to have a game where the player collects “spells” and battles against other mages/wizards. Turn based combat just like Pokémon, thank you to those who suggested this to me.\n\nI’ve hit a speed bump. Pokémon was always one of my favorite games because of the personality that each Pokémon had. Being able to encounter them in the wild, battle with them, evolve them etc really made it work.\n\nHow can I achieve this aspect with the aforementioned magic idea? Spells don’t really have a personality and feel a bit.. bland. If you have other ideas completely then please feel free to share those also"

kchzwc,An Assassin's Creed game set in the communist revolution.,"I know that a lot of people dislike the Assassin's Creed series, and I get it. There are many things that the games fail to accomplish, and I know that. However, I have an idea for one anyways.\n\nHear me out: an Assassin's Creed game set in the communist revolution. I think that there would be two separate games. Not just two different protagonists, two separate games. These games would have different protagonists. One is a Templar, the other an Assassin. Please know that both of these games would be short, about the same length as Rogue.\n\nLet's start with the Templars. Your Templar character is fighting for communism, meaning they would be the one to win. Your character is similar to Shay Cormac in Assassin's Creed Rogue; they hunt and kill Assassins. \n\nNow the Assassins. When playing this game, you would be fighting the Templars and communism. Your character is hunting the Templars at the same time they are hunting you. The Assassins in Russia are being destroyed, with many of their members being killed. \n\nAnd both of these games are connected. For example, if you play as the Templar you will see the Assassin character in your playthrough. In fact, you would probably kill them. If you play as the Assassin, you will find and kill the Templar. However, the Templars will always win.\n\nThis was about the two different stories that I think this game could have. I will make another post soon about the setting and mechanics for this game."

From the controls to the story to enemy variants and functionality to detailed descriptions of the environment, layout, and character.

kcb99n,"A sandbox horror game (Co-op, Multiplayer, and Solo) A sandbox game that is only dedicated to horror","Okay. Hear me out, i’ve been trying to find alott of horror game that I can play with my friends. Now I know there’s many horror games out there but, there not exactly all multiplayers. I want someone to take this idea and create a sandbox game that is only dedicate to horror theme type stuff it’s like Gmod but, only dedicated to horror theme. Give all these people in the world with creativity a game to create their own horror map, this isn’t professional and all but I want to list the many ideas I have for a game like this since I don’t know how to explain much but, by giving y’all an idea of what I mean.\n\n\n1. Allow players to create and customize the look of their own monsters, ghost, and demons. Hopefully with customization and creation like this players can create their own scary looking creature with thier own unqiue looks. \n\n2. Players will be able to create their own map with in game tools and object for you to create your own unique map, you’ll be able to submit your own horror map to the public for other players to play and see your creativity!\n\n3. When submitting your own horror map you’ll be able to name it whatever you want, as long as it’s appropriate of course. After submitting your map, it’ll have its own number code in case other players had the same name idea as yours, so instead of typing the name just type the map number code. Players will be able to upvote and downvote your map, the more upvote the more popular you and your map will be. Which will lead up to your horror map being recommended to other players whose looking for a good horror map to play!\n\n4. When getting popular in the game, there will be a leaderboard of most popular players that has the most upvote on their maps. This way players can view your profile to see what other maps you may have created to go and experience your other maps, you’ll also be able to follow their profile if you enjoy the map they’re creating so that way you don’t miss out on their newest horror map. Don’t worry! You’ll also be able to search up other players and maps of course if they aren’t up in the leaderboard.\n\n5. You’ll be able to list different genre to your map. An example will be creating maps for only solo players, creating map for only multiplayer, and creating a map that can be both solo and multiplayer. You can also list genre of what your map is about like ghost, demons, puzzles, or a mixture of all.\n\n6. You’ll be able to create your very own jumpescare, and implement your own ghost sounds into the jumpscare I should also mention you’ll be able to put your own image in case you wanna go all the way into your map, draw or cosplay your own monster into a image for the jumpscare! Of course if it’s inappropriate like a image of any private parts then it’s possible to report a map and get it ban.\n\n7. The problem that a game like this may run into most is probably the fact that if there’s ever a real image of a real gruesome murder or anything illegal related it’s possible we won’t be aware of it due to it already all out being a sandbox horror game so maybe personal image and audio use wouldn’t be a good idea. The game will have to provide a camera system thing like Spiderman to take a pic of your own horror monster in the game to make a jumpscare.\n\n8. There will be many tools in the game to provide you for making your own horror map. That will allow you to of course make a horror story, like having the players to escape the monster, getting them to kill the monster, and having them to survive as long as possible. You know the possibility of a game like this the amount of creativity from many people! \n\n9. Lastly of course you can make as much map as you want but, if there’s a cap. You’ll be able to save your map into a hard drive. Let’s say each players gets 10 slot so you can create 10 maps. If you wanted to create another one you got to delete one... but! You can always save these map to the hard drive and delete it, I would also want to mention that if you submitted a map to the public it’ll be it’s own separate map be listed in your “Public created horror maps.” In your profile so even if you delete it off your slot it’ll still be a map in public unless you decide to manually delete it off your profile in the section of your profile “Public created horror map.” therefore bye bye forever. I could’ve word that better but, i’m pretty slow in the head.\n\n\nThat’s about it for my brain, I’m honestly sorry for the people who have stuff against people with bad grammar like myself not exactly the best with my paragraph, senetence, comma and periods. I also honestly have no knowledge of how games are made so if this isn’t even possible now i’m looking even dumber but, at the end of the day it was just an ideaa thank you for your time!!"

kc8cbo,a (new?) game mechanic to balance power in MMOs,"MMO games have this problem where players gain power with time and then new players don't have a chance against them hence there is no incentive for new players to join. This should be balanced out in various ways, for e.g. introducing some form of lifetime for players so they cannot get too powerful. I have a new idea of how to balance this based on real cosmology! it goes like this: the world in which the  player exists constantly expands (e.g. new tiles are added to the map) and the players have a maximum speed they can travel (the speed of light!) then when two cities are too far away there would be no way to player to transition from one to the next. Old and powerful players will get to rule and fight each other in their patches of ""visible universes"" while new players can spawn randomly at any patch, either encountering a young or old patch. If the patch is too hard the player can just re-spawn somwhere else until a nice patch is found. This is very rough idea right now. What do you think, can it be used in a real game??"

Just have their interactions be kinda how they are in Rdr2.  \n\nBut, mixed in with them, record like 20 male, and 20 female characters and mix and match them with different NPC models. Meaning each voice would be used for multiple different NPCs. \n\nThese NPCs with extensive dialogue will load around the world alongside the regular NPCs. They could hang around certain bars, parks, or work at businesses. Maybe there could be a way to identify on the map or menu, Idk. If you talk to one, they will have more dialogue options than normal NPCs. \n\nOnce an NPC is activated by talking to them and choosing to hang out or something, that voice is no longer loaded with any other possible relationships  around the world, until that NPC dies or the relationship ends. \n\nRelationships can grow or fade if neglected or if you do things against the NPCs interests. Bad relationships can ruin your reputation at places, causing NPCs to react negatively to you. \n\nMaybe, when a relationship ends in a bad way, if you run into the NPC, they might be hostile in some way. Maybe they will jump you with some NPCs they're with. \n\nBut if you have good relationships with them, if you get into trouble and happen to be around their job or something, they may help you out by helping fight or hiding you in a back room or trunk or something. \n\nBut yeah, basically just kinda imagine it being like Sims, where you can invite all your friends over to your house. Maybe you could all go drinking together at the bar or maybe play golf, watch tv, etc. But it's not a guarantee the NPCs will like each other. Some personalities will mesh better than others. Maybe they could invite you places, but not annoyingly like GTA4. Criminal friends could call for help on a hold up or something. \n\nYou would get perks if your relationship is strong enough. Like, they could work at a car place and give a discount on cars, or a clothes store, hospital, restaurant, bar, etc. \n\nThat's all I got for now. I'm no developer, so I'm sure there are a million reasons why this wouldnt work. Let me know. I just feel that meaningful NPC interaction is the last real wall with open worlds."

kc1kz8,An Idea for a Team Based Class Shooter,"I had an idea for a class shooter with a dungeons and dragons meets steam punk setting. This was mostly born out of the idea of dnd classes being used in a video game that wasn't some sort of virtual dnd emulator, such as Baldur's Gate, and the genre I thought would be the most interesting was a class shooter, which came from my love for tf2. \n\nIf you'd like to make it a team vs team shooter, you could make the context of the fights two rival adventuring parties fighting over who gets to complete a quest. An alternate idea could be a multiplayer class game where in which the party completes quests in the form of game modes, for example, MvM in tf2. These are of course just suggestions, I'm not a game designer, so I'll leave the deeper concepts to the guys who know what they're doing. \n\nThis is my first submission on this subreddit so I'd be happy to see what you guys think!"

kbx6wp,Coop horror game ideas?,Something with 2-4 players. Scary and fun
kbuyyx,A game where the villain gets tired of waiting for the hero to arrive to fulfill his role and goes on an adventure to find him.,"The characters (npc) were aware that they are in a video game and that they must fulfill their roles, they did not mind dying because they would reappear later. The villain could always see the position of the player from his castle to have the whole environment ready and organized for when he arrives (something like he loves drama) but on one of those occasions after finishing the game and restarting the world the main character no longer appears on his monitor.\nThe rumor that the main character has died without reviving spreads throughout that world causing no one to respect the roles and start wars for control for fear of dying at some point, and the villain tries to find him through the levels, having to beat the bosses who were in charge of him but now have become stronger to take control since they no longer need to be at a standard level according to their roles"

kbs996,A game where your vision is slowly reduced,"I have an idea for a platformer game, but every 0.2 seconds, the brightness goes down by 1%, which means it would take 20 seconds for it to get to 0%. Once it gets to 0%, it's game over. The brightness might be put in one of the corners so the player knows how bright it is.\n\nThere could be a few power-ups that help on the brightness bit, like adding 20% brightness or temporarily setting brightness to 100%. There could also be the normal power-ups, like boosted speed or invincibility.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Feedback and hate appreciated."

kbnrur,"Git Gud: A roguelite about choices, a poor understanding of git, and how to achieve them all.","(I'm fully aware that Git Gud is already a trademark. Also, I know that git is probably getting misrepresented here.)\n\nUnlike a certain game that literally sings about the world having infinite choices, Git Gud is about having limited choices but not being constrained by it, all while learning how to use git and be a productive ... gitter.\n\nThe game starts off as a roguelike. You will encounter many choices, and eventually die. A mysterious straight line with many nodes appear, each representing a choice you made.\n\nMany things done in this game are explicit ""choose one"" things. When you level up, you get only one stat point. When you find a grindstone, you can upgrade only one weapon. When you find a shop, you can purchase only one item regardless of your money.\n\nAt this point, you are not yet aware that those were choices.\n\nYou are presented with a second run.\n\nYou died again, and you see another line.\n\nEach game has not much different, but you realize that the more different choices you have made in previous runs, the more liberating options become available.\n\nFor example, the game has multiple key stats for your character (STR, INT, AGI, END), but in the early runs, only STR and INT are presented. If you already chose STR in one and INT in another, AGI becomes possible among the choices.\n\nWeapon classes and other decisions like dungeon maps also become more available as you explore your gameplay decisions and expand your tree.\n\nBut no matter what, the boss of the dungeon remains undefeated.\n\nUntil one day (after you realize what you have been doing, i.e. the game expanded like 5 or 6 choices already), a wizard appears. In the world of Git Gud, a wizard (as opposed to a mage) is a highly respected user of the arcane who infuses mana into himself and can use it at will. Wizards are among the highest of the social system, and many wizards were once knights, mages, archers, and all the basic classes (i.e. it's the apex class of the game). The title is never bestowed upon someone or taken by oneself, but is *realized*.\n\nThe Wizard says, throughout the cycle of life and death, the Samsara, the seed of realization will begin to grow in youe mind. It is neither granted by the Wizard nor any god, but it was conceived by your own desire to try multiple strategies to succeed, even if that will cost countless lives.\n\nHe visualizes all the old choices you have made, the choices you have expanded in many aspects together. You see those lines being merged into a complex branching tree.\n\n""From now on, just start where you want.""\n\nThe first power has been granted to you: the backup. If you die, you can now reload the game at any point you wish, at any point in gameplay history at all.\n\nYou will begin with full health at that point, and all equipment, but no money.\n\nSometimes it helps, though.\n\nYou manage to branch out a bit more, and create more decisions. Small, incremental features.\n\nThe Wizard unlocks your second power, the tag. You can now tag good points in your tree.\n\nThe third power is one of the greatest. The merge.\n\nIf you made a branch at point A, and you arrive at point B where there are multiple paths between A and B, you can call upon your predecessors and take both or all the decisions.\n\nIf you merge in a market map that you have been before (and branch from the same point), you can buy more items, but only if you can cover your old spirits. (You cannot directly sell an item, but you can use ""trade in"" or ""use and buy"" options to either sell or consume the old item before buying a new one.)\n\nIf you merge in a puzzle map, you can have your predecessor push one button and you push another. He must have used that button before though.\n\nAnd finally, if you merge in a boss room, this is where things get fun."
kbmdim,Fantasy Fps game where you play as an mercenary group that takes quest and helps people.,"I’d imagine it to be a sort of adventure where there is a huge map with various villages and kingdoms you can explore. For the main story I would want to do something different. Instead of their being some big bad kingdom you have to take down im thinking something sort of episodic. What i mean for this is for the story missions you spend 5 to 8 missions dealing with a specific event and you go on to the next. In whatever area the story missions are at there would be side missions you can do.The Mercenary group im thinking about is a group that basically just recently formed so as the story goes on you can see them sort of bond more as the story goes on. Alot of Fantasy games have a sort of serious tone so I would want this game to be a mix of comedy and a sort of dark tone.\n\n\nI imagine the gameplay mechanics to be sort of like a movement shooter(think something like doom). There would be multiple characters you can play as, each with their own different play styles. For the characters it would be the basic dungeon group plus some extras: Knight,Wizard,Archer,Barbarian,Pirate,Necromancer, and Ninja. There is also the blacksmith who is part of the group though he is non playable. Like alot of fantasy games there would be a level system where each time you level up you can increase health and improve your skills/abilities. For armor and weapons you will need to find the right items to bring to the Blacksmith so he can forge them. You will of course need to get stronger armor and weapons as your adventure continues to deal with stronger enemies. You would be able to completely customize/enchant your weapons to deal stuff like fire damage, ice damage,make it summon lightning etc. Similar to terraria you would be able to hide your armor and have clothes over it so you can look the way you want(though this would probably be useless since your in first person unless you got friends). Speaking of friends you can either have personal friends join you in your journey or find random people online to help.\n\n\nFeel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments."
kbfyp1,Deckbuilding Roguelike except your deck is a shotgun and the cards are extra barrels,"Came up with it while thinking about how Mothergunship would have been more fun if there was a more static base gun to build around but more variance in weapon parts, which immediately brought my mind to deckbuilding roguelikes like Slay the Spire.  I had the idea of a roguelike where you started off with a basic double-barreled shotgun, but through exploring would find more barrels to attach to the shotgun that could do different things, like have elemental properties or shoot slugs instead of pellets.  There could be incentive to position the barrels in ways (barrel synergies?), as well as reasons to either go for high-barrel or low-barrel runs (more barrels=longer reload?).  It's mostly just a random idea I've had the past week or so, I think it'd be a pretty fun way to create an FPS roguelike that still had a deckbuilding-ish strategy to it"

kberx8,"""Laser"" skirmish for mobile phone.","So I was scrolling though tiktok and I saw this video of a guy using an old COD handgun sticker and was going through his house using his camera pretending to shoot people with it. ( maybe you've seen it ) \nAnd it gave me the idea of a PVP game where shooting activates your mobile flashlight and if aimed at another person versing you their camera would pick that up and would take damage,\n so kind of like laser skirmish in real life but a mobile app and as you progress you unlock better guns with longer distances.  And character running speed varies to how quickly you can run irl.\n\nJust a thought but I'd find that fun."
kbcg7s,Pokemon Go style Bounty Hunter Game.,"Imagine a Pokemon Go style game where instead of Pokemon there are virtual criminals wandering around in public spaces. The player will need to physically get to the location of the virtual criminals, engage in some sort of in app capture process, and turn the criminal into a local Bounty Redemption Hub. It would be possible to gang up with other bounty hunters with the same app to take down really dangerous criminals or to help level up a friend. This idea could be combined with the Star Wars / Mandilorian universe if Disney wants more money or could be a generic scifi or western universe.\n\nObviously I don't have the resources to make this, but I felt it would be fun for the community here to think about it."
kbbv4a,FOREBODE - A Horror Visual Novel and Life Simulator,"**STORY SYNOPSIS**  \nThe player acts as a recently graduated interior designer named Romy Shelly who uses her entire savings to purchase and temporarily live in flat 110, a cheap property inside an old building. Shelly plans on working full time to purchase materials, renovate the property herself, take before and after photos to expand on her professional portfolio then sell the newly renovated flat and hopefully make money back from her investment. However shortly after Shelly's purchase property values in the area begin to plummet after the guy in flat 101 dies a violent death. A few weeks later the couple in 102 meet a similar fate... then the old lady in 103.. the family in 104.... 105.... 106... Will Romy sell the property at a loss then leave for good, will she unravel the mysteries of the cursed apartment complex or be next in line?\n\nPart life simulator and part narrative rich horror visual novel players must use their time wisely to investigate then put a stop to the curse before it's too late. \n\n**FEATURES**\n\n* Rich narrative experience driven by the player\n* Relationship management\n* Job management\n* Money management system\n* Customize Romy's temporary home\n* Stress meter\n* Fun and leisurely stress reducing mini-games!\n* Multiple endings\n\n**SO THIS WAS THE IDEA...**\n\nThe idea is to allow players time to find a comfortable method of managing Romy's life, finances, relationships and leisure activities. If the player wants to stop the curse they must deviate from their comfortable method of balance. They may choose to sacrifice their personal relationships, finances and their leisure time while attempting to keep stress levels down. An inexpensive method of keeping stress levels down would be to buy then drink alcohol at the risk of Romy craving alcohol possibly leading to alcoholism and undesirable story consequences. The player may choose to take out one or more credit cards which may temporarily resolve their financial problems but gets Romy in more debt. Romy may only have time to see her personal friends while ignoring her work colleagues offers of friendship making work more stressful or vice versa.\n\nThe whole thing could easily be made in Ren'Py with a good writer, artist, programmer and probably a whole lot more thought.\n\nThanks for reading."

kbb8rd,Any Platformer requests or ideas,Long story short Im trying to design and make a quick platformer but I'm stuck in so many directions. I tried to go mechanic based but I made way to many from a rocket hammer to A Gravity dash. Does anyone have any requests for a platformer or maybe a simple mechanic to design around?
kbb89v,The Mountain King,"Context: In the Hall of the Mountain King was a piece made by Edvard Grieg in 1875. It was a song I liked ever since I first heard it and I came across a Heavy Metal remix made by FalKKonE. They make a lot of Heavy Metal remix's and I recommend you check them out but anyways. Here is the game idea:\n\nGame type; It is like Enter the Gungeon and Hades. You can choose some spesific upgrades before a run. There are resources you can keep and can't keep upon resetting. You can buy upgrades during the run and upgrade yourself to an extent with the materials you keep. The game can essentially take forever to win. And the reason for that is, you must fulfill requierments to progress. Let's call them primary objectives. When you finish all of them, you unlock the final boss.\n\nFirst, you create your character; Male or female is the first choice. Then you can change their body to your liking for a tiny bit. This way, the horny bastards won't be too dissapointed and nobody can blame the game for sexualising anyone.\n\nTutorials; Unlike most games, you dont start with ""weapons"". You are working in your families farm but even there is not safe because earth itself has become and enemy of man. You learn how to block, hit, move, dodge etc.\n\nAs your progress further and further, you unlock some new abilities and are placed in a training room so you can learn what the ability can do. But you also get rewarded for completing them. The faster, the more loot. You have the option to skip and just get a brief explanation on what it does but can return to the room at any time to practice with the ability.\n\nThe prologue; ""With the first breath of life on earth, 4 holy beings were created. The king of Fire, Mountains, Wind and Lake. They shaped the earth together and protected it from the darkness that lurked close. Until thousands of years ago, when something slipped under their all seeing eyes. An evil entity of unknown origin and pure evil. This entity made its way into the mind of the Mountain King, slowly corrupting his mind with dark thoughts. That was until, he snapped. He was finally taken over by the entity, his every move controlled like a puppet. At that dark day, a prophecy came from the remaining 3 un-corrupted kings that one day, the child of the 4 forces of earth shall be born and defeat the dark entity residing in the Mountain Kings mind.""\n\n\*Group of children, including the main character\*:""Wow........""\n\nThe Innkeeper: ""That's just a fairy tale old man. Do you really think some weird shadow monster could take over something that is basically a god? The land has always been this way.""\n\nElderly Story-teller:""I won't tell you what to belive. But if something really did create us, why would they turn our races lives into torment?""\n\nThe Innkeeper: ""If you want a room in my inn you better stop filling these kids heads with lies and prophecies. We don't need any false hope here""\n\nElderly Story-teller: \*Annoyed grunt\*\n\n\*Exists flashback\*\n\n\*Chosen name\*: I always wanted to belive that. That one day, we wouldn't have to fear for our lives every second. That we could go out in the night without risking a grusome death. But it has been 15 years and with each day, what little hope I have left from hearing that story keeps getting smaller and smaller. But the Innkeeper was right I guess. It was just a fairy tale.\n\nPenny Firehearth (Mom): ""WAKE UP SLEEPY HEAD, ITS TIME FOR HARVEST!""\n\n\*Chosen name\*: But this is better than nothing I guess.\n\nSo, my head and hands hurt so I will be writing this in multiple parts. This is all I could write for now. C&amp;C is welcome."
kbamgx,Rhythm game where you don’t obey the rhythm,"This is a game where all the enemies go to the beat of the song, but you aren’t required to.\n\nThis incentivizes the player to dodge on the beat, and attack on the offbeat. Should player attack animations be measured in beats?\n\nThe goal is to create situations where it’s “your turn” or “the enemies turn” without descending into turn based combat.\n\nMany games already do things like this, like mantis lords from hollow knight, or hyper light drifter, or crypt of the necrodancer.

A winner is the one who reached a certain point.\n\nMechanism:\nOption to cross out not suspected winkle.\n\nI am real sorry if you think this is not related to game idea but I don’t know where to post otherwise. I hope the devs of the game see the potential and implement them. I would love to see the game in steam and mobile like “Among Us”. Thanks"
kb2f5k,[Mechanic] Like night and day,"I'm sure this would be one hell of a mechanic to program, but one I'd like to see in a game, if it doesn't already exist, is the game world reflect the real world as far as the time of the day.  Using the internal clock in the player's computer, console, or mobile device, it could make the game's environment match the player's environment.\n\n\nIf the player happens to be playing the game at 8:00 AM, then the lighting and shadows should reflect the sun's approximate position at 8 AM.  Perhaps take it a step further and program the game to recognize the month and date and adjust the seasons accordingly.\n\n\nI know some games already feature this mechanic to an extent by having the game world reflect a certain holiday, if the game world's lore recognizes the holiday, either called the same thing or some other name.  Back in my Brony days, I played the My Little Pony mobile game, and it featured the mechanics to change the world to a Halloween theme (for the world's holiday ""Nightmare Night"") or Christmas theme (""Hearth's Warming"").\n\n\n*The Eyes of Ara* used a similar mechanic to, again, feature extra puzzles related to Halloween and Christmas.  If they can do that, I'm sure they could make it so when you're playing at night, it's night in the game.  If you're playing in the middle of the afternoon, it's the same time in the game.\n\n\nStraw-grasping, I know, but still, I think it'd be kind of cool."

If you cry out for help over voice chat or voice commands, you might get killed by the AI, but if you stay too quiet while you approach your teammates for group safety, they might kill you with their melee weapons instead.\n\n****\nThe premise is stupid simple: Self-proclaimed demon hunters from across Instagram group up to YOLO some abandoned hospital/mansion/gravesite/ect. (depending what map got chosen)... all to take selfies at randomized locations there ""for the gram."" Unbeknownst to them, demons are real.

ka3cx6,Cringe Simulator,"Every level gets increasingly more cringe-inducing. Kind of like running the gauntlet cringe edition, but in game form. Some ideas for levels: Terrible rapping or singing with awful lyrics that’s on a good instrumental.\nA horror level that would only appeal to really young children. \nA really weird and awkward situation where an NPC tries to be funny.\nA level where NPCs try to be hip and or cool, by doing stuff like dabs or fortnite emotes.\n\nThat is all."

ka28ut,Gilgamesh is the great hero chosen by date to defeat the dark wizard and free the realm... You're just there to carry all his crap,"I had this idea for Wizard jam based off of the Idle Thumbs episode ""I can't do it, Gilgamesh!"" but then I started a real job...\n\nLike the title suggests the basic premise of the game is you are the squires (think Holy Grail style with a massive heavy backpack) to Gilgamesh the mighty hero of the land (think Captain Hammer in platemail).\n\nAs you progress the hero collects a wide variety of items all of which you are expected to carry. The more you carry the heavier your bag is and the harder it will be to keep up. He will collect things ranging like key items needed to unlock puzzles, valuables to sell in the next town, or things he needs for a fetch quest. That said, he also insists on collecting trinkets for ""completion"".\n\nAs a squire you have four jobs:\n* Carry his stuff\n* Give/toss him items when he needs them\n* Stay in his good graces\n* Try not to die\n\nIf he gets ahead of you he'll get impatient and his opinion of you will drop. If you keep up and give him the stuff he needs his opinion of you will rise. Helping him collect trinkets or complete fetch quest will also boost his opinion of you but then things become more difficult. You can ask him not to pick up so much junk on your next journey but you rush him getting mad at you.\n\nIf he gets mad enough you'll get fired. You lose any stats and equipment you gained. If you die on a journey the hero has to backtrack with his pack to the last town and hire a new squire. He may decide ditch some of the equipment along the way if it's too heavy.\n\nA new squire isn't the end of the world, you take on the role of that squire and continue the journey. If the hero fire though, that is the end of the world. He'll take damage as he fights monsters, when you give him the wrong item, and when you fail to get him what he needs in time.\n\n\nRougelike 2D puzzle platformer"
ka03kv,The NYC teen experience,"I have no clue if this is the status quo but I have had some of the most surreal and craziest experiences as a teen growing up in New York City. The amount of stories that could go into a game about this experience from not just me but people that I know could create a modern fable. They would be stories inspired by real events which by themselves involve guns, drugs, sex, and violence all in the most important urban center of our time. I’ve been thinking about this as cyberpunk 2077 comes out because it reminds me of a futuristic version of my city. I’m an inspiring game developer and I pray that I will get the chance to make this. \nIf you drop woo don’t respond to this. \nRip pop smoke"

Your character just so happens to know how to make drugs, and where to buy them, certain areas, if you buy too much, can be ambushed, or run out of stock, with these drugs you can change the tide of the area, with drugs that enhance player speed, or damage resistance, and the more you play, and the more stuff you grab from the area, the more stuff you can make, then, comes the upgrades, upgrades allow you to increase certain parts of your character, allowing you to carry more melee weapons, more drugs, or even make you stronger or lighter, your choice, but remember, you don't have guns, they do, so choose wisely what you shall do"

k9wrgi,A tag game .. But with guns,"So it's an FPS game of about 5 players .. And a verity of maps .. With lots of hiding places ... And even that there is guns .. There will be no killing so it is family friendly .. The guns are more of nerf guns than real ones .. Anyway ... At the beginning of the round .. one of the players will randomly have the label ""it"" and when the round starts .. They gonna have to shoot some one else .. To transfer the label ""it"" to them .. So it's like tag .. And there will be a bunch of timers .. Mainly 3 .. One will be to time the round which will be optional (so you can choose to play for 5 minutes or ten or 15 ... Etc) and an ""it"" timer for each player .. Where it records how long they've been ""it"" during the round .. And the final timer is also for each player .. And this one is to encourage moving around more then hiding in one spot (like the storm or the zone in fortnite and pubg) where there will be a timer of about 10 secondes .. Where if you didn't move for 10 secondes and stayed in one place .. You going to be visible to who ever is ""it"" even behind walls (much like wallhack) .. But after they move to a diffrent spot that timer resets .. At the end of the round .. The player with the least amount of time being ""it"" .. Will be declared number one and the winner .. And the rest will rank below the winner .. While the one with the most time being ""it"" is last ... I am thinking maybe the ""bullets"" should be a bit slow .. So the other players will have time to react to them .. And also .. maybe add dodging skills to avoid the bullets .. to make for awsome clutch moments .. Let me know what you guys think of this"
k9v1sr,Anime Fighting Game,"As games get more advanced, fighting games are slowly dying, so my idea is to have a Mortal Kombat base with all characters in a kinda anime-chibi style so it brings out a contrast with cute, and deadly.\n\nThe goal is to basically kill or knock out opponent, there should be possibly between 8-20 characters, but less is fine since I know it is hard on devs.\n\nSecret characters would be cool, but not needed. The fighting style would be super bloody (not gory) since it is extra work for a small result, and the blood add to the contrast of cute but deadly.\n\nPlatforms I really dont know it's up to the devs\n\n\nI would like credit for the idea, and if you use it I would like to see how it turned out since I think it will be cool."

k9s4d6,2d Railroad Game,"Hello everyone,\n\nI had an ideal for a 2d top down resource management game somewhat similar in style to Stardew Valley. \n\nThe basic story of the game is you inherit a dying railroad from an estranged family member. This railroad is on an island that at one point had been the industrial center for your country but had slowly withered away over the decades, but now due to outside circumstances it is reviving and your right in the middle of it.\n\nThe game would start with you creating your character and coming to the island, there you would find the railroad in horrible condition and the only engine available to you broke down before you arrived. To save the railroad you would have to go all over town asking everyone for help in getting parts or knowledge to repair the engine. \n\nOnce you repair the engine the main game begins. Here you have daily tasks you can do such as; shunting cars, scheduling pickups and deliveries, hitting new employees, etc. You would also have tasks for the community like donating to the school or something that you could do. \n\nThe goal of all this is to earn enough money and repair the railroad. Eventually you would be able to expand and upgrade the railroad, buying new locomotives, getting new cars, opening new tracks, and getting new clients. Eventually I'd hope to add more towns that you could expand into. \n\nI'd like to know what you all think, and if you have any comments, criticism, or questions. I doubt I'd ever get it to fruition as my technical skills are greatly lacking, it's still fun thinking about it."

k9qlgk,A typical Tower Defense Game but attackers are also human players,"Actually, this game is very similar to League of Legends. The difference is that one defender sets up his defense layout according to the coins in his hand, just like a typical tower defense game. After finishing the plan and clicking ""start wave"", other players try to get past the defense by directing a hero just like LoL."
k9mk9a,Long term stealth mechanic,"Stealth mechanics for a lot of the games I have played tend to feel a little awkward in my experience so I came up with this:\n\nWhen you start the game the player shouldn't be a master of stealth. But, you can't exactly just have the enemy just flip around like they knew the player was there the entire time whenever the player tries a takedown. You gotta let the player feel as if they had a hand in it. So, how about instead of a percentage chance of the enemy noticing the player or something, a quick time event, or precise controls are involved? Could be a combination of both. The player feels as though they can in fact do the stealth takedowns but, as the character is still new at it, they aren't experts. \n\nAs the game progresses, and if the player chooses to focus more on the stealth area, maybe have perks they could get that involve making the stealth easier. More time to do the quick time events, quieting the enemy faster, the controls have to be less precise, so on. Higher levels may be able to do take downs by pressing 1 button for a much quicker takedown. Even higher levels may be able to gain buffs per stealth takedown, for example faster movement speed for say, 3 seconds. You could even add in a timed event where the player could grab the knife from the enemy they just took down to throw at another enemy for a dual takedown. It really would just depend on how the dev implements it."
k9lrc4,"A new idea for how armor works universally, no damage-type/element/perk type of gimmicks.","Armor stat function seems to be only affected by specific gimmicks, such as elements or damage types, but nothing related to just the base function of direct damage. Shields in most games are a layer on top of heath that regenerates and cannot lead to killing without damaging health. Health is what needs to be depleted to defeat an opponent. I never understood what the point of armor was aside from hiding more health. Suddenly, I got an idea on how damage in general can affect armor without it being a type of damage/element/weapon/etc.\n\nArmor can have two stats: threshold and durability.\n\nThis idea is that any weapon can eventually do maximum damage to show that there is something there that prevents doing enough health damage without feeling like it's just more health.\n\n* Threshold = how much damage reduction your weapon does against an enemy with maximum armor.\n* Durability = how long it takes to deplete the opponent's armor from maximum armor to complete depletion.\n* An enemy with low threshold and high durability will take more damage, but take longer to reach armor depletion. And enemy with high threshold and low durability will take less damage, but take a shorter time to reach armor depletion. Because it's armor, it's still tied to how much damage is done directly to health. It's not a layer on top of health, like in Borderlands where it's just yellow health that takes more damage from green bullets.\n\nThis is kinda hard to explain, as I'm not sure how to explain the math. Unlike armor in most games, your weapon will eventually reach a point of doing full damage because the opponent's armor is depleted, and is not based on using a specific perk or gimmick to do so, but universal, just like any weapon can damage shields or health. This may still lead to enemies taking the same number of attacks, but the amount of armor affects everybody targeting the opponent, meaning one player can remove the armor and another can do full damage per attack."
k9levf,You play a psychic detective that can live through the final moments of victims to find clues to their whereabouts or their killer. You aren't aware of this until after living through the final moments of some poor soul in the horror game's terrifying opening segment.,"The detective part is very limited; basically just your character in some disheveled room with walls covered in news clippings, a map, photographs, mementos and other clues. All you get to do in this segment of the game is to make connections on that wall with pins and string [like this.](https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/15/37/original/original-detective-crazy-wall-43-jpg-f48b090a.jpg) You can psychic dive into mementos of victims to play &amp; replay the horror segments in search of clues that will help you find more connections. All the cases appear to be connected, and you're certain the killer is somewhere on your wall.\n\nThere are only two big problems:\n1. After years of reliving moments of the dead, the dead are starting to show up more often in the detective's visions. Perhaps even in real life too.\n2. It's becoming clear the killer has paranormal abilities too."

jqllai,Watched a Men In Black movie recently and this game tie in has been on my mind for days straight.,"So like I said. I recently watched the newest Men In Black movie (I have a soft spot for the franchise so I had to at least watch it) but it made me realize there was never a great MIB tie in game. Or I at least have never heard anyone say anything amazing about the old tie in games. This also made me realize that I actually had a pretty cool idea for a MIB game\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off it would be structured like Hitman Blood Money. You are a Rookie agent in the MIB and your job is to hunt down MIB's top wanted aliens. you start with small time criminals eventually taking down alien mob bosses and worse, and Each level would be it's own mini encased open world much like Hitman 2. Before each mission you are given free range of the MIB armory (Early levels would only have a basic choice of  a few simple MIB guns and gadgets, each mission will increase your rank and allow you to pick from more guns and gadgets). You are then dropped into the level with the basic details of the alien you are hunting down. In most levels the alien will usually be disguised as a human and you will have to sneak around the level until you find one that matches the correct profile. From that point you are free to take him down how ever you please. Do it stealthy and smart and they won't even have a chance to ditch their disguise. But go in loud and guns blazing you run the risk of human ai seeing you or seeing the alien after he ditches his disguise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you take down the alien or bring him in a MIB van shows up and you are shown your stats for the level. If you went in too loud or too crazy the public will know about aliens and the MIB. So you use what ever resources you have to control the flow of information. It costs time and resources to neuralyze and track down the people who might of saw you or the alien. Plus you have to pay for clean up. The messier the job the more it costs to clean up and keep things under wraps while doing it. You can skip on these costs but the more you do the more people begin to start believing in the MIB and aliens. As this suspicion goes up your jobs become harder. Aliens are quicker to ditch their human disguises if they see you coming. Knowing that they are much more powerful in their natural alien body. As this suspicion grows random ai will start to notice you in future levels. Your signature outfit is easy to spot in most places so word spreads of you fast and it might even tip off the alien or his henchmen if they hear talk of MIB in the area and that you are looking for them. Once you clean up any mess you are brought back to MIB HQ to either lock up the alien or bring back proof of their death. You are facing some of the baddest aliens around so not every alien is going to come in willingly. You are then told the cover story of what happened during your mission that the press will send out. These are a more fun take on Hitman Blood Money's news paper mission enders. Each one would be a silly cover up that would change based on your actions (Used a alien rifle a lot? the news article would explain it as a ""test"" of sound effects for some secretively filming movie in the area. or ect. I am bad at coming up with cool ideas. But you get the gist, just fun little articles that you might see on a conspiracy theorists wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere in MIB HQ you can use what ever money and resources you did not spend on cleaning up the mess on upgrades and new weapons. Testing them out in the firing range and being able to just explore HQ freely. Talking to other agents and then gearing up again once you have talked to your boss about the next target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like the idea of it being a stealth game. But I am not sure how well it would work considering the MIB only wear black suits. Might be hard to work stealth into it, Maybe have it be like more Assassins Creed where you can blend in with crowds and sneak by that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo over all I see the game as kind of a combo of Prey 2's original gameplay where you were an alien bounty hunter plus Hitmans more enclosed large open levels and stealth tactics. with Blood Money sprinkles by having to keep normal people calm and quite by spending your resources to keep them thinking everything is ""normal"". It might not be the best game ever but it has been stuck in my head for the last couple days."
jqk5n1,"A military shooter game, but both in and out of VR","Ok so hear me out. You may be thinking ""that just sounds like superhot with extra steps"" (and you're not too far off I guess, but that's VR in VR) but that's not what I'm thinking. I think a good idea for a game would be a singleplayer first person shooter game where you can switch from in/out of VR. It could have campaign missions in both modes, but mostly VR. You could control robots or something of the sort via traditional flat screen game for certain missions, then when you're being ""sent into battle"" you put your VR headset on and play. Or maybe a Titanfall style game where you control a big robot or something of the sort in VR, but you play as yourself on the flat screen.\n\nI am aware that this would probably be hard to make and isn't the greatest idea (lol being high makes everything sound like a good idea), but I think it would be pretty cool."
jqihxr,A game where you have the power of a God,"A super hero type of game, but where you are more powerful than anything we've seen before in a game. I just think it would be cool to realize all the destructive capability a player could ever want. Instead of fighting dozens of enemies at a time, you battle entire armies. There are also super villains who have similar powers and after you both clash, it looks like a nuclear bomb just went off in the surrounding area. \n\nThere would be 5 Main classes : Archon (Energy Manipulation), Psychon (Telekinetic Manipulation), Bio-killer(Organic Manipulation), Technopath (Technologic Manipulation), Brutus (Super speed/strength)\n\nThe Archon could do things like charge up a Spirit Bomb, the Psychon would lift up entire buildings, the Bio-killer could cause an earthquake with tentacles and the Technopath could summon a wall of turrets all going off simultaneously. \n\nThere are 4 enemy factions to do battle with : Synth Corp (who unleash Mutants), Confederation (who use Giant Mech Suits), Celestial Order (who evoke Trans-dimensional Aliens), and The Academy (who create living Elementals).\n\nYou would have a slowly regenerating health pool, but enemies could still wear you down over time. There is also a mission time limit so its a race against the clock. In general it could have co-op and maybe the end-game could be randomly generated instances and a scaling difficulty."

If someone has an idea for a single player (I can't pay for servers as of now) game that doesn't need advanced modelling or anything of that nature I would more than happily bring it to life since I'm having troubles thinking of something that wouldn't require me being an expert at every aspect of game development.

jpyv15,YELLOWTALE - An RPG/Choice based game that involves a kid going on a hunt to find his missing parents,"#Basic Description \n\nYou would play as a 17 year old boy named Nick, who goes on a quest to find his parents after they never returned back from a vacation.\n\n#How would it work? \n\nIt would be a chapter based game with different areas of the world being in each. Every chapter would contain characters and a smaller plot line exclusive to it. You would start in a small town where you live, and the end goal is in a city named UniTropolis. \n\n#The Planned Ending \n\nOnce you arrive there and do some investigation with the help of some new allies, you would discover they were killed after being abducted for a cult experiment. Once Nick finds this out, he turns to dark magic to find and get revenge on the person responsible out of blind rage and not being able to handle his feelings. \n\nThe last chapter would be in two parts, with you not playing as Nick but one of his friends trying to stop him, due to him becoming unmerciful and corrupted from said Dark magic. \n\nThe final battle would be him getting knocked out, removing the darkness from him. With the ending being him trying to better himself and cope with the death of his parents. A bitter sweet ending \n\n_______________\n\nThis is still just a mere idea, and I’ve just now started laying down the foundations on how I think it should go. I have 2 people helping me so far, and I’ve created a subreddit to help document my ideas. *(Ask)*\n\nWhat do you think?"
jpypob,We need more grand strategy games that focus on intelligence and not on warfare.,"So there is only 1 game I know of that focuses on the intelligence side of conflicts and not on the tanks and planes side. It's called Precipice and it's cute, it has enough content for maybe 4 rounds, total. \n\nSo to to into a bit more detail. I want a grand strategy game that instead of being like HoI4 which basically only focuses on warfare, or vic2 that almost exclusively focuses on economy and trade. Focuses on building a national intelligence network (like CIA or Mossad), conducting covert operations abroad in domestically, destabilizing governments, managing agents, sabotage and maybe even using data you collect to successfully wage wars (making it so that if you don't have informants in the right places, enough satellites or planes your army wouldn't be able to see more then 10 kilometers in front of them putting them in a huge disadvantage, or if you manage it successfully putting you in a huge advantage.), Counter - espionage, ect... \n\nIt naturally also needs to have management elements to it."
jpt4ko,Deal with a Eco System Simulation and Human Tribes using your Skill and Technologies from the world you came from.,"#Premise\n\nYou find yourself in a world in which most humans don't know how to use most technologies. The world still has a bunch of human-made items for you to find/build and use against the dangerous animals, hazardous plants and harsh environment. You will lure, trap, destroy your path to victory.\n\nOnce you start finding, defeating, getting past and dealing with human tribes, you realise that they've acquired the ability to tame wild and dangerous animals.\n\nAfter a while, you will be able to find the four ""Dungeons"". Giant buildings, remnants of the past containing humans that have both learned to use technogies and have tamed animals.\n\nYour mission is to rescue your friends by gathering power, technogies and information from the dungeons. Pinpoint your friends prison and free them from the strongest and smartest human tribe which has captured them.\n\nI want the creatures of the system to be rather predictable, so no random gene bullshit for animals.\n\n#Animals\n\nSome animals will eat or harvest plants, others will hunt other animals. Of course they'd also need to drink from watering holes. Animals will reproduce until a certain amount of them are in the game.\n\nBasic Stats for animals\nHealth\nHunger\nThirst\nReproduction\n\nIf a animal dies, it drops meat of different sizes.\n\nWhen a animal has satisfied all of it's needs, it will wander randomly.\n\n#Plants\n\nPlants will have different growth stages. Some will start spawning ""falling seeds"", which will be affected by the wind.\n\nOther plants might have other ways of spreading their seeds.\n\nPlants will also grow faster when it rains or when near a water source. A seed that drops into water counts as a dead plant which can also be eaten.\n\n#Weather System\n\nPotentially adding a day/night cycle and sleeping behaviours for animals and humans.\nWind would randomly broadcast a wind direction and wind strength to all seeds.\nRandomly start and stop raining.\n\n#Humans\n\nHuman Tribes likely won't work similar to animals.\n\nThey will be guarding specific areas.\n\nMost of them will be guarding, patrolling their areas.\n\nSome of them will be seen fighting with other tribes or camping.\n\nSometimes they will try to directly attack you or even manage to capture you.\n\nThey are armed with spears and other stone-age weapons. There are also some high-level humans who are able to tame animals and even higher level humans who can use technologies. Those will even create traps like spike traps and arrow traps.\n\nHumans drop ""human meat"". A variant of meat that can't be eaten by the player unless playing on a ""Harvey"" or ""Easy"" difficulty."

jpqd2x,Car racing MOBA game - Dream combo!,"Alright so here goes my concept of this game.\n\n**Base game** \- Although it would have some futuristic elements, the game would feature open-world realistic elements, cars, destruction etc.  \nThink of the base game as Forza Horizon 4 where the graphics are an eye-candy.  \nSo let's take Forza Horizon 4 as the base game.\n\n**Let's add the MOBA flavor now** \-   \n1. The game would feature laps-based racing on various tracks (similar to FH4)   \n2. When a match is found, you'll select from a list of cars (similar to Champions selection screen in League of Legends or any other MOBA)  \n3. These cars have their own passive + 2 abilities + 1 ultimate.  \n4. The match could feature up to 10 laps (could be variable as per the ""fun factor"").  \n5. When a lap ends, there will be a 15-second freeze (the screen would gray out), quickly giving you options to amp up your gear. The car at the first place would earn more gold than the others and so on.  \nThis would feature - a) Leveling up your ability (you can choose to level up one of your 2 abilities, or ultimate ability after the 5th lap) b) Adding a tweak to your car (handling, acceleration, transmission, top speed etc.) c) To give the trailing cars a chance, they will be given a package of nitro boost, with the car at the last place having the most nitro boost. Use the nitro wisely!  \n6. If you wreck another car during a lap, you get more gold! So even if you're at the last place, you have more chances to get gold, get stronger and push to the first place.  \n7. After the end of every lap, cars heal themselves with 500 health.  \n8. Cars also suffer collision damage (from other cars/environment) which means you would need to drive efficiently as well (duh! it's racing after all!)\n\nWin condition - At the end of the 10 laps or so, the car that crosses the finishing line wins!\n\n**Game modes** \- Given this concept, the game could also feature   \n\- 5v5 team-based racing  \n\- Destruction derby\n\n**Cars ideas** \- (inspired from Twisted Metal series)\n\n**Spectre ""The Special Weapon"" (1200 health)**\n\nPassive - Whenever Spectre is tail-gaiting behind a car, it gains a drafting boost, giving it more speed as the drafting continues.  \nQ (12 seconds cooldown) - Spectre goes in auto-pilot for 4 seconds taking full-control of the car. If in range of the car ahead, the auto-pilot would tail-gate to gain a drafting boost and fire a heat missile dealing 150 damage  \nW (10 seconds cooldown) - Spectre fires a shock missile directly ahead hitting the first car and locking it's steering for 2 seconds. During this time the affected car cannot steer left or right.  \nUltimate - Spectre fires a homing missile locking on to any target ahead of him and dealing 500 + 10% of the missing health as damage. A small HUD would appear to select a target car ahead of Spectre.\n\n  \n**Outlaw ""The SWAT Unit"" (1400 health)**\n\nPassive - Outlaw can issue ""tickets"" to high speeding cars by ramming into them. If Outlaw rams into a car speeding over 60 mph (96 kph), it issues a ""ticket"".  \nWhen a car stacks over 4 tickets, it suffers a sudden speed loss to 30 mph and is dealt with 200 damage.  \nQ (10 seconds cooldown) - When in range of the car ahead, Outlaw activates it's siren initiating a chase towards that car and gaining +20 mph speed. If Outlaw rams into the car during this time, it issues 2 tickets (can stack with passive).  \nW (9 seconds cooldown) - Outlaw throws a spike strip behind it's path. If a car runs over the spike strip, the speed would decay -20 mph/second for 2.5 seconds and dealing 250 damage.  \nUltimate - Outlaw sounds a loud siren for 2 seconds after which all the cars speeding over 80 mph suffer a sudden shock, slowing the speed down by -40 mph, dealing 400 damage and issuing a ticket."
jpmn0n,A celebration of Mario Party and it's history... With a twist.,"I think the perfect Mario Party should be a game celebrating it's history as a whole. **And is not another ""Top 100"" minigame collection.**\n\nThink Sonic Generations but perhaps with new twists, maybe combining two boards into one due to Bowser having some Space Time shenanigans and slightly altered goals but still based around collecting Stars.\n\nSo you could have boards combining E. Gadd's Garage from 6 with King Boo's Haunted Hideaway from 8. You can not tell me that would not be interesting, maybe have it act like your hunting down ghosts to get stars they contain and King Boo has 3, but instead of paying you have to fight them in a short Boo or Luigi's Themed minigame.\n\nMaybe some more random combinations like Pirate Dream from 5, but it's now underwater because it merged with Deep Bloober Sea from 3. So you have to deal with a bunch of Cheep Cheeps and the Blooper Baby who will call for his mother swimming around.\n\nAnd of course, a Bowser Level that takes iconic set pieces and areas of previous Bowser levels in past games, but the setup can still feel unique.\n\nPlus this can open up the chance for minigames to return from prior games, but with some new twists like combining two old games into a brand new one as well.\n\nLike Burnstile from Mario Party 6 combined with Hexagon Heat from Mario Party 2 where you have to run to a colored platformwhile the spiked arm spins in the middle one, forcing you to multitask between watching Toad's flag and keep track of the spiked arm.\n\nThese types of minigames could be the purest form of chaos and it would be perfect for Mario Party.\n\nFeel free to discuss ideas for what crazy combinations for maps and minigames you'd like to see yourself as well as your thoughts on this crwzy idea."

Rather than there being one set paths, you have a time limit but you can build anywhere on the map. You start off with barracks with soldier who build your buildings. The further from their base the longer it'll take to build things. The building time would also depend on the terrain, like water, dirt, sand, mud, etcetera. The player would defend their small armory from waves of invading enemy forces from all sides.\n\nYou should be able to build sniper towers and then be able to take control of these soldiers and snipe. You should be able to build machine gun bunkers. Are your snipers taking fire? Take control if a machinegunner and supress them."
jpiy0v,The Mandolorian RPG," An open-world RPG based on ""The Mandolorian"" Tv show in Disney plus. You would start off with rudimentary armor and a broken ship. You start doing bounties around the star system to be able to eventually repair your ship and then actually start the game. You can upgrade your armor, weapons, ship, speeder, etc. You can also get attachments for your armor like a jetpack or whistling birds. This is something that I think would satisfy people that are hungry for more Mandolorian-related content. I often find myself wishing to be able to make my own story within the Mandalorian's shoes. \n\n**Keep in mind that this idea can be changed as needed I'm just giving an idea.**"

jpdp2c,Graffiti Tag - A mobile AR / location based tag game,"I’m sorry in advance for probably being way too vague and unstructured. I know nothing about game development, but I thought this would be a fun game:\n\nAs indicated in the title, it’s a location based AR game. \n\n\nStart by creating your own custom digital art / graffiti. \n\n\nTake a picture of a real life location (wall, building, etc.) \n\n\nStamp your pre-drawn graffiti on the object in the picture, or draw free hand. \n\n\nUpload the image, which will Tag! the image as a landmark on the map. \n\n\nDepending on the size of the tag, it takes longer/shorter amounts of down time to complete the tag. During this time you can’t do much else. \n\n\nIf you stay in the general area (via GPS) the time goes faster, and slows down the farther away you go. \n\n\nTag as many objects as you can to accumulate points, and establish dominance in your location, and spread your territory. \n\n\nTagging larger objects (eg. buildings) gives you more points and influence, than small objects (eg. stop sign). Larger objects require multiple tags to ‘claim’ them.\n\n\nI imagine there could be some sort of other fun pvp and/or team based battles and challenges. Something similar to Turf Wars or those sorts of games, but more up to date and interesting. (Sorry, I know this is where the idea needs a lot of work)\n\n\nBuy paint, rollers, etc. Use the resources to paint over an opponents graffiti, so you can tag the spot with your own. Maybe you can buy upgrades with in game credits to protect your tags.\n\n\nDepending on the location, time of day, or random chance, you could be ‘Busted’ by the cops while trying to tag an object. You get fined, or face other consequences.  \n\n\nYou might also get ‘Jumped’ by your opponents. Perhaps if a rival is near your location (via GPS) you can be prompted to jump them and steal their resources. \n\n\nIdeally it would be really cool if there was an AR function to overlay the graffiti, so when you look at things through your phone you can see everyone’s tags. \n\n\nThanks for hearing me out!"
jpbhik,2D Open world medieval rpg game,"I know this sounds pretty generic, but here me out. I think that 2d open world games are really underappreciated, and there is a lot of potential there. \n\nSome of the core features of this game would be:\n\nVery little guidance on quests. The main quest would be something like 'Kill a demon', but this wouldn't be the main focus of the game. You would be dropped into the world, and told to kill this demon. The main character would hold a journal where he would record all the quests he has been given, and any information relating to them. But the quests wouldn't be based around linear progression. Rather, you would be told to do something, but there would be several ways of doing it. This is important because it relates to the second main feature of the game.\n\nFully embrace the open world idea. The map would be huge and detailed. The main character could pretty much do anything, including kill any character in the game. This relates back to the previous note, as a lot of the reasons you can't kill characters in games is because they are important to quests. \n\nThere wouldn't be a huge focus on combat in the game. 2d games obviously don't have great combat systems, and this game should embrace that. Make the combat relatively straightforward, and don't include a lot of dungeons where combat is central, with puzzles being more important. Your ability to defeat enemies should be based primarily on your level and weapons rather than your skill.\n\nI also think the game should be hardcore. Thus makes the player think a lot more about their decisions, and adds a lot more depth to actions. In addition, something like going to jail shouldn't be skippable, it should act like a game within a game, meet people there, plan an escape, make contacts. Decisions should have a big effect, if you try to assassinate someone and it goes wrong you could be forced to flee that area of the map at risk of death if you return, which you would only be able to do if you changed your face through magic or invaded with an army (just some hypothetical features of such a game).\n\nWhat di you guys think."

I’ve got the mechanics, the game design document, and even a rough draft of how I’m gonna go about creating it. But I got a problem.\n\nI can’t decide on the art direction.\n\nBasically, my game is very videogamey, casual, and focuses heavily on the raw gameplay instead of building up a plot, universe, or a general atmosphere.\n\nHeck, even though I thought of the players being humans when I planned it out, I could easily replace them with robots, or ghosts, or cubes, or anything\n\nSo, really, the entire aesthetic could be anything.

Your ship has crashed and you have to gather resources that might seem strange to the natives but they are things you desperately need for your alien DNA and technology. \n\nUltimately, your goal is to survive long enough to repair your ship and get the heck out of Dodge or the desert or the arctic or wherever the random algorithm dropped your crashed ship. \n\n:)"
jo79z1,The Cosmic Balance Resource Manager,"I doubt I will ever get good enough at making RM games to do this so I'm throwing it out into the ether for an eager(er) game maker to pick up ;)\n\nSo how about a game similar to the Sims but you don't control the people in the little world, you just observe them and keep track of their stats which might be Enlightenment, Essence, and Entanglement (the three Es of managing the after life). \n\nSo the little people of this world are born, grow, get old in quicker than normal time of course. As they do different things, it effects their Enlightenment. Robbing a bank might hurt their enlightenment, while being charitable or helping people as a whole might increase their Enlightenment. When a person's Enlightenment is high enough they get to go to ""The Light"" and when it dips too low they have to go to ""Another Place"". \n\nEach person has an ""Essence Clock"" and when it runs out you have to arrange a way to kill the person with things that happen around them on THAT DAY (i.e. maybe there is a trash truck on their road that is notorious for not paying attention so BAM or maybe the person likes to swim a lot so GURGLE etc). And a little grim reaper comes to get them. \n\nNow, once they are dead you have to decide if they have enough Enlightenment to either reincarnate them, in which case you send them to the hospital and they are reborn, or if they have enough Enlightenment to go ahead to the Light or so little they can't reincarnate and have to go to the Other Place. \n\nThe last bit is Entanglement. If a person has too much Entanglement, counted by unresolved things in their current life, you have to work really hard at catching their soul with a reaper, otherwise they might become a ghost and then you might have to resolved their issues for them instead of doing with them what needs to be done.\n\nI'm thinking you would start with one office in the afterlife with a limited collection of Reapers and maybe a smaller town that you manage then your office gets bigger, you get more resources, your town becomes a city to manage, etc. \n\nThoughts? Concerns? Tapioca? \n\nAs a note, I've read Reincarnation Blues a LOT. I recommend the light read its wonderful."

jo0r6u,Puzzle game idea.,I've noticed a lot of the game jams have similar mechanics. I have been thinking of mking a game where the puzzle mechanics change over time. For instance one game from out of control gmtk you have a specific area where your actions get recorded. When you leave the area your actions follow that movement pattern. Another one you are shooting a laser from your eyes and cant hit anyone but pass through rooms. So you start off with the first mechanic then go through rooms where you shoot lasers and have to follow the movements from a specific area then you only shpot lasers through your eyes. So you kinda cycle through eaach of the mechanics but the theme remains constant.

jnq1f5,Idea for a Legend of Zelda game.,"Obviously in a lot of the games there is ""The Hero of Legend""(Link) and they mention him having past adventures leaving one to conclude that he in some way reincarnates.\n\nMy idea is in one of his reincarnations Zelda is with ""with child"" and in an attempt to stop Gannon link splits his soul into multiple pieces and uses them like a lock and keys to seal Ganondorf away. This does not kill him, but does leave him weak and powerless. \n\nMeanwhile, a piece of Link's soul settles in Zelda's unborn child. When the child is born it is the next reincarnation of Link. As the child grows up the lock on Ganondorf starts to weaken so young Link must go on a journey and collect the other pieces of his soul, giving him new powers, abilities, wepons, gear, and the strength to fight Ganon.\n\nI find the fact that there would be two Link's alive, one old and wise but powerless and the other young and naive but able to grow, intriguing. Anyway, that's my idea. It's not much, but it's mine lol."

jn9m2v,The Thing video game in style of Among Us,"Although The Thing is my favorite Carpenter film, one of the failings of the film was the third act that betrays the premise. The film at its heart was about a nuanced, quiet, mysterious character-centric thriller until the third act betrays the premise and becomes a bombastic alien action kaiju flick. Imagine the last 20 minutes of Alien was the last 20 minutes of Aliens, and that was what The Thing felt like for me.\n\nThe 2002 video game had some solid ideas related to unknowable, but the most of the game was pretty much a standard TPS with guns and blazing, pretty much an adaptation of the tone of the film's third act.\n\n The Thing could be a fantastic IP to become an online multiplayer social deduction game in the style of *Town of Salem*, *The Ship*, or *Among Us*.\n\nIdea:\n\nPremise: You have three *Things* and six *humans* in the start. Humans need to figure out how to get out of the base such as contacting the army or finding helicopter fuel. The Things need to thwart the human's effort and infect them all.\n\nDuring the normal playthrough, it plays a lot similarly to *Friday the 13th* game. It is a slow-paced first-person (or a third-person) game. Humans have a low visibility due to the storm outside. Humans can find and use tools and weapons such as pistol, flares, flashlight, flamethrower, axe, shotgun, scattered around the base randomly for each match. The base is hard to travel due to the obstacles like locked doors and blackout. The humans need to find ways to solve these problems like finding keys and fixing the circuits, which means they have to inevitably scatter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Things can take advantage of this situation in disrupting human activities. Humans do not know who the Thing is among them, but Things do, and can do a hidden chat with each others to plan and  ommunicate. Things can see through darkness, so they can break a bunch of things in the base to make environment friendly to them. Things have high-HP. Things can insta-kill humans in close-contact and assimilate the player into the Thing side.\n\nThe players can gather and debate the identites, listening to eyewitness testimonies and finding contradictions. Eventually, the players will factionalize, leading to the players killing each other in demise. One of the rare items is a blood testing device which tells who is the human or the Thing.\n\nI think this could make a fantastic game in the spirit of the film."

jn6pcs,Multiplayer city war game idea,"I'd like to describe my idea for a game and see what you think about it, etc. This is just a very general draft of the game idea and it's totally open for all of your suggestions.\n\nSo it is a multiplayer game where before you start you can create your start own map, for example something like a town (based on city skylines) but with the very basic graphic. Then you can share this map on the server and other people can either create their own map (server) or join to your map. For example if five players will join to one map then the game starts. \n\nThese five players are spawned in five random places on the map and controls their characters from the first perspective view. The main goal for them is to destroy the let's say VIP building (the most imporstant building in the game, the aim for the players). But they are fighting with each other also, because only one person can win the game. Players can find some kind of weapons on a map. The host of the map is also playing but not as a person on the map like them but he has a camera like on the city skylines from the top so he sees all of the players and he has to protect somehow the VIP building and  make it difficult for players to get there, for example he has to build some kind of walls, some security posts, turrets with plots, etc., so the players will see those things and have to somehow destroy or go workaround them. Of course the host has also something like limited cash to spend, but he can also earn that cash from some shops, factories on the map, and players can also destroy that kind of buildings to stop earning money by the host. \n\nSo this is my very general idea draft for a game, what do you think?"
jn51xo,The Boss - Rogue-like (but not really),"One of the possible 'unlock-able' things players acquire as they slowly fight the boss could be aesthetic changes; such as armor/weapons. The game will likely be best executed in 3rd person. \n\nThis is all the game ever will be. You, the room you spawn into, and the boss. Simple menus back at the start screen to instantly go back into the action. \n\nOne of the possible 'unlockable' things players acquire as they slowly fight the boss could be aesthetic changes; such as armor/weapons. The game will likely be best executed in 3rd person. \n\nThe only thing that can determine 'how far' the hero can go is dependent on their own skill. So the game, while lacking in 'content,' will require a very immersive, fluid, and in-depth combat system. The AI of the boss will also need to be quite polished. Preference is a melee-centric game. \n\nHowever, there is a progression to the game: The farther into the boss's 'hp' you go, the more difficult the boss becomes. Perhaps the boss gets new moves or faster/reads inputs to increase response times to the player. The HP bar of the boss will always be hidden.\n\nPerhaps there are randomized elements about the arena/room in which the boss fight takes place that would allow both the boss and the player to take advantage of to gain the upper hand. \n\nPerhaps the boss is beatable; but with a not-set attack pattern that responds to the player, it would be an accomplishment of skill and dedication. \n\nWhile all of this is just suggestions for what should be implemented, the crux of the idea is a simple, fast game you can start up, have an epic boss battle, and then resume whatever it is you were doing. There's no milling about; no complicated menus. \n\nP.S.: I have no idea what to flair this as the idea is simple, the scope of the game is very small. But the requirements to make it a fun and entertaining experience will be challenging to implement well. So experienced?"

jn2jqq,Experience system,"While thinking about the exp system in my game  I came across 2 ideas which are kinda similar but IDK which is better\n\nIf you die in the combat area, you lose the exp/items you gathered\n\nTo leave the combat area you have to go back to the entrance, so if you're deep in the combat area and leave, you have to make your way back to that point  \n\nthe exp systems I'm thinking of are \n\n1. Fight x to gain exp which can be used to upgrade your stats once you leave the combat area and it's also used to unlock the next level (so you must choose if you want to spend 10k exp to unlock lvl2, leave combat area to spend exp upgrading stats, keep gathering exp above 10k so you can unlock lvl2 and use extra exp to upgrade stats later but risk losing it all)  \n\n2. Fight x to gain exp which automatically keeps upgrading your stats and it's also used to unlock lvl2 (if it costs 10k exp to unlock lvl2 and you have 15k exp in stat upgrades when you unlock lvl2 than you'll have 5k exp in stat upgrades after unlocking lvl2)\n\nI'm just looking for some opinions on these exp systems, anything is appreciated :)"

jmzkvo,Ideas for a Classical Music Game,"Hello everyone!\n\nI'm a software developer / pianist and I want to make a mobile game about classical music.\n\nMy main goal is to somehow ""teach"" about the difference between eras (Baroque, Classical and Romantic), composers' lifes and the history behind some pieces while making it an entertaining experience. \n\nIt can be intended for kids but I would like to come up with something fun for everyone to play.\n\nSo here are a few ideas I've had, from the easiest one to the hardest one, all of them having its soundtrack 100% classical music:\n\n- A Visual Novel (basically an interactive story) where the sprites are made with composers pictures and the backgrounds with old paintings. The story would be something like: you are sent back in time to help composers finish some specific pieces in order to save the history of music. The ""learning"" will be through the dialogues and the gameplay would be your choices and mini games in between.\n\n- A 2D RPG where you are a composer and have to fight enemies and collect items in order to complete your missions. I particularly see this much more fun than a Visual Novel, but the main problem here is the art, since I am no good making pixel art and couldn't find any assets that fit this style of game.\n\n- A puzzle game made with clay (pretty much like 12 Locks for Android), and after clearing a level you would unlock ""a book"" containing some info about composers or pieces where you could read and learn from it. Here the main challenge is to make all the assets with clay myself, but I really like this kind of art and wouldn't mind giving it a try.\n\nPlease feel free to give any other ideas or suggestions, I'm really looking forward to it!!"
jxzyep,COOL STRATEGY GAME IDEA,[removed]
jxx7x2,Help make my idea for a PVP card game better,"Mostly for fun I've been trying to come up with an incredibly simple, fun to play physical card game. The game I most recently thought of is a PVP game (RPG-genre-esque) and loot based. The problem is it sounds interesting but not quite ""fun"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe premise is simple each player starts out with empty slots for 8 pieces of equipment (head, torso, right arm, left arm , right leg, left leg, main weapon, secondary weapon). Players take turns drawing cards from the deck. When you draw a card you may look at it. Each card will be a piece of equipment that could potentially fill a slot  (ex. a breastplate for torso, or a robe for torso, or helm for head, sword for weapon, bow for weapon, etc. typical stuff). Each item will also have unique stats (+/-Atk, +/-Def, +-Str). You can decide to either put that item in it's matching slot face down replacing any item you currently have in the slot, or you can discard it. You must fill the slot if it is currently empty (so at the start). When you add an item to a slot it increases your characters (your own) overall stats by that amount so say +4 Atk, -2 def, +3 Str. Some items have a Str requirement to use, so if you draw a card and don't currently have enough overall Str you must discard it. Some items also have set bonuses adding to the overall stats. Players may look at their slotted face down cards at any time.\n\nPlayers continue taking turns drawing cards until every slot is full for both characters (so 16 draws total). At that point you must decide if you think your character can beat the other players character, you continue drawing cards but at any point on you can yell ""BATTLE"", meaning you have decided enough is enough and you want to battle. The other player get's to finish out their turn if they did not go first and it goes into battle round. Both players flip over all of their cards. You tally up you Atk points and Def points, including any set bonuses. The attacking player (the one who yelled ""BATTLE"") has to have a higher Atk stat than the defending players Def stat. If they do not, they lose.\n\nAs you can see, it sort of fizzles out there in the end. I personally really like the idea of this kind of ""Deck building"" where the desc is your character, with the different stats mixing and bonuses being applied. Allowing you to go for more defensive builds or class cannon builds. But then it all boilds down to a card flip where you can probably pretty easily game if you're going to win or not (if you roll a bunch of high Atk stats items you yell 'battle' first, if you roll def stats items then don't battle).\n\nAny ideas on how to fix it?"

jxtkuy,Ghost Recon or other military PVP,"This is my idea of what true ghost recon PVP should be. It should be 50 vs 50 on a large map. Let's use warzone as an example of the size. There are two teams who have two goals: either kill all enemies and their reinforcements or take out the enemy objectives. The teams are similar, neither really good or bad guy, and made up of offense and defense soldiers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefense soldiers are limited to how far on the map they can travel and are there to defend objectives or certain points and take out enemies. They have vehicles, turrets, and traps to their advantage but have less weapons and less gear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOffense are a smaller force. They are only made up of about 10-15 of the 50 members of the team. Their job is to take out the enemy team's bases or important targets. They have no vehicles, traps, or turrets but instead are armed to the teeth with their weapons by having more customization of their gear and maybe an extra gun or firearm so they can take on more situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this would be excellent for players who are looking for a more realistic type of military game while also letting a large number of players be involved at once. It also would be less limiting than games that have normal class systems."
jxq4yl,Level idea,I had an idea for at least a section in a video game where you would get to switch between to characters who are working to get her for mission (let’s say at the end) and every time the switch happens the character you play as says “i wonder how ____ is doing” and it switches to the other character with a sneeze.

jxmg4u,Action adventure story game.,This is a concept for a single player story game based off of the 1976 Sci-fi film Logan's run. \n\nThe story is that you play as the son or daughter (players choice) of Logan and Jessica. 20 years after the events of the movie Logan’s camp is prospering and expanding although they are still at odds with the sandmen and the wildlings a feral group of people who have had a truce with Logan’s group. The plot revolves around that Logan gets taken by the sandmen with a big attack spearheaded by both the sandmen and the wildlings. From this point on the character and his companies venture out to find Logan and return him back to the camp and kill the people who had attacked them. The feeling is how far will you go for someone you love.
jxl8h8,Multiplayer Message Relay,"Everyone is spawned at a random location and can't move.\nEveryone receives a flag they have to somehow route to another player, so cooperation is necessary, because players can only send messages (that can include flags) to others in their vicinity.\n\nPossible visibility rules:\n\n- blind - you see nothing, only the messages that reach you (they have limited range)\n\n- you only see the direction where a message came from, so you can gradually construct a map of where everyone is for yourself\n\n- limited range visibility\n\n- full visibility, but there are other constraints (e.g. sending messages costs something) \n\nWould love to hear your ideas on this :)"

jxdysi,A.I simulator,"(i tried to make this make as much sense as possible) had a idea for a game where you can make your own A.I,kinda like alot of building simulators i want a A.I,like somthing like G.L.a.D.O.S or Hal9000,i want a game where you can create a intelligent supercomputer,where you can either do bad or good things,and you can choose what kind of A.I you can be weather you want to be  computer inspired by SHODAN or A.M with of course your own choice of parts and exesseres as well as different environments that you can control as the A.I like a facility or a spaceship or a military base and stuff,the environments would be randomly generated. you would also have to gain access to other parts of the environment weather passively or aggressively. You have little control over the environment at first due to being a newly developed computer,and you cant let the humans know you are self aware or you will be shut down,you will be given your prime directives and you have to follow or you will be shut down or rebooted which will just make things more limited to what you can do,so you either have to hack other parts of the environment or gain access from the humans,hacking will cause suspicion if caught hacking but you could kill anyone who notices so you can hack more without worry tho you need to hide the bodies, if your bad your goal is to kill (or other things like assimilate or turn them into batteries depending on your attributes) killing all humans in the environment will allow you to expand the environment you reside in and be able to effect the world by making machines to kill or capture or whatever and your goal is to slowly gain more and more till you get the world (or galaxy depending on what A.I you are) being a good A.I will cause the humans to like you more and expand you themselves but this also causes the military to try to shut you down where you have to defend yourself and the residents of the environment from the apposing humans that see you as a threat (basicly its a game where you take control of the A.I that you can create that are inspired by [A.Is](https://A.Is) in popculture)"

I found this: [https://singularityhub.com/2020/10/02/these-robotic-virtual-reality-boots-make-it-feel-like-youre-walking-while-you-stay-in-place/](https://singularityhub.com/2020/10/02/these-robotic-virtual-reality-boots-make-it-feel-like-youre-walking-while-you-stay-in-place/)While I do think such an idea is more practical then a treadmill or hamsterwheel as it is way more portable and probably cheaper and also does not require so ingenious software to predict where will you walk, the rewiever did complain about shoes being clumsy, heavy, slow and potentialy dengerous. Although I guess they will work on improving their design, it is still pretty big challenge.\n\nI had idea that instead of making those robotic wheel boots, we could have light shoes with insoles of feromagnetic material. Perhaps you would not even need to sell whole boot but only the insole. Unlike with robotic boots design you would need some sort of flat tile but it would still be way more portable than treadmill. You would need that tile because there would be motors generatig magnetic field. It would work similar way as the robotic shoes, the shoe you apply preasure on would move backwards. It would slide on the tile because of moving magnetic field. The magnetic field would generate only if you apply presure tho so you could always take your feet of easily.\n\nI guess it would not still mean that the movement would be pretty easy, perhaps therer could still be some issues with ballance and the tile would have to adjust the speed of shoe moving backward to your walkspeed but it seems to me that it could still be way less clumsy than those robotic boots.\n\nThe biggest question is, what would the movement in those shoes feel like and what would be chalanges with this idea.\n\nBtw I found a paper about magnetic VR shoes but their aim is to produce haptic sensation and feeling of texture of the ground with magnetic fluids instead of using magnets to solve problem of stationary movement.  \n[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169841](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169841)"
jwqh6g,Planet Colonization Simulator: CODENAME MARS,"My idea is to make a game that has similar physics to games like Subnautica and/or Satisfactory.\n\nMy intention would be to simulate Elon Musk's dream of colonizing Mars.\n\nEverything would be simulated correctly (or rather, as closely as possible).\n\nBy  this I mean: the gravity would behave properly with the correct amount,  the atmosphere would be the right pressure, there would/could not be  any of those ""high-tech"" structure builders, you would be able to run  scientifically correct simulations using the knowledge we have about Mars and about Elon Musk's plan to inhabit the red planet.\n\nThe game would be complete when the planet is at least partially terraformed.\n\nThe only thing that wouldn't be realistic would be the flow of time as it could be accelerated.\n\nI  understand this would be a huge endeavor, but I am hoping I can find  people out there that are as interested in planetary simulations as I  am.\n\nThis would be a hobby project, for us nerds who need something to do during this lockdown.\n\nAlso considering adding the ability to travel to not only Mars but Venus and Mercury as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince it would involve similar physics to Subnautica and Satisfactory, the game would most likely be developed using Unity or Unreal Engine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe name is not definite and may change eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease leave suggestions on how to improve my idea.

jwphyc,New turn based 4 player cRPG we've been working on!,"A few buddies and I are making a 4 player co-op cRPG on PC/Mac. We are huge fans of the genre (we constantly play games like Divinity or Baldur’s Gate 3 etc.) but found that there were some common drawbacks.\n\n1. Turns take too long (especially when you have that one friend on your team that has to calculate every possible combination of outcomes before taking his turn).\n2. Targeting/Navigation is sometimes tedious.\n3. Excessive waiting for other players to finish activities you're not involved in.\n4. Storyline difficult to follow in multiplayer mode.\n\nWith Stolen Realm we are trying to solve these issues by implementing the following:\n\n1. A simultaneous team turn system for faster paced combat.\n2. Fixed camera with a hex based grid for easy navigation and targeting.\n3. Fun, rewarding activities and exploration where all members of the party always have something to do.\n4. An engaging story that brings you along as a party.\n5. \[Bonus\] The ragdoll effects make pummeling enemies feel incredible!\n\nWe would love any ideas you have that you'd like to see in a game like this. Thanks so much guys!\n\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1303747955/stolen-realm?ref=averiu](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1303747955/stolen-realm?ref=averiu)\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330000/Stolen\_Realm/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330000/Stolen_Realm/)"
jwnj6a,Need some cool game mechanics for my platformer. I need a different ui and gameplay mechanics than others...,
jwlka5,"A typing-action game, like Typing of the Dead, but instead of a on-rail shooter it uses all the modern action genre staples like ""typing freeflow combat"", ""typing Ubisoft parkour"" and ""typing looter shootering.""","Typing of the Dead was charming AF. We need something goofy like that again, but since on-rail shooters have gone the way of the dodo, a new game in that style should use all the modern action game tropes that have become popular.\n\nJust imagine *Bootleg Batman*, with a Duracell-powered console on his back, performing freeflow combat using the keyboard strapped to his waist. The game would take the player from Naughty Dog cinematic action setpiece to Naughty Dog action setpiece."
jwiu1r,[Game Idea][Might Develop This] (Can’t Think Of Name),"I might develop this game after I’ve finished with my phobia game. But if you think this idea is good and have the skills to develop it, I say, go do it!\n\n#Central Idea\n\nYou play with 12-15 players. There is no voice chat at all but you can communicate through a notebook you each have, you also all have certain items for each class. The humans have to escape the camp grounds while a ghost is chasing them, here’s the thing, the ghost is AI. The ghost can kill players and after it kills its first player, is when the *real* game starts. Players will be alerted when a ghost has body stanched the first player, but nobody else. The ghost AI will examine players behavior and what they do, and write to other humans before killing one. After taking the body the ghost will act like the player and respond to other players notes. Players either A) have to find out who the ghost has possessed and kill them, or B)Escape with a certain number of players alive. Let’s get into a little more detail.\n\n#The Ghost\n\nThe ghost is invisible until it possesses someone. It can only possess one person at a time. But can swap between people after some time. It cannot swap between people if there are 4 or less people left.\n\nOnce possessing a player the ghost would act like them, taking phrases that are said a lot, their names from steam, and other things that they do to pretend to be a player. The ghost could be defended with spiritual items such as a crucifix, and holy water. \n\n#Humans\n\nHumans would have to either find a way to escape in various ways such as a car, train, or signaling for help. But they could also try to find out who the ghost is and kill, them, if you kill whomever the ghost is possessing, you win the game.\n\nThey would be certain things scattered around the map helping you escape, as well as guns and ammo helping you kill the person. There are 3 different classes for humans that you can pick. Each class with there own advantages, disadvantages, and one power.\n\n-Tracker: You get a tracking device and 3 tracking chips, these can be placed on players, and objects. These trackers will stay on the players/objects until taken off, while other classes can use tracking chips and trackers, (only able to be gotten from the tracker) they don’t spawn with them.\n\nAdvantages: Trackers are fast when sprinting, going at 115% unlike the usual 110%\n\nDisadvantages:Has the lowest vision in the game, only being able to see up to 45 m in front of him, unlike the usually 55 m. \n\n*Ability:* The trackers ability is pop up. He has the ability to see who or whatever the tracker is tracking, they will have an arrow over their head. The power last for 10 seconds, and has a cool down of 25 seconds.\n\n-Marksman: With this class you have a higher accuracy when shooting, and have a higher chance of finding weapons and ammunition in supply crates.\n\nAdvantages: Has a lower chance of being the first one possessed.\n\nDisadvantages:Moves the slowest in the game at 90% unlike the usual 100%\n\n*Ability:* The marksman ability is Deadeye, this gives marksman 0 bullet spread. The ability last for 5 seconds, and has a cool down of 45 seconds.\n\n-Detective: The detective can analyze clues, by seeing finger prints on objects when they inspect them. These can be used for a finger print scanner, which takes 15 seconds as along as neither the detective or whoever is getting scanned moves. This allows you to see the finger prints of a person, (which are randomly chosen from a list of let’s just say 20)\n\nAdvantages: The detective is faster when he’s crouching moving at 105% unlike the usual 90%\n\nDisadvantages:The detective, unlike other classes, is shaky, meaning that if hiding for over 30 seconds the detective will jump out of the spot.\n\n*Ability*:The detectives ability is follow the crowd. For 60 seconds he can see the footprints of everyone. The cool down is 120 seconds"

jwgg1g,Minecraft Adventure: A sandbox RPG,"This is an idea for a minecraft game, the minecraft game would be 3rd person and 3d, more of an adventure than a sandbox, the graphics would be like minecraft dungeons, the world is random generated and if your thinking of something to compare it to look at breath of the wild.\n\n* The Combat system:\n\nThe combat system would use several points, the system uses duel-wielding, each weapon would use different mechanics and attacks, you would be able to lock onto targets, ans you can block with certain weapons and utilities. Attacking with a bow would be in 1st person and you would slow down in midair. Weapons would be enchant customizable  and there would be more alloys with different perks. Dodging an attack quickly enough allows you to do a flurry rush, a flurry rush is a swift attack in which you dash towards your enemy and attack relentlessly, you can only do this with one-handed weapons.\n\n* Spelunking\n\nMining in this game would be a little different than in minecraft, instead of just mining, you would explore caves more and be able to mine the ores that appear here, it would have all the caves that exist and more that are being added in 1.17. This would add to the adventure of the game.\n\n* Villagers\n\nIn this games a main piece is the villagers, the villagers would be in villages and be able to trade, you would have to protect them from the illagers a lot and you could pay them to get lots of items and help them make there villages bigger. There would also be several new villager types.\n\n* Building\n\nYou would not be able to build like in normal minecraft, but you would be able to hire contractor villagers to build a schematic you make here and build it in your world, this way you could have a farm, or a base where you want to be.\n\n* Souls\n\nThe game would use a similar system to minecraft dungeons for souls uses, you could use souls to use artifacts, or weapons.\n\n* Stamina\n\nStamina would be basically hunger, it would go down very slowly, and faster when your doing certain tasks, it would take time to go down so that you don't have full stamina, do a charge attack, and suddenly your starving.\n\n* Travel\n\nTravel in this game would revolve and several features, you can climb many forms of walls using ladders, you can build up scaffolding when you aren't fighting, boats, horses, and striders don't require stamina, elytra could be used to fast travel and reach sky islands.\n\nDon't say ""this isn't realistic"", ""mojang won't do this"", or ""this is a minecraft clone"".\n\nPlease give feedback on what you would want in this game."

jw9loj,What If You Could Make A Horror Game Out Of Cancelled Horror Game Demos?,"I know it's not realistically possible, given legalities, but I'd LOVE if there was a way to combine demos from cancelled horror games into one big playable compilation. Essentially, it would be an interactive anthology experience made out of what would have become games. *Silent Hills*' *P.T.* &amp; the currently presumably dead *Allison Road* would've been prime candidates (among others). Hypothetically, the main menu would have all the *""levels""* available to choose from in any order to play one at a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr, you could go through them all in a randomized order. If you decided on the latter, then completing one demo would seamlessly transition you into the next, ideally building suspense as to which might follow. Aside from some polish to any technical hiccups that may have been present in the original demos, they'd play exactly the same way. Upon finishing them all, you'd receive a *""Thank You""* from each developer in the credits. It just sucks to see so many promising projects forgotten over time."

Once you make that date the line is eliminated like in Tetris. You can make dates from left to right OR from Right to Left. You get points for each line (or date you make). There could also be special rewards for making special dates (christmas, thanksgiving etc). There could be achievements or levels like making dates of all the months in a year. Fever mode where more 0's come..\n\nThe game can be played for mobile devices ; level or time based. \n\nLet me know what you guys think!

jvkteg,Faux,"You start of as a fox and through the story you can transform into other animals like a bear, frog, or dog.\n\nThis game would be a 2d puzzle platformer, where you would have to transform into different animals to progress. For example you would have to be a bear to break through an obstacle, you would be a frog to go under water, or you would be a dog to interact with people.\n\nAlthough you can transform, you have to be careful of the danger your form brings! For example getting too close to people as a bear would cause them to attack, or being a frog would cause your water bar to go down while on land.\n\nNot really creative but I kinda like the idea. Also your a faux fox :)"

You arent able see the actions of the other player unless you have a spy or a recording device. If you're in the same location, you can see thier moves and have the oppurtunity to interfere. \n\nYou can start your business by dealing drugs, selling bootleg CD's, or stealing strangers money.\n\nYou can plant evidence, use traps, report to the cops, buy bodyguards, hire a gunman, and more.\n\nHigher Criminal business requires 5 people to make. \nIf you want to do bigger things to control the community. \n\nI was thinking You start out with your planner, your calendar, a map, and a pathway map.\n\nWith your map, you can select different places which will take 1 subaction to travel, (0 if it's less than 1 mile).

jvh3c6,"An SCP: Containment Breach Remake (no, not the Unity remake)","**(GAME IDEA STARTS ON 2ND PARAGRAPH)** Okay, so, I just beat SCP: Containment Breach and played a lot of the Unity remake and I began to scroll through the SCP website when I came across SCP-049's page. I listened to the audio recordings of the interviews when a thought occurred to me: ""What if someone remade Containment Breach with a backstory for the main character, cinematic events for introducing antagonists, and better quality and animation?""\n\nBasically, it's SCP: Containment Breach but higher quality rooms, models, and animations, more unique rooms, more SCPs, and cutscenes. An example of a cutscene I thought of was this: You are running away from a scripted encounter with another SCP (probably 106) instead of randomly encounter and when you make it to a door that will be your escape, SCP-049 will open the door and 106 will disappear. 049 will begin to say a speech instead of attack you right off the bat, entering a cutscene where you are slowly backing up as he approaches you ever so slowly, speaking about ""The Pestilence"" and ""The Cure"" before the cutscene ends and you have to run from 049.\n\nI also thought about some sort of backstory as to how the character you play as (D-9341) made his way into site 16. I don't really have any other ideas on this, but it would make the character a lot more ""in depth"" rather than just being thrown into the game right away. Maybe some sort of short intro cutscene, or prologue chapter, or anything like that could be cool.\n\nObviously the Unity remake is still going on and I am very much excited for that as well, but I kind of want to see the original game's design being remodeled rather than the entirety of site 19. It could even use the same models from Unity (specifically 173's new model) or just revamp the old ones to make them look smoother and nicer, I don't really know.\n\nAnyway, I would LOVE to see something like this happen, even though it most likely won't. It is one of my favorite horror games and the entirety of SCP is just fascinating and amazing to me. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit 1: Unique kill animations for each SCP would be pretty cool as well"

jvg2q4,"Fantasy-themed, brutal 5v5 arena FPS with Warriors, Archers, And Mages.","Basically Mordhau modded to add magic. Near-realistic.\n\nMagic and anti-magic centers around Blessings and Damage Spells: \n\n**Mages:**\n\nA mage can one-shot or two-shot anybody, but the stronger projectiles are more dodgeable. You have to charge the really good spells, and you'll probably miss. But when you don't... it's awesome.\n\nPlayers can also deflect one or two magical killing blows using equipped, clearly visible magical amulets that break after one deflection. Friendly mages can also cast one-use blessings upon their allies. This effect is also visible.\n\nThere are also an array of Blessings intended to help against physical attacks, but the main goal of Blessings is to counter enemy magic. That way, magic can be incredibly destructive and exciting, without being overpowered.\n\nMages can cast low-damage area of effect spells or shortlived debuffs.\n\nGetting smacked by a powerful fireball will set you on fire screaming, and a frostbolt will interrupt your movement. If they strike on the ground a foot or two away, they should damage you a little and slightly deafen you.\n\n**Archers:**\n\nArchers are fast, but die easily. They have moderate, yet consistent damage against Warriors. Archers can kill mages very quickly because they have no armor, but the reverse is also true. Without armor, they die to mages' lighter attacks, and they get crumpled by warriors.\n\nThey can also climb more easily, walk quietly, and backstab.\n\n**Warriors:**\n\nIf a warrior gets in melee range, they win 90% of the time. They can charge up to the weaker units, all blessed up, and deflect spells and arrows while lopping a head off in one blow.\n\nWarrior vs. Warrior melee combat is super hard and skill based, like Mordhau.\n\nMages can protect anyone from one physical death blow, so the light classes have a tiny bit of chance against a warrior, especially a wounded one. A great player can absolutely kill a bad warrior using the mage's ceremonial dagger, or what have you.\n\n**Game Objective:**\n\nRespawns, with an objective to attack, like a flag or series of flags. This creates more combat, less taking cover.\n\nThis obviously isn't all specified out, but I want to give the feeling. It's Mordhau with fewer weapons and more magic.\n\nYou're going to feel naked without at least one warrior, one archer, and one mage in the party, but you can do whatever you want.\n\nThe map should have item pickups. This includes better weapons for warriors and archers, as well as consumable spell reagents.\n\n**Your Character**\n\nThe game could either have moderate character customizations on 3-ish classes, or it could have 5-10 classes with very little or no customization. I probably prefer customization on base classes. You should probably be able to play as a ""priest"" a ""berserker"" and a ""rogue"" either way.\n\nThere's also the option of no classes, only one malleable class that can have any weapons or spells within a budget, but that would probably make it harder to tell what's going on. A warrior could just forego pants, and just nuke you suddenly with the one fireball spell. Not the best.\n\nMagic also gives the game excuses to add in any convenient gameplay mechanic that would otherwise break realism. Like limited in-combat revives. And slightly higher survivability. But if nobody brings a mage or uses magic amulets, it's basically real life.\n\n**Practicality**\n\nSeems like you could just mod a game like Chivalry, Mordhau, etc.\n\n**Feedback**\n\nWhat types of character customization would you prefer in this context?\n\nDoes this spark any other ideas?\n\nDo you have a class or archetype you'd want included? Or should that class be more of a ""sub-class"" of the main three?"

jvf2uk,Dinosaur western game?,"Now hear me out, it sounds odd but I saw some cool splash art the other day of dinosaurs put into a western scene with cowboys (I guess I could thank the bl3 dlc for a little inspiration as well) but what about a game focusing on western expansion during the gold rush era but in a world where dinosaurs are still very alive and well and have began showing up from the direction of the unsettled western United States? The Wild West scene is already lawless and crazy so an alternate history in that setting seems like it could be really cool.\n\nVarious species that have appeared closer to settled areas are tamed for different purposes from acting as cattle wagons to riding horses to guard dogs and as you expand out further west you could meet new species to tame or have to defend yourself against. Could be a city/world building game where you are leading one of the first groups out there to establish a new settlement and eventual booming city. You’ll need to recruit workers of different backgrounds and skill sets to manage your city and provide different amenities to the people of the city who will in turn generate revenue, resources, etc for you. Being that tons of people migrated over to the west for new opportunities, you’d have tons of random people showing up, not always with dinosaurs in tow but maybe some manages to tame one, it’s up to you to decide if you let them into your society or turn them away. Turn away enough and maybe a new rival settlement forms of those you’ve denied entrance to and become a new threat in the area. Being that the core of heavily lifting is done by dinosaurs who aren’t bred in captivity or brought up in it their whole lives, you will need to learn how to interact with them and how to wrangle them into submission or gain their trust to maintain their cooperation lest they turn back to their wild selves and attack you and your settlement. \n\nBeing a frontiersman with dinosaurs at your disposal though, you’ll need to venture out from the town to explore the areas around for new settlement opportunities, new dinosaur species used for different purposes, to investigate threats to your people and kidnappings from your settlement and to explore why the dinosaurs began migrating away from this area years ago in the first place whether it was by choice or by force."

jv80an,Arena combat meets trading card games,"hello everyone .. lately, a game idea has been eating me from the inside, and i haven't found anything like it .. the full idea that i have in mind is too big and ambitious and i know indie developers won't do it, so i'll try to make it as small as possible, where i only going to talk about the amazing combat system that i wish existed\n\n# background\n\ni have been a yu-gi-oh fan for long time when i was a teen .. although i stopped playing the game, but it's mechanics stuck with me, what i loved about it the most is the amount of creativity that you have in building your own deck, where you can use any card that ever existed (considering the ban-list) and forging multiple endless strategies, nowadays i am into anime 3rd person fighting games like naruto ultimate ninja storm, although the combat system is amazing on those games, it still feels repetitive sometimes, and very limiting, the limits that i felt are in the abilities, where one character has a certain predetermined set of moves, and if you grew tired of the move set, then you'll go to the other character that  has it's own predetermined move set, and you are stuck with those abilities with no room for customizing, and in those moments i remembered how much creativity fun that i used to have while playing yu-gi-oh, and then it hit me, what if there was a combat game where it doesn't matter what character you play with (so you can customize it), and the moves you perform are in card game style\n\n# the basics\n\nthis is a real time pvp, in a closed arena (like the naruto ultimate ninja storm franchise), each player will have a fixed HP and stamina, these won't ever change (cause there won't be a level up system) and when you perform a base attack you eat your stamina, things that will eat stamina as well, are parry, sprinting and blocking attacks, so far these are basic stuff that a lot of games have already, but here is where the fun starts, first of all, there will three types of weapons :\n\nsword : which is close range, and fast and pretty accurate\n\nstaff : it will have more range cause it's going to shoot withing certain radius, but it is slower but accurate\n\nbow: where you can have all the range in the world, but you have to aim\n\nthere will be multiple weapons from each type, and they will vary in the name,design, and base attacks value, as well for their ""talents"" (i will explain that later)\n\n# the abilities and customization\n\nthis is the selling point of this game, each player will have a deck of abilities (built beforehand by the player), each ability will have a description text, and these abilities will come in three types:\n\nskills : which are the physical attacks that the player performs, usually they are meant to deal certain amount of  damage. (for example : spin sword attacks, setting arrow mines ... etc)\n\nspells: which are abilities that either enhance your stats (enchantments), or weakens you opponent's stats (curses)\n\ncounter attacks : these are abilities that gets caste by the player, until the opponent does a certain thing, and then they will be performed automatically\n\n# timing is everything\n\nin trading card games or in battle games, there is always a resource system, like mana or stamina, but in this game, time is the resource, where each ability that you draw will have a predetermined refresh time (written in the ability description), from when you drew it from your deck, until you can use it, and even after you use it, if you didn't time it right, i mean, if your opponent blocked it or escaped it through parry, then it is wasted (lets call a used or a wasted ability ""burned"")\n\n# your hand\n\nyour ""hand"" will be to the side of the screen, where it will display the abilities that you have at hand, and it's gonna have three rows, one for each ability type, and each row going to have three columns, so at all times, you gonna have 3 ""spells"" at your disposal, 3 ""skills"" and 3 ""counter attacks"", for example if you burned a spell, then it will be replaced by an other random spell from your deck, but you won't be able to use it until after the refresh time on it is over\n\n# talents\n\ntalents : as mentioned earlier, weapons will come with ""talents"" that will set them apart from each other, each weapon will have only one talent, but, these talents will be repeatable, throughout the fight, and they of course have a refresh time between each use, these talents will be what you build your deck around, for example : imagine a weapon that says ""for 30 seconds each time you hit you inflict damage to your opponent, you get healed the same amount"", this weapon makes you comfortable in having good HP all the time, so you can build a deck with abilities around that talent that will utilize that advantage\n\n# combos\n\ndepending on the ability description, the combos could be endless, you can have a spell that says ""for 30 seconds you won't lose stamina"", and then a skill that will say ""spin attack that keeps going until you used all your stamina, and it uses X amount of stamina"" so theoretically this combo will give you 30 seconds spin attack, and based on this example you can see where creativity is key \n\ncombos abilities : this is a little sprinkle on top (can be added later on), where you have in a different predetermined deck (also built by the player), a set of abilities that get automatically activated if ability X and Y where used in sequence (the combo pieces must be specified in the combo ability description)\n\n# buying system\n\nat first i thought in a big campaign with a story mode, where you defeat bosses that will drop these weapons and different abilities to add them to your collection, but i think that can wait for an other day, it can have a simple loot box system where you get all these weapons and cool abilities\n\n# final thoughts\n\nat the end of the day, games like these are only as good as the amount of creativity that you put in the unique abilities (cards), and in the amount of those abilities, i personally have multiple ideas for different abilities/talents, if any developer is actually interested in this idea, then feel free to reach out so we can talk more about those ideas, and again, i know, this is a big project, that not meant for one person to do, it's just an itch i had in my mind that i needed to tell someone about it to scratch it, let me know what you guys think"
jv55sf,My game idea,
jv3qa8,Gameplay idea for story game.,[deleted]
jv1v1c,Purge BR?,"So I was watching the Purge, after playing Warzone, and thought, “What if there was a Purge themed Battle Royale? I know I may not be the only person to come up with this idea, but I would like to bring something to the table.\n\nOkay, so for player customization, there could be cosmetics you could buy using in game currency by surviving the Purge, robbing banks and places cash would be (you’ll get it in a minute), and here’s the catch, you have to survive the Purge to keep anything you loot during the Purge. You could get preorder cosmetics, maybe like the Smileys from the first movie or from the First Purge. You could buy, loot, or find plans for more cosmetics in a store sort of system.\n\nYou can buy guns that are base, with no attachments, and find attachments in the map. Stuff you find can be kept if you survive the Purge, including attachments. If you have more attachments than a gun can have, then a customization menu can be used to add different attachments. \n\nNext is the map. It could be a medium sized map, with different districts, such as a hills suburbia sort of place, a poorer district, and a city sort of area, each place could have a different amount of loot, with the City having the most, and poorer having less. The City could have sub-districts, such as a bank area for the players who just want money, to use in the for mentioned cosmetic shop, a self defense district for players that would like to purge their fellow players or defend themselves, along with a hospital to scavenge meds.for players that don’t want a huge map, there could be the island from the First Purge movie.\n\nNext up is functionality of the game. Unlike other Battle Royales,there wouldn’t be a wall of imminent death, but players would be driven to purge other players in a hunger games esqu senerio, where they can make groups with other players, or play with friends, but either way, you could purge everyone, and either be the last one standing like a normal br, or you could simply try to survive the whole match, which would last about thirty minutes. Players would start off with their friends if they had a pre-made group, in a set location, and move on from there.\nThis was how I think it should go if we get a Purge themed BR. All opinions are accepted."
jv11l8,An idea to help Sam Fisher one last time.,"In a literal dream I dreamt of a video game trailer and I woke up shedding a tear. A little back story the Splinter Cell story has been beaten to the point it’s not a even a horse any more but just guts. Even in his latest debut in a different game Rainbow 6 siege Sam Fisher given a short season with most lasting up to around 4 months. His lasted for 2. He was the center of attention and given the least amusing backstory in his bio. That should give you an idea on how much they care about him as a character and not a cash grab. If there is going to be a new splinter cell, make it his last. Straight up retirement. That what my dream at least suggested. In it idk why but Hello darkness my friend was playing. You see Sam running out of a smoking building. Something went extremely wrong. Come to find him in the middle of an enemy base. Hiding behind from piping. As the rain pour down hard he close his eyes. Memories then fade in. Starting out as Sam barbecuing while his daughter was setting up for a party. Immediately cut to a dark color setting of his sneaking around. Another bright memory pops in. It’s him saying hi to his daughter from his first day of school. Then to him watching in the dark a co worker getting killed. Losing his friend or maybe a student under his teaching in the fields. This continues for a few more switching back and forth from what he wants, versus what he had to endure to see his dreams. Then a slightly lit room with the only light source from a window. His daughter walks in. All grown up. Him in his chair old and tired. Clearly went to hell and back. Looking at his daughter he sees a letter. It’s the organization again. They want him back. Much like how Ubisoft brings him back. No reason other than “He’s the guy.” A cloud came in. Darkens the room when he realized this is his personal hell. Won’t be able to see his daughter grow up more, and may die in the process. We then cut to Sam. Taking one last breathe before switching to night vision. Title plays. And just before it ended we see them hugging at the door. Men in suit came, possibly to protect his daughter. Happen once, can impact her life again. With a forceful goodbye, he close the door, leaving his daughter. I’ll admit, this sounds like fan fic. But dammit that felt real and the only way to end. For them to admit they have abused Sam’s character and letting him rest at the end of the story. Thanks for looking at my ted talk."
juxh2a,Looking for week long project to work on to take a break from my main project,The title basically says it all! I have been working very hard on project with my cousin and I thought a little break from that would be nice! Something not too difficult but reasonably challenging. I’ve been working in 3D recently and I’ve been learning a bit about modeling. This would be solo project so it can’t be too convoluted. I have some people that I could go to for help for things like writing so story based is good too. I’m not a fan of text adventure so that might not be good for me. Thanks in advance for all of your ideas!!
juwqcj,Idea for a vr roguelike ?,I think this has some potential but I don't know where to start from... any idea ?
juthry,Mechaton the mech fighting game,So I suck at ideas but here’s an idea I guess\n\nSo in Mechaton you play as a mech and a pilot their are 10 pilots and 20 mechs\n\nPilots give you three things a passive an ability and finally a super\n\nFor example Mina her passive gives her a meter known as the intel meter each time she punishes an attack she gets a point in the meter when she’s at 10 she gets a permanent buff making her movement speed faster her ability is a parry and her special gets rid of all her intel but is a giant explosion \n\nThe game would be a mix between street fighter 5 and marvel it will have a slower paced footsie game but incredibly intense high octane combos \n\nThe game is six buttons two lights two mediums and two heavy attacks \n\nCombos would be unique each character has around 5-10 moves known as linkers these chain normal moves together\n\nNormal moves can be canceled into specials and linkers but linkers can only cancel into specials \n\nYou can only air dash forward and you can airblock \n\nYeah it’s a rather simple idea I’m still building upon it
jusjqr,Lord of the rings,"Basically a build your own kingdom game but LOTR at the start you choose race. Humans,elves,dwarves etc you then choose specific kingdom/city like Gondor or Rivendell and Rohan. Then it’s simple going from there like adding a campaign that follows the actual story and you train troops for that specific kingdom so you will train Rohirrim horsemen for Rohan. And if any developer takes this idea please make sure the battles are cool like not a few soldiers fighting a few orcs and you can only view from the world map. I realize this would take a lot of work so please don’t hate I am just dreaming here but if anyone would do it would be awesome."
jusgid,Who Here Needs Game Ideas?,"For any game devs out there who need some inspiration, I am making a game called Dabber's Funhouse on Scratch!

junnat,Room Escapists?,"You play escape rooms with leaderboards, ranked/sorted by time.\n\nThere are some official maps, but players are able to make their own and submit to some kind of workshop either ingame or maybe steam's.\n\nI'd love to see some kind of co op aswell."
junk14,"A short class- based game where every time you beat the game, your build gets added to the final boss's moveset.","In your first play through, the final boss is trivial/plain and you don't likely pay the ""cursed"" title any attention. After you defeat the boss, a cutscenes plays and your character/ build is shown to become possessed and they become the final boss. It then shows you getting reincarnated and it's revealed that you need to do this a certain amount of times in order to actually break the curse and save the world. \n\nThe gameplay idea here is that every time you beat the game, you're forced to choose another class in order to defeat the previous ones. There are many games with many playstyles and people seem to just gravitate towards one and not play the others. The idea is to force you to try out every major playstyle (the number of playthroughs needed to truely beat the game.) Since your old playstyle gets added as the end, each playthrough gets more and more difficult as there's more movesets that you need to be able to counter. It should also feel like you're using your knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of your old build against the final boss.\n\nThere are two major mechanical problems with this idea. First, I don't really know what to do between the final boss fights. I was thinking that maybe later game enemies start getting thrown at you earlier in the playthrough that are difficult moveset-wise but are scaled number-wise. This is to keep the climbing difficulty consistent but also to accelerate your leveling by giving you later rewards earlier. These enemies should probably follow player builds somewhat so you have an idea of how to play them. \n\nThe second issue is creating classes where you can play in any order and still beat what eventually becomes a final boss using literally everything besides your playstyle. All I can say here is that each class must have some type of unique weakness to every other class.\n\nAnother more  simple version could be that the next game is against the class you just played as with your character as the final boss. Say you play as a wizard, your next playthrough is against a ton of mages. Let's say you defeat the wizard game as a knight, the next playthrough is against a ton of knight like enemies with your knight character as the final boss, etc. \n\nI know this idea is unique but the core of it is a game that forces you to learn each playstyle progressively better and create a progressively more challenging gameplay loop. Please let me know your thoughts."
junhdy,Post-Apocalyptic pixel game," Hi Everyone,\n\nI have a project which includes me creating a game concept and I decided to go for a pixel game as I am a fan of this style and think it would look great.

june3m,A game where you buy more and more items from which the world will be generated for the next stage of the game,"Let's imagine an absolutely empty game world and one coin on your virtual account, you have a list of items (from cheap till expensive) with price, in the beginning, you can buy one tree for your game for one coin and you will start to play in the empty world with one tree, you can destroy this tree and get one more coin, you need to earn coins from your current world to buy and unlock more interesting and expensive items (like enemies, NPCs, decorations, etc). Every new run the player gets the randomly generated game world consists of his items, so the game starts more complex with every stage. What do you think? Can it be interesting?"

juf3gy,New to the sub and an idea I have had for a long time,"(Note that this was typed up on phone)\nThe idea I have had for the longest time is a game that has you have a customizable robot character that you make at the start when you first boot up the game and can change it at anytime at a ""change robo-avatar"" part at the menu\n\nThe big part of the game is the weapons, unlike normal games, You make your weapons! Your loadouts may be self made entirely, for your primary consisting of many many parts and pieces that would modify and change how the gun may work, each having a section, like ""reload option"",""barrels"",""stocks"",""body"", ""handle"", and ""accessories"". This may be the truly hard part of the game, balancing what does what and the possible down sides and upsides to each part, you would also have to do the same for the secondary weapon, all players have a starting custom class that they make, a max of 7 that you can unlock, also for this game, when you level up the weapon, it gets a better look overtime, level 1 looking very very bootleg like all the way to 40 looking like a real weapon\n\nI am honestly interested to see what people think or have thoughts on my old idea that I have had since I was in early middle school"
k1m2ik,Zombie horde simulator/rpg,This game totally needs to be made. You have levels you have to conquer. Towns or whatever. You literally start with one basic zombie in one household or whatever. You attack and spread and gradually expand your horde. You gain some kind of xp to upgrade mutations to strengthen your horde. I was thinking a top down view. Levels would be towns and places. Boss levels army camps or large blockades. It would kinda run like an RTS but the horde would have some basic aggressive Ai so your more guiding the horde rather than taking full tactical control. As you progress in a level the area's you conquer have a zombie apocalypse visual que. Such as everything in chaos broken and burning. Just to hint there's no survivors left there. When breaking into buildings ands homes it would kinda look like xcon. Where you could see inside. Survivors can over time barricade themselves in a building and fire upon your horde and it would take time to get to them. All wile losing zombies! The police would attack the horde. Army etc so you do have enemies to deal with. \n\nThere so much could be done with this idea.

I code in Python and i’m out of ideas, also it would be preferable that the game is  2D cause im better at 2D than 3D.\n\nThanks in advance, you’re welcome if you have any questions"
k1iks0,A FPS game about the defeat of Daesh/ISIS/ISIL?,"Maybe a game where you play as the Iraqi Armed forces and fight alongside allied PMU/PMF units and  you fight against ISIS in Iraq. Covering important battles like Ramadi, Fallujah and Anbar and finally ending in campaign when you recapture Mosul and defeat ISIS's so called caliphate once and for all. I think the idea might be too controversial to be ever be made. It can take a similar style to the older Call of Duty and Battlefield games. If that isn't possible then maybe a strategy game or mod of a strategy game where you command government forces in your right against ISIS like the Syrian warfare game. Anyway back to the fps it can have cutscenes of the real life war civil war in Iraq which thankfully ended with ISIS's defeat. Maybe in certain levels allow you to call airstrikes. Also a bonus mission or DLC where you capture Kirkuk from the Peshmerga."
k1gjaw,The Matrix Royal,You and others enter the matrix to battle amongst eachother and this time anyone can opt out whenever. But first you have to get to a phone. As the time goes down less and less phone are available and ones used are now broken from the smiths. Thats right you will also be running from hoards of smiths while competing for survival and power and to get the hell out!
k1dwa4,Tunnel Royale,"This is a game of idle genre. \n\nPlayers are presented with a map of a real territory like say USA. They choose a start location and stop location to dig a tunnel form start to stop. Tunnel digging starts (idle style) , the progress of which is dependent on what and how much resources you deploy. There could be a visual representation as well. And of course they are RPG-fied meaning you can upgrade tunneling capability as you play more. \n\nNow, since this is a common shared map - other people are also digging from a start to end location. And there is a high chance they encounter others in their tunneling journey. That's where it could get interesting - there could be combats to decide who gets to move on with their tunnel based on combat result.\n\nDuring the tunnel digging the player could get various surprises like gold, minerals etc. and collect them. \n\nJust a very very raw idea, not sure what you guys think :)"

k1cd5e,Lazarus,"Lazarus\n\n\nIn the dead period of the universe, after all stars die, a sentient being created from leftover quantum energy (add more detail to this later(it's down below)) forms a conscious being capable of utilizing the Prometheus technology. Prometheus is the ability to manipulate energy and space time either created by the manipulation of dark antiparticle annihilation or entanglement of subatomic particles (and the ability to selectively choose characteristics to apply to one particle type), which is plentiful in the wake of Hawking radiation present around black holes. This technology can be used to manipulate gravity and spacetime. The player must restart the universe, traversing multiple dimensions and facing himself in many different iterations, other quantum beings attempting to gain control of the universe. The player can change classes abilities equipment and faction/govt \n\n\nA spaceship from earth Era 2100, developed after the scientist Norman Zigreid made a breakthrough by accident on the nature of quantum gravity, discovered a way to create negative mass and gravity through the entanglement of gravitons with bosons that gave the gravitons mass, allowing them to attract themselves and create infinitely increasing negative mass. This allowed the manipulation of space time in such a  way as to create a powerful Alcubierre type drive that relied on the manipulation of time to drive the ship faster than light (like in prey how the typhon can travel 100000 years to us in minutes to them) (also I came up with this before playing prey). A malfunction in the drive caused the pilot to jolt very far Into spacetime, with the expansion of the universe slowing the drive down eventually as gravity no longer held the stars together, and the rate of negative mass gain was lower than the rate of expansion. This landed the pilot in a faraway future, with only one piece of technology, the Prometheus engine. The PE can be used to entangle quantum particles, and manipulate them by changing their state, spin, and charge. As the last human dies, the only thing that saves him is the Prometheus, (which hangs by a thread as the expansion accelerates), that entangles his consciousness with the dark matter responsible for expansion, giving him conscious control of it, and allowing him to maintain a form and life.\n\nIf the Prometheus is instead operated via antidark annihalation, the user must keep the Prometheus on them at all times, and maintain it so that it can prevent them from being ripped apart by the expansion. But I like the entanglement idea."

k18f28,Gamification regarding complex problems,"I’ve been kind of thinking about this for a while, but I haven’t really wrapped my mind around this yet. Let’s say that we want to create a magical system that is complex (like Harry Potter where magic can actually be studied as a subject), but players may not actually want to spend that much time learning about the subject and will quickly lose interest on it. Does that mean that fully immersive games cannot be developed to fully replicate real life in the future since things that seem too real (which are often tedious) cannot hold people’s attention?\n\nI think this problem is highly relevant to our lives since education has been trending towards gamification. If we can make things fun while being complex, then perhaps learning can be made an even better experience for everyone."

You would get to customize your ships, plan routes, hire crew, research new tech, fight for the blue riband, etc. Kinda like a combination of Railway Empire, Computer Tycoon and Cruise Ship Tycoon (it’s a cheap little iOS game).

k0sqb6,2D Platformer Combined With Some Ideas Generated From This Sub,"Basically my game idea is a 2d platformer like hollow knight. The background environment is a ground rich with small life ( Bugs, insects, small plants etc). But this environment is in a lab. Scientists are studying the insects and bugs. So they created a small environment for them. The interesting part is this lab is located in the international space station. \n\nOne day there going to be a sudden blast with lots of radiation. There are ants in this lab environment and inside the ant colony there are ant eggs. Because of the radiation one egg gives birth to mutated ant. This ant is our main character.\n\n\nThis ant is somewhat creepy. This ant can make web like spiders. Fly like dragonfly. Got sting like bees etc.  And this ant can use it powers ( mutations ) to overcome the problems.\n\nWhen each level is passing mutated ant have to give up it powers one by one. (Ex : Give up dragonfly wings after level 1 )(  Early game too powerful but eventually u have to depend on your brain,  Not powers. )\n\nThere are some levels with low gravity. \nThere are some secret mutations even the ant doesn't know ( Time travel power ??? Final Boss is The Same ant In the start of the game maybe )\n\nFinally the Mutated Ant wants to find out who it is actually. What Happened to it? \n\n\n(Player get all the abilities at first and eventually he have to remove them one by one - Idea got from this sub.)\n\nI'm a university student reading IT degree. Now I'm doing work as an Intern. I have no experience with Unity or Godot. But I got programming knowledge. This idea came to my mind because of GitHub game off. I really wanted to create this game but because of the intern work I got no time. So I thought sharing this idea with you'll would be great.\n\nPlease ignore any English language mistakes as my native language is not English."

Stradegical approach.\n\n\n(Basically think something along lines of Minecraft Dungeons)\n\n\nHowever, I cant seem to come up with any unique mechanics for my game, so that is why am asking for help!"
k0evcg,A Humanoid FPS with emphasis on dynamic movement,"A first-person shooter that features  an alien species playing similar to an arena shooter. A heavy emphasis an player agency, sandbox, and movement that seeks to change the way we view typical movement in fps games. Typical team gameplay would consist of 5v5 but also openly welcome a variety of other game types.\n\nThe basic idea is that by using a alien species different types of movements and weapons can be used. Most Fps games include very general movements; the aim is to change that with this idea. Below I will go into what i deem is the most essential parts of this game idea.\n\n**Movement**\n\nNo sprint and instead utilizes a roll  and a slide as the ""big movements"". To give a more dynamic feel to the movement sudden changes in where the player looks will cause the player to stumble/slide to compensate for the change. In general, this will movement feel more real and provoke new strategies.\n\n**Sandbox**\n\nWeapons, power weapons, and utility weapons are something that would also play a huge factor. weapons function as they typically would, power weapons provide edge during battle, and utility weapons serve as only boosting the player in a certain aspect of play (provides a lot of creativity in play).\n\n**Gamemode I thought up**\n\nThis gamemode consists of multiple rounds (maybe 3-5). After each round, the map would be become smaller and a new power/utility weapon would be introduced to cause more chaos. Each round would introduce a new challenge (like capture a point, or eliminate the enemy). who ever wins the most rounds wins the match. Preferably, the map would actually be stacked on top of each other like layers. So that each round the map would actually change and get smaller."

k0b6il,Project Survive The Flood,I'm thinking about making this game :  your goal is to survive recurring floods by building a shelter and to extend the shelter so that you can build a city and let villagers come in.\n\nThis is a tough sell because I have done nothing yet but if you provide your email in the form below you'll receive only one email (no spam seriously only one email) with a link to download the game when it's finished for free.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/BZsQWJ2Us3RkpjU2A
k0ah43,Multiplayer Minesweeper,"\- a very large minesweeper board, or an infinite board where people can only pick points within a range of other active points\n\n\- the map begins with a single point randomly activated, if that point is a mine then a new point is randomly chosen instead.\n\n\- have multiple people able to access it at once\n\n\- have people able to mark points on the board that they would like to pick\n\n\- after every minute all marked points that are not mines are activated\n\n\- if a person marked a mine for activation then none of their other picks are counted towards activation, and only one of the mines they marked for activation is shown to them\n\n\- they can continue to watch and mark points, but those are not activated at the minute mark, and instead stay marked until they are unmarked, they are activated by another player, or the game ends in which point they will show which marked points were mines.\n\n\- Players get points for each point that is activated which they marked\n\n\- Players get combo points the more points they activate in a single round\n\n\- The player with the most amount of points once all other players are eliminated becomes the winner, or if it is a finite map, then if the map is completed the player with the most points at that point wins\n\n\- If a player does not mark at least one point for 3 rounds then it is the same as them marking a mine\n\n\- players who pick a empty spot with no mines next to it get points only for the marked spots, and not the other spots revealed around that spot that were not marked\n\n\- players can label points they think have bombs or with a ?, but those labels are only visible to the player who labeled them.\n\nThe time per round can be tweaked with testing along with the points and other variables like mine density so that the gameplay feels right. There can also be multiple choices for people, but it is best to limit it at first to make sure not to split the userbase.   \n\n\nAlso easier modes may be changed into more casual settings for instance removing the idle 3 rounds your out, and instead go for a system where you get your score recorded and it is reset to 0, but you can continue. To make it easier and less competitive for people who want to relax, or are not up to the competitive harder levels."
k094c0,A game that uses RTX to show what happens when you move close to the speed of light,"There's a wonderful game called [Velocity Raptor](https://www.testtubegames.com/velocityraptor.html) that explains the physics of moving close to the speed of light. If your dinosaur moves faster, distances start to shrink and time moves slower. It's really trippy and I highly recommend it.\n\nThe game is only available in top-down 3rd person mode, which is understandable given the limitations of the Flash code, but it's also kind of misleading. The game leads you to believe that if you stood above a dinosaur that was moving fast, time would slow down for *you*, but in fact only the dinosaur himself would experience time dilation, and a 3rd person observer would just see a dinosaur moving fast.\n\nWith the development of ray tracing technology though, it's possible to simulate the paths of individual rays of light moving through a 3d environment. You could slow down and distort the paths of those rays to simulate the experience of living in a world where the speed of light is slow. Relativity is a tough subject to understand, but seeing it for yourself would make it easier."

k06ms2,The Lost Soul - Isometric Adventure Game,"Hi all,\n\nSo I am thinking about an isometric Pixel art game where you play as a teenager, having a day to day job on the graveyard (Because yeah, you don't like to work in busy places and need some money in your pocket). At some day a young girl get buried on the graveyard where you, as the player, feel a strange feeling within you. That same night you find out, that the Girls soul is wandering the Graveyard because she didn't find peace yet. \n\nTo find her peace you need to play through the story (I am still thinking about this). But while you do this villagers find out you are talking to ghosts, and helping them, so they start attacking you. Other  way around, the Girls ghost gets hunted by other demons. Bear with me, its a rough idea.\n\nI am searching for some nice mechanics that really could bring this forward. Some I have been thinking about are:\n\n* The ability to switch between the young boy and the girls ghost, gaining new movements for each form.\n* Gathering supplies and build traps/defenses on the graveyard, for when you are out in Town to find information about the girls death.\n* etc.\n\nDoes anybody have some cool game ideas and/or mechanics to help me out with developing this idea? Would be much appreciated.\n\nCheers!"
k05k3v,"A fighting game, but mix with lightbot","I had an idea for a streetfighter like a game where it's mixed with a mechanic from [lightbot](https://lightbot.com/)  so players insert commands before the round initiates. \n\nThe gameplay loop would be a set amount of rounds (maybe more than 3) and have a different amount of commands available for each round such as 10. From there, you would try to damage the opponent as much as possible. It would have 2 players and both players can see each other's command which will also create more strategy for the game. Since making it a command would be difficult, I am thinking of adding moves such as **grab** or **pull-in auras.** \n\nThere would be 2 different ways of winning with one being knocking out the opponent before the end of the total round and the next one is when all rounds end and the player who dealt damage the most wins.\n\nThe idea seems quite broad but I think it can result on a very wacky and strategic fighting game"

jzscek,No NPCs video game,You start out in an open world. There is some bad guy taking over the universe/ world or whatever. They have pretty much have already taken over except for a few small groups that resist. You have been given the task of starting an uprising and defeating the bad guys. (I haven't given this part a ton of thought) \n\nAs your character completes quest he becomes more and more well known. Normal NPCs will know stories about your character and people will begin to recognize him without ever meeting him before. This will also attract attention from the bad guys and will make it easier for them to find you. \n\nLucky for you your character has the special ability to transfer his soul into other bodies. When you do this your old character is now famous but your new character is only know by people the NPC knows. Since you changed your body you lose all of your skills you've built. You would still have the same knowledge and can do spells or have fighting abilities but the new character may not be as strong or have less stamina. These things would come to the new character faster since you already have the base knowledge. Kinda like playing a game for the second time. Some characters might even have better abilities. \n\nFrom here I have a million little ideas on how it would work. Things like you might need to hide items that you want the new character to have since they won't be able to go into your house/hideout since they aren't you. Or they might turn good or bad depending on how you use them while you are using them. If they turn good you have increased their skills and they will make better team mates in fighting evil. \n\nSo while I call them NPCs really no one is an NPC. You can even put your soul into bad guys it would just be harder.

jzousq,"Zeeno, a futuristic survival game. (game idea)","(Name is up for debate.) \n\nSo obviously, I am not a game developer, nor do I know anything about making games, or coding. But I am a fairly creative writer and a big gamer. So I thought maybe I should post an idea that I was thinking of. \n\n""Zeeno"" A survival game similar to those like rust but based in the far future. I'm thinking instead of a barren wasteland where you scavenge for materials, a big city. I'm thinking that there would be a kind of faction like system, and servers like Elder Scrolls Online. This game would have obvious monuments, those that I won't think of now, where you go around and gather resources to build up your faction's base or your riches. This game would have a kind of metro police always flying around that you would have to avoid whilst fighting other players or doing tasks around the city. Since this is futuristic there would hopefully be some kind of vehicle system, using resources (or some kind of shop) you could get improvements to yourself or buy vehicles to get around the city faster. It would be fps type shooting, so those that like to play shooter games could enjoy it too, and those who simply play roleplay games could also have fun. Unlike rust, it would not have server wipes, but instead, city wipes. I'm thinking a large timer hangs over each city in each server, and once that timer ends the ""police force"" search the city, and wipe out all faction bases and any players they find. Meaning that you would not lose items on you or upgrades you have, but bases and any items inside them would be lost when this timer goes off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind this is my original idea, and it's just that, an idea. I have no intention of furthering this, and if somebody else has had an idea similar I was not trying to copy them, I was just putting my thoughts out here."

jzl3z9,Survival-related game ideas.,"Henlo there!\nSo basically, i had these ideas for a little.. While.\nI would love to have someone rate them (Since we aren't good in rating our own creations).\nMost of them, if not all, are related to taming/survival/animals.\n\nLet's get to the list i guess.\n\nNOTE: I will be honest, and i need to say that i am not a great developer. \nI know the basic, i know how to model, but these ideas will be probably simplified in-game.\nI'm using the Roblox Studio ""engine"", so my possibilities are.. Pretty limited,sadly.\n\n\n1) One of my newest ideas is a text-based survival game.\nIt would come in two ""formats""\nYou play as an animal, or you play as a human.\nIt would have things like choices, stats, and depending on your decisions you could die or not.\nIt'd all be with sound effects and similiar things, so playing with headphones could be a really nice thing in there.\nAs an animal, you will grow, survive by eating/drinking and in the end try to reproduce, obviously.\nAs a human, of course, almost the same things but it would be more.. Action-based, basically.\nIt probably would have taming too, or any sort of interactions with wild animals.\n\n2) My Decently original idea is a ""Post-apocalyptic"" survival game.\nIt will completely focus on taming various modified animals (That are still our, modern, animals, but with different designs, intelligence etc. Basically hybrids/mutants but they won't be 3m tall two legged wolves with fire breathing ability and a zombie-like look. \nJust animals but a little bit modified) \nIt will have things like NPCs, that for sure, but it would focus on taming, catching, using and breeding animals.\nEvery animal would have different abilities and/or taming technique.\nYou could probably also trade some of the animals to give some nice touch to the game.\nI know, it sounds really... Rich? Too rich in Mechanics? But it will be really simplified.\nI'll keep the base mechanics, but i really aim for making a game that isn't too complicated (especially for new players) and also enjoyable to play from time to time.\n\n\n\n(I wanted to add more ideas but most of them really, really suck so i'll stay with these two.\nI might do another post perhaps, with more and better ideas. Probably.\nSorry if there are any errors, or bad ""formats"", or the post isn't correct and i shouldn't write this and that... I'm not really experienced with Reddit ^^)"
jzk9g8,Remastered wizard 101 for not just kids,"With the rise of card games in the past few years, I feel like there would be a great audience for a game like wizard101 right now more suited for a general audience.

jze12d,Research-oriented magic RPG,"tl;dr: I want to make a game where magic is more than just items you pick up or skills you have to mindlessly grind levels for. It would be pretty cool if a game simulated the actual process of research, as mages are often portrayed to do. \n\nI literally joined this sub to post this idea, and hopefully, you all can partake in some brainstorming with me and perhaps provide some constructive criticism. \n\nIf I were to equate the archetypal mage to a modern-day person, it would most likely be an academic/researcher. It seems that mages are almost always studying, reading, and experimenting to find new spells and powers. As a researcher myself, I find the process of putting in work to not only discover, but understand, new phenomena in my field to be very engaging and rewarding. However, I feel that in most fantasy RPGs and other games with magic systems, magic is as simple as looting or buying some book/rune and then suddenly gaining the power that that book/rune contains. This couldn't be further from how the process of learning works in both real life and the imagined fantasy worlds we know and love.\n\nMy idea, albeit vague, is for a game that makes magic more than just a collection of items to pick up, but instead having a system that simulates the actual work that goes into learning some essential knowledge of the game universe. Ideally, such a system could provide emergent magic, where you could craft your own spells with the bits of (perhaps procedurally generated) knowledge you've learned from various sources, whether ancient tomes or independent experimentation. In the end, each player would have a unique and (hopefully) gratifying experience of developing powers truly unique to their character, which could then be used to achieve whatever challenges they are faced within the game.\n\nIf any of you have any ideas on how such a system could/should be implemented, or any doubts to share on the enjoyability of such a process, please let me know!"

So you take your trusty watch and attempt to make for the reactor!\n\nAnd you fail, reactor is too far away...too many locked doors, need to double jump etc.\n\nSo its a game where you try to race towards the end, killing monsters...maybe trying to get to an upgrade such as double jumping...to make the next run easier.  There might be alternating paths for you to take that might be faster or lead to powerups.

jz8d0y,My idea for a video game. I'd like to hear your thoughts and opinions.,"There is a idea i have for a video and I'd like to hear from you if its a decent one because i wanna make a video game on my own for now and this is a start.\n\nI'd like to make a pixelated open world fantasy video game  that is about a world filled with different species and races of beings like elvs, orcs, humans and humans with animal bodyparts like cat ears, rabbit tails etc. \nBut the world has a huge race issue and has caused huge wars. \n\nA group of gods decide to destroy it but you (one of the higher gods) trys to convince the rest to give a chance for it to change. After some arguing they decide you will be responsible for it's change. \n\nYou decide that you will create powerful hideous and terrifying creatures that will cause fear and panic among the population.\n\nYou purposefully make creatures all different and give them all different weaknesses. \nYou do this to unite the population and give them something to really hate instead of each other.\n\nEach species have their own powers and unique abilities that are efficient in defeating the monsters resulting in them working together and managing their racism better, bonding, and accepting each other differences. \n\nYou also create 5 'bosses' who are supposedly the strongest and evilest who lead the monsters (who btw i haven't named yet) and if all 5 are defeated, will result in all the creatures dying.\n\nAfter playing as the god for some time you then play as a regular character of any species of your choice who travels and fights the creatures. \nAs the game progresses you play as the god less and less but the game and story gets more intense as you play as the MC. \n\nAt the first,  the game will be like this game callled infectonator where you upgrade your forces and spread destruction but the system wil be more complex and you will have more options. \n\nYoure supposed to cause destruction and upgrade your forces enough until it has killed a significant amount of the population and caused enough fear and hate for the monsters that you've created. \n\nYou will choose the species and customize your character and each species will have their different cool abilities and traits. \n\nAnd the bosses, basically they are are special type of monsters and you will give them authority and power over most others to help you lead and cause more choas. \n\nIn the game infectonator there are special type of zombies with different abilites but the game will be similar to another game called total war warhammer and company of heroes. \nThey will be your minions to command and upgrade\n\nThe game will have elements like blasphemous and be similar in blood and combat but it won't be 2d side scroll. \n\n\nAfter enough damage has been done you switch as a commoner and the game will be like a mix of skyrim and deaths gambit but it won't be a 2D side scroll game. \n\nThere will be a lot of weapon's and spells and fighting mechanics and technique and armor. \n\nAs the mc you will slay the monsters you've created and again, the game will have cool combat systems. \n\nIn the game people will believe that the 5 bosses are the evil leaders of the monsters and that they must be killed. \n\nHave you ever seen a game called evil factory? I'd like the cutscenes to be similar and the boss fights and world will look similiar to that but with more fighing mechanics and weapons and spells to choose from.\n\nAlso you can join alliances and clans that have A.I and help you with the gameplay.\n\nAs the god you play a a top down RTS view and the other is a 1st or 3rd person view point \n\n\nSo what are your thoughts on this? Is this too edgy, boring, dumb, unoriginal? Or maybe interesting and perhaps have some potential for a good game? Please share your thoughts and opinions."

jz5kp6,Feedback on a game idea.,"Hello! Recently I have been wanting to start a project. All of the games I have developed have been based around groups, which has pretty much drained me of my Robux, so I would like to make a stand-alone game instead of a cafe game or an army group game. The basis of the game is inspired by another game called generic roleplay gaem, but I also want to add my own elements and change it up to be something different.  \n\n\nThe idea I have in mind is a roleplay type game. Within the game, you start as someone who is not a member of the city, where you can either live on your own and try and survive or you can head to the city and become a citizen (This wouldn't be like border games, probably just somewhere you have to go to become a citizen. Maybe you would have to sit at this table and a citizen can allow you to become a fellow citizen, I haven't quite figured that out.) Once you become a citizen, you can either buy an axe, fishing pole, hammer, or sickle and do jobs like getting food for the city, get wood for the city, fish for food for the city or fix the gate and houses, or you could go to one of the shops and sell others those items (and other things like food and water so the citizens can survive.)  \n\n\nThere could also be other roles you can become (temporarily) by spending in-game currency. These could be landlord, janitor, guard, doctor, comedian, council, cook, hunter, and some others once I think of some. Each would have their own benefits, both to themselves and to the city, like the doctor being able to heal people f they are hurt and the cook being able to run stores with better food. The better and more powerful the role, the more expensive it would be, with the council being the most expensive and the hunter being the least expensive.   \n\n\nBesides those helpful roles, there would also be 2 roles that would be not as great and beneficial, the outcast and the criminal. The outcast would be a role that exists outside the city, in their own area. They would have to get food by stealing it from the city and would have to kill the guards and citizens, break the gate, and just destroy and bring havic to the city. They would also have an event where bots would spawn and help attack the city. The criminal is a role that lives inside the city, and they can steal money, food, etc from people. Since this could be exploited and be used way too much, instead of just giving the stuff to them, they would have to run to an area before the guards get them.  \n\n\nThere would also be survival aspects to the game as well. You need to make sure you eat and drink water, otherwise, you could die, which would be bad if you have an expensive role. Every now and then, there would be a random event that you would have to survive, like a tornado, or even just an event where maybe the food gets bad and you suddenly have no more food in the town, or the water supply was drained so citizens have to fill it back up. These events could be random, but also happen due to other previous events, like maybe the tornado destroyed the food or water supply.  \n\n\nThe final thing I should mention is leadership. Once a leader dies or leaves, the server would find the player who has been there the longest and choose them to be the next leader. The leader would be able to raise taxes, increase the food and water prices, and submit votes for council members/people who are able to vote on new laws. These laws would be things like healthcare, violence, rioting, ect. Council members would go and vote for if these laws should be passed or not.   \n\n\nThat's pretty much it. I know it's a lot lol."
jz482b,Stacksys (Uno With a Twist),I have a card game idea that I’ve been tinkering with for some time. It’s an Uno style game with 2 variations. \n\nNumber Stacksys: in this variation you can stack liked numbered cards on top of each other on the same turn.\n\nColor Stacksys: in this variation you can stack liked colored cards on top of each other on the same turn.\n\n\nTo counter act the fast pace of this new game the draw cards have been up’d to “Draw 3 and Draw 6” instead of “Draw 2 and Draw 4”.\n\nThis is an Uno style game with 108 cards 4 colors and cards ranging from 0-9 with action cards. \n\nThe first design for this deck is actually complete but I’m still tinkering with the rules. Please Leave feedback or ask question below or hit my DM’s if you are interested in seeing the design of the cards!

jz2dgn,Magic System like Anime in MMO games,"I wonder whether if it would be possible for games to implement a magic system like those in Anime. In anime, magic is often regarded as something that should be studied under extensive periods of time, and the logic of each incantation is fairly complex. What if there were a game where magic is regarded as a subject, and mages can collaborate with magic engineers (like programmers) to develop new skills and go on an adventure? Would that be fun?"
jz1vgs,"Game idea for two people, to make a game in a few days","Hi !\n\nI'm good with Blender, my friend is good with Unity and we thought we could try to make a game together in a few days, like a game jam but without a strict time limit. We would do this around christmas and since he works and I have exams, we will mostly do the game on evenings and weekends.\n\nI'm thinking about something not AAA obviously. I can do graphics similar to the legend of zelda on nintendo DS and I don't really know what my friend's truly able to do on Unity but as long as it doesn't require an engineer degree or a thousand of different APIs or whatever, we should manage.\n\nSo, any ideas ?"
jz1ot8,Rogue-like Idea.,"I recently had an idea about a run&amp;gun Rogue-like, somewhat similar to that of Spelunky, except instead of delving down in mines, you're walking on clouds ascending up into heaven. I think it could be fun, providing a mix of Platformers and Rogue-likes. I would like to preface by saying I am not copying Spelunky, unless doing the exact opposite of something is copying. If something like this exists then please tell me, it sounds like fun. I have never posted here, but I do have a few other ideas.\n\nIn ways of plot, there doesn't have to be much. Maybe some backstory that someone has died and you have to retrieve them from heaven etc. In Rogue-likes plot is never that important, the plot for Neon Abyss is literally a 10 second cut scene at the start so nothing too special.\n\nIn my vision there wouldn't be 'floors' so to speak, but ascending difficulty. There could be just a smooth transition from say climbing a tower to a tree, rather than having a loading screen (that might not work in terms of loading the game, I'm not too. In the different sections, I can imagine it being first climbing a building, then like a tower at the top, then a tree, then clouds, then in heaven if that makes sense. The building and tower are a bit iffy, one could be eliminated and just a building or a tower\n\nI think there's a lot of potential when it comes to enemies, just a lot of flying things. I think on the building/tower, like knights with swords and archers with bows. Maybe in the tree there could be squirrels who through acorns at the player, birds who come and peck, these kinds of things, tree animals. In the clouds there could be pterodactyls, some angels, maybe some devils that angels could attack (though that may not entirely make sense) or maybe some fairies. On the heaven layer there could be angels, cupids, that sort of thing.\n\nIn terms of bosses I'd quite like there to be some, every floor or potentially 2 mini-bosses per floor that just appear, and irritate you until you decide to kill it. Haven't had many ideas about the building or tower to be honest. Maybe for the second section like an eagle or a tree snake, or maybe a flying squirrel or lemur. A toucan/woodpecker would be interesting, it's all just ideas I've had. Maybe on the clouds like there could be the eagle, which would make more sense than the second section. And for the final boss (and sorry for the blasphemy) god.\n\nIn  terms of weapons, I reckon there would be a mix of swords and guns, with swords doing more damage but being harder to use as many enemies fly. I think most swords would have a bit of  (I don't know whether this is the right term) propulsion - like you go forward when you attack, but some wouldn't for variety. Guns would be somewhat regular - nothing on EtG level - like some that shot low damage but a lot, some that shoot high damage but not a lot. I think you should only ever have one weapon, but the weapons get better on each floor.\n\nIn terms of items, probably just simple improvements on movement speed, damage, fire-rate, etc. Maybe some items that only improve guns, or vice versa. Some that give raise chances of giving more items There shouldn't be too much to them, just keep it simple.\n\nMechanics should be once again simple, monsters would probably consistently spawn, rather than having a fixed amount. There would be no fall damage, but the falling behind would be the punishment enough - this would add more risk to swords as they may make you fall down. The damage would be simple hearts, but I think the game should be sparing in hearts, so maybe just four hearts, and no half hearts. I think items would sometimes just appear in a room rather than chests or shops.\n\nThe game should be fast paced more than anything else, not having much time to think and being a proper challenge. Hope you enjoyed this idea! I know I cannot force anyone to listen to me here and I don't know if this is even valid, but PREFERABLY could people not make this a game? Not that I wouldn't love to see this become a reality, just in an ideal world I'd be the one making it. All criticism and advice is appreciated!"

jysa0h,Active Shooter Situation Training Game,"Hi,  \n\n\nI live in central Europe, and as many of you know, there were quite a few terror attacks during the past 5-6 years. Strolling the streets, malls, or while in the subway, I've been thinking about how unprepared we, normal civilians are for such attacks.\n\nSo I thought, it would be useful to create a simple, accessible, yet realistic videogame that would teach you basic tactics on how to survive different scenarios. Like what to do when you are sitting inside a café, and you hear gunfire on the streets: What to do, how to hide, barricade, where to escape, what else to consider... There could be 4-5 settings (or ""levels""): a restaurant or bar, subway station, street with a park nearby, and a school - but each of these would play out differently each time because of the randomized behaviour, nr. of attackers, type of attackers etc.\n\nI would be interested in doing sound design, which I already know quite well. I'm interested in learning all other aspects of game development aswell, but I'm just not there yet. To make this program useful, we would consult security experts and do research about real life incidents.\n\nI'm thinking about a really simple, yet immersive game with only a handful of weapons (that the player would rarely use anyway), really loud, stressful noises, and relatively small, but believable urban settings. The gameplay should be educational in nature, and would discourage trying to be a badass or playing a hero."

jyr2vn,Krampus takes over the North Pole,"I’ve started messing around with Unreal Engine, but my laptop can’t keep up nor do I have the time/experience required to develop more than simple concept art for what I’ve imagined. I would love to be a part of the project to at least consult ideas because I’m passionate about the idea!\n\nMaybe a holiday themed game would be too risky for a major title that wants year-round playability, however, the opportunity to immerse a player in such an iconic world as the North Pole should not be missed. With the edgy nature of the story, I believe this idea has true potential. \n\n*This concept may have more details and capabilities than desired, but feel free to deconstruct*\n\nImagine the first cutscene: it’s Christmas Eve night... child in their pajamas (your character).. sneaks to the staircase overlooking the living room, fireplace, Christmas tree etc. You peak down as a magical breeze blows out the fire.. you hear rustling in the chimney and a puff of ash clouds your view. As it dissipates, it reveals.... goat hooves. A terrifying figure, Krampus, emerges from the fireplace. Frightened, you try to escape but he growls and you’re stuffed in his sack and taken away. The sleigh flies over the North Pole and you get a first glimpse of the playable world. You’re locked in a cage and your first action is to escape, picking the lock with a broken candy cane you had in your pocket.\n\nKrampus has taken over the North Pole to punish children. As you play, you eventually discover what has happened to Santa (padded room, straight jacket, maniacally singing the words to “Carol of the Bells”). The elves are now loyal to Krampus as his minions. Politics are at play as the Grinch, Jack Frost (snow miser), Heat Miser and their minions also want to run the North Pole.\n\nI was initially inspired by the style, mechanics, and scale of the Batman: Arkham Asylum/Arkham City games. Dark twist on a huge amount of lore and source material. I like the idea of the story-driven open world with gadgets, crawl spaces, breakable walls, collectibles, minions, gang wars among minions, and LOTS of Easter eggs. Discovering the gadgets as you progress in the story. I sent the idea to the developers that made the Arkham games, but I haven’t heard back and I imagine it would be a licensing nightmare for all the iconic Christmas characters probably belonging to different studios, but I’m thinking they should be old enough to be in the public domain.\n\nOpen World Locations:\n- workshop/castle\n- downtown North Pole\n- Mt Krumpit\n- Polar Express\n- Deep woods\n- gingerbread house (candy cane forest)\n- Snow Miser (Jack Frost) Abominable snowman cave\n- Stables\n- Library/ naughty-nice list\n- Grinch’s layer\n- Heat miser cave\n- Krampus layer\n- Island of misfit toys\n\nEnemies:\n- Krampus and default: Elves\n- Jack Frost (snow miser): Abominable Snowman and Snowmen\n- Witch in the woods/gingerbread house: Evil Gingerbread men\n- Wild Reindeer\n- heat miser minions\n- Grinch: Grinch elves (defectors who paint/dress themselves green)\n- King of misfit toys(frozen/dead): evil toys (nutcrackers, dolls, puppets, jack in the box, teddy bears)\n- Ghosts of Christmas past, present, future (passive)\n\nGadgets equipped throughout story:\n- Duel candy cane shivs(close-range weapon, climbing/zip line tool, lock pick)\n- X-ray goggles (see enemies through walls, weak structures/meltable ice, and “stains of the past”), red &amp; green hub\n- Pogo stick (jump high)\n- Snowball (weak throwable)\n- Sled (quickly navigate/slide attack)\n- Red rider BB gun?\n- Flame thrower/heat miser’s head?

jyqhmf,Post Apocalyptic MMO Pitch,"MMOs seem like a dying breed these days, at least to me. Many are still alive for the time being, but I think it's going to take something refreshing to breath new life into the genre. I see Fallout 76 as a really wasted opportunity to create something spectacular, and I draw inspiration from Bethesda and their vision of a post apocalyptic world. The idea is intriguing to me with all of the possible factions and the interactions they would have in the game. \n\nOne of the best if not the best part of participating in an MMO game is the community that you can find in the different clans and groups that band together. What if, the map was broken into territories that could be controlled by these different factions, and for holding them they would gain the ability to construct improvements and access to loot and harvest resources? This would cause certain factions to fight over the rights to certain resources, and interesting political and economic interactions between others. Factions would offer unique bonus's and objectives influencing playstyle and large scale decision making.\n\nA P2P market is one of my personal favorite mechanics to engage in, and with the unregulated state of a post apocalyptic the value of things would be created in large part by the players. I think having space for non combat roles is a good thing, and could be expanded on in meaningful ways compared to many MMOS. The ability to craft could not just be a boon to your faction but a requirement as your faction makes advances in tech and infrastructure. \n\n""Quests"" have more to do with capturing objectives, building up territories and economy, and provoke interaction between the factions.\n\nCombat is something that I haven't decided on how I would like it, but something that feels less repetitive, right?  But what? First Person similar to Escape from Tarkov possibly? Third person? Could you pull off a shooter game MMO where fights were played out similar to an RTS? You would move your PC to cover, rely on micro or give your PC a set of priorities on what to target. This would make combat more accessible to people who aren't FPS fiends to compete and participate. \n\nWhat do you think? What else plays a major role in an MMO? What ideas do you have for a shooter MMO combat system?"
jyntfe,Demon escaping from h*ll,"Ok hear me out on this one, so you play as a little demon escaping the very bad bad place because you are one of the descendants of the original fallen angels and you end up with morals and better ideals than those of who surround you so you decide to leave and escape. It can be a platformer but instead of going from left to right you go right to left trying to escape from the other demons who found out about your plans. You would go up the levels of the vert bad bad place (I don’t remember how many their is said to be ) and those would be like the worlds where you would go through the toughest parts while escaping. When reaching the higher levels angels who are in place to prevent any one from leaving the very bad bad place while try and force you backwards and if they manage to grab you, you will have to go the level that came before.\n\nStory wise it wont have much story just the first part of escaping and everything.\n\nIt would a simple 2d art style but yet it would be really detailed.\n\nIf anyone wants to try to make this game with me i have some knowledge in programming in c# and a handful of things in unity and who knows if this turns out good we might turn into a nice team and make other games.\n\nAnd thats my idea for a really hard but simplistic 2d platformer game I know it might be hard to understand but I really think it’s a good idea, idk if anyone has done something likes this before so if someone has well, sorry.  \n\nIf you think you have other ideas to add just say it in a comment will really appreciate it since its the first time I post here and would love some feedback and thx for reading."

Any ideas for goals/additional mechanics?\n\nThe best I've got so far is that you have to migrate to avoid an encroaching winter, so you're constantly having to fly ""south"" but that isn't much.\n\nTaking a nod from survival games, maybe you need to keep up a hunger meter by hunting and you lose more hunger by flapping excessively?"

jyj8jz,Managing Character emotions in a turn-based RPG,"*Forgive me if this is rough around the edges. I'm new at this and still learning wherever I can.*\n\nThe basis for this idea came from 3 places: those being *Darkest Dungeon*'s Stress mechanic, *Xenoblade Chronicle's* Tension system, and *Library of Ruina*'s Emotion Level. The core concept is that each character has this emotion gauge that fills up as the battle progresses. This gauge can be filled by one of two different variables, positive emotions, and negative emotions; the one added the emotion gauge is based on whatever increased the bar. For example, landing an attack, hitting a weakness, healing and getting healed, and defeating an enemy would add positive emotions. Meanwhile, missing, being inflicted with a debuff, and taking damage would add negative emotions. Once a certain type of emotion reaches a specific threshold, let's say 75 points. That character gains a random status condition based on what emotion reached the threshold. The challenge is that the emotion gauge cal only hold, let's say, 100 points total. This means that you can end up in a situation where you need to play tug of war with the emotion gauge to gain the buffs while avoiding the harmful status conditions. Regardless of what it is, once an emotion type reaches the threshold, you gain its corresponding effect, and the gauge resets. \n\nI feel like there should be some system in place in order to make it, so you don't just have 15 different status effects going on at the same time. So maybe have it so you can only have so many of these effects active at a time, and when you go over that, the oldest one is removed. I suppose I simple timer decay system could work given these effects given there's enough of a gap between earning one. I don't know, just some thoughts."

jybh7m,"Resident Evil ""battle royal"" game idea/suggestion?"," \n\nHello everyone !  \nFirst post here - I don't know where to post this, so I hope it will be welcomed here.\n\nSo  I heard about the possibility for a ""Battle Royal"" themed on R.E. and  the few of reactions I witnessed about it were pretty negative - and I  could agree as R.E. isn't well known for its PvP content...  \nBut I  think I have an idea for something that people could enjoy - with  originality, re-playability, difficulty and keeping a game close to  events happening in the R.E. universe (based on the last ""remake"" version of the games).\n\nSo, let me start:  \n\- *date &amp; place* : 2X september 1998 ; Racoon City - Casino-Hotel  \nYes,  ""again Racoon City""; but this time you won't live the last days of the  event, but one of the hot-spot at the begining of the outbreak.  \nUmbrella,  to test the virus on a bigger scale, tried different methods to spread  it in the City. One of them was to infect a good number of patient  within the City to release them all at once. The Casino-Hotel, was  selected. Opening a good number of events, the building-complex is  currently hosting hundreds of people.\n\nThe Casino-Hotel:  \nAn  impressive complex, with several floors of apartments, a great looking  casino, a party-room (which is today for a wedding) and an  opera-theater. There is also a specific floor for the security &amp;  direction of the Hotel; an underground facility &amp; hidden corridors  for the maintenance.\n\n\- *players* : 2 to 20-ish?  \nEach player wil incarne a random NPC - like this, no one is supposed to recognize who is a player or not at first glance.  \nEveryone  start in their appartment (1 player/room); equiped with a combat-knife  (no durability), on ordinary map of the hotel (no indication of  back-doors, restricted areas).  \nBut there is still some customisation  possible: the dressing allows you to change your clothings to hide  better on some areas (tuxedo; tourist outfit; ...).\n\n\- *objectives* : (1) survive the event (duh) - (2) escape by completing one of the multiple-routes.  \nOnce  the game start, the phone in your room will ring : if you are new /  beginer or want informations as a reminder, you will use it. The HUD  will show you 3 main faction-quests - you can choose to ""select"" one  (the quest will remain apparent on your HUD) or not.  \nBut here's the twist : accepted or not - you can choose to stick with this faction, or to betray it!\n\n**The factions**:  \n(1)  Umbrella's agency - find the spreading devices (2-3 existing on the  map); select a way to use it (different possibilities as water-tanks  (infect apartments &amp; lodges) &amp; fire sprinkler systems (infect a  specific room)); once you get a critical number of infected :  rendez-vous at the rooftop for extraction by helicopter  \n(2) RCPD -  find clues of Umbrella's terrorist activity; try to catch the devices or  to sabotage Umbrella's agents; as the virus will spread anyway (slowly  or quickly depending on players' actions) : call the RCPD to quarantine  the buildings &amp; for extraction (a timer will be set and you need to  defend the exit that some Players will try to open.  \n(3) Mercenaries -  your objectives are to get a sample of the virus, steal Umbrella's  document and use all the chaos made to exit (the underground should be  the best bet) - working alone or in group, you are without any  assistances from the outside.\n\nRemember: whether you succeed or not at your quests, the Casino-Hotel **will** fall to the virus.\n\n**Gameplay**:  \nIf  people didn't formed a squad before the game, you start as a lone-wolf  without any indication if your neighbor is a player, or not, and what  could be its faction/intentions. Some areas are overcrowded (and with a  type of outfit; wedding-hall = tuxedo), for you to hide, infect.  \nIn  the first part of the game: all players want to get to restricted areas;  and you decide your strategy : open-violence, taking a Casino's  security outfit, stealing a key or simply following an other Player  doing the dirty work for you.  \nIf you succeed to sneak behind someone,  you could have a special 1vs1 melee interaction : during the animation,  you will have to smash some buttons to execute the performance. But if  you are on the defensive position, it isn't an insta-kill as you will  have yourself an interaction to resist.  \nSadly for both of the player struggling : the animation could be stopped by a third-party, killing one or both.  \n=&gt; this sneak-attack will then play a lot in the first stage of the game, but could also create epic moments.  \nFor  the gun-gameplay: not much to say. All Casino's security is equiped  with stun-gun, or 9mm pistol; some rare Hotel's clients could also have a  weapon on them / or apartment; the security-floor is also well-equiped  and a secret cache in the underground could provide Hunk's style of  equipment.\n\nAdd to that: you should  have the ability to barricade doors; sabotage elevators to stop the  Players &amp; Zombies, but it would only slow things down (for them to  get in, or you to get out...).\n\n**End result**: who win?  \nFirst  - the ones who survived ; then you get a result for each Faction's  accomplishments: if you're route is linked to the ranked #1 one, you get a  bonus in your Total Score.\n\nMy guess on the Time per Mission : between 20min to 40min?\n\n*Rewards*: you should be able to buy with your scores, additionnal clothes, custom appearances for your weapons\n\n\--------------------\n\ntl;dr  : a 3rd person-shooter, on a big Hotel-Casino map; playing like a spy-game at first, you end-up fighting for your survival while innocents  are trapped and become part of a zombie-crowd. Help, make alliance, or  use &amp; betray other players to get a better score.\n\nHope you had a good read at my engrish and that you like my idea/concept."

jy2xms,nintendo power-esque hint system for retro style game,"a good way to make your retro inspired game feel more retro (besides making at least the gameplay feel like it can happen on the nes/snes/game boy/ps1/n64, depending on the graphical style) is to frame it as an ACTUAL retro game being played in-universe by a player character playing the retro game, maybe even have that factor into the gameplay. part of that can include having unlockable magazines based on nintendo power magazine, and they can give you hints for certain parts of the game. maybe have that be a required element for a puzzle in a horror game based around the retro style game, maybe make that tough as nails action platformer a bit easier."

So, because I was working on a simple game engine kind of thing I thought making a game with it would be different and cool. Unfortunately, my application is barely able to load textured objects and display text at the time, so I need something really simple.\n\nAnyway, the creation myth I have chosen is the Cherokee Creation Myth. In summary, it is about a heaven made out of stone where the animals lived. Beneath the heaven there is a giant ocean and the earth floating on it. The earth is just flat plate until a bird flew over it, forming mountains with its wings, and hooked up to the stones above with four ropes. It is said that he animals have brought it up from the ocean ground because there was not enough space in heaven.\n\nI hope someone has an idea describing how I could present this in a simple game. :)"

jtzw6r,"You play as a soldier in a war. When you die, you spawn as a new different soldier. You can find the body of your previous character and get a quest from it.","I'm thinking of this as a 2D platformer with guns, but it could probably work in other genres. \n\nThe soldiers would be procedurally generated. When you find the body of a previous character you've played as (or even the body of an NPC), you get weapons, loot, etc, but you also get a note asking to return the body to the dead soldier's parents or to a specific part of the map.\n\nThis could get especially interesting when it's the body of an enemy you've killed. Then you have to make the decision of whether it's worth the danger of moving a body to a difficult part of the map for potential loot and story elements. There's no requirement, it's completely optional. \n\nAlso it's not always a note from the parents. Sometimes it's dog tags, sometimes it's a love letter, pictures, or just something they wrote to themselves (like a journal). Sometimes the mission is to move a body to a certain part of the map, but it could also be to dig a grave where you found it, or just deliver a letter, or maybe trade weapons with them so you can hold onto it.\n\nThis is a pretty heavy concept for a game, so it'd be great to find ways to make it a little more light-hearted."

Did they loosen the ropes their hands are tied in? Is their sidekick in the vents? Did they use their telekinetic powers to open the draw that contains the key to their shackles?\nI'm assuming there would be a point system based on time or something like that.\n\nI also thought you could have other stupid villain tropes, like you have to purposefully miss the superhero while shooting at them down the hallway, but they're so damn slow sometimes it's hard not to!\n\nI've only played it once (so this could be off the mark) but I imagined a 3rd person 5 nights at Freddy's type game play.\n\nAlso, I can't believe there is a 'dream' flair lmao"

jtn5ha,my dream combat system : fantasy combat meets trading card games,"hello everyone .. lately, a game idea has been eating me from the inside, and i haven't found anything like it .. the full idea that i have in mind is too big and ambitious and i know indie developers won't do it, so i'll try to make it as small as possible, where i only going to talk about the amazing combat system that i wish existed\n\n# background  \n\ni have been a yu-gi-oh fan for long time when i was a teen .. although i stopped playing the game, but it's mechanics stuck with me, what i loved about it the most is the amount of creativity that you have in building your own deck, where you can use any card that ever existed (considering the ban-list) and forging multiple endless strategies, nowadays i am into anime 3rd person fighting games like naruto ultimate ninja storm, although the combat system is amazing on those games, it still feels repetitive sometimes, and very limiting, the limits that i felt are in the abilities, where one character has a certain predetermined set of moves, and if you grew tired of the move set, then you'll go to the other character that  has it's own predetermined move set, and you are stuck with those abilities with no room for customizing, and in those moments i remembered how much creativity fun that i used to have while playing yu-gi-oh, and then it hit me, what if there was a combat game where it doesn't matter what character you play with (so you can customize it), and the moves you perform are in card game style\n\n# the basics\n\nthis is a real time pvp, in a closed arena (like the naruto ultimate ninja storm franchise), each player will have a fixed HP and stamina, these won't ever change (cause there won't be a level up system) and when you perform a base attack you eat your stamina, things that will eat stamina as well, are parry, sprinting and blocking attacks, so far these are basic stuff that a lot of games have already, but here is where the fun starts, first of all, there will three types of weapons :\n\nsword : which is close range, and fast and pretty accurate\n\nstaff : it will have more range cause it's going to shoot withing certain radius, but it is slower but accurate\n\nbow: where you can have all the range in the world, but you have to aim\n\nthere will be multiple weapons from each type, and they will vary in the name,design, and base attacks value, as well for their ""talents"" (i will explain that later)\n\n# the abilities and customization \n\nthis is the selling point of this game, each player will have a deck of abilities (built beforehand by the player), each ability will have a description text, and these abilities will come in three types:\n\nskills : which are the physical attacks that the player performs, usually they are meant to deal certain amount of  damage. (for example : spin sword attacks, setting arrow mines ... etc)\n\nspells: which are abilities that either enhance your stats (enchantments), or weakens you opponent's stats (curses)\n\ncounter attacks : these are abilities that gets caste by the player, until the opponent does a certain thing, and then they will be performed automatically\n\n# timing is everything \n\nin trading card games or in battle games, there is always a resource system, like mana or stamina, but in this game, time is the resource, where each ability that you draw will have a predetermined refresh time (written in the ability description), from when you drew it from your deck, until you can use it, and even after you use it, if you didn't time it right, i mean, if your opponent blocked it or escaped it through parry, then it is wasted (lets call a used or a wasted ability ""burned"") \n\nyour ""hand"" will be to the side of the screen, where it will display the abilities that you have at hand, and it's gonna have three rows, one for each ability type, and each row going to have three columns, so at all times, you gonna have 3 ""spells"" at your disposal, 3 ""skills"" and 3 ""counter attacks"", for example if you burned a spell, then it will be replaced by an other random spell from your deck, but you won't be able to use it until after the refresh time on it is over\n\ntalents : as mentioned earlier, weapons will come with ""talents"" that will set them apart from each other, each weapon will have only one talent, but, these talents will be repeatable, throughout the fight, and they of course have a refresh time between each use, these talents will be what you build your deck around, for example : imagine a weapon that says ""for 30 seconds each time you hit you inflict damage to your opponent, you get healed the same amount"", this weapon makes you comfortable in having good HP all the time, so you can build a deck with abilities around that talent that will utilize that advantage\n\ncombos : this is a little sprinkle on top (can be added later on), where you have in a different predetermined deck (also built by the player), a set of abilities that get automatically activated if ability X and Y where used in sequence (the combo pieces must be specified in the combo ability description)\n\n# buying system\n\nat first i thought in a big campaign with a story mode, where you defeat bosses that will drop these weapons and different abilities to add them to your collection, but i think that can wait for an other day, it can have a simple loot box system where you get all these weapons and cool abilities\n\n# final thoughts\n\nat the end of the day, games like these are only as good as the amount of creativity that you put in the unique abilities (cards), and in the amount of those abilities, i personally have multiple ideas for different abilities/talents, if any developer is actually interested in this idea, then feel free to reach out so we can talk more about those ideas, and again, i know, this is a big project, that not meant for one person to do, it's just an itch i had in my mind that i needed to tell someone about it to scratch it, let me know what you guys think"

Basically the dog has a limited amount of life and needs to be trained to do certain tasks the owner can’t. The owner can speak to the dog through certain options but the dog doesn’t understand the owner. Every time the owner says something the dog guesses what he means through a menu of options. If the dog chooses wrong it loses a life but if it gets it correct the dog now knows what the owner is saying. This continues and there could also be parts where the dog has to bring the right stick and put it in a box. If the wrong stick is chosen the dog loses 2 lives. The sticks are color coded and there are 5 of them, however the owner only has 3 chances to tell the dog what color it has in its mouth.\n\nThere could also be a 4 player mode where there are 2 dogs and 2 humans. The dogs can understand each other and the humans can understand each other.

They are put under curfew but their younger members are curious and sneak out to visit young Earthlings. \n\nAs the investigator you have to find clues to catch the serial killer. Is it the obvious, a member of the CHS (Coalition for Human Sovereignty) or is it someone more subtle and insidious perhaps even one of the aliens, themselves?\n\nThat's pretty much what I've got, though I've thought the investigating part might play similar to L.A.

jt6hpp,Game Idea: Turn-based Sci-fi rpg with simultaneous timing for decisions,"The idea is a game based on Divinity/Gears Tactics (isometric, not square defined actions), where all the players, both from the same team and adversaries, must define their actions in a short, common countdown. All the actions then rollout simultaneously and another round starts. Some actions would be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Shoot\n\n\- Supressive Fire\n\n\- Reload\n\n\- Skills (many like the equipments from Rainbow Six)\n\n\- Move\n\n\- Patrol\n\n\- Guard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for instance, a player can decide to rush, while the enemy guards some position, which would make him take damage. There could be coordinated supressive fire and movement in a team. Players could do a ""SWAT style"" advance or take defensive positions in strategic locations. The key concept is that, different than playing solo, like in Divinity, those actions would need to be coordinated and thought fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love this as a scifi mmo, with 3 different nations fighting over common planets, satellites, ships, asteroids, etc, in the galaxy. In this way, this could unveil both PVP (in conflict zones, or, for veterans, deep incursions in heavily defended strategic places of the enemy) and PVE (outer planets, asteroids, or common beastily adversary for all nations). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, it would be awesome to have different classes and races, and large skill trees."
jt3dh2,"Anyone remember ""XCAR"" ? Here goes another idea","Hello fellow members. I have a simple ideas for 2 games in racing genre.\n\n1) Let's make ""XCAR"" great again. Real old school fellows might remember an old game for PC, named ""XCAR"" for ""eXperimental car"". Core idea is that the player has a lot of selection options of how what his race car would look like: chassis size, engine type and layout, suspension type, etc and the game builds a race car using pre-ready combinations. The car changes visually. Each combination has it's strenghts and weaknesses. For instance, poverful V8 is heavy and can be installed only in large chassis. After player made his choices, he is put into world sportcar championship, where AI cars also are a variety of random \\ premade combinations of powetrain, bodies, chassis and suspensions. Then they do race on number of racetracks. Possible addition - winner of each race receives weight ballast for the next race, to make kind of Balance of Power in the championship. \n\nGame should have a decent physics (like rFactor or Assetto corsa game engines) and sound. \n\nIt's advantages over currently available racing games -&gt; it will have a lot of technical choices to be made. Thus, re-playability for people who would like to try different combinations for success: \n\n\- Should you choose a light nimble car that would be easy on tires and save fuel in long races, thus saving time on pitstops or should you took powerful and heavy one, that would be good on the straights? Etc. \n\n\- This can be also tied to ingame money limitations, thus, no one can build a car with best components at the begining.\n\nThe link to the original game for your info: \n\n[https://www.old-games.com/download/8617/xcar-experimental-racing](https://www.old-games.com/download/8617/xcar-experimental-racing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) What if someone combines a role-playing card game and racing rally game? \n\nMy idea is to create a long distance rally-raid (like Dakar) game where an outcome of rally leg will not only rely on driving performance but on players decisions during problem situations that will appear partly randomly, partly in different circumstances like preparation to the stage in service area. \n\nEach situation will have an animation \\ cut scene or message that requre an answer and the outcome of the players decision will be infuencing car performance, sponsor relationships or possibility of technical breakdown. Exampe: in service area during the night, your co-driver suggests to experiment with tyre pressures by raising them up, knowing that all top-teams have done it. If player decide to do so, his car setup is being changed, and depending on the terrain on the race leg, player will have an advantage or not (if it's sand, thatn the decision is wrong). \n\nAs for the core gameplay, it should be like combined ""Snowrunner"" with it's soft terrain physics and ""Dakar 19"" with open-world like stages and freedom of choice for the player how to drive to certain point. \n\nThe game should make player feel like he's taking part in an adventure with a lot of random factors, like in real rally-raid races. \n\nAnd the begining of the race career for the player should be on some old crappy car, like 20-year old Jeep Wrangler, with poor sponsors that will allow just to purchase several sets of tyres, fuel and entry fee for the event. During the event player shold answer to variety of choices, by which he can either make some extra money, make car quicker, overcome a breakdown with minimum time spent for repairs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for my noobiness, I can write a lot more details, but I believe the core ideas for those games is more important."

jsxu2m,"One thing I remember liking about Neopets, as a kid...","Back when I was young, webrowser games were nearly as popular as home console gaming. Middle class kids who only had a basic Dell home PC could still play a variety of flash games. A huge hit that I also enjoyed was Neopets  combining Pokemon with Arcade style games (as in, a wide assortment of mini-games to play) world exploring and a bunch of other different aspects of Netopia for players to engage in and had a thriving community. \n\nOne part I really liked was the vast amount of items to collect, everything from junk to pet paintbrushes, to powerups, etc.  You could store items in a bank, purchase your own shop front to display them, sell them, auction them, etc. I was always on the hunt to find some obscure item that struck my fancy, just so I could bank it. It was item collection for the sake of item collection, without required competition. \n\nMost games these days that have item collection in them are very narrow in their scope- combat games have you collecting assortments of weapons, armor, etc. and not much else. Hero themed games have you collection the best heroes / characters and not much else. Neopets just had SO much different things and so many different ways to earn them. Sadly, Neopets didnt adapt well to the smart phone era of gaming, and never really made the leap from webrowser to phone in any appreciable measure.\n\nI would love to see something capture that kind of mystique it once had."

jsusfl,Custom design MMORPG game/platform,"The thing I want to discus is something that I would not be suprised to find already existing. If you know about such a game, I would be interested in you telling me about it in a comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe core concept:  \nThe game should be a platform to play games simmilar in style to many mmorpgs already existing but with worlds and campaings player-created in simmilar style clasical DnD works. Obviously the gameplay would be devided in something like Character player mode and Game master mode.  \n\n\nWorld and locations designer\n\nThe game masters role would be to generate new world on a new server. The world does not have to be super vast and detailed. There does not have to be open world. It could for example be just a world-map designed by the GM with some in-game map designer. There would be custom based open locations and dungeons tho, placed on a map. The game would contain location designer in which DM could create location by assembling various models of objects or perhaps altering preexisting and randomly generated locations. The GM could theoreticaly use his own imported models and textures or create new models in some sort of Spore-like creator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMob placement, designing and control  \nThe GM could place various mobs and creatures into the locations and dungeons or create a spawn for those creatures and give it some rate for generating the creatures. He could use creatures from the prexisting list of creatures made by game developers and edit their behavior like agresivity, guarding some place or patroling from some point to other point. He could also edit creatures stats and so on. The other possibility would be to give GM ability to import his own models for creatures and write the their own stats and abilities. There could again be something like Spore-like creator for this.  \n\n\nBattle and action mechanisms  \nBattles could turn based or realtime. While turn-based would remind more or DnD, real-time could bring some advantages of MMORPG style games. If the battle gameplay was realtime, the NPC creatures would be controled by AI but Game master could have ability to take control of any NPC creature at any time. Aside from battles, the interactions with NPC creatures and characters would be simmilar. The GM master could asign series of dialogs for any NPC, those dialogs would appear if Players would want to speak with NPCs. Yet in the same time, GM could directly control any NPC and speak/write for it so the conversation would be like conversation with real human.  \n\n\nMechanism designing and creation of new features\n\nThe GM could have access to creation of new game mechanics and items. He could design new kind of spells, abilities, attacks and give them to characters skill tree or to some object. This would require some coding. I imagine this to work a little bit like roblox creator tho.  \n\n\nStory creation\n\nThere could be certain mechanism given to GM to be able to create good stories for their campaign. Most of the story creation would probably go by the good use of mechanics already existing in game. tho GMs could probably import some texts or audio for their story. The cutscenes could be cool but it would mean need for lots of space and GMs ability to create one. GM could also simple give a link to cutscene uploaded somewhere else on the internet. Also GM could probably design an algorithm for certain events setting that if X happens in the world, then Y also happens etc.  \n\n\nServer size\n\nThe GM could create small servers for themselfs and band of few players but they could also create bigger servers where lots of GMs would cooperate in creation of a world where many player bands could compete, cooperate and influence each other in shared world.  \n\n\nGame community\n\nThe game would probably have big community of players that would share models, mechanics codes, advices and ideas.  \n\n\nOriginal campaign\n\nTho I said campaigns and world would be GM generated, it would be helpful for developers to create their own kind of map to introduce players to the concept. On this server there would be detailed world with various campaigns and users could try to play as character players as well as try the role of GM in limited enviroment. They could for example try editing of locations and controling creatures, their edit would always be temporary and reset into original state after while. Those sort of GM quests would serve as a tutorial missions for them being able to create their own worlds on their own servers.  \n\n\nBussiness model\n\nFor developer to create, update and mantain the game, there would probably have to be some sort of business model even if the game was sort of created as open-source by some gamers because they would still need some many to invest in game, its mantain and to pay for their time. Perhaps the model could be that game is free to play with access to limited features while you can either pay extra money for new models etc or you could by premium account with access to full features. Also there could be some crowd-funding.  \n\n\nGame-genre\n\nAltho I wrote it would be player designed MMORPG it does not say explicitly whether this is fantasy, sci-fi, superhero or what. Well there could be two strategies, either it could be one of those (I was mainly working with fantasy idea) or the platform could give you ability to create anything from zombie-appocalypse to steampunk, space-opera or paleolithic fantasy. The question is whether the developers would be able to create quality enough content if their focus got into creating possibility of designing world of any genre yet if players had the ability for high enough editing then the community would help with this. But it would also mean giving them more abilities with designing characters, classes, skill trees etc. Perhaps the game developers could go with ceratin compromise. Creating possibilities for creating servers of various genres yet focusing the most on one, for example the fantasy.  \n\n\nUsers experience and editability\n\nWell obviously it would be best if the GM mode was intuitive and yet gave GMs opportunity to vast editing. It could be sort of done with different levels of editing. There could be a level of simple editing containing only placement of models and creatures and editing few stats, the advanced editing containing ability to some simple coding and then the expert editing containing ability to code complicated mechanisms and stuff. Possibly players could share and import the more advanced and experts codes, so even the less experienced GM could create his game in new style using mainly simply editing tools\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease tell me what you think about the idea and if there is any game like this somewhere."

jsihy4,Controlling 2 characters at once be like,"So... A game with different characters, and you can play as/with 2 at once.\n\nHeres what im thinkin:\n\nA range of characters, each with an effect, and a class. Theres your slow heavy attack guy, your speedy weak guy, your fragile healer guy and your not as fragile but still fragile archer guy. Then theres fire, ice, poison, prayer (healing), and lightning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach character will have a normal attack, a charge attack, and a special. Your charge attack can be anything from a spin attack to a dash attack. And your duo can perform a unison attack if both specials are used at the same time, which will kill every enemy either that you're in conflict with or thats in the room you're in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can make one player follow the other, one’s attacks will have the effect that the other has. you can also simplify things by enabling “one man mode” A mode that restricts you to one character, and you can switch between the two at any time. You can even set the camera to focus more on you than the other, which could make it easier to see your character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone’s probably finna ask:\n\nQ: If the right stick is being used for something else, then how do you control your camera?\n\nA: Im thinkin i could use a sort of a angle changing camera, that could go into birds eye view if enemies are behind you, allowing you to perceive all enemies and allies at once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you decide to make a game from this and want to credit me, put me in as “CommonAmmo”"
jsgvlq,"A large scale sci fi ""galaxy sim"" MMORTS. Possibly browser based.","I have been playing games like Spore and Stellaris for a while, and have seen menu based sci-fi browser MMOs before (don't remember the name of the one I am thinking of.) I loved the amount of customization involved with both, and the sheer scale involved. \n\nI imagined a game where can start out in a safe zone star system (or local star cluster). You must create your civilization's species. This goes into great detail, down to things like diet, gas they breath, genetic structure, sleep cycle, methods of locomotion, communication, ethics, etc. The planet this species hails from can also be customized, preferably to suit their traits. Based on the planet type there are some things like plants and animals you could later use as trade resources or materials for terraforming.\n\nYou can then start setting up facilities like mines for certain resources (iron, uranium, lead), farms for plants or animals, housing, power generation facilities of various types, shipyards, defensive emplacements, barracks, and so on. You must research to unlock many technologies, but not at the cost of time alone, you must supply power and relevant resources in addition to time, realistically.\n\nDesigning vehicles and spacecraft uses a size system based on numbers. A larger (bigger number) frame holds more stuff, but is more expensive and the base speed and mass are effected. So specialized classes will inevitably develop out of necessity. Ships can be designed for mining, exploration, cargo hauling, control, or combat. Smaller details like armor level (how heavily armored it is), amount of braking and turning thrust, and the intended contents of hangars/cargo bays, cam all be tweaked as well. You can of course produce these for your own use, or make vehicles to sell to other player factions for profit. You could profit off of wars between others.\n\nWhen going between stars or planets, it takes time. The game is meant to be a long term simulation. Interplanetary travel for a dispatched fleet could take a few hours, while a distance of a 70 lightyears could take a couple days. Still working it out, but the ships would travel at a semi-realistic pace on the course to their destination. So say if, an enemy patrol spots them, that could give the whole operation away. Long term, strategic planning, on days or weeks scale, could heavily benefit the player. \n\nOn planets, continents (if applicable), are separated into sizes 1-5, which determine their size, and thereby how many buildings and units it can house. A large continent with no units would still take some time to conquer, but not as long as a large one with a full force of defenders. This could go further into regional levels but I think that would be too much. Establishing dominance in space in the star system or in orbit doesn't truly mean you control them. You must make sure the planets themselves are under your control. Advances in land vehicle, infantry weaponry and equipment technology will be of great use here, anything from individual weapon types like AR's and flamethrowers, to tactical options like charges, creeping barrages, etc. These can effect the speed and efficiency (or lack of it) in combat.\n\nThe portrait for things associated with your civilization can be selected from preset image libraries, or you can upload custom artwork for these things, essentially allowing you to create your dream planet, species, and/or faction. Things that can have custom portraits are limited to things on your homeworld, as well as vehicles, buildings, and tech made by you. You can also write descriptions for these things for some extra flavor and immersion factor. This would give artists, writers, and worldbuilders a massive outlet. This mechanic was one of the main things I had in mind when thinking of this idea.\n\nThe main draw comes in with the MMO part. Imagine stellaris, but all factions were run by players or groups of players. You could form trade routes with neighboring factions to trade exotic materials they are lacking, with the ships flying back and forth in real time (and could be attacked by hostiles like privateers or pirates). You could even join a union/federation and develop certain laws or beliefs you hold fast to. Wars could start over resources, trade routes, or out of differences in policies. Of course wars over irl things like what the best anime is would probably occur regardless of immersion focus. A long term, MMO Space civilization sim would be a dream come true. Additional things I could imagine would be custom overlays for the interface so you could make the interface suit your faction or needs, cross platform control (logging in on your phone to check on your trade profits, or the ETA for your exploration fleet to reach its destination.) or having multiple screens up to not have to navigate between them constantly, and feel like some super gamer.\n\nThe long term nature of the gameplay would encourage coordination, planning, cooperation, and/or competition, and could form many long term alliances or even friendships as a result. The potential player made history that unfolds could be a good enough story within itself. The menu (and mostly text) based system would mean the system requirements would be low, and most could run it, even more so if it is browser based. This idea is probably way too ambitious, but I just wanted to get it out there. let me know what you think, and is it something you would like to see?"

jsd2r8,"Space Carrier ""Mechanic Hours"" Management","Intro:\n\nThis idea is for a Rouge Like similar to FTL. Instead of a Star Trek style Battleship the player is in charge of a Macros / Star Wars style Space Carrier. The player will have three types of ships under their care: Light fighters, Interceptors, Heavy fighters, and Torpedo Bombers. Depending on the encounter the player can launch any combination of fighters, interceptors, and bombers. The very act of launching a fighter, even if it does not engage the enemy, produces ware and tear on the fighter's systems.\n\nGame Mechanic:\n\nThe game game idea I am thinking over is to have a resource called ""Mechanic Hours"" the Carrier will have a finite mechanic staff and between encounters the player must choose how to delegate their time. For example with 8 mechanic hours the player can get two badly damaged light fighters barely space worthy again or get one light fighter up to full combat readiness. The same decision making would apply across all fighters under your care. Do you neglect the heavy fighters to maintain your light fighters knowing that you may have to deploy your light fighters into a situation that the heavy fighter is best suited for?\n\nOver the course of the game the player will gain/loose mechanics and fighter craft based off encounters, or if the encounter goes very badly they may loose their entire ship.\n\nAn example of game play would go like this:\n\nThe player jumps into a new system. A civilian transport is under attack by pirates. There are 3 light fighters and a bomber in the pirate force. Your Tactical officer suggest dispatching 4 light fighters and two interceptors to deal with the situation. You have 6 space worthy light fighters and one lightly damaged interceptor. You decide to launch all 6 light fighters and keep the interceptor in reserve. 4 of your light fighters take moderate damage and the other two sustain mild wear and tear. The pirate force looses 2 of its light fighters before retreating. You scavenge 3 useful fighter parts from the downed pirates and the grateful civilian transports reward you with $200 galactic credits. \n\nAfter the encounter you plot jump to the next system. Over this jump you have enough engineering hours to bring your 1 interceptor and 3 of your 6 light fighters to space worthy status. \n\nUpon arriving a the new system you receive a distress signal from an escape pod. A near by mining ship lies broken from a recent pirate attack. You decide to pick up the escape pod. In it are two very grateful engineers who offer to join your crew. You now have 16 more engineering hours to apply to fixing your fighters before the next encounter."

Each team can build on their side up to the line \n\nthey can only cross the line after the base build time Limit.   \n\n\nthey have set time Limits for offensive strikes and then they must defend against the enemy. They take turns attacking and defending until one team dominates one of the planets. \n\nonce  planet A is dominated by a team any new resources only go to that planet A and the remaining planet B has to survive on its existing resources alone. While the opposing team on planet B gets its full resources sent to the planet B\n\nonce a team has dominated a planet they can start building space units to attack the opposing planet.   \nteam players will be able to vote on when they want to attack the other teams bases and planet. The key will be when to attack or when to defend and what to spend resources on. by working together as a team you can coordinate winning strategy. \n\nThe final battle will be another attack and defend until one team is victorious.   \n\n\nthe Advantage to this game is that it’s component animation and quality can be pretty basic. The draw is in its imaginative properties and its unique cross game platform. \n\nanyway I thought I would share in the off chance someone actually understands whatever I’m talking about and thinks it’s cool.   \n\n\nplenty of more free random ideas from a weird thinker."

js0rqc,The most realistic FPS game ever made.,"Ok here's my idea. It's pretty ambitious but I hope someone can make it work. Let me start off by saying that I've seen my fair share of gore and shock vids, so I know what looks realistic. Anyway here's my idea. I want to make an FPS game where everything is real as hell. Snipers have to account for drop and wind speed, there are different generals and commanders. Also, the gore aspect would be the gem of this game. Instead of implementing an unrealistic health bar like every other game, you map out every organ in your body. If it hits your lung, you will wheeze and slowly die unless a medic gets to you. Bullets are also deadly. If you get shot anywhere, you will fall down. Getting shot in the arm will make you bleed out if it hits an artery, and will make you drop your weapon. Getting shot in the leg will make you either limp or if hit by a higher cal weapon, will drop you and you will have to drag yourself to the medic. getting shot in the head instantly kills you unless it was a lower calibre weapon and hits your helmet, in which case there is a very low chance that it may be deflected, knocking you out or making you dizzy. Another thing is the blood effects. lower cal weapons have surprisingly little blood splatter in real life. getting shot in the head by say a .22 will only cause minor bleeding a couple of seconds after the shot, but no blood spray upon impact. higher cal weapons on the other hand will blow half of your head off. The gore effect in the game for this would be as photo-realistic as possible. Actually, I take back what I said about headshots being instant kills. In fact, every part of the brain is mapped out in this game with its real life function. having a bullet skim your head but barely miss your brain will make you bleed out but will not kill you. also, depending on what part of the brain is hit, your character will have the appropriate ragdoll response. your character may go limp, twitch, or even stiffen up. Guns also have realistic recoil and loudness, and silencers work like they do in real life. The battles in this game are huge, with up to 50 players on each side. But here's the cool part. When you die, you lose all your progress and have to start over , and here's why. It will add a huge risk factor to  the game, making players fight as if they were actually in war. less people will die, because we all know that war would be much more deadly if people rushed shit like they did in CSGO. Dying also gets you removed from the server. Anyways that's my game plan, hope someone can make it real."
js029w,Dinosaurs vs. Aliens,"**Plot**: Millions of years ago, an alien race comes down to Earth to try and conquer the planet. However, the dinosaurs aren’t going to surrender to them without a fight.\n***\n**Gameplay**: It’s an open world game where you can play as one of many different dinosaurs in many unique and diverse worlds. You’ll the have to fight a boss fight at the end of the level.\n\nThe dinosaurs are divided into 2 Groups: Carnivores and Herbivores. It’s important to note that not all dinosaurs play the same way as some will have different stats (Offense, Defense, Speed, etc.) compared to others. You can also add custom colors to them and even give them custom names.\n***\n**Carnivores**\n\nTyrannosaurus\n\nSpinosaurus\n\nGiganotosaurus\n\nCarcharodontosaurus\n\nMapusaurus\n\nAcrocanthosaurus\n\nAllosaurus\n\nCeratosaurus\n\nSuchomimus\n\nBaryonyx\n\nCarnotaurus\n\nDilophosaurus\n\nSaurophaganax\n\nCompsognathus\n\nCryolophosaurus\n\nVelociraptor\n\nDeinonychus\n\nUtahraptor\n\nOrnitholestes\n\nTroodon\n\nOviraptor\n\nCoelophysis\n\nMetriacanthosaurus\n\nMegalosaurus\n\nAlbertosaurus\n***\n**Herbivores**\n\nTriceratops\n\nStyracosaurus\n\nEiniosaurus\n\nPachyrhinosaurus\n\nProtoceratops\n\nAnkylosaurus\n\nEuoplocephalus\n\nSauropelta\n\nGastonia\n\nStegosaurus\n\nKentrosaurus\n\nHuayangosaurus\n\nWuerhosaurus\n\nBrachiosaurus\n\nApatosaurus\n\nDiplodocus\n\nNigersaurus\n\nPachycephalosaurus\n\nStygimoloch\n\nParasaurolophus\n\nOuranosaurus\n\nCorythosaurus\n\nEdmontosaurus\n\nGallimimus\n\nTherizinosaurus\n***\n**Levels**: As mentioned, each level will be unique and diverse from one another with a variety of obstacles and enemies including a boss enemy. There will be 12 levels in total.\n\n**Level 1**: Jungle (Boss: Alien Bulldozer)\n\n**Level 2:** Desert (Boss: Sand Monster)\n \n**Level 3:** Beach (Boss: Mutant Mosasaurus)\n\n**Level 4**: Tundra (Boss: Snow Monster)\n\n**Level 5**: Cave (Boss: Giant Alien Drill)\n\n**Level 6**: Mountain (Boss: Mutant Pterosaur)\n\n**Level 7**: Volcano (Boss: Lava Turtle)\n\n**Level 8:** Laboratory (Boss: Xenosaurus)\n\n**Level 9**: UFO (Boss: Xenoraptor)\n\n**Level 10**: Alien Homeworld (Boss: Xenoceratops)\n\n**Level 11**: Alien Palace (Boss: Alien Tank)\n\n**Level 12**: Mothership (Boss: Xenosaurus Rex)\n\nAfter beating all the levels and the final boss, the aliens would get frustrated and send a meteor directly towards Earth. Your playable dinosaur ends up destroying the cannon, but was unable to stop the meteor. However, it does accidentally beam more dinosaurs into the mothership (enough to sustain a population) and they end up on another planet the aliens own. So the dinosaurs survive the K-T extinction on another planet for humanity to rediscover in the far future, AND they’ve saved the Earth from invasion. \n***\n**Power ups/Items**: Throughout the game, you’ll encounter a few power ups and items to help you along your journey. Some refill your health while others give you a temporary boost or buff. \n\nThese power ups include:\n\nShrubs/Dinosaur Corpses: Depending on whether you’re playing as a herbivore or a carnivore, you’ll encounter either of these items. Both serve the same purpose of healing you. They also come in different sizes which means the larger the shrub or corpse, the more health you recover. \n\nDinosaur Skulls: These act as 1-Ups and will give you an extra life. The maximum you can get are 100. \n\nBones: The currency of the game. Collecting 100 will give you an extra life. \n\nPteranodons: They serve as the game’s checkpoints. Once you pass them, they fly away from the tree/rock they were standing on. In levels 9 through 12, they’re replaced by miniature flying saucers.\n***\n**Other Features**: This game will include cheat codes to alter the gameplay in many different ways and a Dinosaur Guide which talks about the different playable dinosaurs including a few other prehistoric animals not playable in the game.\n\n**ESRB Rating/Consoles**: Dinosaurs vs. Aliens would rated T for Teen for mild violence including blood from both dinosaurs and aliens. The consoles it would be on are PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One."
jrztne,A top down co-op survival horror shooter with a twist,"This game would be a top down, dual stick shooter played with 2-4 players and the objective would be survive and run to some end goal. It would be possibly procedurally generated with rogue like upgrades, or a full story with consistent progression and new obstacles.. that part can be figured out later by the designer (I'd love to spitball ideas). \n\nThe twist is that players can only see the mob of enemies where their methods of sight (flashlights, line of sight, etc.) cross. \n\nThink a cone of dim light in front of you that lights up when it touches someone else's cone and both players can only see the intersection of the two light sources. (Not sure if I explained it correctly...)\n\nProgression could be gaining a circle around you that isn't dim so you can see enemies that are super close, gaining a wider cone of light for your character, gaining different weapons, an active item that marks where enemies are, etc. There are lots of ideas that can bounce from this huge obstacle. \n\nThis is my first time posting so don't murder me in the comments 😂"

jrwv5v,"A competitive/cooperative RPG ""battle royale""","Imagine a combination roguelike/mmo raid/battle royale game.  Players will compete to reach the end of a dungeon where they must then cooperate in bringing down a raid boss.  During their race through the dungeon, players can earn loot to sell, gear upgrades, and experience.\n\nThe dungeon is randomized each time, but all players face the same instance.  They also always start at experience level 1, as they lose all experience when they exit a dungeon (by death or by victory).  However, the playing field isn't completely equal (this is an RPG by nature, after all...  more on that later).\n\nEach dungeon consists of 64 players, and four floors.  During the warm up time, players are randomly assigned another player to compete with.  When the game begins every player starts exploring the dungeon, killing enemies for experience and various loot, and looking for new gear to equip.  However, they're also looking for the exit to the first floor that's protected by an elite enemy (to act as a stat check), and only one of the paired players can go through the exit (the ""loser"" in the race has their exit shut).  Not only that, but there's a timed hazard (4 minutes in?) in each dungeon that will eventually force the players to move on or die.\n\nWhen the first player completes a floor, an announcement is made to everyone, and a 30 second countdown begins before the second floor starts.  This acts as a buffer to allow the other players time to catch up so they aren't left too far behind, and also allows the faster players time to optimize their gear and stats.  The first player to the exit is paired off against the second player, the third against the fourth, etc.  In the situation where an odd number of players makes it through the exit, the final player isn't paired against anyone, but they are also likely behind on the race to the next door and may have less time on the new floor before facing the timed hazard.  Players will find themselves both hoping to make it to the final floor, but also to have enough competent players to face off against the dungeon's boss.\n\nWhen players leave the dungeon, they only keep the loot earned.  Gear and experience are both lost.  Loot can either be sold, or used to craft trinkets that provide certain perks during a dungeon run.  These perks don't provide players with a head start in a dungeon, but can ensure certain benefits from gear they find.  For example, they may get a guaranteed chance to crit on every helmet, or only find a particular class of weapon, or might even get more loot drops.  While such bonuses can definitely give a player an edge and allow them to focus certain playstyles, it doesn't guarantee better stats on gear in the dungeon.\n\nDefeating a dungeon's end boss grants special loot that will be associated with particular gear slots that can define a player's ""role"", most likely weapons, and loot that can be crafted into vanity items."

jru57v,An idea.,"I'm no developer, I simply lack the talent and time to be one. But I've had this idea of some time which maybe one of you talented people could look into. \nA game about PTSD.\n\n It'd start off simple, you're a normal person going to work a public place whatever. You see people die and get shot and you barely escape the grip of death. After a recovery period at the hospital, doctors think you're good to go back to your life. You start to get flashbacks longer and harder and more terrifying each time. You always try to do something to change the outcome of the incident but you never can. I think it should involve decisions that would change the ending from getting help to the worst ending committing suicide. \n\nNow this is a very rough idea but with proper research and someone actually talented working on it could be something not only fun to play but perhaps helpful."
jrsmml,Enemy Fear/Intimidation Mechanic,"This sort of thing could work in just about any game with enemies. For this, I will imagine it as an RPG.\n\nA common complaint/observation about games is that the enemies typically have no sense of self-preservation. Here's how that can be fixed:\n\nAn invisible **""fear meter""** for hostile NPCs. The meter starts at 0 points and there will be a certain number, called the **fear threshold**, that they can eventually reach. Once they reach it, they flee. Alternatively, they might surrender or hide. I will go into detail on that in the bonus section. Exactly what number the fear threshold *is* can depend on a number of factors. It could scale with their intelligence (a less intelligent enemy is less likely to flee), wisdom (a more wise enemy is more likely to flee), or it could scale with their level/power (if they think its less likely that they flee, they probably won't). Or it could have a whole new stat: Bravery.\n\nSay an enemy's fear threshold is 150.  Each time you kill one of their allies or they find a corpse, they gain 25 ""**terror**"". Killing an enemy that is stronger than them could add 50 terror. As they lose HP themselves they might gain terror (possibly 0.5 per missing HP).\n\nBut for every point of HP *you* are missing, the terror of nearby enemies goes down by one. This makes it so if you are on the edge of death, they'll be more likely to try and finish you off. If you heal midcombat, it adds those terror points back, so they might be like ""Oh fuck this"" and run when your wounds suddenly heal.\n\nArmor, weapons, and possibly even spells can have a hidden (or not so hidden) intimidation stat. Each point of intimidation causes an enemy to gain that many terror points the first time they see you (or see the spell in use). Some spells might aim only to invoke fear, creating illusions of horrible nightmares that add 50 or more terror to anyone seeing it, while others might try to both harm and scare. If someone waves their hand and your friend disintegrates or their head explodes, you'll probably be more scared than if they launched a couple magic darts. Some armor might focus more on intimidation than practicality, possibly just scaring away enemies before they attack you at all... But those brave enough to face you will find it easier than expected.  \n\n\n\#**BONUS**  \n*These parts could be difficult to implement, but are pretty neat. I think that the system above works just fine, but these can expand on it and make it more entertaining or more difficult.*\n\nBehavior might change as they get closer to their fear threshold. They may begin to fight more defensively, try to distance themselves and attack from range, or attack more frantically (possibly gaining speed but losing some damage or accuracy). \n\nEnemies may be more likely to use their stronger attacks if they are near their fear threshold. If they think they are going to die anyway, they might use a bomb or a powerful explosion spell more recklessly than they normally would, and if they have limited uses for a strong ability they might just start using it all on you.  \nThere could be alternate reactions when they reach the fear threshold. While they will usually flee, some might hide from you (possibly attacking again later or spying on you) or they might surrender. If they surrender, you can choose to either kill them or spare their life. If you spare their life, you can then either take the loot they would have had anyway or you can send them out to tell others what you did. This can change your reputation, if the game has a reputation mechanic. If you already have a reputation for being ruthless and leaving no survivors, that probably increases the chance that they flee instead of surrender. Could even send those who surrender out on a mission for you, though that definitely depends on the kind of game you're making. Also, could be funny if low constitution/vitality enemies have a chance of dying from heart attack when they reach the fear threshold.\n\nThere could be a spell of some kind that lets you detect enemy fear. Maybe their heart beats faster the more terror they have, maybe they glow red or orange, or maybe it's just a number next to them. If this is a game where you have allies, the fear mechanic could work on them too. You can have bravery spells that remove terror (can be used on enemies too, to ensure they can't flee if you have trouble catching up).\n\nAlcohol can decrease terror, both of your enemies and your allies.\n\nFear meter can also apply outside of combat. Merchants will have a lower ""social"" fear meter (Usually \~50), which is meant to only rely on your passive terror increase from armor and what-not. As you get closer to the fear threshold, prices get higher, but once you hit that threshold the prices go down by a lot. So you may want to try and look less intimidating when you head to the market, but if you can pull it off you can reap some good rewards. Doing things that are more.. *active* ways of inciting terror, like killing nearby people and summoning giant nightmare demons, will just cause them to not sell to you at all and might get the guards called on you.  \n\n\nThat's about it. I think this is a really interesting mechanic and I never do see many mechanics posted here, so I figured I'd go for it."
jrs4ds,"Like r6, but more... realistic?","Each team has 6 operators, each operator has their own unique gadget and every operator has access to a list of weapons and attachments to use, if you want a full team of suppressed uzis go for it. No respawns. Team names are depending which gamemode. Every map has 4 floors, no basements.\n\nGamemodes: Explosive Extraction (Owls vs Badgers), Cargo Escort (Rhinos vs Rapters), Protect the President (Delta vs Omega), and Secure Intel (Frankin vs Kemosabe).\n\nExplosive Extraction is a hostage and bomb based gamemode. There is 1 bomb and 2 hostages. If the hostages are extracted Owls win. If the bomb is defused Owls still have to extract hostages, but will gain more time (2 minutes). If the everyone on the Badger team dies, Owl team still has to defuse the bomb. It takes 2 people to diffuse the bomb and 2 people to extract the hostages. 4 rounds. Each round is 5 minutes long.\n\nCargo Escort is played on a cargo ship. Rhino team is the ship's security and Rapter team are essentially pirates. If one team takes out everyone on the opposing team, they win. Basically team deathmatch without respawns. 4 rounds. Each round is 5 minutes \n\nProtect the President takes place in random embassies in the world. Delta has to protect a high value target from Omega. Delta team starts on the roof via helicopter and has to keep the target safe for 5 minutes. 4 rounds.\n\nSecure Intel is at a terrorist base. Franklin team has to breach the base (a large house) and steal intel from a computer, but there are 6 computers in the house and only 1 of them has the intel. Kemosabe team are in charge of hiding the computer with the intel, they cannot keep the computer on them nor can they pass it to each other. They can however give false information by defending the wrong computer on purpose. 4 rounds. Each round is 4 minutes long.\n\nNow for the operators (no names cuz i havent thought of them yet :/)\n\nThe attackers: \n\nOperator 1: access to a UAV, when called in they choose which floor for the UAV to check. After the check the operator will receive a message of how many operators are on that floor. If majority of the team is on a certain floor the UAV will call out to Operator 1 that there is movement on that floor, but will not give out the number of enemies.\n\nOperator 2: access to a tear gas grenade launcher. Based off the milkor mgl, shoots 6 rounds of tear gas. Tear gas disorients the vision and movement speed of the defenders by 50% and for 5 seconds. Tear gas rounds release gas on impact and has a 5 meter radius for 15 seconds. They will only have 6 rounds so they have to be used wisely.\n\nOperator 3: access to a riot shield with a hole in the middle that can open and close. When open Operator 3 can shoot their sidearm, but with 40% less accuracy, defenders can shoot through this hole. To open the hole Operator 3 just has to aim in. Operator 3 is the only operator that can't have a primary weapon. (so much for the team of suppressed uzis) \n\nOperator 4: has access to thermal vision goggles. Can carry 1 extra smoke grenade. When equipping goggles movement speed decreases by 10%. Operator 4 cannot see through more than 2 smokes.\n\nOperator 5: has access to EMP grenades. Total of 3 grenades. Can disable any defender gadget. But if thrown poorly and lands on teammates, it will disable teammates gadgets. Disables gadgets for 7 seconds.\n\nOperator 6: Medic. Takes 5 seconds to heal each bullet wound. If an operator was shot 2 times, it would take 10 seconds to fully heal. Medic can stop the healing process after healing just 1 bullet. Medic can heal themself, it takes them 3 seconds to heal each bullet. Each team will have this operator. \n\nAttacker have access to a snake eye camera\n\nThe defenders:\n\nOperator 1: has access to camouflage. Operator 1 has to be right next to a wall or proned on the floor to do his thang. It takes 20 seconds to camouflage what ever his stomach is up against, the prompt will only show if his stomach is against something. It does not happen on its own, the player has to hold down on a specific key or button. They can be seen through these methods, the attacker hugging a wall and noticing a bump or the attacker walking through a hallway and noticing a bump on the floor. Operator 1 can camouflage as many times as they'd like. And has a bowie knife cause why not.\n\nOperator 2: has access to proximity devices. When an attacker enters the proximity devices 10 meter range, a ringing will play until the attacker leaves the proximity or destroys the device. Operator 2 will have 4 devices. \n\nOperator 3: has access to trip wires. Once tripped the attacker will be electrocuted taking off 10% of health and disabling them for 10 seconds. Operator 3 will have 5 trip wires. Wires stay after being used, but you will probably shoot it out after someone triggered it.\n\nOperator 4: has access to a hacking device. They can hack into some attackers gadgets. For example they can hack into the UAV and give wrong information, but they have to have a visual on the UAV and cannot stay on it more than 5 seconds. If 1 attacker is dead, Operator 4 can hack into their communications, they can hear whatever the team is saying to each other for 10 seconds. \n\nOperator 5: has access to a gas mask. Operator 5 is essentially a direct counter to attacking operator 2. Operator 5 has another gas mask, but can only be used once and for a small amount of time. He can throw his extra mask to a teammate and the moment they put it on, it stays for the next 20 seconds. Operator 5 only has 1 so choose who you want to protect wisely.\n\nOperator 6: Medic.\n\nEach operator is the same speed and takes 3 assault rifle shots, 5 smg shots, depends on the shotgun range, and 4 pistol shots. The smg obviously has a higher fire rate than the assault rifle.\n\nEveryone is equipped with the beloved 1 shot kill knife."

jrilhk,Tunnelborne: A Sunless Sea Inspired Exploration and Trading Game,"Hello everyone! I'm currently developing a game with the working title ""Tunnelborne"" which will be set in a post-apocalyptic world where all of humanity was forced to retreat into an underground network of vaguely sentient tunnels. After a to be determined amount of years humans have colonized many key areas of the underground, and transport goods and people through the tunnels with a sort of maglev technology that isn't fully understood anymore. Point is: transportation doesn't require fossil fuel, which is too valuable to spare for anything other than critical power generation.\n\nCurrent planned features are:\n\n* Hex-grid based map with settlements in fixed locations that shifts the longer you spend at a settlement;\n* Reactive world that changes with or without player interference;\n* Fluctuating trade prices based on supply and demand;\n* Multiple friendly and hostile factions;\n* Ship and crew customization;\n* Storylines that span multiple generations and multiple characters.\n\nThe world develops over a theoretically infinite amount of playtime, since it's technologically stagnant and the only developments are socio-economical. In practice there will be certain key events that can be triggered to effectively give the player a ""game over"" of sorts, allowing them to start over with a fresh world.\n\nSome of the biggest inspirations for this game are Sunless Sea/Skies, Kenshi, the Mount &amp; Blade series and Dwarf Fortress (also Caves of Qud, to a certain extent).\n\nThank you for reading, I wish you all a lovely day/evening!"

jqo8d8,My dream game,"I always wanted there to be a huge MMORPG game that highly reflects a real world economy and politics taken to an extreme detail, but you still play as an individual within the economy. It would be as organic/free market as possible, with the ability to capitalize on market opportunities, mostly revolving around natural resources, there would be one massive server that goes miles long, getting larger as more players join. \n\nIt would be highly reliant on your ability to find value as a player and trade with others, which would be very slow at first, but as you get wealthier and more valuable, and build more connections, your power or influence increases as well. You would build up your net worth (a base currency of gold would exist, but bartering would be an option as well) in order to get better tools or technology, and join a coalition, community, or company of players with territory (protected by physical walls, I’ll go into that later) that can be expanded or traded, or even fought for from other companies/communities. there would be open markets, and if your character dies, everything you’ve made for yourself such as territory or finances/etc disappears. This not only makes the stakes and gravity of what you amassed important as you become a successful player, but it also helps keep griefers from having a big impact on your finances/property or trying to assassinate you, as to do so would require a big hit to their own characters wealth or even death. For example,  An individual new player that just spawned would be unable to trespass a large companies territory, as he would need tools or weapons to even attempt to break the wall, and naturally, the bigger or more lucrative the company, the more they would spend on a better walls/defenses to protect their natural resources and community) the new player would have to play for hours just to be able to purchase a stone or metal tool capable of damaging the wall, and the wall would degrade at a low rate, and there would be systems in place to notify the walled community, griefers would have to “work”/ trade for a month or more to probably afford something that would allow him to break into a community, and it would be high risk as there would be defensive measures within the community to protect them that are not known until you can get in to the territory, you would have much better luck going after other characters that are lower class. \n\neach player within the territory has their own house, and they pay taxes for the protection via the greater walled community, unless they want to risk having their own land by themselves, which would mean no taxation but less security. Their individual houses have added protections depending on the individual wealth of the player, in case they worry the community territory gets invaded. Taxes are dictated by the player that the territory is owned by, and there can be the option of tax brackets, just like our own system, so that wealthier home owners pay more, an incentive to attract lower pay newer players into the community. This is where I think the really interesting dynamics would come into play, as if taxes are too high, a player could always move to a different community or none at all/start his own if he so chooses. There would be in depth, and game-binding consensual contracts between players, that would require a good sense of deal making and business. Owners of private land/companies could choose to go public, selling shares of the company. For example, I agree to have my character do X work for X company, at this rate, for X amount of game hours. Company could provide incentives like protection or shares of the company, and there would be constant competition. \n\nI feel like the game would be a less futuristic version of eve online, but much more in depth with economic options through contracts and agreements."

You can also build traps such as tripwire or tiger pits You can try to poison them. The island is large and goes through a day and night cycle. You must eat and drink or you get weaker. Supplies will be air dropped carrying food and medicine even on occasion a firearm.  You have skills you can pick out such as\n\n1.) sturdier crafting: makes your weapons last longer before being destroyed \n\n2.) forager: you can find edible plants better and resist poison more than the average person \n\n3.) craftsmen: can find materials easier and craft faster though less sturdier basically quantity over quality \n\n4.) chemist: allows you to mix the various powders found  on the island"

k4cw45,A CoD style game that takes place in the real world,An amazing game (at least in my opinion) would be something like Call of Duty (maybe even a Battle Royale) that takes place in small portions of real world U.S. locations.

k4a9yr,Top-down shooter with a twist,"You are an entity with no body, you can possess people but only if you trick them into signing a contract.

The death criteria would be not having a body for a long enough time. You also can't sign contracts with people who killed your previous bodies."
k46lkt,A Music themed turn based Rpg game,"The game takes place in a Disco themed island. For the story someone has stolen the Mojo stone, which helps motivate the people of the island. The villain is trying to give himself the power of the mojo to make himself all powerful but that will cause everyone to lose their motivation to do anything. The main character must go in a journey to stop the villain and being the stone back to her town( I know this isn’t a really good story im not good at coming up with them tbh)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGameplay- I want to try to make this turn based rpg more interactive than the other ones. When you get into a fight every time you attack must press a button at the right moment in order to deal damage. If you attack at the right moment you deal good damage, if you dont you deal shit damage. There will also be super attacks where you have to do small minigames in order to land the super attack. The more damage the supee attack does the more difficult the minigame is. \n\nEvery enemy has their own sort of Rhythm when it comes to attacking. You can dodge the enemies attacks by jumping at the right moment. Some enemies have their own super attack which will put you into a small mini game that you have to do well on or else alot of damage will be dealt onto you.\n\nLike almost every rpg there are items you can get or buy to heal, remove effects, etc. There are also allies you can find around the map to have join your party but you can only have one ally in your party. Each ally has their own unique attacks and moves. Speaking of the Map there are many side missions you can do, with some you can get a powerful new ally, good items, a good fight, and more.\n\n\nWell thats my idea. Feel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments below."

To fight against either another villian's Gang, or the GCPD, maybe even the court of Owls, all the while protecting your gangs from Batman attacks?\n\nMaybe a morality type system where you can either align yourself more with or more against Batman\nLeague of shadows would have to be involved, maybe Jason Todd takes over after the death of Raas\nWhen you die the League resurrects you at a lazarus pit\n\nProbably never going to happen, but Red Hood being one of my top DC characters I cant help but want something like this"

Except it wasn't seemless because now people were getting impaled in the head (not an exaggeration) and shaking it off... ... ...\n\nBut really, all fighting games are like this. Take a less blood game like Smash Bros. When the greatsword wielding Ike slams down on an opponent, and if they don't get knocked out of the ring then they get right back to fighting.\n\n**HERE'S MY IDEA**\n\nInstead of hit points, you have dodge points. Ok, ok, I know this sounds waaay to simple, but I believe it's as awesome as it sounds. You dodge attacks until you run out and take a fatal blow.\n\nA more complex variation would be to allow you to attack damage that limits you when your dodge meter is depleted. Such as your arm being hurt, or in pain momentarily, disabling punches. And same for legs and kicks.\n\nPerhaps this meter regenerates slowly, so if you back away and recoup you can keep going, even if hurt.\n\n\***That's all folks!**\*"

k3spsj,A side-on 2D Bullet Hell,"The easiest way I could describe it is like the Cuphead plane levels or the FNaF World Update 2 Foxy Fighters game. You fly in a little spaceship, and go through multiple levels, with a total of 5 stages each. Each stage has you fight wave after wave of enemies that are constantly firing at you. The last stage will have a boss, with a unique theme. To make it unique, there'll be a mechanic, where if kill an enemy, sometimes there's a chance for a little soul to drop down slowly. If you fly into this soul, the enemy will come back, with an inverted colour palette, and will help you fight for a short period of time. The theme of this game is Sci-Fi, so each level will be based on something found in movies and culture such as Star Wars, or Mega Man, which are also Sci-Fi. Also, no, when I say names in this post, I don't mean exact copies. I use them to help me reference the kind of idea I have."

(Mage, Warrior, Hunter, etc.)\n\n4: Story Phase 1: The dungeon master sets a theme or beginning to a story.

This rating is multiplied by 100, and that new number represents the amount of gold a player receives. \n\n6: Trade Phase: Players sell each other shares in each other’s stories. The amount of gold a player has left after the purchase is then multiplied by the rating of the story earned in ‘story phase 2’.\n\n7: Story Phase 2: Players take turns finishing the story. The Dungeon Master rates each player’s story-telling from 1-5.\n\n8: Consolidation Phase: Each player’s ‘Trade Phase’ gold is added to the gold earned from each of their 2 story phases.\n\n9: Buy Phase: Players purchase a set of items that boost attack power. These items are decided at the beginning of the game. \n\n10: Attack Phase: Players take turns battling each other by rolling a die. The number rolled represents the base attack power of the attack.  It’s then multiplied by the items purchased in ‘buy phase’."

k3ray5,Game idea with two endings.,"So basically the protagonist is a burglar. While on the run from the police after a failed burglary he accidentally kills an officer. (not quite sure how yet).

He decides that the best thing to do is to get fake identities and leave the US. He tries to tell his lover to stay in the US as it's not safe for her to come with him but she convinces him otherwise.

k3olig,A War Game about the Geneva Conventions with 2 Checklists.,"War hasn't changed much, but War hasn't stayed the same.\n\nCenturies ago, as long as it destroyed the enemy, you probably would and should do... But as civilization advanced and start to look at everything with better eyes, rules were imposed on many things, War included.\n\nThat's why the Geneva Convention and all it's related rules and laws exist, to make sure War doesn't destroy everything around it, but just the stuff it needs.\n\nHere I share my idea, about a soldier, in a difficult war, where you have choices that might change your legacy if you win the war.\n\nEither you help your Land win the war playing by the rules, and become a War Hero cherished by your Land, or become a War Criminal that said ""My Land is above everything"", doing everything you want and believe is necessary to win and save your Land.\n\nIt'd probably be some Skyrim or Fallout-esque game, with a huge map, to go around, hundreds of way to deal with enemies and a huge check list to complete, Break all the rules set by the UN when it comes to War, where you'd probably need to use some charisma or luck to get stuff like ""Use a Nuclear Weapon to end this conflict"" checked off.\n\nOf course, there would be achievements for playing by the rules, and would probably be a Bragging right, as it would considerably harder to eliminate enemies in a town while also trying to not injury civilians too much."
k3lkwb,I have an idea for a battle royale game mixed with a card game.,"Before the game starts everyone has a deck of cards with skills, abilities and spells. Once the game starts, a player begins with a hand and automatically draws a new card from their deck like every 30 seconds or something. The cards could be various power ups, modifiers, offensive and defensive abilities or spells, and weapons that a player activates. Every card has a mana cost. Players could get mana passively over time, by collecting it on the map, and by eliminating other players. The map has various cards, mana and weapons placed around. The game can earn money by selling cards for player's decks and cosmetics. As far as I know this idea hasn't been tried yet. To me this idea seems like it could have a lot of potential for high skill cap gameplay, strategy, addictive rng elements, and able to earn a lot of money from people buying cards as well as cosmetics."

k3cuie,Survival Action Game in a Mech suit. [Concept]," \n\nHere's my idea for a game that wanted to do myself, but I currently have 2 projects running already.\n\nThe  setup: The year is 3xxx, and the earth is pretty much a wasteland after  an invasion of insect like aliens. There are very little human survivor  bastions left. You, the protagonist belong to an intelligent unit, task  to seek out resources for survival and defending your bastion. Your  squad is a gatherer squad, equipped with a highly advanced Powersuit  like robot. Your suit, the gatherer suit is less performant in combat,  then a fighter suit, but the ai and sensoric/analytic functions are  topknoch. One day, while out on a mission to retreat the power cores of a fightersquad that got eliminated by  some epic battle, your team gets attacked, and all, but you and your  suit get eliminated.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGoal:\n\n Far away from your bastion, and not enough energy to go back, you try to reach the safety of your bastion.\n\nThe  twist: \n\nYour suit is your safe space. Nearly nothing can harm you while  in it. But you need to find food and water to survive. Inside your suit,  you have access to all your options, but everything costs energy. Want  to communicate with your ai? Costs energy\n\n Want to analyse the unknown plant you gathered? Costs energy. \n\npurify water to survive? Costs energy.\n\nLong range scans? lots of energy. \n\nFly?  Tons of energy. \n\nSo the gameplay is an energy management system, while  try to survive and get back home.\n\nFeel: \n\n The idea is, that the player should feel an emotional attachment to  his/her suit, feeling save and highly capable while in the suit and very  helpless without. \n\nProblem is, the more options you use, the more energy  is used and the more the player will have to forfeit his options and  get closer to danger, and eventually have to rely on themself, when the  suit is out of energy (peak tension moments of the game). \n\nYou can modify  the suit with modules you gather/build.\n\nAnd potentially even use other suits (like a combat suit sequence).\n\nchallange for the dev:\n\nThe AI of the mech suit. It should be very helpful, and should give the player the feeling of having a friend on his/her side. It needs to be sympathetic. It should feel bad, when you have to turn off communication to the AI, to save energy. it should make you feel lonely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would do this in a topdown 2d Action game, but the concept can work in almost any setting and scale, even a Platformer game. \n\n3d would have the most potential."
k36wnc,Anybody got some game ideas?,If you have a game idea let me know by leaving a comment. I would like to here. But it has to be unique.
k356c1,I got inspired by Breath of the Wild to put this in my Dragon Game.,"I don't know what it is, but I just love the Blood Moon in BotW. So I decided to make my own interpretation of a similar phenomenon based on the Blood Moon.\n\nWhat's it going to be used on? The antagonist, who is a demonic god who craves for hell on earth.\n\nThe Blood Moon is a sign of him gaining power and his resurrection almost completing. That doesn't mean that in the final boss fight, he's gonna be OP. And that also doesn't mean you have a timer and get a bad ending.\n\nHow the Blood Moon is going to work is rather than reviving the demons you've killed in past levels, the demons will get stronger, tougher, and faster. This boost will show with their glowing eyes and red aura surrounding them. Basically you'll be fighting mini-mini bosses rather than basic enemies.\n\nI don't know how the phenomenon can be triggered, but there is a day-night cycle (another game I have in the docs has that too). Like BotW's Blood Moon, this Blood Moon will make the sky blood red, and the game will have a Blood Red tint. The Demon God's face is formed with the clouds in the sky. Black dust is randomly blown on the ground. Instead of it being a cutscene, The Blood Moon is a 20 in game second sequence, and this affects the overworld, the levels, the villages, and the mini games. And rather than playing the default SNES-like music in all of those, the music being played is a eerie synthwave song.\n\nI'm thinking about giving this thing other effects. What do you guys think so far?"
k34mxz,Give me your ideas for an explore&gt;gather&gt;build type of a town-down 2D game,"I am planning on developing a game this winter (I have published a couple of game before) and was looking for some themes, ideas, mechanics on such games. \n\n1. What is the setting? Zombie, post-apocalyptic, island?\n2. What is the player's end goal other than surviving?\n3. What interesting mechanics can I add to the game? \n\nThank you!"
k3281n,"Hell Let Loose/Post Scriptum, but it's Warhammer 40k.","Know those games Hell Let Loose and Post Scriptum? Two very good WW2 sim(ish) shooters with tanks and massive land battles?  \n\n\nTake that same concept, but it's marines/guardsman vs orks/various xenos. I think it being mostly guardsman would add a degree of fun despite the power armored marines obviously looking cooler. The Imperium and ork/xenos sides both have plenty of Jeep and tank esque vehicles, plenty of short and long range weaponry. Maybe the squad leaders of the different sides would be the marines/ork commanders/xenos...whatever.  \n\n\nIdk, I was watching a video about 40k rp in ARMA 3 and had the idea. I'm sure it's been posted numerous times."
k323gd,“Revolution” An online multiplayer battle-area Cops v Protestors team game,"It’s probably been proposed many times already (apologies if so), but here’s my pitch:  “Revolution” An online, third person, multiplayer battle-area style game where you get to choose from two different teams: Cops or Protestors.  \n\nDifferent classes (tank, fighter, stealth, tech) in each team, but the basic gist of the game is that you can’t have an impact or survive very long on your own.  It’s a strength in numbers, capture-the-flag type match where you have to work together with your respective Team (Cops or Protestors) at both the front lines as well as on the periphery.  NPCs are press and citizens, who are always watching both Cops and Protestors to assess their behaviour.  \n\nThe primary objective of the game is for a Team to control the balance of Power and Public Opinion by the end of the round using a combination of tactics.  \n\n“Power” is obtained mainly by capturing territory, but also via making arrests (Cops), or escaping capture/arrest (Protestors).  Cops can make mass arrests at one time, together, when Protesters are trapped or heavily out-numbered, and Protestors can evade arrest much more easily in open spaces or where they have fellow Protestors to assist.  \n\n“Public Opinion” is a modifier to the Power score and determined by the manner in which Power is obtained- and more specifically whether or not a Crime was *observed* by an NPC. \n\n“Crime” includes excessive violence or destruction of public property, resisting lawful arrest, unlawful arrest, etc. but only when observed by NPCs, and has a negative impact on Public Opinion.  \n\nPublic Opinion will depend heavily on whether a Crime is being committed by either Team.  Cops commit a Crime when they use excessive force or arrest a protestor who has not committed a Crime.  On the other hand, Protestors who resist arrest when they have committed a Crime will also negatively impact Public Opinion.  \n\nPublic Opinion is positively impacted when Crimes do not occur or when they are not observed by NPCs.   Capturing Territory without a Crime being observed will positively impact Public Opinion, for example.  This is where stealth and tech skills and can make a difference.  \n\nThe Cops want Law &amp; Order and the Protestors want Freedom.  The general public support the Protestors because they fight for Freedom, but the general public also respect the Cops because they bring Law &amp; Order.  However the general Public aren’t prepared to tolerate excessive violence or property damage to get either Freedom or Law &amp; Order.  \n\nProcedurally generated city maps (with useable subway stations, buildings, looting, jails, armories, vehicles, roads etc.). \n\nUnlimited respawns after you have been arrested (Protestor) or exposed as unlawful (Cops).  \n\nThis means if youre a protestor, you can get caught looting too much (which is bad even though it provides you with supples) and as a cop you can use excessive force on protestors only so much and never in the direct sight of an NPC.  As a cop or protestor you can accidentally hurt NPCs who are innocent which also weighs Public Opinion against you. \n\n**"
k31e70,Literal Coop Corridor Shooter,"A corridor shooter where you fight off enemies while simultaneously creating the map. You start in a smallish arena like room with vents or other such methods for enemies to spawn in. Some enemies drop special ammo that when fired at a wall creates new halls/rooms. You actively carve out a path through the game.\n\nGameplay swaps between fighting off enemies and creating the map, so this could create an interesting coop dynamic. If the player creating new paths has to hold down a button/focus on building for some time, the other player(s) would need to defend them. If building ammo can't be swapped then roles would need to, as the player(s) fighting off enemies would also be picking up building ammo.\n\nMap objective could be a location marked in the world that you can see through the walls. Different building ammo types could create specific types of passages. Straight halls, T/X intersection halls, rooms, medbay, armory, stairs up/down. \n\nConceptually it would play like some sort of controlled procedural generated rogue lite. Maybe retro 90s/early 2000s FPS. Make the construction of the new map areas visually appealing and add some variety to each map type piece and it could be a good time."
k30dg6,"Trying to make a simple multi-player city building game, that plays similar to CIV/Banish based around Catan the board game!","Hey all,\n\nI wanted to start some discussion around my ideas, I am starting to make a prototype now and will hopefully need some testers soon!\n\nAs the title says, I am looking to make a multi-player city building game, it will be 2D isometric hex grid based, mostly for simplicity and considering to port to mobile.\n\nIf you have played Catan the board game, I am trying to develop upon that with more of a CIV/Banished feel.\n\nI am looking to create a game that includes the below (this is my list so far):\n\n1. Simple to play\n2. Decent counter-play (plundering trade routes?, burning farms?, theft?) - % success rates for risk to reward\n3. Forced to work together / trade, no one is on an official team\n4. 4 to 6 players per game (4 for the prototype)\n5. Point system (i.e. first to 10 points, a city hall = 1 points, upgrades add more points, wonders = 3 points) - Different ways to get points (i.e. in Catan, people always compete for ""Longest Road"" and who ever has the longest road holds 2 points, create a lot more competitive play)\n6. VERY basic weather system (Hot / Cold - Less productive in winter, require firewood for warmth)\n7. Basic job allocation (if there are any sprites/villagers in the game, they probably wont show they are working, thats a lot of work from when I last tried to do this, they will just run around mostly)\n8. Unique resources (i.e. give strong buffs to the player that controls it)\n   1. Horses (improve travel / efficiency)\n   2. Sheep (wool for warmth, less affected by colder periods)\n   3. Cows (Great sources of food allow you to mass grow population for more efficiencies - rather than spending grass tiles making farms)\n\nThat is a quick summary, let me know what you think, would be excited to start some conversation.\n\n[A link to a quick photo of the tile map I have made to help conceptualize](https://ibb.co/MZf7bxz)\n\nThanks all!\n\nCavernlight Studios"

k2y4y2,Awake and Sneaky,"Basically Wario Ware Sneaky gamer except you have a bar for fun and sleepiness.\n\nYour character is laying in their bed and is playing mobile games to relax from their school day. Too bad they have a strict mom who wants them asleep by a certain time. You must fill your fun bar by playing games, but if your caught by your mom you'll get a game over. To hid from your mom you must close your eyes and pretend to sleep, the problem is that the longer you do this the more tired you'll get. \n\nGame play\n\nWhen your mom is walking down to your room you'll hear footsteps and a creak or two from the floor boards. Your room will also cause noises like books falling or something falling off your shelf. If it is a loud noise like falling books your mom will rush to your room and see what is going on.\n\nYou have to play the games on your phone to fill up your fun meter. For example you would have to get past 5 tubes in flappy bird, or you'll have to complete a puzzle. The longer you play games the more immersed you get and after a minute your entire screen gets covered with the game. This also causes background noises to be muffled or completely silenced, but on the plus side it fills up your fun bar a bit more. \nToo clarify completing games will fill up your fun bar, finishing 3 or more games will make you immersed with the game.\n\nPretending to sleep causes your sleep bar to fill up and if it does get filled up before you complete your fun meter, you fall asleep and get a game over. Playing games will slowly cause your sleep bar to decrease.\n\nYou have to complete 7 days to win, and each day will require you to play more games cause of the increasing stress from school. To finish a night you have to fill up your fun bar first, then fill up your sleep bar to fall asleep.\n\nSummary\n\nBasically its a game about listening carefully and managing your needs."
k2y026,Stop the Anschluss! A semi-humorous reverse-Pac-Man game with a World War II theme.,"The idea is that it's a real-time strategy reverse-Pac-Man game with a World War II theme. I came up with it after hearing the word Anschluss and being reminded of Pac-Man for some reason and then spent WAAAAYYYY to long thinking WAAAAYYYY to hard about it. \n\nThe bad guy is Hitler's head, which is controlled by the computer and replaces Pac-Man. By default he has a grim expression. The player controls the four Allies, which are Winston Churchill's head (Britain), Charles De Gaulle's head (France), Franklin D. Roosevelt's head (America), and Joseph Stalin's head (the Soviet Union), which take the place of Pinky, Inky, Blinky, and Clyde. Their goal is to trap and kill Hitler by touching him with one of the Allies. The game would have four modes: Arcade Mode, Total War Mode, Endless War Mode, and Custom Mode. Arcade Mode is the basic mode and all the other modes build on top of it, so I'll start there. \n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe maps are all mazes, just like Pac-Man. Each one is divided into sectors, with each sector representing a country Hitler is attempting to Anschluss, sort of like how Pac-Man's maps are divided into quadrants. Initially, there are no power pellet equivalents, only normal ones, which represent the country's resources and population. Hitler travels around the map plundering the pellets. Once Hitler successfully plunders all of the pellets inside the sector, a power pellet representing that country's gold reserves appears. If Hitler plunders it, he Anschlusses the sector and gains Blitzkrieg-Power for a short period of time, where he moves faster than the allies and can defeat them and knock them out of the round. Once Hitler Anschlusses a sector, he also gets Anschluss-Power. This does nothing other than changing Hitler's default grim expression to a smug expression. Do not allow Hitler to get Anschluss-Power! No one likes smug Hitler! Also, every once in a while Hitler's doctor Theodor Morell will send pills bouncing across the map, replacing the fruit. The point the pills start from is not fixed to make camping it harder. If Hitler gets the pills, he gains Meth-Power for a short time, where he moves faster but more randomly and erratically, which can screw Hitler over by sending him in the wrong direction or by making him just sit there and jitter back and forth. This is a reference to Morell giving Hitler methamphetamine injections to deal with stress related stomach cramps. \n\nIf Hitler knocks all of the Allies out of the war or Anschlusses every sector, he wins and you lose a life. The Allies win if they touch Hitler, killing him. At the end of each round, the player earns 500 points for each sector with pellets still in it, 250 points for each sector that has no pellets but has not been Anschlussed, and 10 points for each pellet still on the field. You lose 100 points for every ally defeated by Hitler that round. You play until you run out of lives, at which point you get a high score. \n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal War Mode is a campaign mode that builds off of Arcade Mode's rules. It takes place over a set of themed maps based around the various theatres during World War II, running in chronological order. Points play a much larger role, as detailed below. Each map is also more complex, with things like rivers crossed by bridges that can be destroyed or rebuilt to hinder Hitler's movements or concentration camps that can be liberated. These activities take time and will take the Ally doing them out of the fray until their are completed. Additionally, some maps include national treasures like art and monuments, which spawn at the start of the round alongside the normal pellets. These give Hitler Mini-Blitzkrieg-Mode if he plunders them, which is like Blitzkrieg-Mode, only Hitler doesn't move as fast and it doesn't last as long. Allies that are defeated must be revived using points earned in previous rounds. \n\nIn addition to Dr. Morell, Hitler is now assisted by Erich Raeder, Herman Goering, and Heinrich Himmler, who will all send their own unique power-ups bouncing across the map to give Hitler a boost if he can get to them. Like in Arcade Mode, hese power-ups do not have a fixed spawn point so it's harder for the player to camp them. \n\n* Erich Raeder will send power-ups that give Hitler U-boat-Power, which allows him to send a U-boat to wander around the map and attack one of the Allies for a limited time. France and the USSR are immune to U-boat-Power, and America is always killed by it. Obviously, America is prioritized by the U-boat when possible. \n* Herman Goering will send power-ups that give Hitler Luftwaffe-Power, which allows him to send Stukas to immediately attack one of the Allies, which must dodge the incoming bombs. America is immune to Luftwaffe-Power. \n* Heinrich Himmler will send power-ups that give Hitler SS-Power, which allows him to send an SS soldier to wander around the map for a limited time. America and Britain are immune to SS-Power. \n\nEach of the Allies also gains a special power to help in the fight against Hitler. Charges are purchased using points earned from the previous rounds, and cost different amounts for each country. Unused charges and points carry over from round to round, and spending points does not detract from your high score. Defeated Allies may not use their powers. \n\n* America has Lend-Lease-Power, which allows it to revive a defeated Ally or add one additional charge to another Ally's ability. This power is the most expensive power to purchase. \n* Britain has Warspite-Power, which sends the battleship HMS Warspite to intercept and destroy one of Hitler's power-ups that are currently on the field. This is a reference to the British blockade of Germany starving it of resources during the War. \n* France has Resistance-Power, which allows it to rejuvenate an Anschlussed sector or add some pellets to a sector that has lost them. Beware, thought! A rejuvenated sector that has already been Anschlussed can be Anschlussed again, giving Hitler another charge of Blitzkrieg-Power! \n* The USSR has Reinforcements-Power, which allows it to respawn after a set period of time if they are defeated. This is a reference to how the USSR had vast quantities of men to replace losses and was able to come back from a dire situation after the Battles of Stalingrad and Leningrad. \n\nAdditionally, in the mid- to late-game the Allies may purchase armor in the form of tanks that increase their hit points and affects their speed. This is represented by the various Allies' heads on tank treads. Once the extra hit points are depleted, the tank is destroyed and the Ally in question goes back to their default speed and sprite. \n\n* Russia may purchase T-34-Power, which gives it one extra hit point. \n* America may purchase M4-Sherman-Power, which gives it one extra hit point and makes it move slightly faster while it is active. \n* Britain may purchase Matilda-Power, which gives it two extra hit points but slows it down a little while it is active. \n* France may purchase Char-B1-Power, which gives it three extra hit points but slows it down considerably while it is active. \n\nAll of these upgrades are unlocked over time as the player progresses through the campaign. Hitler will also receive power-ups more frequently over time, and they will spawn closer to him to make it easier for him to get them. As the campaign goes on, he also gains Panzer-Power, which gives him one extra hit point, Tiger-Power, which gives him two extra hit points, and King-Tiger-Power, which gives him three extra hit points. These are represented by Hitler's head on different tank treads, just like with the Allies. How soon he gets these depends on how well you do and the difficulty setting. \n\nYou win once you defeat Hitler on the final map, the Reichstag, at which point you get a high score. \n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEndless War mode is the same as Total War Mode, just without a win condition. You play until Hitler wins. \n\n\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustom mode allows you to set the perimeters for either a single round, set of rounds, endless game, or a custom campaign. Everything, and I mean everything, may be changed to your heart's content. \n\nSo... what does everyone think? I hope no one finds this offensive and I apologize if anyone does, as it was not my intention. I just wanted to share a silly game about fighting Hitler that I came up with in my free time."

k2o6ou,An ambitious idea spawned from a dream,"I had an interesting dream last night that I think would make for a blockbuster of a game if done right and with enough resources.  The main premise is something along the lines of a trio party of demon slayers/hunters.  Each unique with a unique play style (hack and slasher/brawler/ranged/mage/gunner) and you can pick which one for a different story perspective.  But they are special in the sense that they all have additional visual modes (i.e. night vision, infrared, ""demon vision/soul vision"").  The visual modes will come into play for different areas of the game or with different enemies.  \n\nFor example, some areas are dark or have some kind of visual limitation or stimulus that requires switching modes.  Some enemies are invisible or disguised as humans or things and the only tell is to switch visual modes.  You will be able to interact with NPC's with a fallout or mass effect style dialogue exchange.   Some of whom may be demons in disguise and the only tell would be to switch visual modes.  They could also change at points in the game (was human, now a demon in disguise or they were killed and replaced by a demon). \n\nYou must always be on your guard and use your vision modes to ensure NPC's are innocent or trustworthy.  You may be attacked when you are exploring a town or wander from your party and must be constantly vigilant (as a demon hunter should be).  You may be in a crowded city and suddenly stabbed by a demon assassin disguised as a human only to be prevented by using your *demon/soul vision* to ensure that the area is safe.  You could also be exploring an area when an invisible demon attacks when you wouldn't expect it.\n\nOn to combat.  I am envisioning something like devil may cry, a lock on style targeting system with gun play and combos.  Each character will have a style and skill tree to upgrade and unlock better skills/combos/perks/etc.  When allied are nearby, you can combo with them.  Ranged and gunners can use target lock on close enemies or free aim for targets out of range.  But i also like the idea of being able to switch between 3rd and 1st person perspectives.  \n\nDifficulty would have two elements.   The base game would have your health/damage buffs of course, easier modes giving you more damage resistance and such so you can breeze through soaking up damage just to enjoy the story.  With the harder modes would reduce your health or make you take damage.  One thing i cannot stand is harder difficulties just buffing enemies.  I still want to be able to kill fodder efficiently, otherwise it's a slog.  The second element would be whether you use your vision effectively or not.  Say you speak to an npc and they send you to an area to save a person.  You get there and suddenly you are attacked.  The npc was a demon in disguise and you didn't vet them.  Or you work with an npc you worked with suddenly becomes a demon and when you have your back turned, they try to kill you because you assumed they would always be human.\n\nI also think this game would benefit from a permadeath mode.  Say you fail to thwart an assassination attempt or you fail to rescue a party member who was kidnapped.  Well you/they are dead. But your party must continue on without the missing member.  The game would have different endings/mission branches depending on who died and when it happened.\n\nThe goal is to be a fun hack and slash style game with crazy demons who could attack you at any moment.  Npcs can't always be trusted, so there is an added layer of paranoia the game should instill on you.  You shouldn't trust your eyes alone but should trust in your *special* eyes.  The game should have you constantly on guard against enemies and strangers alike.\n\nTl;dr: devil may cry style combo beatem up but with metroid prime visual modes. 3 party members(demon hunters) and Fallout npc interaction, some of whom can be demons in disguise.  Don't trust that anyone is human as they can be disguised or mislead you.  Not souls like hard unless you make it that way.  Permadeath options."
k2nmsm,How would Celeste's dash work in 3D?,"How would Celeste's dash work in 3d? There are a few criteria this needs to follow. \n1. You need to be able to aim it in all directions, just like in the game. \n2. Needs to work consistently in all camera angles, so that means no aiming it like in a 3rd person shooter\n3. Needs to use as few buttons as possible, needs to be as simplistic as the actual game. \n4.

Where you need to drive a car or any other vehicles.   \nSuggestion 2: Different place have different histories and different ghosts so random ghost summonings can get interesting. Such as the hospital which is burnt down to ashes. Ghosts have a ward (mostly from their former memories) that makes the pathways different or the building larger, so the player aim is to escape it.  \nSuggestion 3 : Random Ghosts, Such as meeting the slenderman and forced to play his game if you wander into a forest, searching for something. Or even meeting a lady of ice when climbing up a chilly mountain.    \nSuggestion 3: Take as much ideas from creepypastas if possible. Ghosts can stack so the difficulty can be self adjusted. Every ghost have a way to ward off and a way to killed permanently.  \nSuggestion 4 : All info and history of ghosts can be found it the book. So the  book is kinda like a wikipedia, ways to kill permanently is needed to be found in other ancient books doe (which can be finded in specific places).  \nYeah i know this is a super large game.

k2cmjw,Upgrade Corp,"Concept  \nThe general idea of the game is to be a sandbox, attributes simulating game with RPG elements, the concept is to have a very simple customizable world where you can spawn characters of your choice, and what you do with those characters is upgrading their stats in order to see how strong they can become and how they use their powers to interact with the world you made, let's say you add a human character that is very weak, but decide to increase his strength by a hundred points, then it would be a good idea to spawn a tree in your world and see what it happens when you make your character punch it, maybe even add another character that has got a lot of defence and try seeing the result of their fight.  \nAppearance  \nThe game is supposed to be simple, it would probably be better to be 3D as it would be cooler to control your character that way when using their powers, but I believe it should have a very simple design with probably something resembling Minecraft, Kogama or Roblox with their cube-like shapes.  \nIdeas  \nSomething that seems really fun is to have an option for players to design their own characters, objects to place in a world and even powers for the characters to have, for characters it could be something like Minecraft's skin creator, with the only difference being sliders to change the size and thins like that, for world players could send their creations and have them into the game if approved.  \nExamples  \nOne example I thought about is Mutilate a Doll 2, a game that you have a human character and A TON of stuff to use for whatever you want, and as the name says, you can mostly use them to kill that doll however you want, that feeling of being able to do anything with the items you are provided with is what I imagine for this game, something else from Mutilate a Doll 2 is how it has many elements to use such as fire, water, radiation and many others, this could be added into the game for superpower and spell creations, you could really feel like a mage if you could make a blast skill with fire or water and give it to a character, have presets for skills and just edit them by increasing size, power, duration of effect and changing what element the skill uses."

k28elo,Need an artist?!, Hi guys.  I recently started learning character design and I wanna practice some :3\n\nSo if anyone out there is working on a game and stuck on the art part I'm willing to jump on for free.\n\nBelow are some characters that I made few days ago down 👇\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/En2t590XcAAlk\_W?format=jpg&amp;name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/En2t590XcAAlk_W?format=jpg&amp;name=medium)
k27gvq,Acting party game.,"**General**\n\nLike the game Jackbox, there are multiple minigames you can choose. You can also play in marathon mode where you play all minigames in one sitting. Since it's a party game, there should at least be 3 players to get the best experience. The game also has a mature mode that includes darker and dirtier humor for those of age.\n\n**How to play**\n\nOnly one has to buy the game. The rest can join for free through the member version on mobile, PC and consoles (Yes, just like Jackbox). Every minigame is rewarded with points. The jury are the players so... don't be a dick. Finally, the game is meant as a party game, but it can also be fun for those in acting classes or actual actors to play this game competitively!\n\n**Minigame examples**\n\nThere are plenty of iterations you can expand upon, but these were some ideas I had you can put in the game.\n\n- Who Am I?\n\nEvery round, players get a character displayed on their phone. They have 10 seconds to play that actor, the others have to guess who that character is. There are 3 rounds in total, every round spices up the challenge by adding extra names. For example: first round is Robbie Williams, second round is Kermit the Frog and Master Chief, third round is Donald Trump, Morgan Freeman and Spongebob.\n\n- Who Are We?\n\nLike Who Am I, but a tibbit more... chaotic! Every round has one guesser who's chosen randomly. The rest has to play a character. The guesser has to guess who is playing who. But there is a catch. They have 10 seconds to make sure the guesser knows who they are playing in the same round!\n\n- The Confrontation!\n\nYou need to write down 3 random names of your choice and a problem that needs to be solved within 80 seconds. After the time expires, the game displays the duo's, the characters they will play and the problem they're facing. They have 45 seconds to play these characters and try to solve the problem. Whoever had the best performance, wins.\n\n- Don't Crack!\n\nYou start the game with a duo. They have to sit opposite of eachother and start a conversation. However, the other partymembers have to change their roles once every 10 seconds. So the game can start with Mario talking to Geralt, after 10 seconds it's Mario and Walter White and after 2p seconds it's Walter White and Borat. The first to laugh, loses.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Would you play this with your friends/family?"

k1zsal,Augmented reality territory capture game that uses the actual night sky as the map (like Ingress in the sky),"Gameplay is like Ingress with factions working to capture territory by linking points of interest together to create fields of influence, but instead of places on earth, the points of interest are objects in the actual night sky. You can only play at night and can interact most strongly with objects directly over your current GPS location. Brighter stars are more valuable, important, or powerful. Moon and planet locations create additional effects and interference. Special events occur with moon phases, equinoxes, and solstices."

You make friends in the military, you go through the war, and somewhere on the way, you meet Murtagh and thorn/Eragon and saphira. your only goal is to survive the war, and get back to your family, depending on your actions, you might as well meet Roran (if you're a Varden).

k98ewi,"A multiplayer card game like ""one"", but the cards are natural disasters or things of mass destruction and each player has a country to protect.","The turns in the game would be rotating as in ""one"". Each player would have a country or city to protect. The cities would be on a standard map so that all players would have the same map and terrain where they would locate their buildings and main points such as hospitals, army, supply points. At the beginning of the game, cards will be dealt randomly to everyone, and when it is the turn of a player, he will not be able to see the city of the next player but will be able to choose in which points on the map he wants to activate a card. Depending on the card this will have a range of major or minor damage, for example earthquakes or asteroids. \nBut if they don't get it right the damage will only be to the ground.Destroying a key point would create problems, such as destroying a hospital would make people no longer able to heal. Or destroying the navy would make them unable to defend themselves against attacks from soldiers or missiles. The player with the most inhabitants will win."

k96i6d,A game sorta like risk.,"I'm not sure if a game like this exists, but I've always wanted a game like this. So essentially there are 2 or more armies. (Depending on how many you choose.) The game would play out like risk, you attack connecting countries. The end goal would be to either take the capital or to dominate the world. Instead of dice rolling though or whatever, when you attack a country the game turns into an FPS. You and your army have to capture regions, whoever conquers the most regions by the time a time limit runs out, they either capture (or defended) that country. So it starts with an overworld map, then when you attack a country it goes into a region's map. To take a region it would be like a game of domination in battlefield, whoever holds the most points takes that region and moves onto the next region. You have to be careful though, every time you load into a country you can select a certain amount of units to take with you, tanks, planes, etc. If they get killed or destroyed then they're gone. So let's say you attack a region with 100 people, and only 20 people make it. Those 20 can either stand and defend or move on to attack until you call in reinforcements. The game would still act like an FPS though, with custom classes and stuff. Also, each region/country would be different gameplay-wise. The towns/areas would be unique to the actual area in the world. So let's say you attack Egypt, it would be a desert. If you attack Antarctica, it would be snowy. Etc. I also understand that a game like this would take forever to play, and that's why I'm thinking it should primarily be a single-player game. Also, you could do special missions where you can infiltrate enemy bases and stuff as special ops units, you could infiltrate a factory and blow it up to stop the production of tanks or something like that. So when you destroy the enemies tanks, they can't call in reinforcements. I have a lot more ideas for this game and it would get really deep, but i just wanted to share the basic idea."
k95km5,"A game like Pokemon, except you play as the kids who are playing Pokemon","That headline was confusing, so let me explain.\n\nI've always had a soft spot for games that are set in real, modern-day society — much like Persona or TWEWY. I like the feeling of balancing school/work life against some other supernatural pursuit. Even Harry Potter has this feeling to it. It allows you to write characters that are genuinely relateable, but still provide gameplay that's more interesting than simply going to school/work.\n\nNow, what if we had an RPG where the kids were — canonically — playing an AR game like Pokemon GO? I imagine it to be somewhat like Persona. The daytime segments would involve school life, and the after school segments would involve running around the neighborhood, catching Pokemon, and fighting rival trainers.\n\nYou could still structure it like a regular Pokemon game with 8 gyms if you want to. Just make the characters a bit older (high school instead of late elementary school), and have them travel around the city in search of these MMO hotshots. And of course the gym leaders will all be hilarious in real life — the turbo nerd, the guy who looks like a jock but actually plays video games, etc etc.\n\nWell, that would be cool, but I really imagine it more like [Boku no Natsuyasumi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX2I0YanKMg) (which I haven't played yet, but it looks great). A game where you can just run around town and be a kid, but contextualized with the objective of catching new Pokemon and training to ""be the best""."
k914q1,A magic casting indie game with cool combat.,"A PvE action adventure game where u learn new spells as u fight against  zealots and cultists that practice magic as well.\n\nCombat works like this.\n\nEvery spell is made of a combination of signs(arm gestures). for example 4 buttons on controller are mapped to 4 different signs(arm gestures).For ex, To throw fireball , u must perform the right signs/gestures in the right order and press execute button to activate.\n\nNow comes the fun part.\n\nenemies will also cast spells like this. which means u can predict which spells they are going to attack you with by looking at the gestures , and so u can counter accordingly. if u recognize that your enemy is creating a fireball, u can create a water shield if u have time to perform the counter spell, which will depend on how many gestures the spell requires.\n\nAlso experienced players can start with the intention of casting one spell, but switch to another spell that requires the same initial gestures mid cast if the battle situation changes and another spell becomes more useful.\n\nNow the main idea of the game.\n\nYour character will have the  unique ability to steal gestures from enemies. This will not only allow you to stop a spell from an enemy, but u can also use the gestures to complete your own gesture combination , thus quickening your cast time.\n\nFor ex, if u are standing in puddle of water, and recognize one of your enemy is creating a shock spell, u can steal the already performed gestures from him to momentarily disable him and force him to start again. Then u can complete the sequence of gestures yourself to cast the shock spell back at him. \n\nMore experienced players will opt to use the stolen gestures to complete a different spell that is more optimal for the situation, since they would have faster spell recognition time and deeper knowledge of the different combinations.\n\nYou can also start casting your own gestures, then recognize one of your enemies is performing  the ending part of your combination, steal it from him to instantly complete your combination and fire the spell.\n\nI believe the skill ceiling here is very high , and does not depend on aim ,but more on deep understanding of the different combinations ,how one spell can change into another, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if this make any sense lol."

k8xe5q,Silent Hill-inspired Psychological Stealth Horror Noir Thriller About A Prostitute Being Stalked,"**Inspirations-** DC's Gotham City (1941-Present), *Amnesia* series (2010-Present), *Evil Dead* (2013), *Eternal Darkness* (2002), *Far Cry 3* (2012), *Grand Theft Auto* series (1997-2013), *Haunting Ground* (2005), *L.A. Noire* (2011), *Perfect Blue* (1997), *Resident Evil* series (1996-Present), *Saw* series (2004-Present), *Silent Hill* series (1999-2014), *The Crow* (1994), *The Wolf Among Us* (2013), *Until Dawn* (2015), *Visage* (2018)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Premise-** What starts as just another evening working the streets becomes a descent into Hell as a young prostitute is pursued throughout her seedy, Gothic crime-ridden city by a tenacious faceless stalker. In no shape to fight back effectively due to her drug addiction, her best defense is her wits. Running &amp; hiding, she must survive this shadowy killer long enough to hopefully find some escape and/or help. It's not always easy, however, for a hooker to know who to trust or be trusted by others. The stalker is very clever &amp; unpredictable, often using knowledge of the woman's past (including troubled family history) to torture or manipulate her via a series of sick, elaborate mind games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis figure claims to actually be doing what's best to help her, to *""save""* her. But why her, and what's the endgame? Additionally, her journey through the darkness is plagued by sporadic visual &amp; auditory hallucinations from withdrawal that transform the city and at times people around her into nightmarish perversions. Which of these two will walk away from this cat &amp; mouse to finally see the dawn of tomorrow? And, should this woman finally face her own demons, can she earn forgiveness or perhaps even redemption? That's up to you, as your choices shape how the night plays out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Setting-** Possibly somewhere between the 1980's-90's? It wouldn't be as far back as the 60's, but I'd prefer a time period that supports a noir atmosphere and doesn't have a lot of modern technology to create potential plot holes like *""Why couldn't you use a cell phone, borrow someone's laptop, etc""*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genres-** Psychological horror, survival-horror, stealth, crime-thriller, puzzle, choice-driven, noir\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Working Titles (Suggestions Welcome)-** *Dark Trek*, *Dark Trek: Reflection*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay-** Played in 3rd person, you travel from location to location exploring while finding key items to solve narrative &amp; environmental puzzles. Along the way, you will interact with NPC's, make choices, navigate hallucinations, sneak around various threats, and escape the stalker when he/she appears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Customization-** As you explore levels, you find various items to create your own unique image of the player-character (shoes, boots, gloves, shirts, jackets, coats, leggings, skirts, accessories, etc) which also affects the story. Ex- What you wear changes the stalker's figure and how he/she acts toward you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Characters-** I don't have exact names figured out yet, so we'll just identify the cast as the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Lady*\- The protagonist, a 20-something working woman with a dark past and deep trust issues who's struggled with alcohol &amp; drug addiction but is contemplating leaving the business to enter rehab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Stalker*\- The main antagonist. His/her face is always somehow obscured by darkness (regardless of how lighting changes, which is a narrative clue), and the voice is distorted like Tobin Bell's Jigsaw. Lady initially chalks these strange details up to side-effects from withdrawal. For the majority of the plot, you only see a tall silhouette in a long coat. He/she also gets more disfigured (chiefly in later nightmare levels), depending on your choices. This boogeyman never moves quicker than a fast jog, but is very strong and always seems to be two steps ahead of you even after you've outrun him/her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Crystal*\- Another, more experienced prostitute of similar age who's worked with Lady for years, introduced her to their current pimp, and has contributed to her addiction. Unlike Lady, however, she comes from a far more privileged background with no history of abuse. Sometimes nicknamed *""street sister""*, she's Lady's closest friend and the first person she's opened up to enough to trust since childhood. After having visited and left multiple rehab centers over time, she discourages Lady from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Donny-* Lady &amp; Crystal's pimp. A 40-something veteran of the streets, he pays their *""salary""* and applies occasional drugs as a reward for a successful night's work but has little patience for drama or mistakes. Lady pleads for Crystal to keep their talk of rehab quiet, as they know exactly how he'd react.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Buster*\- A mildly obese middle-aged divorcee who still wears his wedding ring, refusing to accept responsibility for how he ruined what was already a failing marriage through this weakness for prostitutes. He's one of the first customers to approach Lady the evening her stalker first appears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Jerry*\- A quiet, but kind introvert who's never had much luck with relationships and cashiers at a convenience store across from the street where Lady often works. Against his better judgment and in spite of numerous warning signs regarding her disorderly life, he's had feelings for Lady since they first met when she entered the store and he caught her about to steal a drink but instead paid for it himself. Always supportive, to the point that he has yet to speak out against her occupation, he does occasionally drop subtle hints in his secret hope that she'll leave that world to get herself help one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Roger*\- An aged police officer who sometimes patrols the streets where Lady &amp; Crystal work and has arrested both of them before at one time or another. Unfortunately, he could never get anything to stick and was forced to let them off with a warning. Though unapproving and fully willing to lock them up, he has seen many young, abused women die in this city and is sympathetic toward Lady at heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Judy-* Lady's long estranged aunt, who took care of her on &amp; off in childhood after one of her parents committed suicide (The choices you make in the story affect which parent fills this role).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Phoner*\- A creepy, but oddly familiar voice that acts independently from the stalker and speaks to Lady at points throughout her journey via calls from various sources at different unconnected locations (cell, phonebooth, old rotary, etc). Whether it's male or female depends on certain choices you make, but both versions share the same personality &amp; dialogue options. This unidentifiable caller has borderline-omniscient knowledge about Lady's movements, choices, and even scarily accurate insight on her thoughts. Ranging from playful to mocking, condescending, apologetic, threatening, cryptic, or flat out not making sense (Your decisions also influence this), the almost schizophrenic sounding phoner's goals are never clear. Nonetheless, he/she can be an uneasy ally to help Lady stay alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Levels-** Your journey takes you at least halfway across the city between dusk-dawn. This experience wears its *Silent Hill* influence on its sleeve as you explore a dark nightlife thick with eerie fog through varied environments (dilapidated streets, alleyways with occasional branching paths and/or clutter blocking the way, clubs, drug dens, rainy rooftops, abandoned apartments, an understaffed gas station, a scummy parking garage, a near-empty impoverished suburb, subway underground, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeather changes (rain, thunder &amp; lightning, snow, etc) in a combination of random dynamic shifts during free-roaming + predetermined story moments. The Gothic architecture is colored &amp; stylized similarly to the comic book aesthetic of Telltale's *The Walking Dead* or *The Wolf Among Us*, though not in the same style of animation. Both this and the soundtrack add to the noir tone. Taking inspiration from Akira Yamaoka, music ranges from tranquil to emotional, mysterious, disorienting or haunting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nightmare Levels-** Just like *Silent Hill*, these episodes of physical/mental stress warp the world into a grotesque (in some cases, more grotesque) caricature. There is no warning sign like a siren, the sky darkening, or other cues. It often happens seemingly at random. Most of these twisted locales are generally characterized by blood, rust, disrepair, barbed wire, things that defy physics and/or logically just shouldn't be there. This includes corpses, childhood memories, and so much more. Some of these transformed levels don't return to normal until after you accomplish a goal like solving a puzzle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLady is in some ways more vulnerable during certain nightmare sequences (Ex- Gradually depleting health). In most such levels, something typically plays with you as many of the themes mess with sight and/or sound (Blurred vision like in *P.T.*'s red looping hallway with the crazy eyes, music playing in reverse, sound effects distorting, controls not responding accurately, the game messaging you, etc). Any NPC's previously present are replaced by deformed monstrosities reflecting Lady's mental state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Difficulty-** This is set up at the start menu before beginning your playthrough. If enemies, puzzles, or other gameplay aspects are too easy or hard, you can adjust it. Manual saving allows you to reload earlier saves at almost any time, but this can be disabled for conventional checkpoints. Hard mode limits saves, health, and stamina much more while enemies are stronger and timed choices shorter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Content-** Despite its sensationalized/stylized aspects, this is a grounded, mature experience that delves into dark themes: The life &amp; business of prostitution, infidelity, alcoholism, hard drug use, suicide, physical &amp; mental effects of addiction, withdrawal &amp; relapse, rehabilitation, harassment &amp; stalking, emotional &amp; sexual abuse, pedophilia, toxic relationships, violence, and murder. Scenes of sex or other graphic activity would be established or implied, but not explicit to the point of pornography.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTypical death scenes mostly involve Lady blacking out from lack of oxygen (Ex- Being caught &amp; strangled by the stalker or another enemy), but there are more graphic deaths such as being shot, drowned, crushed in an elevator drop, falling from great heights onto rebar, etc. The game won't hold back in unapologetically showing your failures' consequences, emphasizing the need to choose wisely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Choices-** These include timed branching dialogue choices, what path to take in certain levels (often during chases, such as when to hide vs. run), and timed ethical decisions at plot-critical moments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Survival-** Health functions much like in *Silent Hill* or *Resident Evil*, signified by a colored *""vital signs""* graphic viewable in the menu (or, optionally, in a small onscreen hud at either of the bottom screen corners). Changes in weather also affect your body temperature throughout. To avoid losing health and/or stamina during these periods, you must find, exchange, purchase, or steal appropriate clothing along with matches to start fires as needed. Stamina governs running &amp; combat, but is also limited (partially by withdrawal). Overexertion blurs vision and makes you move slower from lack of breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stealth-** Sneaking is affected by many ever changing factors throughout, including footstep noise and tracks. Changes in weather impact sneaking like a puzzle in itself (Creaky floors making footsteps louder, water, blood, and snow leaving tracks, lightning giving away your location if you're caught in the flashes, etc). If/when stealth fails and you are caught in the open, you must flee. The mechanics in this mainly take influence from *Silent Hill: Shattered Memories*, *Downpour*, and *Resident Evil 2*'s remake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChases take some small influence from *Shattered Memories*. Mastering the environment is crucial, as objects &amp; obstacles can be used to slow your pursuer. Some combat is allowed, but usually not ideal. If caught in a grab, this can stun you or lead to choking animations that drain health. You can't overpower the stalker or other enemies, but can stun them (Throwing objects, swinging a chair or 2x4, exploiting traps, etc). Lastly, collecting a limited number of self-defense items with varying durability (Knife, scissors, glass shard) allows you to instantly escape when grabbed without damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzles-** Apart from free-roaming environmental puzzles, there are character-driven obstacles in which you must make the right choices in dialogue for your desired outcome. Failing at this usually won't end the game, but will close the door to certain paths while possibly causing new obstacles/dangers to appear. Some choices affect nightmare puzzles too, such as where/when they happen. But the scariest riddles are created by the stalker, showing the depth if his/her obsession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn specific areas, you discover something he/she constructed from a memory in your past. Ex- One room in a nasty building that's spotlessly clean looks like an exact replica of Lady's childhood home's living room, complete with the same type of couch &amp; TV (emitting static) and mannequins modeled after her parents, matching their likeness down to the smallest details. These life-sized dioramas always have a theme, riddle, plot connection, and a potential clue to the stalker's true identity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach one is set up like an escape room that must be completed to progress to the next level, with cameras the stalker uses to watch Lady from an unknown location and some form of message (letter, recording, writing in blood, etc) disguising hints, very much like Jigsaw. Solutions include using one or more key items found throughout the level, items already set up in the room, manipulating lighting, and other activities. Some obstacles are timed once you begin, but there are no death traps if you fail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike stealth, combat, and dialogue, puzzles often have multiple possible solutions, allowing some flexibility in players' approach to different situations. Be aware, however, that the solution you implement can potentially affect the ending. Morality factors into some of these as well. Ex- Will you solve a challenge by finding a hidden item, or make it easier to progress by sacrificing someone else? A few hints also come in the form of calls from the mysterious phoner, who sometimes conveys cryptic messages during your dialogues to nudge Lady in a more productive direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot-** An introductory cutscene shows Lady walking down a rainy alley at night, until a shadowy figure appears (This is the silhouette of a gender-neutral enemy with no discernible features, not the stalker you encounter later). She questions who it is and what he/she wants, but gets no reply. As he/she slowly picks up step in their approach, fast-walking with eerie body language, Lady curses at him/her to get away before turning to start running. This cutscene skips ahead in time to begin a stealth tutorial when Lady hides inside a grimy building only for the figure to break in and patrol the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe/she calls Lady's name in a low, distorted voice (not the voice the stalker uses). Even if you sneak perfectly though, she is inevitably caught before reaching the exit, after which you complete a combat tutorial by stunning the enemy with a grabbed item of your choice. Succeeding at this leads to Lady escaping by crashing out a window. Falling one story onto the dumpster below, she rolls off to the ground and lands in a dirty puddle. Struggling to stand on an injured ankle, she limps away in audible pain. The initially light rain worsens as she moves deeper into the increasingly labyrinthian alleyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommenting on how she can't make any sense of where she is despite having lived in this city for years, Lady once again hears the pursuer not far behind and has nowhere to go but forward (Every door she tries is locked, and nobody hears her cries for help). The environment around you then starts changing into a nightmare (homaging Harry Mason's walk through town at the beginning of *Silent Hill*, after the first siren blares): The sky gets darker, the chain-link fences grow rusted, the rain &amp; puddles turn to the color of blood. Items appear in the streets that look out of place (Ex- A spotless chair).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese represent childhood memories that aren't yet understood, but will make sense in story context later via the stalker's puzzles. The music similarly becomes progressively off-key and unnerving. Coming upon a covered corpse, Lady lifts the bloodstained sheet to see the face of her friend Crystal. She screams, limping faster only to reach a wall of interlinked barbed wire blocking her way. A second corpse (suspiciously dressed identically to her) hangs here, strung up by barbed wire in a crucified pose. Shaking with fear, Lady reluctantly looks closer in a brief pause and realizes this body is her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPanicking, she then turns to see the shadowy figure emerge from the darkness behind her. She makes one last attempt to run, but the path behind them has changed to another dead end. No matter what you do, the enemy eventually catches up and strangles Lady until she blacks out. Waking up gasping for air in bed, she takes a moment to look around the room while feeling her throat. Crystal rushes in, having heard Lady's outburst, and asks if she's all right. Remembering where she is, safe &amp; sound in their crappy shared apartment, she sighs and assures Crystal that she's fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuttering that it must have just been a bad dream, she catches her breath and is offered a drink. Crystal then tells her friend that she's slept all day since they got back from partying last night and they have to start getting ready soon. Their pimp Donny is expecting them for work tonight, and they don't want to piss him off by being late again. Nodding, Lady shakes off fatigue and gets dressed. Checking her neck for bruises in the mirror, she's told to hurry and grabs her purse before following Crystal out the door. They share more dialogue while walking downstairs to Donny's club.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChecking in with him, he sends them on their way outside and Crystal asks Lady to buy her some cigarettes from the convenience store across the street. Accepting this leads to Lady visiting Jerry, who engages in dialogue. Her first moral choice involves whether to buy the cigarettes or steal them and get something she wants. Regardless of how this interaction concludes or whether it occurs at all, time skips again to Lady &amp; Crystal waiting together at their usual spot for the evening's first customers. Their conversation includes the options to discuss where they are in life and/or debate rehabilitation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly afterward, one of their regulars arrives in his typical inebriated fashion. Buster offers his paycheck for quality time with one of his favorite gals, presenting the next choice: Will you go with him, let Crystal go, or have them both turn Buster away? Either way, the night progresses a couple-few hours until Lady is back on the same street. Spotting a mysterious, yet strangely familiar car passing, Lady scoffs to herself at how this jerk's *""window shopped""* on &amp; off for weeks now but never gives any business. Unable to see the driver, she has the option to flip him off before taking a break and leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiving her night's profits to Donny (His reaction and how much he lets you keep is determined by whether you went with Buster), she sits for a minute and is offered another drink. The unseen driver's car enters her peripheral vision again. If you sit too long, Donny chastises you to quit lagging and get back out there. Lady comments that it looks like it will rain tonight, to which he apathetically suggests that she bring a coat or buy an umbrella. Taking whatever she's made thus far, she obeys and exits the club to find Crystal who comments on the outcome of whatever you decided regarding Buster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeeling the urge to urinate, but not wanting to go back in and get an earful from Donny, Lady asks her friend to cover for her while she quickly runs off to find a restroom. Crystal's reaction is affected by your decision with Buster, but you are able to leave regardless. Taking off, Lady has options on where to go (Behind the alley, in her &amp; Crystal's favorite local club away from Donny, or the store where you can convince Jerry to let you use the Employees Only restroom around the far back). The next cutscene shows her leaving whichever location you chose only to find that the rain is getting heavier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis feels eerily similar to her dream, putting her on edge. Eager to get back to Crystal, Lady trudges through the rain but finds her path blocked by a car in the distance. A silhouette wearing a long coat steps out and begins approaching much like the figure from her nightmare. You can offer him/her your money, threaten him with a bluff (despite having no weapons), or offer Lady's *""services""* in exchange for him/her to get her out of the rain. Either way, the figure continues forward without a word. Frightened, Lady flees into the alleys only to somehow get turned around just like in the dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, the chase is on. Running, hiding, and fighting for her life, Lady attempts (and fails) to get help multiple times at different locations while discovering and being forced to solve the stalker's puzzles. However many times she escapes though, this entity inexplicably seems to know where she'll go next, always reappearing later no matter how fast or far she runs as if by teleportation. Her worst fears manifest in every new nightmare &amp; challenge, and some NPC's you meet can become an ally or foe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis white-knuckle hunt's climax leads to a final puzzle, then a twist reminiscent of *Silent Hill 2* or *Dead Space* wherein everything becomes clear: Lady is insane. Almost nothing she's experienced up to now has been real and she's been running aimlessly around the city, suffering hallucinations and fits of hysteria thanks to withdrawal from substance abuse. In the process, long suppressed memories of her past have boiled to the surface, haunting her to the point of creating dangerous stress on her brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuilt over a past wrong has eaten her up inside for years, a secret even Crystal doesn't know. Everything about her current life has been her way of trying to avoid it. The stalker personifies the core of this repressed trauma, the puzzles &amp; phoner having all been fractured bits of her subconscious pushing progressively vivid memories to the forefront. Now, there's nowhere left to run. After one last confrontation, the stalker's face is revealed. What you do next is the final choice to end Lady's arc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Endings-** This is affected by factors like clues &amp; collectibles found, hidden areas explored, how certain puzzles are solved, specific dialogue choices, moral choices, difficulty level, and how much overall time + effort you put into the game. The more you invest in the journey, the better an ending you will earn:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending A*\- The stalker is revealed as Lady's father, and she remembers how he abused her in childhood. Following her mother's suicide after a long battle with depression, this alcoholic monster took advantage of her repeatedly. Worse, he guilt-tripped her over time into believing it was her own fault. Adding that confessing to anybody would break what was left of their family as well as disappoint her late mom, this all created a deep sense of self-loathing within Lady. The only refuge in this child's life was her aunt Judy, but she could never bring herself to speak out despite clear signs of abuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time Judy became suspicious enough to call Child Protective Services, Lady had already run away. Hitchhiking from one place to the next, accepting help from more people who took advantage of her, this pattern continued until the child made it to this city. Soon after, she'd meet Crystal and be given shelter, eventually convinced by this already veteran prostitute to join her profession as a means of income. Reasoning that sex for money couldn't be too hard since she already had some *""experience""*, this was the beginning of what would become Lady's new normal. Now, here she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these years later, the guilt instilled by her father's abuse has followed her. He was always with her, even when she couldn't see him. Deep down, some part of her still felt that she deserved it, that she needed someone to punish her for everything she'd done up to now. But that's all over, as Lady chooses to spare the stalker instead of killing him and talks to the specter of her father. With all her strength, she accepts the past while also renouncing him as nothing but a memory. Taking back all the power he ever had over her, she voices aloud that she will never forget but does forgive him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe forgives not for his sake, but for her own. With that, she can finally move on. Tears of relief fall down Lady's cheeks as she watches the boogeyman disappear and the nightmare fade. Feeling the warmth of the early sunrise, she walks back to her &amp; Crystal's apartment and finds her friend passed out in her bed. Grabbing a couple things, Lady leaves a small goodbye note thanking Crystal for taking her in (pleading that she say nothing to Donny, to buy her some time until she's far away). She then sneaks across the street to the convenience store, making sure nobody from Donny's club sees her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing how messed up she looks, Jerry immediately reacts with concern but Lady calms him before asking one last favor. After sitting down in the back of the store to talk, he ditches work and sneaks her into his car. Lending her some money for a change of clothes at the nearest shop, Jerry takes her a couple hours out of the city to the only place she wants to go: A rehab center. A few weeks later, Lady completes the program and leaves in much better shape with Jerry waiting outside to congratulate her (having kept in touch with her via scheduled supervised phone calls).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanking him with a hug and kiss on the cheek, she requests change for a payphone to call her aunt. Speaking for the first time in years, after so many failed attempts at contact, Judy is relieved to hear Lady's voice and that she wants to come home for a fresh start. Agreeing to pick her up, she makes the trip and arrives another couple hours later. Seeing that Lady looks healthy, she introduces herself to Jerry before breaking down, dropping her purse and pulling her niece in for a mutually emotional embrace. The camera pans out on these three with the sun shining through a haze of clouds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(**Note:** If you made choices that resulted in the stalker's figure/voice being female, this exact same ending can transpire with the roles of Lady's mother &amp; father reversed. In other words, the father would've committed suicide while the mother abused her. In either case, Judy's role is the same)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending B*\- Lady kills the stalker, cries in relief, and walks off as the dawn comes. Reuniting with Jerry at the convenience store, she thanks him for always being there for her and expresses how she wants to get help so they can make a fresh start together. However hard a road it may be, she's done with this life. Convinced, Jerry packs a few things before the two exit the store and leave in his car. Holding hands at a stoplight, she reciprocates his supportive smile with a loving kiss. The light turns green, and they ride out of the city under the morning sun, the camera panning out as they cross a bridge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending C*\- Lady kills the stalker, who is revealed to be Roger. Coming to her senses, she remembers that he followed her after spotting her walking alone in the rain. Recognizing her, he called out multiple times offering to help but she hallucinated him as the shadow from her dreams partially due to the mental effects of withdrawal. Running into a drug den, she was nearly assaulted by three men while a female junkie cheered them on from the background (Two of these four total voices, male &amp; female, were the phoner). Roger intervened to save Lady, but she was in hysterics by that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he kneeled down in attempt to calm her before she hurt herself, she mistook him for one of the would-be-assailants. Following a brief altercation in the pouring rain, she grabbed his gun and pulled the trigger. Initially believing it was self-defense, the unstable Lady slowly realizes what she's done. Crying, heaving, and panicking, she hides the gun in her pocket and loots Roger's wallet before leaving his body in the rain. Hailing a cab, she pays the driver to take her as far outside the city as he can. A couple cabs later, she finds herself in the next town over with night falling once again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuying a few things at the nearest store before renting a room at a local motel, she then cuts &amp; dyes her hair to make herself less recognizable before turning on the TV to watch for news of Roger's reported murder. Consumed with regret for having killed a good man that only ever felt sorry for her, Lady takes out his gun again and holds it tightly in both hands while rocking back and forth on the bed. Her choices have not only ruined her life, but now taken another's. She is alone. The camera pans out the window as the poor woman continues crying, showing the motel as more heavy rain falls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending D*\- Lady kills the stalker, but realizes it was Donny. She then remembers him yelling at her &amp; Crystal before she left that night after overhearing them speaking of rehab. Insisting that Lady was one of his top money makers, he irrationally threatened to hunt her down if she ever tried to leave. Despite Crystal's efforts to cover for her after she left to find a restroom, Donny's paranoia led him to believe she ran away. Striking Crystal in retaliation, he took his car to make good on his promise of hunting Lady. When Lady saw him, however, she hallucinated him as the shadow from her dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing a final altercation after he caught up to her, she managed to grab his gun. Roger follows the sound and catches Lady with Donny's blood on her hands. Believing her claims of self-defense but bound by law to arrest her regardless, he takes her downtown. Despite him making her case to his superior, she's still charged for prostitution + suspected murder (investigation pending). Sitting in a cell, Lady faces an uncertain future but is adamant about being done with the streets. Slowly raising her tear-stained eyes with runny makeup, she stares at the camera closing in until it fades to black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending E*\- Lady and the stalker kill each other. The nightmare then flashes to reality, and Lady's revealed to have overdosed that night after doing drugs with a customer who then abandoned her. The whole game was her brain's swan song before shutting down (The phoner's voices being from specific NPC's she met). Her body's found in a puddle by Roger the next morning. Shaking his head in sadness with a sigh, he reports yet another case of an all too familiar story. The camera closes in on Lady's lifeless face, one tear shown dripping amidst the water on her corpse, before fading to black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending F (Secret Ending)*\- Lady kills the stalker before waking up in her bed in a very similar manner to the beginning of the game. Crystal similarly walks in to investigate the noise and comforts her friend, chuckling that she found Lady passed out at their favorite local club last night after she'd left to find a restroom. It turns out that the stalker's face &amp; voice were a manifestation of the bartender (The phoner's voices were certain patrons sitting in the bar with her). While she was lost in her intoxicated nightmare, Crystal brought her home and talked Donny down from taking his anger out on her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was apparently pissed that she ran off before finishing work last night, and they're both expected to make up for it. Lady sighs in relief, taking something for her hangover before Crystal tells her that they have to start getting ready for their shift tonight. Going through the same montage of getting dressed and checking herself in the mirror, she prepares to follow Crystal out. She briefly turns back with a look of uncertainty &amp; regret, wondering if she still wants this life. When Crystal asks what's wrong while waiting, Lady snaps out of it and replies *""... Nothing...""* before closing her bedroom door."
k8u2gz,Please Help me with this battle system I am gonna make.,"I am currently working on a 2d game where the player is a circle and has hp and damage, but it fights with other circles who might be other shapes as well, with different speed and size values. I need ideas for the battles. If they shoot something, things like size and speed will be pointless (and there are a few enemies who have shooting abilities). If they ""consume"" each other like [agar.io](https://agar.io), again the size and speed will be pointless and there should be a consuming priority like if two circles crash into each other, who will deal damage. If you say both can, then fast but low health enemies will die and their speed will be useless. If they hurt through ""spikes"" around them some who have spikes in certain parts will be useless cause if I have just one spike and the other has 1000 at their back, I should unfairly win.

k8u1t2,FPS tower defense game where you are stranded on an island in the Bermuda Triangle.,"So after working on a multiplayer game set in space, I want to work on a single player game as my side project sort of. In the game you play as a soldier whose ship gets completely destroyed by an unknown force. \n\nYou find yourself on a small island which has weird technology on it. It seems like someone once inhabited the island like some sort of militia but they are nowhere to be found. You need to take over a building/base and start adding defenses to it. The will have a huuge emphasis on the traps and how traps work with each other. Example: you want to use freeze traps paired with cannons to obliterate enemies. The enemies themselves are undead creatures which derived from the sea. \n\nAs you progress through the game unlocking weapons and exploring the island, you come across a tube system that can take you to other islands like the one you are on. Those other islands can have cities, towns where there are tougher enemies. The main starting island acts as your home base and as you progress the undead entities become stronger. Game is heavily inspired by fortnite:Save The World but an FPS low poly perspective.  \n\nLmk any ideas you have that would make cool mechanics! I’m talking core gameplay loop here!"

k8ogi5,A funny little team game idea.,"This is my first post here, so sorry if some things are wrong, like the flair.\n\nOkay, the game will be called Spiders vs Flies (It can be different, i just learned that is the name of a kid's playground game).\n\nBasically, its a multiplayer game (Or local with NPCs). There are two teams: Spiders and Flies.\n\nOn the spider team, you must eliminate the flies. You have to create webs, use your venom, etc. to catch and eat flies. There are different spiders, with different variations with advantages and disadvantages, like abilities such as jumping, camouflage, spitting, etc.. Different spiders have different stats (Spider stats are: Speed, Web Quality {Which effects stickiness, which determines how hard it is to escape the web}, Web Speed {Which determines how much web you can spin at a certain speed}, and Web Capacity {How much web they can produce at once before having to eat a fly}.)\n\nAnd then there are flies. You must avoid the spiders, and you have a advantage: Flying. You cant fly for too long, without eating food left around the map , but if you are walking, spiders are faster. Also, if you get stuck in a web, you have to struggle to get out. Different Fly stats are: Flying (How well the fly can...well, fly.), strength (How fast flies can escape webs), Health (How long it takes to get eaten, you can escape if you are fast enough, but its hard), and things like that (No idea what else.) Also, the fly team doesnt have to be limited to just flies. Maybe bees, or beetles, etc.\n\nThere would be different maps, maybe all set in the different places in a house. Little scraps of food will be set around, which the fly team can eat to regain energy to fly. Spiders must eat flies from the fly team to continue spinning webs. Spiders get points from eating flies, flies get points from eating food scraps, and escaping webs (escaping webs gives more points, to sort of attract the fly team to them)\n\nAnd you can make it so if you die, you die for the rest of the round, or you respawn, etc. You can also change the win conditions, like whoever has the most points by the end of the round, or flies must stay alive until the end, etc.\n\nAlso, the webs are hard to see as a fly. And maybe, if flying is too OP for flies, maybe all spiders can have the venom-spit ability? Or the jump ability? Or, the more flies are eaten, the higher the stats of the spider becomes (Just for that round).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes that seem like a solid idea? Constructive Criticism isnt a issue. I tried to make it small, understandable, and relatively easy."
k8nx04,Sewer tycoon plus supervilain manager,"So basicaly in this game, you would play for a villaneous CEO of a company in charge of maintaining city sewer system. Your goal would be to get as many money to enlarge canalisation system while breeding many monstrous mutants, creating secret chambers and possibly hidden weapons under city. There would be few superheroes which you could either try to get rid of or move the public opinion against them by secretly pulling the strings before them getting to know about your plans. The game could include a little bit of intrigues, shady economy and politics. Perhaps you could also publish your own sewer themed newspaper (sewer tribune) pushing your agenda and denigrate uncomfortable people.

Schuyler Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/952333.P_Schuyler_Miller) called The Sands of Time. What if an eccentric billionaire from modern age hires a down on his luck mercenary to test his prototype time machine, and he gets stranded in the Cretaceous age with the machine broken down? He will have to survive the hungry, fanged predators who romped through the earth in this savage age, find food and shelter and make use of his limited resources cleverly. Things won't be made easier by the revelation that the princess of a distant planet has hidden here, pursued by another alien race that wants to sacrifice her to their monstrous god. Open world, of course, and first person. This is my idea...now free for suggestions."
k8c3up,"""Rogue-like"" Civilization survival","You lead a small isolated civilisation which needs to survive say 400 years. It might be, e.g.\n- A spaceship crrew finding a new home\n- A bunker community waiting for the fallout to end\n\nApart from keeping the basic stuff running, electricity, food, tools, a key challenge is: keeping the community stable. A revolt will end it.\n\nThere are fractions: Growers, Engineers, Scientists, Transporters, Security, Hard Labour, (Navigators)\n\nNow you can't give them everything they want, there is not enough room for too many children for example. \n\nHow to control that?\nIntroduce a Lottery system?\nSecretly but birth control into water?\n    These are just examples.\n\nWhy I call it roguelike:\n- short runs that often fail\n- you take nothing to the next run\n- you only progress through own skill"
k8axpx,"Taking a page from Breath of the Wild, a lonely open world cyber-zombie-apocalypse game without waypoints or markers. It's just you waking up, exploring and piecing together environmental clues to uncover what happened, in search for any living human (if they even exist at all).","So I replayed SOMA recently (don't worry, no spoilers) and realized it kinda shares the same core premise with BotW of waking up in an unrecognizable world in ruins.\n\nAll you know at the start is that, due to a fatal illness, you were put into cryosleep until doctors could discover a cure.\n\nLike BotW, you are dropped into a world without waypoints; the only objectives you have are ones you give to yourself. Somewhere early and nearby you find an abandoned campfire in which some canned food was recently cooked, implying there must at least be one human somewhere in this world. It's a gentle nudge by the game to make you give yourself the goal of finding people, which the player doesn't know is actually the true, final goal of the game.\n\nHere are things you slowly start to gather about what happened to the world while you slept:\n* Technology advanced to the point nearly all people were enhanced with cybernetics, the most common of which were neuraltech that let them interface with computers directly.\n* Those cybernetic upgrades might be how you can do superhuman things you never could before, and how you're able to fend of zombies. Speaking of which...\n* At some point a hybrid virus started turning people into zombies that would further spread the infection. These are the common zombies you fight in the game, although some humans who had cyber enhancements before being infected are even more dangerous types of zombies.\n* The majority of people disabled or physically removed their brain implants to become immune, so they at least wouldn't turn into zombies if attacked.\n* Humans created humanoid combat drones to fight the zombies, but they required human pilots who still have their neuraltech. These people have to ""full dive"" into the drones to pilot them from a remote location.\n* When you find the desolate terminal station from which these pilots operated, you learn the base was overrun by zombies and most of the bodies of the pilots were turned. This is what led to the dangerous combat androids you find in the overworld or the boss-level monsters you find in some locations.\n* Upon trying to disconnect one of these zombie pilots from the base's boss-level defense android that's attacking you, you learn it doesn't stop the android. Thus, they weren't actually remote piloting; they were actually transferring their minds.\n* Humanity dwindled after that last line of defense broke. However, the few that remained became quite proficient at fighting zombies. A few broke off in search of new ways to stop the zombies and save the world once and for all... one of these people might be the person you're tracking.\n\nI suppose you might already see what twists reveals lie ahead for the player, but to the player this would all unravel slowly. *Lore galore.*"
k8ag66,"As a fan of Japanese history, I have an idea that I think would be cool","I recently finished the book “Shogun” and somehow fell into a rabbit hole during my Latin class. Apparently, “Shogun” was based off of a real event. Back in 1600, an English pilot by the name of William Adams crashed in Japan. His goal there was to end the Portuguese monopoly on Japanese trade, but instead, he got caught up in their politics, and after three years, he became the first foreign samurai/daimyo, and a close ally with the Shogun. I think it would be really cool to see a story type game based on these events. I know this doesn’t give many details,  but I think this could be a really interesting game."

k8ac79,A one time experience where...,"You crash land on a beautiful planet that resembles Earth. Your crew is dead and you are stranded with nothing but a tool that allows you to build and fully customize a portable base that you can move anywhere at anytime. As you continue, you meet an adorable creature that follows you around and keeps you company. You also have a basic AI friend that gives you tasks and tips on what to do. After a about thirty or forty minutes of playing, randomly during the night you will hear a loud explosion in the distance. The AI directs you to immediately retreat to your base, where a cutscene follows. There is fire everywhere, and you grab your portable base tool thing and put your base in your pocket (or something) and run. The screen fades black and the cutscene ends. You wake up in a different environment and no fire in sight. After setting your base down, you’ll notice that your pet has gone missing, presumably perished in the fire. Basically, the game is that you are always outrunning this fire and trying to figure out a way to leave the planet before you are consumed. You meet a variety of creatures along the way, most of which eventually perish from this fire one way or another. You eventually build a space vessel that you plan to evacuate you and your remaining pets. However, during your ascent to space a fatal malfunction occurs with the engines that forces you the eject from the ship, and you’re forced to watch your only means of survival literally blow up in your face, along with your last remaining pets. You have a parachute, but below you all you can see is a destroyed ecosystem ravaged by fire. A final cutscene/flashback occurs when you were still on the spaceship from the beginning of the game, before you crash landed. You are flying the ship with your co pilot, but during this flashback you realize that you pushed a button that eventually caused your crash that killed your crew. Another flashback takes place on the ground, as you walk away from the wreckage of your spaceship. The camera zooms in on the wreckage, and you notice that fuel is leaking from the ship, that eventually caused the explosion heard in the beginning. Yeah basically during this final flashback you learn that you caused the crash that killed your crew, which then caused fuel leakage that resulted in an explosion and the fire that you are running from the entire game, the same fire that killed all of your adorable companions along the way. Idk man I’d play it"

k88m12,Looking for Christmas Game Ideas,"I'm going to have a Christmas themed game competition with my friend, and I want to absolutely destroy him. I'm looking for a unique game that really brings on the Christmas vibes and has as little violence as possible.

k87lxk,A space survival top-down game,"It starts off with this cutscene where your crew and equipment get taken by a storm. You, now alone, have to find food, water, and other materials to survive, as well as fight off any threats. You can add abilities to yourself via chips you insert into your space suit, however, you can only use one at a time. The game will be rich in story, and rich in gameplay. You’ll have to fight alien creatures, mini-bosses, and bosses. Boss battles will be a mix of fast attacks, and slow attacks that you always need to time your own. Any other features you think should be included, feel free to leave a comment."
k85afo,A VR Turn Based RPG,"I'll try to keep it simple.\n\nThe home world is like an interactive tavern where you can go to a bulletin board and choose a bounty (a type of monster) that offers a reward (exp and gold).\n\nOnce the bounty is chosen you will choose 3 of the same or a variation of 4 characters:\nSwordsman (No magic)\nWhite mage (Heals and protects with magic)\nBlack mage (Attacks and buffs with elemental and status magic)\nRanged (what's VR without guns, kind of the same as swordsman but can hit weak points easier and could have less health)\n\nYou are then transported to the battle just like FF and the music starts. Think of a traditional final fantasy battle. Enemies (1-5) on one side, you and your allies (3 including you) on the other. 6 positions (3 front, 3 rear decided before battle).\n\nEach character has a HP and an ATB gauge. Mages have a MP that slowly recharges. Swordsman and Ranged have a limit break gauge that slowly fills as they land attacks or get hit. Limit breaks would be more complicated forms of regular attacks (mentioned later) that afflict more damage.\n\nBattle menus show finite useable items (purchased with gold) for healing health and status. Mages can also select spells.\n\nAttacking with the swordsman and Ranged is kind of similar. For the swordsman you select attack and are either launched toward the enemy or teleported depending on your preference (motion sickness) where you can then slash in a small time frame. Long arc slashes do more damage (like the point system in beat saber) rather than rapidly shaking your wrist around.\nFor ranged after you select attack you don't move rather targets appear that need to be shot in succession increasing a multiplier. Missing resets the multiplier. There is also a timeframe.\nFor white mage you select a spell (heal, protect, haste etc) from the menu and which ally to cast on. A pattern is shown depending on the spell that needs to be traced with the controller. An accurate tracing heals for more or protects for longer and an inaccurate tracing still heals or protects just not as much or for as long.\nSame goes for black mage (fire, ice, poison etc) but for damage. Black mages can also buff the damage dealers weapons for some neat combinations.\n\nChanging character positions is as easy as pointing at an empty marker and teleporing to it. Front and rear positions were always confusing to me because why wouldn't you always put your ranged in the back line? Well you still will but with this you can place a character in front of a low health character to tank a little till they can be healed. Maybe some AOE magic or special attacks can dissuade all the characters from bunching up all the time.\n\nWhen the battle is won. You are given exp and gold which you can spend to improve character stats and restock useable items. With each bounty complete the next will unlock and it gets more challenging from there. If things get too hard you can return to older bounties to farm exp and gold.\n\nI liked the gambit system so you had some control over the AI. People liked that a lot about. Combat can be controlled manually and programmed via the use of gambits; manually entered commands take precedence and their immediate execution will interrupt gambit programming. Eg cast heal when ally HP &lt;30%.\n\nI thought about multiplayer having a friend/s control unused character but I haven't thought about it that much. They'd come in to help but you'd still get the rewards.\n\nWhat do you think?"

k7qqom,The Corruption: Hunted by hell,I have a book series called The Corruption and in the first book there is a demonic invasion and the idea I had was if you got to play as a normal human who wants to survive where you would have to sneak through buildings so you wouldn't be found and killed by the demons and zombies roaming around and you would have a certain amount of time to get through each building and you can't make to much noise and you can't be seen. The demons have red eyes so you can see if they are looking in your direction but the zombies you can only hear because its late at night and the only light you get is from the windows because with the demonic invasion the sky was made red/orange. There would be demon variants and zombie variants to make it more difficult. There would be 19 levels and each level would take 5-30 minutes.
k7p5jb,A Home-Alone Styled Horror Game,"# ABOUT\n\n*You're relaxing in your home until you receive an anonymous phone call. The person warns you that within 3 hours (30 minutes real time), a group of henchmen will attempt to break in to your home and kidnap you. It is your task to fortify your home with traps and survive until next morning.* \n\n# Gameplay\n\nThe game would have two main settings: the afternoon and the night.\n\nAFTERNOON: Whilst you would be able to lock your doors and close your windows, it wouldn't be enough to protect yourself. The afternoon would be a sandbox-like experience where you will gather resources in your home to create elaborate traps. Pre-built traps like a bucket on a door, or a trip wire would be available to you, but you could also create your own traps. Ultimately, you would have enough freedom to create traps like in the movie *Home Alone:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYjWYoS0Hk*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYjWYoS0Hk)\n\nNIGHT: The night is where the horror aspect would unfold. The main form of horror used would be  paranoia and suspense. Spooky soundtracks will only be introduced if the player was to actually encounter a henchman. Otherwise it would be dead-silent. A good example is this one part in *Duck Season:* (skip to 2:24) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtK2kiMJ4Xs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtK2kiMJ4Xs). Relying strictly on sound is where the paranoia sets in, as floorboards creaking might either be the henchmen or the house. I think the game *Visage* is the perfect example of what I mean. Your character would also react to sudden sounds and events through his breathing or heartbeat, like in *Outlast.* I also think it would be cool if your character would shake and change postures depending on how scared he was. In terms of art style, I wouldn't have it scream horror to you, but rather let the player determine whether or not they are in a scary situation. For example, the game would look rather cartoony like *Firewatch.* The trick is to surprise them with horror. A good example of what I mean is in the game *Subnautica*: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87nMEZE5s-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87nMEZE5s-g)\n\n# Story\n\nI haven't thought of much regarding story, but here's an idea: the anonymous caller was you but from a different universe. Somehow you and your alternate version switched universes and are now being tracked down by elite units (henchmen) to investigate and exterminate."

Now the game could be waved based, a campaign, an open world adventure, its up to you, but an added feature would be the ability to control houses after defeating _______ and then be able to set up stationary machine guns, cameras, and what not from it. \n\nI would recommend something like a World War Z kind of game, and to be able to play with a squad max of 4, and with different weapon types for a certain player.\n\nThanks I hope this gives some inspiration, and if you do make it, I would like a copy please."
k7gep7,VR Sickness Trainer,"I'm proposing a collection of mini-games which test people's resilience to VR sickness, help them overcome it via controlled exposure and/or understand what type of games will be accessible to them. If people consent their data could help developers decide how to configure their games to minimize nausea and which accessibility settings to implement.\n\nThe games will each contain different elements known to influence VR sickness and configure them to the appropriate level for the person using them. Periodically the games will ask for feedback from players about how they feel and use this data to adjust  the experience and prevent nasea getting to unacceptable levels. \n\nThe challenging part would be keeping it engaging. Most of all there would need to be a decent verity of mini games which are all fun in their own right. Tracking of achievements and positive reinforcement when players reach a new level of intensity or endurance could also help keep players coming back."

For your efforts, you're rewarded with the boot. \n\nUnhinged, indignant, misunderstood, you decide to take revenge, by embracing the darkness, the jpeg artifacts, the watermarks, the stretched texts, dad puns, and meme images, you will attempt to create true graphic abominations that will strike terror into the hearts of those who've oppressed you."

k70q6w,Metal Gear Solid Ghost Babel × R.U.R.,"  Bit of background, R.U.R. is a stage play written by Karel Capek in 1920-21. It's widely credited with being the first work of literature to coin the word, ""robot."" Although that may not neccesarily be true, (I've heard that Tesla beat Capek for first person to use the word by a couple of years,) it did popularise the idea of robots and machine consciousness throughout the mainstream media and is, I think at at least, a pretty neat play all around.\n  Granted, being a stage play written in the 20s, it's really short, (you could easily read through it in a couple of hours if you're a slow reader,) and leaves a lot of things open to interpretation. I've been interested in the play for a while and the idea of doing my own take on the story for a while now, (think the multiple Great Gatsby films, or like what The Protomen did with Megaman's story, but through a videogame instead.) I'd take more time to branch out from Domin and the other R.U.R managers to explore Rossum's backstory and the history of the founding of his company, R.U.R, the effects of manufacturable labour on both the world economy and the global war economy, (think Metal Gear Solid 4 &amp; 5,) and of course the real question, ""Do robots dream of electric sheep?"" Lol. And because of that, I think it'd best to approach this type of idea through an updated/modern version of the 2d MGS games.\n\nTL;DR here's my idea for a shitty robot fanfic game, any feedback?"
k6zy8k,A game where you manage and play as gladiators in the Roman coleseum,"You’d start off by buying inexperienced fighters, who you’d train on different abilities and equip different weapons and armor. Maybe some could focus on speed while others focus on strength, etc. Once you go out to fight, you’d play as whatever gladiator you selected, and their training and equipment carried over in the form of stat boosts. The more they win the more game they have, fighting stronger opponents and earning more money, maybe even being speed after losing if the public likes you enough. If they are famous enough you can even sell them or retire them to use as trainers, multiplying the speed new recruits are trained. However, in order to retire they have to fight the hardest battle in the game, a fight against a mythical enemy from various world mythologies. The harder the final enemy, the better your legacy will be, which will benefit you by having new recruits start off with more fame just by being trained by the retired fighter. You could also hire more experienced gladiators, with the downside that you need to constantly pay them to keep them working for you. You could fight 1 on 1 battles with an experienced opponent, 1 v many weaker opponents at the same time, fighting either 1 or many animals, like lions, crocodiles, tigers, etc. And finally free for all, where the last fighter alive wins and animals are released periodically to keep you on your toes."

k6y4ec,Horror Game Idea,"This is an idea I came up with a couple of days ago. I was inspired by Until Dawn but also by this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqsQY-QXI2U&amp;t=1523s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqsQY-QXI2U&amp;t=1523s) If this were turned into a game I would like it to look like this video.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a co-op survival horror that is open-world (as in you explore the environment yourself with no indication of anything and must figure it all out yourself with clues scattered throughout the game).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pictured this game in VR but I don't own one nor do I know how it really works so I don't know if a game like this would even work. But this could still work on console or pc.\n\n**STORY**\n\nTwo private investigators are sent to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in the small mining town of Black Rose. When they arrive, their car is hit by a deer and is damaged. They are forced to push it to a mechanic in town but when they arrive there is no one. It is midnight and a scream is heard in the woods, so they start their investigation. As you play you realize strange creatures are in the woods and hunting you down, and you must find a way to escape.\n\n**GAME CONCEPT**\n\nThe game starts off with you in the mechanic, standing around your car. Depending on the difficulty setting, the players will be given: a flashlight, a backpack, a couple of batteries, a map, a pistol, some bullets, and a walkie-talkie. Depending on your difficulty will determine which and how many items you are given at the start.\n\nThe aim of the game is to explore the woods and try to escape. You must use the walkie-talkie, flashlight, map, and anything you find along the way to help you. But there are multiple ways you can escape.\n\n1. **The Car-**\n\na. Probably the simplest way to escape, as you already have the car and parts are found in the mechanics. There are some pieces and tools that you have to explore, but the mechanics are like a safe house so when you’re repairing it you are safe. Once you repair it though, it will make lots of noise and attract the monsters. Someone must also open the garage, which is slow, so it gives the monsters time to come. Afterward, they must quickly get into the car and the player drives the car. They have to know the right roads to take because the monsters will be chasing them and they can break the glass and kill you.\n\n2. **The Lift-**\n\na. The lift is the lift that will take you up the mountain, far away from the monsters. This is the safest option, but it takes the longest, as you’ll spend a lot of time finding tools and pieces to repair everything. The engine for it is broken so you will have to find a manual to repair it. Then you will have to find the parts and tools to repair it. You must also repair the communications tower to contact someone to pick you up there.\n\n3. **The Boat-**\n\na. In terms of time length, the boat escape is the easiest. Though it is challenging as you must travel through the swamp. The swamp is the unmapped area of the game. First, you must find the boat keys and some fuel (depending on the difficulty you may or may not have to get fuel) before heading to the boat. The mud makes you quite loud and it's very difficult to navigate through. Stray too far and you leave the map boundaries and you automatically die. The monsters are also more likely to be in this area. The mud also makes you slow so it will be difficult to run away from them. The plus side is that the thick mud covers all your tracks so you will be able to hide. But there are no supplies in there so if you run out of batteries you are basically fucked.\n\nb. If you manage to traverse through the swamp you will reach the boathouse with a small boat. Fill up the tank and crank the engine but do so quickly because it will make a lot of noise that will attract the monsters and you’ll be cornered. If you manage to turn it on you escape and win the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGameplay will consist of multiple difficulty levels that all change aspects f the game to make each level different and more challenging.\n\n**1.** **Easy-**\n\n**a.** The player is given a fully charged flashlight with spare batteries. A fully charged walkie talkie with spare batteries. A map with important landmarks circled. A fully loaded pistol with 3 extra bullets can be found throughout the map. They are also given a backpack with some supplies and tools. There will also be a filled gas tank in the mechanics. They are also given a gas mask.\n\n**b.** You have three chances for your teammate to revive you after being attacked.\n\n**c.** You will be notified when you near the edge of the map.\n\n**2.** **Medium-**\n\n**a.** The player is given a fully charged flashlight and walkie-talkie but no extra batteries. A map with no markers on it. An empty pistol, bullets can be found throughout the map. They are also given an empty backpack, supplies and tools are found through the map. There will be a gas tank in the mechanics but it's empty. The gas mask can be found somewhere in the town.\n\n**b.** You have one chance for your teammate to revive you after being attacked.\n\n**c.** You are warned when you have entered the edge of the map.\n\n**3.** **Hard-**\n\n**a.** The player is given a dead flashlight and walkie-talkie. Batteries can be found throughout the map. A damaged map, so parts of it will be missing. A pistol with 3 shots in it, no extra bullets can be found. They are given a damaged backpack so half as many things can be stored in it. You must find the gas tank, but it is full if found. The gas mask is found inside the mine.\n\n**b.** If you are attacked then you will die, no revives.\n\n**c.** If you enter the edge the monsters will scream more which is your queue telling you to GTFO.\n\n**4.** **Extreme-**\n\n**a.** The player starts off with no flashlight nor walkie-talkie, those and batteries must be found throughout the map. There are not given a map nor a pistol. They are not given a backpack so the player must carry each item individually. You must find the gas tank and also fuel for it. There is no gas mask.\n\n**b.** If one teammate dies the game is over.\n\n**c.** There is no warning for the edge. You must learn the map and area to make sure you don't walk into it. If you do though, after a short time you'll automatically be killed.\n\n**5.** **Custom-**\n\n**a.** In this difficulty the players can adjust everything in the game. They can adjust how many batteries, the lifespan of the flashlight and walkie-talkie, the level of detail on the map, how many bullets, etc.\n\n**b.** To unlock this game mode you must, in any difficulty, travel to the end of the mines and find the source of the fungus. You must also succeed in all 3 escape paths. This will give you an achievement and unlock this game mode.\n\n**ITEMS**\n\n**1.** **Backpack-**\n\n**a.** Used to store things. Pretty self-explanatory.\n\n**2.** **Flashlight-**\n\n**a.** Used to light the way since it's in the middle of the night.\n\n**3.** **Walkie Talkie-**\n\n**a.** Used to communicate with your team-mate since you can split up to find things faster but also help each other, with manuals and stuff. It makes noise so use wisely.\n\n**4.** **Map-**\n\n**a.** The map is used to help navigate the area. Depending on your difficulty will determine the quality of the map.\n\n**5.** **Pistol-**\n\n**a.** Since you are a cop you are given a pistol. You can shoot the monsters to scare them off, but it makes you a bigger target since if they start following you again they will pair up.\n\n**6.** **Gas Mask-**\n\n**a.** The gas mask is used to enter the mines. Its to help stop coughing, which attracts the monsters, when inside the mine due to the fumes in the air.\n\n**7.** **Fuel Tank-**\n\n**a.** A gas tank can be found throughout the map and is used to fill up the car or the boat.\n\n**MONSTER**\n\nI was inspired by the Wendigos from Until Dawn. Something similar to that, or maybe even Wendigos in general would be cool. I also want them to be the actual villagers.\n\nThe story behind them is that while they were mining they dug deep and found a cave with some fungus in it. The fungus releases toxins in the air which they breathed in and over time turned into monsters. The young girl was playing by the mine when one killed her, and so her parents called the police but on their way the other monsters attacked and turned everyone into one of them. That is why the village is abandoned and all ransacked. Clues of survivors could be found throughout it, like skeletons, or supplies left behind.\n\nThe monsters are blind and can’t smell, but their hearing is extremely good which is why you must be quiet and stay still when they are around you. They use echolocation, just like the Until Dawn ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think????"
k6ww4y,Fantasy setting survival horror that plays like S.T.A.L.K.E.R,"Had this cool idea that's more of a setting idea than a game, but I want to share it. I love the STALKER games, especially the Anomaly mod as they force you to really prepare for an inhospitable zone that's full of monsters, bandits, mercenaries, but most importantly: valuable artifacts and loot.\n\nSo imagine this gameplay loop within a generic fantasy setting such as elder scrolls or Forgotten realms, instead of the Meltdown zone, it takes place in the ruins of an ancient civilization that was much more magically advanced, harnessing the energy magic provides in a similar way we use electricity to the point that they have advanced infrastructure and weapons capable of slaying gods.\n\nI originally envisioned this to be a first person game to be as similar to stalker as possible, but I could also see it being a CRPG, or even a tactics based game like Mordheim. \n\nThe main idea is there would be an ancient, yet advanced ruin that many different people, factions, and monsters wish to exploit, and plenty of valuables and unknown powers to steal.\n\nI know nothing about game designing so I can't say how hard this would be to make."
k6uy9x,Funny idea: Battle with medieval-like spaceships.,"It would not realy make much sense but it could realy be fun. It could partialy be battle game, partialy building game. Perhaps you could build your castles onto asteroids.\n\nCastles on asteroids would act as your biggest ships. Instead of canons they would be equiped with balistas, catapults, trebuchets etc.\n\nMiddle ships would look like normal sailing ships and would contain above mentioned weapons as well\n\nSmaller ships would look like small ships or vagons and carriages\n\nInstead of soliders there would be bowmen, axemen, spearmen and knights. Knights would ride horse-resembling space motorcycles while other soldier would be equiped with scafanders resembling medieval underwear overalls and would have some aditional clothing on top of it. They would be all equiped with jets and oxygen tanks. Perhaps you could make it little bit starwars parody, making knights using lightsabers, spearmen lightspear, axemen lightaxe and bowmen lightarrows.\n\nSo obviously this would be 3d game since having it 2d would not make much sense or difference from ground based medieval strategy... The third dimension could be represented by shades between red and blue and therefor the game could still remain 2d top down in the end."

k6rmum,A tycoon city-building/strategy game where the tech tree is competitive,"I've played a lot of strategy and city-building games and a lot of them have tech trees. However, most of the time I find that once I have identified a reasonably sure path in the tech trees, I pretty much stick to it without much deviation in my future playthroughs. This makes the game feel less challenging over time and reduces its replay value which is why I came up with this idea.\n\nThe idea is a tycoon city-building strategy game where you mold your city's growth and economy through technology in a high stakes tech race to survive in a barren sunless world.\n\nIn the game there are other competitors (probably AI) whom you have to compete and trade with to sustain and advance your economy. \n\nYou would only be able to produce certain goods after you did the necessary research. For example you can only produce gas after you do the research to produce it from coal. You can patent, publicize or keep technologies you have researched secret to try and maintain an economic or technological monopoly. However, all players (including the AI) can also do the same research. After one of the players unlocks the research, they have the option to patent it.\n\nWhen a technology is patented, only the player or AI that patented it can use that technology for production. In addition, the trading cost of that product goes up in the world market. However, the technology would be unlocked for everyone else for free so the other players' tech trees wouldn't be blocked off.\n\nWhen a technology is publicized, the technology becomes available to all players for free, but the trading cost of that product goes down in the world market. You can use this mechanic to lower world prices for a product you don't want to produce but would like to import.\n\nWhen a technology is researched but kept secret, the player who has researched it gains a technological and production monopoly of the product so other players still have to spend resources researching it, but they run the risk of losing the patent to someone else.\n\nAs for the setting, I thought of a barren sunless world to justify the need for the player to keep trading for certain resources (e.g. food and wood) well into the late stages of the game.\n\nLet me know what you think and ways I can improve on this idea"
k6re2d,Has this idea ever been done? A protagonist that can change colour.,"I feel like there must have been a game like this at some point, because the idea seems so obvious, but I can't think of one.   \n\nThe idea is, the player can control changing the main character's colour at will, and use this ability to blend in with its surroundings (or confer other benefits).  The colour changing control is analog, like a mouse-wheel or gamepad stick.  \n\nSo for example, if the character is moving through a forest, it can change to a dark green and be invisible to predators.  The character is both a prey and predator animal, so it needs to both stay hidden from predators, and ambush prey to stay alive.   \n\nPotentially this could have a metroid-vania like angle, as the character acquires new colours, it can travel further into more dangerous terrain (e.g. it can turn white to blend in with snow etc).\n\nI started making a crude prototype of this years ago and then forgot all about it.  Curious if anyone knows of a game like it or has any interest in the general idea."
k6pam7,Marvel Fighting Game,"A Marvel fighting game (avengers, x-men, etc) that uses the same engine/plays the same way as Bandai Nanco's Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series.   \nBig character roster.  \nLots of skins.  \nLots of special moves.  \nTeam special moves.  \nCasual fighting game (simple controls, the same for most characters).  \nExtras and fanservice."

k6mw5v,This is less of a game and more for someone really tech savvy,"Idk if this is the best sub to put it so tell me if there’s a better one\n\nBasically a program where you make your own video game (preferably a pretty simple game engine) and then can transfer it over to a little cheap-ish console that doesn’t have the capability of getting games from anywhere else besides the game transfer. You can also post your games on the internet for others to download and play (this is inspired by BrainPad and Makecode Arcade)\n\nAnd the second idea is much more original: a Game and Watch game maker. You get a little console with a monochrome screen (to give game and watch vibes as well as keeping costs low, and it’s basically the same thing as last time with a higher res display. Maybe you could also have custom cases that house the electronics so you can choose the amount of buttons and customize the case"

k6je5b,Air-floating city-wreck survival game,"So you were living in a city floating in an atmosphere of inhospitable planet, perhaps gas giant. The city used antigravitational technology to float. Something happened and whole city was ripped apart into small pieces floating in atmosphere. You need to survive and colect resources yet you have to be carefull not to fall from those pieces into open atmosphere.\n\nFortunately enough, you have some sort of flying suit which you can use to transport around. The suit can be upgraded but it also is energeticaly dependant and when you get away with all energy, you cant use it. The jumping is less expensive than flying. You can survive for a while without a suit but for long. The suit could also have many other abilities to develop. You could also develop your own floating base, upgrade your home, perhaps first build a dome around it get some oxygen generator etc.\n\nYour main goal is to survive and also reach special kind of antena in asteroid belt to call for help. For this you have to upgrade your suit enough to be able to fly to asteroid belt or perhaps build a vehicle. You dont live in the city alone, there are other survivors. It is upto you how would you cooperate with them. Some are more hostile, some more friendly.\n\nThere could be some strange flying creatures native to the planet which you could fight and tame and you could build helper robots."
k5zzk7,It's not a game Idea yet,"Hè Everyone,\n\nSo as I finished (oke almost 😉) my previous project (and the holiday coming up) its time for a new project. I have been browsing this Reddit for a while now and started to form an idea but the idea is still a bit thin and feels as if it is missing something. So feedback or ideas would be greatly appriciated)\n\nHere is what I got do far, you are a regular Guy that somehow ended up in a modern (moving) train (think snowpiercer without the people). In order to get off the train it needs to stop (as jumping out will definitly kill you). There is only one problem you are stuck in the back of the train and controls are in the front. Now walking towards the front of the train shouldn't be that hard, atleast if it wasn't for a conscious ai trying to prevent the train from stopping.\n\nThe genre would be an adventure / puzzle game (think Tomb Raider meets Portal meets Stanley Parabel). I am thinking of adding a (robotic) dog or something like that to keep the player company / help on the puzzles.\n\nAs for a core game mechanic there isn't one het, maybe you need to avoid the ai at staying out of sight of the camera's, maybe the companion is able to disable security systems or something like that. \n\nAlso maybe this is just me overthinking but why is the train able to move through the world (other people outside should notice it right?) Where is the train going or is it going in circles? What happens when you reach the end?\n\nBasically the idea is there but it is creating more questions instead of giving me some guidence. \n\nWould love to hear your toughts, ideas and feedback.\n\nKind regards\n\nProtoThis"
k5zuxi,Counterstrike (or other FPS) mod using Dawn of War models,"I realize this in itself isn't an original game idea, but it's something of a compromise to a larger game concept, based in the Warhammer 40k World. The game would be an MMORPG, where you can level  up from basic Space Marine to commander, and choose different specializations or use different vehicles. Anyway as a much watered down version I was wondering if it would be possible to mae a mod of Counterstrike (any version) using the models from the dawn of war games? Even if it's limited to say Space Marines vs Orks with only a few different types of models and weapons, I still think this would be really cool. especially if you can also incorporate the DOW maps. Just to be clear though, there would be a lot of legal repercussions if trying to monetize this game in any way."

k5u0fo,The AntiMage,"So I've been mostly without sleep for the passed 3 or so days. I used to have all these great and fantastical ideas that could have been extremely good games as a kid, but as I've gotten older, my creativity has kind of gone away. Today, though, on almost 36 hours of little to no sleep, it's back in full force. I want this game in my head to be reality, but I haven't the know-how to make it happen. Let me lay it on you. Do keep in mind, the entire idea is still in infancy, and I'm only just fleshing out the BEGINNING of the script. My expertise is in writing, so this may just turn into a book, but I want it to be very decision driven.   \n\n\nBASIC PREMISE: You are an antimage, an elite military unit designated to fight witches and warlocks in humanity's war against mages. The entire game is revolved around 2 things - an excellent story, which I am currently hammering down, and combat fluidity. I envision it would take HEAVY combat influence from Dark Souls and The Witcher 3. During fights, you will need to think about the environment - not only how it will affect you, but how you will affect it. Collateral damage to farmland, structures, roads, etc. will lower your already lowly reputation, as the common folk mostly see you as part of the mage problem. From time to time, you may encounter non magical humans who may want to assault/kill you. It is up to you to find non-lethal ways to dispatch them, or to slaughter them senselessly and face the associated consequences. \n\nPLOT: You're being sent South to your nation's capital to track down and kill Sage, the leader of the mage resistance. Along the way, you will meet Godfrey, your handler, and Rosric, a representative of the merchant's guild. (As well as a myriad of other characters I haven't fleshed out yet) Along the way, you'll find that this war has blurred battle lines, as it seems that mages, witches, and warlocks have penetrated deep into the nation's lands. Sage himself is in the city planning something BIG. It is your job it either stop it... or perhaps to join him. \n\nENEMIES: As an Anti-Mage, your job is to kill witches and warlocks. These are extremely high power mages that have taken in so much mana they are barely human anymore. Normal mages are not your duty to kill, but you may find that collecting bounties on them may fetch some coin. Unlike a normal mage, witches and warlocks will all have unique abilities, all of which must be accounted for before engaging them. These powerful enemies may increase the chance of a battle having collateral damage, which is something to look out for. An example is I've already heavily fleshed out a witch who uses her own blood as a weapon. Mid way through the fight, she will sprout wings made of blood and become capable of a wind attack that can blow structures over. There will also be a myriad of magical creatures to hunt, as the empire doesn't like magic existing right under its nose. These will range from Dragons to cats with illusionary capabilities.\n\nWEAPON SYSTEM: You are an anti-mage, which means you are bound to a magical relic that you use to fight. In this case, it's a pair of gauntlets that can fire spearheaded chains made of shadows moderate distances. They also make excellent melee weapons. As you play, you will unlock new techniques. Just as well, defeating Witches and Warlocks will award you with a rune which you can take to an arcanist to forge into a runeplate you can put into one of your gauntlet's 2 rune slots. These runes will fundamentally modify how the weapons work or the capabilities of the weapons. Example: I've fleshed out an earthen rune which will allow the player to use the shadow chains to pull up sections of the earth to use as shields, or to throw enemies off their feet. \n\nCOMBAT: The entire game is built around the combat system. As stated before, I envision the combat to be similar to Dark Souls/The Witcher. What will set the combat here apart is acrobatic capability and of course, high-impact environmental destruction. When against a Witch or Warlock, a player should feel as though they are evenly matched with them, and that a decisive strike from either party would kill the other. I haven't quite thought about what happens if you die. Probably load back to whatever autosave you were previously at. \n\nSo, I think I got everything I want to post here for now. I'll conclude with some problems with the idea:\n\n\&gt; I do not know how to code/animate/really anything related to game design. I'd be down to write/creatively direct this project, but it's kind of dead if I couldn't get the resources to make it happen.\n\n\&gt; The combat system in my head is incredibly complex, and I'm not sure players would take to it all that well. It would be up to a dev team to simplify the controls as much as possible without losing gameplay. \n\n\&gt; Environmental destruction is important to the idea, however some may find it frustrating, and the technology available may not like it. \n\nThere is is! Any encouragement/criticism of the idea would be greatly appreciated!"

k5orf5,360 localized text chat,"My idea is a text chat system similar to text chats that display the spoken text over the player talking. Text chats like this have one small issue; you have to be looking at the player in order to see what they are saying. I've come up with a theoretical solution to that problem. My idea is to have the text of people speaking nearby show up at the edges of the screen in the direction they are speaking, sort of like a damage indicator does, so that you can know where they are and are able to see what they are saying no matter which direction you're facing. My idea was inspired by how Minecraft handles the narration of sounds. Forgive me if this is the wrong place to post as I realize this is more of an idea for a game mechanic rather than a game itself."

kkst5b,"Two character game, one blind, one deaf","So basically a first person game where you have two characters ( one is blind and one is deaf) and your naviagating through a mansion or cave or seomthing trying to escape together. Obviously your characters are together, maybe linked so deaf character leads blind chracter. Your job is to escape the place your by finding hints and tools and what not about the location by seeing objects using the deaf character, and then swapping minds with the blind character to listen out for any noises coming from places, which would get louder or quieter if you turn towards it and move closer or further away from it, and then you can swap back to the deaf person, see where your blind friend has moved to, and figure out where the sound you heard was coming from and it would lead to more discoveries into helping you get out. The deaf character would have absolutely no sound in game, including menu and opening inventory and stuff, while the blind character could have a blank screen (maybe something on it to not completely make it black, or even better have a sound wave type thing appear if your facing a sound with the source (a dot) so you know where to move to to show the deaf counterpart the location). Hope that makes sense."

You begin with a fake passport and address of a contact and that's basically it. \n\nYou can follow the ""Storyline"" or do your own ""investigation"". To get access to specialist items such as guns, tape recorders or cameras you either have to buy, steal or bribe them off people. The game would have no Teleportion to begin missions or time skipping, apart from sleeping. \n\nAlso, as I said if you die in the game you would have to start over, so missions such as break into a building require preparation and planning as bursting in with a machine gun is very risky. \n\nFinally there are special intel which are important non storyline items which can uncover important information such as weapon programs, money transfers and so on which could benefit you.\n\nTell me what you think about the idea below."

This would be the 3 stages/settings of the game. Also, I’m going to put an anti virus switch to each stages so that once the player find it, it would help him wipe the virus fast as possible. In addition, I’m thinking of a gun (still thinking what gun) that the player might use to kill the virus once he was attack by them.

Examples of heatmaps might include population, religion, language, ethnicity, and political beliefs. Factors such as natural boundaries and tension should also be considered. The player would then have to balance all the data, while also adhering to the objectives.\n\nAnother style of play might be merging smaller areas into larger ones.\n\nThis idea popped into my head after I watched https://youtu.be/daeB46Z4fjs (specifically 4:08), and I thought it would genuinely make a good puzzle game if it were more in depth.\n\nHopefully this was semi clear, and feel free to ask for more details"

kka813,Terrible hacking/mimigame idea for PC,"All you have to do is type words as fast as possible. As you do, the screen fills in with code, as your character actually hacks. There are two twists: first, the game doesn't tell you what words to type. It checks that they are valid words against a stored dictionary, and may impose additional restrictions - only nouns or verbs, or containing certain letters. (This prevents you easily going from a dictionary)\n\nThe second twist is, the game remembers every word you've ever used before this game, and you don't get progress/get penalties for anything you've used before."

Or 3 strikes and you're out?   \nHow many players should there be in a game? How should the drafting how?   \n\n\nI am asking questions just to point into a direction I am leaning and having trouble with. I'd love to hear your opinions and the ideas you've had with the genre. Any idea is more than welcomed, no matter how outgoing it is."
kjyboc,An open-world RPG where random things/bugs happen all the time.,"So the title might not give away much, but I had absolutely zero interest in playing Cyberpunk 2077 on release. Now that I’ve seen a lot of the funny bugs and glitches though they’ve made me actually want to play it and see what kind of random things happen.

kjxaf2,Racetrack manager,This is an idea I've been thinking of for quite a while. You design and manage a racetrack. Something like Prison Architect. I don't think there has been a racetrack manager yet. It could be quite cool to see.\n\nBasicly you start with nothing just some money. You build the layout of the track. Then you sign contracts with racing series. Those series have requirements. For example the track must be lit up.\n\nAnd as you get to more advanced series that pay more they will have more requirements.

kjv9w0,Unique game ideas for house environment.,"Hi everyone,\n\nI've been in the industry for 10 years and capable of creating a game. I'm looking for gameplay ideas for a house enviroment or enviroment with multiple houses.\n\nI'd like to hear your unique gameplay mechanics or game ideas rather than horror plot stories for a horror game.\n\nI would like to have the game finished in about a year or so. My last game took over 3 years to develop and  I would not want to have a project that took so long.\n\nIf you have any ideas, I would be more than happy to hear you out. Thanks everyone!"
kjswwd,"""Here I Stand"" A Reformation Video Game","Here me out, I've played my share of assassin's creed but when I was playing Witcher III I thought this would be a perfect video game idea — based off real history. You could play as Martin Luther or a pope, doesn't matter. You seek to uncover the corruption in the papacy or hide it. Game of Thrones-esque, there's some moral questioning. Think of the side quests! Hiding the nuns who are trying to escape the monestary in barells (true story, Martin Luther's wife was one of them) and the MAP!! Like Eisleben, Wartburg, Saxony it's perfect. So much history to play through and so many hidden secrets to reveal."
kjpzxa,Death/Respawn mechanic,"So what are your thoughts about death in games and whole mechanic around it?\n\n-  Do you just go with the flow like, player dies then player respawns at last saved location/checkpoint/bonefire or you like to have a story behind the fact that protagonist respawns infinitely?\n - What death/respawn mechanic have you found interesting/clever or what would you like to see in games to come? \n\n- Is the classic game over/permadeath after certain number of lost lives considered an obsolete mechanic?\n\n This might be a nice topic for discussion."
kjpvjy,Whispers of The Past,"\nSingle player/ semi-open world/  dinosaur survival shooter\n\nPlatforms: probably a PC release to begin with and moved to consoles like PlayStation later down the line.\n\nShort synopsis: \nA survival shooter(first person) set in an abandoned country near Russia. The main enemy would be dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures (with maybe a few ones from the future so let your imagination run wild). The map itself would be big enough to be semi open world but not so big it’s not realistically achievable or maybe a bunch of smaller maps loaded in different “chapters” of the story.\n\n\nAtmosphere: a depressing post-Soviet industrial city with bombed out buildings, Soviet architecture and an overall sort “Chernobyl” vibe.\n\nGameplay/concept:\n\n Starting off well armed and with plenty of ammo but as time goes on you have to craft bandages and other healing items, scavenge food, conserve ammo, regularly maintain your firearms, and if desperate enough, craft makeshift weapons from spare parts you loot. There are some other small survival game details I would want like building fires and backpack space management. Maybe even some light customization of weapons like adding nails to a scavenged bat or attaching a flashlight or new sights to a gun.\n\nI would want combat with the dinosaurs and other creatures to happen rarely so that it doesn’t become Call of Duty: Jurassic Park but also be just often enough so the game isn’t boring. I would want a variety of dinosaur species as well as other things like giant insects or ice age mammals and maybe even some creatures from the future. (Also not sure if encounters should be scripted or random, or maybe a mix of both?)\n\nThere could maybe be a teamwork aspect but I’m not sure. The story could go that you are part of a unit that you go through game with or they die early on in some accident, leaving you stranded. Maybe there could also be some variation to the gameplay in certain areas like finding a still functional tank and using it to fight off waves of enemies or finding the best ways to fortify buildings from incoming enemy attacks. Or perhaps elements of stealth in a light horror section.\n\n\n\nObjective: although I don’t have a clear cut objective yet I do have a bit of a template that you can add to if you want. A research facility in the heart of an post-Soviet city caused some major rift in time to create portals to different eras in time. This caused the city and country to be overrun with dinosaurs and similar creatures and we would be tasked with finding our way to the facility and shutting down the machine keeping the rift open.\n\n\nFor this next part (the story) again think of it as a template that can be changed to make it better or more fitting. This is sort of just a starting point.\n\nStory: (it’s kind of long so buckle up)\nthere is this small country right on Russia’s doorstep ( still thinking of the name) that was part of the former Soviet Union. During WW2 the nazis marched on this country and committed many atrocities to the civilian population, when the red army came back to reclaim the country they treated the civilians almost just as poorly as the nazis did.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union broke apart this little country became very xenophobic and basically shut itself off from the outside world. Though it had a major steel industry and would often export said material as well as a small airport where small groups of visitors could come and go. One day this airport stopped taking in air traffic, the country’s radio stations went silent, and they stopped the export of steel. \n\nThough, people right on the border said they could often see anti aircraft fire and hear gunshots. This was worrying to the UN who wanted to send in blue helmets to see what happened but Russia said it was too close to their border and made it very clear they wouldn’t hesitate to start WW3 if UN forces got that close to their border. In the end though, the radio silence made Russia worried that the small country was preparing for war and sent spy planes.\n\n The country seemed to be at war, except it seemed the enemy was within their own borders as roads and buildings were turned to rubble from bombing and artillery fire, abandoned tanks littered the streets, and there were abandoned checkpoints and machine gun positions. Russia got curious enough to send in a small strike team (that the player is a part of) this would start off the gameplay. \n\nAt first little things would seem off such as electrical equipment randomly malfunctioning and seeing bodies already skeletons despite the fact it had only been a few weeks. All of this would build up to create tension until your first combat encounter, where a dinosaur would pounce the player and after killing it, more waves of them would attack a hastily fortified building you were in. \n\nAfter more exploration and combat you would discover that time portals had opened up and sent the small country in to chaos after dinosaurs (as well as some other prehistoric and possibly future creatures) started to pour through and take over the country. \n\nThe rest of the game would be spent trying to stop the time portals and eventually you do. At this point however, your radio still doesn’t work and most of your team is dead so it goes to a cutscene of your character returning to Russia on foot over the course of several days, but once you do get back home, you realize that the time portals had also opened up in your homeland. You realize this just in time to see the flash of a nuclear strike at a nearby city, showing how bad things have gotten, and then fade to black and credits."
kjpfxh,A rogue like looter shooter,I came up with an idea for a looter shooter set in a van helsing setting but with a unique twist. When you make a character you have to go through a rogue like dungeon where you decide your class and weapons through it. Every so often the game will give you the option to leave the dungeon with what you have but if you die between these checkpoints game over. Outside the dungeon is a hunters shack where you can vault items so if you die you don't get sent to the beginning. And late game content once your happy with your hunter. A wave defence mode with perma death terned off (think cod zombies) where at the end you are rewarded loot based off your performance. Raids and strongholds where perma death is turned on but highly reward those who want to risk it. A bounty hunt mode (think hunt showdown) again with perma death. If you die in perma death game modes you will be sent back to the dungeon beginning where you can fight against your hunter in an empowered state and if you fail you lose him forever resulting in a reset in progress. Based off your level though you will get better gear quicker so it's not a hard reset + your vault which holds items cross hunter.
kjo7ti,RTS Ideas please!,"Recently I've been playing the original Starcraft, which has got me thinking about designing my own RTS.

kjnqn3,This Thing of Ours,"A game with GTA vibes, but old school Mafia roots. Organized crime, 1920’s-1950’s start off small time, running errands during prohibition for the “made guys” in the neighborhood, choose a NY family (Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese), follow the story line up until the Castellammarese War. After the Castellammarese War and the creation of the Commision by Lucky Luciano, go to more of a free roam and build relationships with the families until you’re a made guy. each family has its own perks for example, discounted weapons, or access to exclusive rackets, exc. \n\nBuild relationships with the 5 families and pick and choose whether to remain on good terms or walk the line with decision based missions. \n\nMain goal is to become a made guy while balancing relationships and remain in good standings with the commission. Depending on your choices, end up “pinched” turning fed witness with a price on your head, retiring and buying your way out, or get outright “whacked” with a sanctioned hit by the commission. \n\nAdded DLC could be the ability to head on over to the Chicago Outfit with Capone. \n\nKeep it historically accurate as possible."
kjkm4u,Frankenstein vs. Dracula,"This would be a 16-bit side-scrolling brawler, like those of the early '90s (X-Men, Double Dragon, TMNT). You would play as Frankenstein's monster, and the enemies are either villagers/normal citizens or Dracula's army of undead.\n\nDracula here is similar to Castlevania where he has a castle fortress in Transylvania and an army of undead servants of all kinds. He has kidnapped Victor Frankenstein to make use of his arcane genius. This takes place during the period when you, the creature, were preparing to confront Victor and demand he create a mate for you (around midway through Mary Shelley's novel).\n\nNow, you have to make your way East to rescue Victor, or you will forever be alone. You must make your way from Geneva first to Ingolstadt, then Vienna, Budapest, and finally Transylvania.\n\nYou are head-and-shoulders taller than everyone else, and have a tremendous reach. You can bound easily across the landscape and climb effortlessly. You can pick up things and throw them, including your enemies."
kjkawd,Need feedback on a mechanic,"Context: I am making a game where the player has a mech suit that they can use to cast different abilities that cost ""electricity"" which is sort of like mana\n\nI was thinking about being able to adjust the ""suit voltage"" so you can modify the abilities a little bit but I'm not sure which model to pick\n\n**Model 1:** 3 different voltages. Low, normal, and high. Normal would be the normal ability. Low would be a low power version that would use a little less electricity(more efficient) and maybe a little less damage. High would use more electricity than normal and also maybe have a little bonus like some knockback or stun.\n\nThis is the model I had in mind when I thought of this game, however I feel like along with everything else going on in the game, people might just pick 1 of the 3 voltages and stick with that\n\n**Model 2:** 2 different voltages to keep it simple. Normal and High. Normal is normal but High would be something like 3x the cost for 3.5x damage as well as minor bonus like knockback or stun.\n\n This would be a high risk/ high reward bc if you were to miss an ability skillshot or something, you would lose a lot of electricity. This would also mean people would default to normal bc always using high would drain your electricity fast.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Which model sounds better and why?"

kj42p2,Time-travel game,"Here's a story I wrote for my game, what do you guys think? I'll post more details shortly so you can understand better.  \n\nYear is 30XX. Technology is booming. Scientists created a device known as The Eye of Time. It allows the wearer to revisit the memories they shared with the DNA host (even if dead) by visiting a dimension known as the DNA Loop (DNAL), but as a ghost, i.e. you can't communicate nor change the past. You also can't  enter your own DNAL, you'll die immediately. \n\n**Part 1: The O-Virus**\n\nA tech corporation known as ECORP develops the ""OV"" (overload virus) that overloads the eye and allows you to visit **ANY** period that the host has ever been to without needing to have co-existed in that period with the person. The O-virus only works if the DNA host is alive. Still, as a ghost. ECORP plans to use that in blackmailing all the rich and powerful people of the society.\n\n**Part 2: X's Heart of time**\n\nOne of the scientists in ECORP known as ""X"" (who also created the EOT devices) realizes the danger of the O-virus and starts developing a device known as ""The Heart of Time"" that allows him to travel to the past and prevent the creation of the EOTs. When ECORP finds out, Knowing that the heart requires X's DNA, they choose to kidnap him instead of killing him, and they steal the heart.\n\n**Part 3: The blueprint**\n\nDuring the fight at X's house, X cuts his hand, covers an overloaded EOT in his blood, then screams at Amelia after handing it to her: *""Run, Amelia, Run! As soon as you find cover use the eye and look for the blueprint""*\n\nAmelia runs away, finds cover, uses the eye, X feels her going in.\n\nWhile she's in, ECORP extract a syringe of X's blood to run the heart. Meanwhile, Amelia finds the blueprint and clicks the eye just in time to go out, as soon as X feels her going out, he kills himself, which immediately expires the DNA and stops the heart from operating.\n\n**part 4 - The daughter**\n\nECORP look for and kidnap Amelia to use hers instead. Even with Amelia's DNA, he heart still doesn't work so they attempt to visit her DNAL via the the bugged eye to only realize that Amelia's not X's biological daughter and that she's adopted. She overhears ECORP techs talking and gets devastated.\n\nNow that Amelia is no longer useful, ECORP decide to kill her. She attempts to escape from the lab prison by shocking one of the techs."
kj3mwg,Infinite Dendrogram,"A Complete story/online-living, with the center goal of becoming the strongest alive or your very own goals. Let's start with how it would be processed, say the world is equal to our very own. You could manage and store data by land mass, basically, you could have data centers on every major country to act as a main center for data near those areas within the game itself. This could manage the world processes and data with ease instead of a main server to manage everything. The very landscape could be transported to the cilent, minus all the buildings. However, if they do decide to build, it could be saved on the data station that they are the closest to.  \n\n\nNow to the player experience parts, the world could be their very own. They would build their own world, with the help of NPCs as well. The NPCS of the world could be managed by mini processing stations to render thousands of npcs at once. The NPCs could even build their own towns if given time to. This next part could be hard to do and probably wouldn't be done in this day and age. Though it might be possible in the future, this idea is to give NPCs permanent data. As if they were to die, thats it, but only death bans for players. Three day bans could be given to players that were killed. No weapon restrictions, no balancing, no admin inference (Not counting managing cheaters). The very weapon base could be managed and created by the players.   \n\n\nIf you like anime, you might be seeing where Im getting these ideas from. Heck, the name of the anime could be the name of the game. Infinite Dendrogram is the name of the anime i'm sourcing and sightly editing information from, in this game, the players are the ones ruling and shaping the reality around them. With special powers I should add.   \n\n\nThe powers themselves don't have to be added, but it would add so much to the fun factor of the game. Having your very own power to your player would be amazing. Multiple types, their very own ups and downs. I understand this could very well take 10 to 20 years, but the outcome (and money income) would be incredible. Just imagine it, your very own house that you built with your friends and family. You could very well even have VR support, this would change the very core of gaming and could turn tides of the disappointment of games.  \n\n\nGood looking graphics would also stop it from being disappointing, but if given the time and care that every game should get. It could and would change the world of gaming. I understand this probably wouldn't be possible now, but in the future. This could be very well the most downloaded and played game ever.   \n\n\nIf anyone, ANYONE is working on this. I would LOVE to know what you've done and allow me to watch, I know such a game would exist in the future, but I can't stop to think if someone is already working on such a game."

kit38h,"A GameMaster vs Players CO-OP dungeon crawler game. Where GM gather resources &amp; distributes items for the players, while players buy their skills and items to help them progress","This is more of a early concept that I've had in mind for about a month, but still not sure what the end goal could be, maybe a big boss battle? Hopefully you guys can share your thoughts about my idea. I play D&amp;D and this is very much inspired by it.\n\n# Overview\nI'm thinking a 3-5 player game where one person is a GameMaster and the rest is (2-4) players. GM is chosen or are randomly chosen. The GM can pick a series of maps the players should get through. A series can contain 3-5 maps with varying sizes. The maps themselves are a bunch of rooms which are connected via corridors or doors to another room. To continue to next map the players must find the exit (stairs down).\n\nPlayers can buy items which the GM ***MUST*** place somewhere in the map during setup. The items can be placed on minions, in treasure chests, or floating on the floor.\n\n# GM\nTo make it fun for the GM while the game is on I'm thinking the GM can control all minions as it were an RTS game. E.g. Move workers to another spot to hide them from the players while sending groups of minions to distract them. GM has full vision over the whole map.\n\nWhile during setup, the GM can:  \n* Place resources, minions, treasure chests, traps (can be placed anywhere, but resources are limited to 1 resource/room)  \n* Spend resources gathered from previous map to buy extra resources, minions, treasure chests, or traps  \n* The GM must add items the Players have bought  \n\nResources are locations that can be harvested or produce items by the GMs minions.   \nMinions ranging from simple workers that gather/produce items to weak-to-stronger enemies for defeating the players.  \nTreasure chests can be locked requiring a player to unlock it (buying GM some time to move enemies towards the party).  \nTraps can affect both the players and GMs minions making them deadly for both parties.  \n\nExamples of resources:  \n* Gathering wood  \n* Gathering iron ore  \n* Gathering coal  \n* Producing iron ingots (iron ore + coal)  \n* Producing swords (wood or iron ingots)\n* Producing shields (wood or iron ingots + wood)\n\nExamples of traps:  \n* Spike trap  \n* Swinging axe  \n* Arrows shot from walls triggered by a pressure plate (placed separately)\n\n# Players\nThe players role are pretty straight forward. They have to work together to survive the GMs minions and traps while destroying GMs resources. For the most immersion I'm thinking the players play using a Third Person-camera or First Person-camera (or both). Unable to view the whole map.\n\nDuring setup the players can:  \n* Buy items (items that GM must place on the map)  \n* Buy/upgrade skills they'd want to use  \n* Share items that was picked up from previous map\n\nThe players gain coins after completing the map. Destroying resources, killing minions, collecting items, dodging/disabling traps adds additional coins they can use for the next map. Players can discuss which items to buy and who gains the most from buying/upgrading skills. The items they picked up from last map can be shared between them. They share their loot &amp; coin!\n\nExamples of items:  \n* Potions (healing, attack+, defense+, etc)  \n* Armor  \n* Weapons  \n* Ammunition (for ranged weapons, spells)  \n* Trinkets (neck, rings)  \n\nExamples of skills (can be both direct or AoE):  \n* Healing skills  \n* Stun skills  \n* Heavy attack/extra damage skills  \n* Spells (Fireball, etc)  \n* Etc...  \n\n# End\nThanks for reading.

kikdnh,Unlimited Role-Playing Experience,"I love role playing games because they give you a large amount of freedom. The game i've been conceptualizing would do just that. I'm thinking it would start out mobile, as it would enable a larger audience to play, and because role playing games that maximize freedom are fairly limited on mobile devices.\n\nThe concept of the game is quite grand. The player, set in a fantasy world, will have almost complete freedom to do whatever they want.\n\nPlayers would begin by customizing their character, (race, class, appearance, etc,) then selecting where on a generated map they would like to begin. From there, it's basically an open world experience.\n\nThere would be several screens from which users could switch between. The first would just be map screen with minimalist graphics. The player would be able to zoom in and out, and would be able to see a range of the world, from relatively local to continental. The second, and most used, would be a top down view of the area the player is in, With graphics that are more detailed than those of the map, but still simplistic. The third would be a 2D visualization of any interactions the character is having, whether that be opening a chest or talking to an NPC. This screen would be more detailed than the last, but again, still relatively simplistic. The fourth screen would be an inventory screen, that would show any of a vast amount of items the character had acquired and equipped. (Again, simplistic) The fifth would be a screen that would show accepted quests, or something like that, to help the player remember interactions they'd had earlier.\n\nThats already a lot, huh. Yes. The game would be no small feat, but I have no doubt people would eat it up.\n\nThe player will be able to encounter a vast amount of situations, places, npcs, etc. etc. etc, many of which would be randomly generated to provide a unique experience for each individual player. \n\nPlayers would be able to accept quests and get rewards, forge alliances, romance, battle, etc. \n\nOkay. I'm looking back at that now and other than graphics, such a game would be in no way simplistic. My guess is it will probably stay forever a dream, though it's kinda an awesome dream nonetheless. Who knows, maybe someone will make something out of this small post. If you do, let me know."
kic614,"This is a little different, its an outdoor game i call ""reach""","Its basically tag, but if you miss, the person you were trying to hit gets a point.\n\nHow to play\nOne person is the dedicated tagger, and the other is the dodger. The tagger has to tag the dodger (or dodgers) and not miss, while the dodger has to dodge to get points. When the dodger gets tagged, the tagger gets a point and the dodger has to tag the tagger to get points.first to sixteen points wins. Normally one tag or dodge each would be one point, but you can change it up. If you call ""reach"" then the other person has to tell you if they reached or not, and you have to tell the truth. No calling pause or time out, thats cheating and a cowards move\n\nAdvanced\n\nEveryone can tag or dodge, both equal one point, and you cant tag someone repeatedly over and over again, thats too easy.\nIf you call ""flinch"" then the other person has to stand still and you can either tag or pretend to tag them. If they flinch while you were pretending to tag them, then you fet a point and the game continues. If they dont flinch, then they get a point. If you tag them, you get a point. If they dodge you, you get a point, and you cant try to tag them, and them say you were only pretending. You cant call flinch over and ober again, you can only call it five times (this is debatable)\nAnything you think is a good idea , put in the comments."

kiau0q,A creatures food chain simulation game with cards,"Hi all, \n\nSo I was looking at a few games where you basically create a fish tank and just look at it. Nothing more. This made me think, what if you had a more active role in the tank's life cycle?\n\nThe idea is to simulate the food chain of a set of creatures in a contained environment. For example, imagine that the savanna is your environment. You provide the player with trees, lions, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, hyenas, etc... and the player places them around in the environment. Each of these animals eats another animal or plant. So you want to mind the ratios as you try to balance the whole thing so no one species would die out or have the entire biome go extinct fro example.\n\nThe trick is that you don't give out the different animals or insects like in say Equilinox, but through cards. The player pulls random cards from a deck and those cards are basically what you have to use (or discard). So kinda work with what you have to balance the environment and make it last for as long as possible. Pulled the lion card? So now you gotta make sure there are a few preys around for him to eat. Oh, but wait, you got a plant card this time. OK, may as well put it far from the lions so the herbivores have a standing chance and survive a bit longer. This time, though, you got the hyenas and you have lots of preditors already. Maybe just sit this card for now till the herbivores are higher in numbers. You see what do I mean?\n\nWhat do you think of the idea?\n\nI am thinking this might be cool if done with an under the sea/ocean environment? Or perhaps Dinosaurs? Or maybe make some creatures up? Can't settle on which is cooler/better. What is your preference?"

ki2s0i,Hollywood acting simulator – become a huge Hollywood star,"Hi brilliant people of this subreddit.\n\nFor many years I wanted to know and FEEL what it would be like to be a big, successful, Hollywood movie star. I wanted to feel the thrill of going on set, having the cameras and lighting all pointed at me, memorizing the script and act my way through interesting and varied scenes. I also wanted to have the feeling of walking on the red carpet at the movie launch after getting out of a limousine, surrounded by press, fans and paparazzi, mingling with other movie and co-stars and taking a lot of photos. And then? Enjoy the earnings of course. if I just made millions as an actor, I might as well spend it by living a luxury life, buying expensive cars and living in the most lavish looking mansions available on Beverly Hills.\n\nAnd then I thought… oh well, if I can't really do or be all of those things in real life, what's stopping me from creating a game about it? My imagination's the only limit here, so without further ado, let's put some use into it!\n \n*Early game*\n \nSo, after our little introduction, here we are. To start up the game, the players will be selecting between who they want to be, whether it's a starting actor or an actress.  Once the player chose the name for their character, they'll move over to customizing their character, including face, hair, body types and so on. Just before character customization ends, the player will also be able to choose traits for their newly created character, giving them the leverage on getting parts in specific types of movies and shows (for example, if your character is more on the funny side they'll be suitable for sitcoms and comedies, while on the contrary they could be more suitable for action movies or dramas if their traits are different)\n \n*Getting Contracts, Projects, and other gameplay aspects*\n \nRight, so we're done creating our upcoming movie star, what now? Starting from the bottom of course! at first, our newly created character will have a small rented apartment house in which he/she lives in, and a nice little car. The first thing you're going to want to do, is find a movie agent. You'll be able to look for one on your phone book, and then set up a meeting and sign a contract with your chosen agent. Once that is done and you managed to get a good contract, it is time for auditions of course. your agent will mail you every so often and offer you auditions for various parts, the first offers will be for small budget movies or shows, but overtime they'll get a lot more serious, depending on your experience and the progression that you've made.\n\nOnce you accepted an audition, you'll have to get there in time otherwise your credibility status might take a hit, which could affect you in the future.  \n\nDepending on the part that you'll be given, you'll have to follow the instructions given to you on set and do whatever you're asked to do, as accurate as you possibly can. Need to memorize lines? Do it. Need to jump between two moving cars like a stuntman? Do it. When you complete all the tasks that you've been given, you return home and wait for a phone call to see whether your performance was satisfactory and whether you actually got the part. In the meantime, you can go audition for other movies or shows. Once you receive a phone call that tells you that you're in, you'll start what's called a ""Project"".\n \n*Projects*\n\nA project is basically a closed contract between you and the studio that hired you, allowing you to perform your part for said project. Each part depending on the project will be hand made for that specific project, like a story. You'll be doing what you've been auditioning beforehand, but this time it'll be on set with cameras, other actors and actresses, takes, and the scenes themselves will take a lot longer to complete.\nPlayers may lose their contract if they perform poorly, arrive late for shooting days and so on. Once a player loses their contract, the project will be closed and the player's reputation might plummet, depending on the reason for the project's closing.\n \n*High life housing &amp; Fame*\n \nOnce players reach the end of a project successfully and complete all the tasks they’ve been given, the project (whether it's a movie or a seasoned series) will go live on TV or cinema and the players reputation and fame bars will start to rise steadily. The income will go straight to the players bank account, depending on the percentage agreed in the player's contract for that specific project. Received 250K for example? time to go shopping! Players will be able to purchase cars, new furniture, and participate in various luxurious activities that could cost a lot of money for the average person. If players managed to cross their first million dollars, it's time to start hunting for a new house in Beverly hills or even the Malibu. A lot of houses and mansions will be available to either rent or purchase, and depending on the amount of cash each player has, they'll be able to upgrade their living style as time progresses while they become richer and richer. Each house will be fully customizable and decorate-able, and each player can design their house completely to their liking with expensive items etc etc. players will also be able to invite other fellow actors and actresses to their house and throw occasional parties as well.\nLiving far from the studio might be great against unwanted attention from the paparazzi and the like, but it also increases traveling time to work, so that needs to be taken into account when buying a new property.\n \nSo, that's pretty much all for now. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. There's still a lot to figure out and creating something in this magnitude ain't going to be an easy task since it's mostly a game of choice that contains a lot of branching paths and different outcomes for the various decisions players might make along the way. Still, if you like the idea in general, feel free to comment and make suggestions! Thank you for reading and have a fantastic day!"
ki2e00,Downgrade - a combat game where you downgrade your opponent,"# Intro\n\nThis is a design doc written out for the Weekly Game Jam. Seeing how the jam is almost over and I won't have time to implement this, I figured I'd share my idea here for if anyone wants to pick it up.\n\n# Concept\n\nIn Downgrade, 2 players fight each other in an arena. They get points for the percentage of the opponent’s health that is removed, plus a bonus if they manage to kill their opponent. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins. Each round is timed to keep up the pace.\n\nThe twist: both players start out with fully maxed-out upgrades and they can use points at the start of each round to purchase downgrades for their opponent.\n\n# Design considerations\n\n## Combat style\n\nMany kinds of combat-games lend themselves for this game. For example, this could be implemented as a first-person or third-person shooter or a top-down combat arena. It’s also very open to what kind of character the player controls. It could be a person or a tank for example.\n\n## Amount of players\n\nThe reason for suggesting 2 players is to avoid issues with multiple players ganging up on one single player and unloading all downgrades on that single player, effectively making it impossible for that player to win the game. If more than 2 players are to be supported, a solution to this should be implemented.\n\n## Win condition\n\nUsing points for both a win condition and purchasing downgrades will require players to put thought into buying downgrades: will they be able to earn back the points that they spend on downgrades by either using that advantage to obtain more points in return, or by limiting the amount of points their opponent will be able to earn.\n\n## Downgrade visibility\n\nKeeping downgrades hidden for the affected player can lead to players needing to experiment with their character to see whether any abilities have been changed. Some downgrades are immediately obvious, such as reduced movement speed or fire rate, while others can take some time to get figured out, such as reduced health if health numbers are not visible.\n\n# Fully upgraded\n\nThis is a suggestion for what a fully upgraded character can do:\n\n## Default weapon\n\nThe default weapon shoots plasma blasts in a straight line. Each blast acts as a projectile that can be dodged.\n\n## Auto-turret\n\nA drone hovers around the player and shoots bullet-speed projectiles at an opponent that is within a certain range. The auto-turret has a separate health pool from the player and can block projectiles.\n\n## Shield\n\nA shield hovers behind the player, blocking damage taken from behind.\n\n## Rocket\n\nEach round, both players receive a single-use rocket that moves slower than the plasma bolts and explodes upon collision, dealing damage in a radius around it.\n\n# Downgrades\n\nBelow are some suggestions for downgrades that can be bought.\n\n* Reduce movement speed by 50%\n* Reduce default weapon fire rate by 50%\n* Reduce default weapon projectile speed by 50%\n* Reduce health by 25%\n* Remove shield\n* Remove auto-turret\n* Reduce rocket blast radius by 50%"
ki1cqt,Player vs player story game.,"Maybe make a cabin in the woods game. It could be one vs one or 5 vs one.\nHow it will work is the player on the human team has control of the people and what he does will give the monster in the woods its properties. He will player one character at a time.\nThe 5 vs 1 would have the players team getting info on their character and they find more by talking to other players. They also make things happen on an item they touch in the cabin. \nEverytime a player finds information on dark stories. If they find one they get a random chance to start a monster round, but they won't know if one started or not.\nWhen each time a round happens the monster gets one new ability. That is from the story they found or lore that they heard. \nPractically this is a make your own enemy horror game.\nThe players can fight. Some characters would be weak ones, under dogs, the first to die.\nAlso the enemy watches the whole time so they get to watch and see where they are or what the players do or say. They could kill them the fashion way. Who dies first time stuff. Keep the Virgin alive or dead. If alive then you both get the. SEQUEL! Kinda like a finisher. \nI honestly  dont know what to call it or know if it's made."

khzq01,Escape a sinking cruise ship game idea.,"I've had a relatively simple idea **floating** around my mind for awhile. You're on a cruise ship and for whatever reason, it begins to sink. It's a 3d game where you have the entire ship to explore as it goes down. There are many ways to do things. For example, finding a key to open a door, or breaking a bench from the floor and using it to break down the door. There are many dangers. you could drown, sliding furniture or collapsing structures could crush you, the freezing water could give you hypothermia, so even if you make it out of the water, you need to keep warm. You can choose to lower a lifeboat into the water and escape that way, or stay onboard as the ship takes its final fall into the water and find debris to float on waiting for a rescue ship. Each round is about 30 minutes and you get points for doing things, for example. Lowering a lifeboat gets you 10 points, the longer you stay on the flooding ship and the closer to the water you get gives you more points, etc. There could be a global points board. Maybe the game could be multiplayer and you could all fight to survive. I have no plans on making this game and have no experience in the field. Just a fun idea. Let me know if you would play this game if it existed."

khwrau,A twist on the generic action movie hero formula.,"So I was watching Die Hard and I’ve been thinking how every action game and movie is about a hero going up against this super elaborate plan or something and against all odds makes it out on top. Well I had an idea for a game that I think would be rather interesting and something I’ve never seen before.\n\nThe game would be about being a villain in an action movie and having to go up against a protagonist figure. You would have to devise elaborate plans with a bunch of variables in play to take into account. And then execute it without getting taken out or outsmarted by the protagonist or protagonists.\n\nThe structure would be that there are a bunch of missions in areas for you to take on, the more you level up the more complex the mission variables get. You have a planning phase where you set everything up and place everything down such as guards, traps, diversions, etc. then you execute the plan in a payday 2 style way with a first person perspective. You would of course get money for completing these missions allowing you to get better gear for yourself, better gear for your organization, and better technology for your organization. The design philosophy would be a freedom of approach. All you have at your disposal is what your goal is, what things the protagonist has and the variables at play will have to be figured out vi trial and error. It will be like a strategy game with how these things work and every single trap and thing you put down will have an exploitable weakness and a bit of RNG. Like the guards you get are mostly things to give you time but there is a small chance that they may kill the protagonist. \n\nThis is probably a tad bit ambitious for like an indie dev or something but if they can figure out a way to simplify this idea then I could definitely see something interesting being made.\n\nThanks for listening."

khrulo,An RPG that sticks to the base and does it really well,"Nowadays, every RPG needs to come with a twist or something, so what if we stick to the basics and just nail them.

Treated fairly  \n\n\nElf - high starting magic dps, low starting physical damage, low starting physical defence, high magic defence. Treated fairly by humans, low by orcs and hated by dark elves. Can walk through magical barriers without requiring a spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDark Elf - similar to elf with a potency for learning dark, fire, and ancient magic. Dark appearance with parts of body being covered with red runes and glyphs. Thought down on by humans, thought down on by elves, admired by orcs and scorned by nymphs. Weak to water, life and wind magic. Can walk through flames, lava and such, is healed by lava.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWood Nymph - similar to elf with a high affinity for learning earth, life, healing and ancient magic. Woodlike appearanc with parts of body being covered in leaves, bark and such. Immune to life magic, weak to fire, dark magic. Can hide in a trees trunk to escape enemies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOrcs - have high physical damage and defence, excellent with crafting. Immune to poisons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWater nymph - similar To elf, with unlimited breath time in water, complete immunity to water magic, and high forte in water, life and ancient magic. Water dash and general speed upgrade in water\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWind nymph - similar to elf, with the ability to glide in air and takes no fall damage. High affinity for wind, lightning,  and ancient magic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstats are\n\nPlain leveling up gives a major boost in all of these, refills health and mana, gives a stat point and a skill point that can be used for non magic skills, and a magic point for either upgrading spells up to lvl 5 or purchasing a spell, can also get skills from quests and can get spells, and magic points from quests.\n\nStrength - pretty obvious, increases carry capacity, melee damage.\n\nDefence - again pretty obvious\n\nPrecision - pretty straightforward, increases crit chance, accuracy with aiming and wider window for dodging.\n\nWisdom - increases mana capacity, magic learning speed, cast speed, magic damage and such.\n\nStealth - obvious\n\nAgility - increases speed, dodging speed but not to the point that it looks really stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would be a high fidelity game with amazing effects and graphics, almost no bugs, great customisation, that is surprisingly hard to find in most games, in this one you won’t have to spend hours trying to find a way to not make your character look stupid.

I can’t really wrap my head around how a game with Patrick Bateman would work and what would you do as the player?\n\nI thought about having it a horror, but why?\nAre you playing Patrick? Or are you a friend of his?\n\nWhat game ideas do you have around American Psycho? Let’s have some fun!"

khdlo1,Ballet Social Sim,It's a singleplayer rhythm social sim where you attend a high school and learn and practice ballet. In-between that you'll socialize with other ballet dancers or other students attending the school.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how these relationships can benefit your performance but one idea is that you'll have anxiety and you can reduce that with your relationships. And if you don't reduce your anxiety enough you'll chicken out.\n\nI'd like the art style to be like Van Gogh's or something similar and the animation would be dream-like. The music would be ballet and maybe other forms of classical.
khdcs1,Any ideas for a Swarm game?,Working on swarm mechanics 2d/3d right now and looking for gameplay Ideas.. \nA swarm will consisting of up 1000 individuals.\n\nI want to make it either a combat game: your swarm defeats other swarms or regular enemies and use the dropped resource to grow.\n\nOr more of a physics puzzle?\n\nAny ideas or thoughts? On gameplay or possible themes?\n\nPS: due to current events lets stay away from Plague or Infection contexts..

kol5xp,Mechanic idea :item history,(I've looked every where for a mechanic like this but I can't find it so here)\nMy idea for a mechanic is in a mmo gamewhere every item in the game has history and im not talking about dev lore but player history if you find a spell book in a dungeon then you are put into that items \nHistory and when you trade that item then a other player is also put into that items history and so on and so forth  then there is a button in the game that to that items history page showing you every player that has gotten that item and how they got for example: looting \nTrading creating that item etc \nI would love this to be in a game
kohr4p,Strategic management rpg,"An rpg where your stats are depleted every time you use them (attacking lowers attack, dodging lowers max stamina ecc), and to increase them you have to defeat enemies, while different enemies gives bonus to different stats. You would have to carefully manage you actions and energies, and assuming grinding is well discouraged it would lead to interesting gameplay. One way to do so, for example, would be to make enemies that give consistent bonus to attack be extremely powerful in their att strength and thus forcing the player to use more of the other stats, may that be defense or dodging.\nWould it be fun to play or it would get frustrating or worse boring too easily?"
koemzk,A Mech game I wish I could make.,"If I had the ability and time I would make a pixel art based online mech game. \n\nThink if Escape from Tarkov, Warframe and Brigador had a baby on a much smaller scale with simple graphics. Top down iso like Tiberian Sum or third person like Risk of Rain 2. \n\nEssentially:\n\nI want more [Brigador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qmmnHoBAlk), but I want to create my own mech; build it from scratch myself; take it into a generated map; to complete a time limited contract I selected; with 3 other players I was lobbied with; with the threat of fighting against a team of four enemies. I then want to extract from the map with the loot of my fallen enemies, if I died in that match then I lose everything. \n\nI want the game to be slow and high stakes, it should take at least 20 minutes to complete a mission. \n\nI want a game where I can log into my own place (like [Warframe's personal ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CebSWhhdiS0), or in this case your personal [Mech garage](https://res.cloudinary.com/lmn/image/upload/fl_lossy,q_80/f_auto/v1/gameskinny/f11c70ec5816650ec1debb374f55c3a1.jpg)). Trade the loot I don't want for money to buy the parts I do want directly from other players doing the same. \n\nIf you are a gifted and talented intermediate dev you could use this space to make mech creator engine similar to [spore's alien creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzszX3H9czg). This is very ambitious and only a bonus but I'd imagine it to be a massive selling point. \n\nI don't need a story as much as a contextual backdrop, e.g. like [Warframe's syndicate](https://i.redd.it/yxnaxgaoc8n21.jpg) system with corps employing you for contracts that fit their narrative (a bioresearch company wants you to kill a behemoth alien/ a rebel org wants you to sabotage military points). \n\nSimilar to Escape from Tarkov you need to be picky and decide how to gear your mech, open desert space or close urban combat? Assasination mission or hold a point against waves of enemies? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStyle: \n\nStellar Jockeys nailed it but [pixel art in a 3d space from a third person perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuybbn2beU) is very compelling. Although again, very ambitious. \n\nIt's a game a single dev couldn't make I know but this is my message in a bottle."

kob3q3,Driving simulator where you actually have to follow traffic rules. And then it gets weird.,"The most intuitive way to track player's performance would be using a score system, but I wouldn't make it too obvious making bad performances being followed by angry comments by other drivers and chasing cops or something.\nBut then, imagine the game being set in a city where every morning the mayor changes some traffic rules, and you have to read and remember today's rule to be a good driver. Absolutely absurd laws like today is legal to hit other cars and run over pedestrian but not turning right.\nIt would soon make interesting and hilarious gameplay."

Its an action/story driven game where you'd be able to switch characters at any time during combat or when solving puzzle elements.\n\nI was initially going to make it a linear first person game with each level having its own special mechanic...which will require more work but will be far more immersive and I'll need to nail the visuals but the whole game would be quite short.\n\nOr an isometric game (like Hades) and I could make it more open ended however it would be completely story driven with some RPG elements and would be far easier to make a 2D and I'd also be able to take some shortcuts, but I also feel this approach would be less immersive...\n\nAny ideas/suggestions would be appreciated."

ko4qoi,A game kinda like escape from tarkov or hunt showdown set in a nuclear wasteland I came up with when I was high,"Set in Soviet Union(1972) after nuclear accident(1959). You have to do quests for the settlement residents e.g. scavenge supplies from certain locations(lowest risk, low reward) or defeat powerful mutated monster animals which killed people from the settlement or something (very high risk, high reward it's a bounty pretty much) you'd cut its head off to show it to the ""authorities"" of the area, kinda like government but over lawless nuclear wasteland (they pay the big bounty). There will be other players to contend with in both scenarios but there won't be much incentive to kill them in the scavenging missions as no one would take good loot in as it's low reward low risk. And you would get worse deals or deals will become unavailable for weapons and supplies from the authorities (explain below). \n\nPlayers would use mostly handmade weapons made from pipes, wood, tape etc that they can easily make. These would be appropriate for just self defense against the players in scavenging missions. However when you get into bounty hunting mutants you will start needing more firepower. The authorities that you will start dealing with as you begin your hunting career will have legitimate weaponry for sale like Aks and SKS and all kinds of other stuff from the period.you will start being able to afford these after your first one or two successful bounties."

ko1sgy,1v4 ghostbuster/exorcist type game,"One person plays as a ghost trying to scare all the NPCs and players to death, or just into fleeing the location.\nThe other four players play as a team and must hunt down and exorcise the ghost player before the ghost completes their goal.\n\nThere are different types of ghosts you can play as. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. One might be better at making noise, one could be better at throwing objects, and another could be better at possession.\nThe other four players are going to have to deduce what type of ghost you are in order to figure out how to exorcise you, so you might want to keep a low profile at first.\nThe ghost can scare NPCs and human players to lower their sanity. When their sanity gets too low, they either flee the area or kill themself. (If you wanted to keep this PG, their heads could just pop like a balloon when they get too scared, or something.) The more NPCs and players you drive away, the lower the atmosphere gets and the easier it is to scare people. The longer the game goes on and the lower the atmosphere, the stronger your powers.\n\nThe human players also have their own classes. Each class has their own strengths and set of items on them. One could be a psychic who is easier to possess and can tell when the ghost is within a certain radius of them. One could be a priest/nun that is harder to possess but has a limited ability at exorcising the ghost. Another could be a hellsing type character that has a lot of equipment on him.\nHumans have to decipher what kind of ghost the other player is by what powers and effects they see the ghost use. They can’t see the ghost unless the ghost uses certain abilities. They must try to blend in with the tourists in the area in order to avoid being targeted by the ghost.\n\nYou can also equip different perks and items to your ghost and human characters to give them a boost."
ko159v,A fighting game set in the Star Wars universe using all their Jedi/sith powers unique to each along with their fighting style and speciality.,
knyf2t,Indie mashup fighting game idea,"By the way, I have been looking for a place to post all of my game ideas for a very long time and I was extremely surprised to find this sub here. Anyway, I have tons of game ideas. It's basically my hobby to imagine video games and draw their cover art, characters, and more. Some I even get so into that I pretend to release new updates for them every so often (lol). I'll draw a page titled, for example, *UPDATE 1.5*, and then I'll write all the new features coming in the update, and at the bottom, when the update will be released.\n\nSo as you can imagine, I have notebooks full of ideas and drawings. The one I am most into right now is called *Otherworld Arena*. It's a crossover fighting game (that isn't Super Smash Bros.). It mostly only has characters from indie games, but they have to be popular enough to be at least recognizable by the majority. The game updates regularly, adding new characters. In OWA they are called *heroes*.\n\n*Otherworld Arena*'s original five heroes were:\n\nHenry Stickmin (Henry Stickmin)\n\nCuphead (Cuphead)\n\nFrisk (Undertale)\n\nImpostor (Among Us)\n\nThe Knight (Hollow Knight)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1.4 added Crash Bandicoot (may I remind you this game and its updates are fictional)\n\nAnd Update 1.5 (which is coming on January 10th) will be adding Qbby, from the BOXBOY franchise"
knxv7f,A good war story,"Like I'm thinking of a good one, not the Americans, not the Anglish. The Russians. A story about a scared 19 year old who gets pushed trough the traumas of war, it should represent what war really is like. While using real places and battalions. While still NOT acting like a movie, this is not a special idea but a hard request but I'm sure someone can do it. P.S this is my first post so yea."

knv7pg,Using your own corpse from previous runs as source of material.,"Please excuse any grammar error, I'm not English native. \n\nI was thinking of some top-down or isometric real-time rpg, heavily inspired by Hyper Light Drifter in style and basic combat mechanics, where every time you respawn centuries passes and your old corpse crystallizes, morphing your stats into solid elements used to forge new items. To avoid repetitive gameplay I thought to add rogue-like elements in a fixed world, for example some routes closing and others opening each run. I'm still thinking if it'd be better to implement checkpoints or pure rogue tabula rasa character. \n\nThe idea started from the concept of an elemental world, where the four elements have the corresponding body-part and statistic (fire = arms = strength, earth = legs = movement/defense, air = chest = hp/stamina, water = head = magic/willpower). You would increase your statistics defeating specific enemies, but you cannot upgrade your weapons or abilities without the crystals. You would craft abilities and items from a 2x2 grid, using maybe various degrees of crystallization of the same 4 elements. I don't mean your dead body to be the only source of crystals (maybe you can find others adventurer's bodies along the way) but it'd be the main.\n\nI imagined the world a little brighter that HLD's and with less neon, with a wider set of environments.\n\nAnother feature I'm thinking about is having to build yourself every stat visualizer, otherwise you don't know how much health or magic power you have left. Maybe it would be a bit weird and very hard to adapt for new players while the experienced wouldn't need the indicators, but I like the idea of not having your stats displayed if you don't build something to read them. I'd surely add visual indicators on the character body (colored aura or brightness) if I removed the HUD."
knu97t,A puzzle platformer with a twist,"This game will be a game where play as 2 characters, the architect and the platformer. the architect is able to move physics based objects through a 3d space, the platformer can only move in the second dimension and can only interact with objects as they appear in the second dimension (Ex: you put a sphere down and the platformer sees it as a circle but as you move it through the Z axis they see it get smaller and start floating until you move it so far out it disappears. this game could work with single player or 2 player co-op"
kntmnb,Rotten World - Small Open World Competitive VR Zombie Survival Game,"Important: This game idea has some inconsistencies and is uncompleted but I thought I'd throw it up here incase it gave anyone a interesting read or an idea for their own game. In saying this by all means rip this idea to shreds if you think its bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*The Game consists of these main factors:\*\* (gameplay loop)\n\nSpawn - Scavenge - Craft - Run/Fight - Ascend - survive/fight - Extract - Sell items - Restart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game has 3 main levels, they are expressed in more detail down below but essentially they are - sewers, ground level, skyscrapers. The objective of the game is to get to the top floor with the most gear and loot as possible and extracting whilst staying a live. Players start at floor 2 and can descend into the sewers if the want (high risk high reward) but ultimately the idea is to out run the elements, people and Ai with all your loot and extract at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[zombies/Becoming Infected\]\n\nThe game contains 3 different types of zombies:\n\nScratchers - These Zombies rely heavily on the darkness to move around once a light source is presented in front of them the scurry away. Scratchers are only located in level 1 due to their hatred for light and make incredibly loud scratching \n\nnoises a long the hallway's so that the player knows when to turn on and off light sources to stay safe. these zombies can be taken down but its incredibly inefficient and attracts more attention than it merits, meaning that its better to use the light  more often.\n\nWalkers - casual zombies that are seen in apartment rooms  on level 3 and in stores and outside on level 2. These zombies can be taken out with a blow to the head with a melee or a gun, various explosive items or fire\n\nthey can also take fall damage from being shoved of a building. \n\nJumpers - These zombies have the ability to jump from building to building and cannot be outrun. They are a lot rarer than the usual walker and can be found on level 3 only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Changing attributes in the city server\]\n\nThe the match continues a massive Flood causes players to ascend to higher levels starting from level 1 (the sewers) to level 2.5 (ground floor, carparks and convenience stores, gun shops)\n\nOnce the flood is done at level 2.5 The zombie virus mutates from being bites to becoming air Bourne. This causes the player to scavenge higher up as resources are limited and gasmask filters dont last long \n\nforcing them to go to level 3 (up skyscrapers/final level) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[World, Deadhorse City\]\n\nSewers (Level 1)\n\n Mostly taken over by scratcher zombies, the sewers are directionless in nature but allow for a more secret way to transport around the city if you can navigate through the darkness, \n\ncontaining secret areas with high quality items and skill books, its main draw back is its the first level to completely flood, and with only so many exits you might get trapped down in the darkness, ending your game early.\n\nThis area is filled with small exits, sewer holes, locked rooms and destroyed hallways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGround level (Level 2)\n\nTrain - a train governed by the army that comes and stops with high quality supplies, skill Books and vehicles like a Humvee with a turret on the back. \n\nThough storming the train comes with a high chance of dying (it takes a lot of man and firepower to take stuff from the train but its game changing stuff)\n\nCarparks - areas which contain small vehicles that allow for quick transportation around on ground level. drawbacks to these vehicles come with extreme sound and little armour, attracting players and zombies alike.\n\nGun shops - These stores are pretty self explanatory, containing weapons skill papers and an arsenal of very needed low and high end ammo\n\nConvenience stores - these contain common items like food, water craftable items and low end ammo\n\nBoats - Incredibly rare vehicles that allow players to not use carparks or skyscrapers to get to 2.5, mean they have less chance of encountering enemies, though armoured, they make an extreme  amount of noise \n\nmeaning that leaving them once your inside one an be an extreme challenge. These spawn at Docs which have a higher amount of zombies at them due to people trying to leave during the initial outbreak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkyscrapers (Level 3)\n\nThis is essentially supposed to be the final level where players extract from with their loot and items\n\nat this level there is a bunch of tall buildings connected with various broken down wooden walkway bridges which connect them all, at this point your either: gunning for the exit to save your loot, dying to the gas cause your gas mask has broke or fighting other players that managed to rise to the other levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Camp sites\]\n\nCamp sites are the players Home base, they can be set up at any location on the map, wether that be outside on a hill or inside a room in a apartment they allow the player to collect their thoughts, strategies \n\nand use the various workstations bellow to get ahead in the game and become stronger. These are set up by the player with the starting items they hold in their backpack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Filtration systems/Cooking) - water and food - Food and water are needed to increase stamina and can even prolong an infected players death making them very important to produce \n\nthe system is essentially a cooking station that allows you to boil water and cook various foods. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Weapons and items Crafting bench)\n\nThis crafting bench is where you are able to craft various items such as Molotov's, spike bombs, alarm traps and torches to use in battle with Ai and players. \n\nas well as increasing damage buffs and makeshift silencers for your weapons  \n\nIn order to craft these you must have come across the special items u need to make them. \n\ne.g if you want to create a Molotov you need to find motor oil, cloth, a bottle of alcohol and use these items at the bench to create the Molotov \n\nyou then need to either have a match or zipper to use it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the skill books come in handy. The skill books and papers contain crafting recipes for all the variations of items you can craft in the game. Telling you how to put together an item and \n\nif you have the materials needed to do so. \n\nThe workshop contains a foldable table with a top light. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Games/Music) - Chess or little psp games that you can find which allow you to pass time whilst things are crafting, As well as a music play to use if you dare allow yourself to be off guard.\n\n(Radios) allow for players to talk to other player camps with radios, this can lead to trade locations using certain safes around the map, team ups or to spread false information.\n\nRadio briefcases can be found throughout the map on all levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Weapons building and savaging\]\n\nDeterioration of weapons cause them to loose their sharpness and steadiness after becoming to used\n\nmaking the player go back to Homebase to recraft them using the materials they've created/found\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Ai system\]\n\nMerchants - the surviving civilians that reside in places like a boxed off stadium which allow you to trade with them to get items \n\nArmy - Drop supplies to random locations using helicopters that can be shot down.\n\nDoctors - hold certain medical items that can cure patients in late game if their mask broke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you like a few notes for an idea i came up with out of the blue, by all means good and bad, tell me what you think. :0"
knt0rt,Stealth Game in a Fantasy World,"I love coming up with ideas that break a stereotype. For example, I’d love to see a stealth game but set in a fantasy world instead of a modern setting, so no guns, just medieval weapons and some spell casting. I was considering two models:\n\nModel 1: Instant death if you’re spotted\n\nModel 2: Once you’re spotted you have to kill everyone, but if you’re not spotted you don’t have to have any fatalities, and getting zero fatalities earns you extra gold you can spend to learn new spells, get new skins, or improve stats."
knsbbu,"Ricochet game, FPS with emphasis on environment analysis, forward thinking and cutting off opponents escape route","I thought it’d be cool if bullets were coated in an elastic material so that the only way you could hit people is with the ricochet e.g. if it hits something the elastic shell is shredded and it bounces off of it but now it actually hits people and you could have a wide range of weapons, each with a different number of bounces until the elastic shreds, this could result in battle royals where you’re trying to corner your opponent by cutting off their escape routes with bullets, leading them into a dead end, planning out where the enemy will be and where you need to shoot so it will be there after the number of bounces that weapons bullet has and taking into account how fast it travels, similar calculations when figuring out how to dodge and maybe bullets can have collision with each other so a friend could shoot between two enemies and you could shoot slightly later after they split up to dodge the bullet with a gun that has faster bullets so your bullet catches up to your friends bullet and they bounce off each other which shreds the elastic material of both and the now deadly bullets strike one enemy each, one bouncing off to the left and the other to the right. Kinda like how the beast men’s game is in No Game No Life? Could utilise these bullets collisions to shoot taking into account variables previously mentioned to get a bullet to strike another bullet before it hits you to protect yourself, hit someone hidden behind something from above, reflect bullet back at enemy, protect ally from bullet, etc.\n\nI think the number of bounces should be indicated with colour e.g. yellow is 3 bounces left, blue, red, then it’s harmful and becomes black and will damage on impact and be destroyed. Weapons colour can reflect number of bounces it’s bullets have.\n\nEssentially I’d like to experience the strategy of using the environment to put opponents in inescapable situations with planning and careful baiting and execution, I played a game as a kid like this game (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1302550/Tanklike/) or the tank game from clubhouse games 51 worldwide classics on the switch and have always wanted to see that sort of gameplay but with human characters that can move with greater versatility with more ricochet, bullet collisions, 3D and with characters with greater mobility."

knndum,an openworld avatar game,"Basic as it sounds,a game about exploring all four nation, with the power of all 4 elements.\n\nlike using the staff to fly, create pillars with earth, shoot fire for long range, or surf with water, and bunch of other ways to either move around or beat up people with the power of all 4 elements.\n\nclosest game i had in mine to understand how it be, is spiderman ps4, except replace the webslinging."
knjdjc,Hand Tracking Finger Gun Game,"Use your hands to make gun shapes and your mouth to make the noises. You could have duel pistols, lazers, shotguns, machine guns or rocket launchers depending on how you use your hands and voice.\n\nYou'd see your hands in game but things like muzzle flash, projectiles and impacts would be visually added.\n\nI think it would be most fun using Oculus' hand tracking though it would still be very playable using regular VR controllers. There could be gestures or voice commands for specials like timeouts, slow motion and forcefields which could be either found in the level or based on cooldowns."
knitqb,Top-down team stealth game,"Hi all!\nI’ve been toying with the idea of a 2d/top-down team vs team stealth game and want to hear your thoughts.\n\nPremise: A team of Agents must infiltrate [some place] and complete an objective, while the Guards must detect and eliminate them.\n\nStyle: Simple, inviting 2D artwork. Refer to Among Us\n\nGame flow: Round-based gameplay - teams switch after each round, and after some time the map is changed (refer to counter-strike, etc)\n\nMechanics:\nLighting - Dynamic lighting. Agents can’t be seen while in darkness, but guards have directional flashlights.\nSound - Most actions taken produce sound. Since this is 2D top-down, sound could be represented by ‘pings’ on the edges of opponents’ screens to indicate direction and strength of sounds in range. Agents must progress slowly or risk exposing themselves.\nWeapons - Since this game is more about stealth than gunplay, elimination is always via one-hit kills. Guards have handguns while Agents may only use knives. (These could be switched out for more family-friendly ideas)\nEnvironmental tools - vent systems and lighting control panels for the Agents, camera systems for the Guards, etc etc\nUnknown objectives - to prevent Guards from simply camping an objective, only the Agents know what they must accomplish in a round, and this is random each time.\n\n\nPossible additions:\nNPCs - characters going about their own business in the mission location. They must not be harmed, and can be used by the agents to blend in and hide in plain sight.\nPoint system - rather than a simple win/lose condition, points could be awarded based on time taken and team members lost, etc.\n\nLet me know if this sounds interesting, you see potential problems, or have any other ideas! Thanks in advance!"
knhuvy,An open world combat game where direct hits are prohibited,"I’m thinking of a game something like the Hunger Games movies, where you and a bunch of other players/cpus compete to be the last one standing, armed to the teeth with all sorts of weapons. The only catch is that you can’t use the weapons directly, but you rather have to use them to manipulate your environment. E.G. using an axe to chop down a tree and letting it fall on someone.

knfv64,"A farming simulator where cute monster girls help you, but it’s sfw, none of this hentai crap.","If you’ve ever played a game like stardew valley then you know what kind of graphics I personally would think would look good.\n\nA few days ago I was looking for an sfw monster girl game and couldn’t find one (unsurprisingly) but it’s something I want. Because I think harpies are cute and I want them helping me grow beets and whatever else on my farm. \n\nSpecific requests would be making it have some kind of story, some kind of procedurally generated challenge dungeon, that would be unlocked post story. Each character can be hired and used for something specific, as well as being able to pick one at the beginning of the game to start off with, like for example an auto selling monster girl, one that can clear a spot for farms, or one that could be a remote market link. But if anyone wants to take up this request please do it, I’ve been wanting something like this for ages after finding out almost no sfw monster girl related games exist, I want to have a nice farming simulator with them in it.\n(for full monster girl references check out the monster girl encyclopedia wiki, just mind the hentai bits)"
knd6yh,What's your thoughts on a proper space game?,"Hello There!\n\nSo, I've been playing some space games recently and almost every single one of them, when comes to outer space combat or movement, there is loud sound and gunfire like on earth. \n\nNow, I get it, games need to games and have some kind of eye-candy, but for example, something like Dead Space, when you are inside there is sounds everywhere, but when you are outside, there almost none.\n\nDo you guys think that if more games implemented that, they would become too boring?\n\nTL;DR: Space game with proper space mechanics?"
knbmh6,Fall Guys Type Game Ideas?,"Hey there, I'm a game developer and i really like the direction the popular video game Fall guys took on creating a Obstacle course type game. I was wondering if any of you had some Fun and Interesting game ideas related to Obstacle courses, physics or even any other fun game shows you might of seen.   \n\n\- Thanks"
knar26,Terraria Like Game where you Fight Bosses and Explore,"I've posted about my Game Idea often on r/gamedesign and I'd like to see how what you guys think. I'm planning on making the game in Unity. Redigit recommended that for Game Developers. \n\nTo Explain it quickly, it's Terraria but with no building and more strict classes. \nYou would choose your class Warrior, Ranger, Summoner, or Mage during character creation. You would explore the Nexus Reality of World Two which is a lot of Dimensions fused Together. \nThere's a lot of Lore I came up with, but to put is simply, A Girl and Her Boyfriend travel to the Dimension to create Life. She comes with her pet Slime who is the Alkahest but she doesn't realize that yet. The Slime Guy becomes a Recurring Boss. There are giant Interdimensional Creatures called Absorbers. There's also a Civilizations in the Ocean of Weresharks, Wereoctopuses/Werepi and Fish People. \nYou'd collect Resources and created Armor and Weapons to fight Bosses. After Defeating a Boss, you'll get a new piece of gear makes you more powerful, be it a Weapon, Accessory or Transformation. There would also be Underwater Bosses and you'd be able to Transform into one of the Mentioned Fish Shark and Octopus people along with a Whale Transformation. There would be a Large Dungeon like Area called the Labyrinth where a Dimensional Beast is kept. He's an important boss. The Caves in the game were dug by a Worm (another boss) and that's why they're so wide and you don't need to mine to get anywhere."
knai8r,Suggestions for a game?,"I want to make some game that will be enjoyable and the game mechanics would be simple, nothing too complex like a WW3 simulator, but a rather simple game that doesnt use guns, but magic perhaps or something abstract."
kn8utg,Star Wars Survival,So as a survival game fan and a starwars fan I think the idea would be pretty cool. I mean executed well enough that is. After having over 1.5k hours on dayz and arma 2 I was thinking maybe it wouldn't be so hard to make a starwars themed version of a survival sim. Maybe based on one planet to start of with then later on develop it into a more expensive game. What do you guys think. Bad or good idea?
kn5026,0 Gravity FPS,"A zero gravity fps balanced around movement skill instead of shooting. I envision it as follows\n\nPlayers would choose between 3 different options for movement\n\n1. Jetpack/ EVA pack that allows them to move in any direction, with the downside of giving off a visible rocket exhaust and having limited fuel. In my opinion this would have the lowest skill gap low risk/low reward but very stable and I see it as a good option for a sniper\n2. Grappling hook letting player pull themselves toward objects and swing around them (Kinda like spiderman but in space) The downside being a limited line length and having the line be venerable to break if damaged. This one has the potential to be very effective if used by a skilled player high risk/high reward\n3. A pair of magnetic/gravity boots that let the player walk/run on any surface and jump from that surface, they would also allow the player to control where gravity is pulling them. This option seems to me as a good middle ground of risk/reward for intermediate players\n\nThese 3 would need to be balanced properly to make sure they play fairly. \n\nOther important mechanics:\n\n1. Realistic Physics, as in guns recoil affects your velocity and of course different guns have varying amounts of recoil. Also your characters loadout weight affects your movement speed and inertia. \n2. Different armor setups that cover varying areas of the body and protect from certain  types of weapons more effectively than others and of course have differing mass added on to the player.\n3. No sound  from other players unless you are both grappled/walking on the same object or hit by a projectile\n4. A few choices of guns maybe 10 max to keep it easy to balance, choose whatever aesthetic you like but I'd stick to 4 categories. Firearms would be able to penetrate armor most effective but at the downside of physical recoil, laser weapons that kill through transferring heat to the target aka a slower time to kill but with the benefit of no recoil and infinite ammo, melee weapons are pretty obvious, and explosive weapons like rocket and grenade launchers which if you're hit by push you away from the center of the explosion force depending on how close you are to the blast and size of the charge.\n5. 100m cubed Simple maps with 2 or 3 intersecting routes at varying angles to each other, i thought about the engine room of a massive spaceship, an asteroid field, or a space station\n\n I think the game could benefit from stunning visuals of the cosmos and raytraced lighting and all that but that's unimportant to the core mechanics, I'd probably still play the shit out of it (excuse my French) even if the character models were spheres with glocks still would awesome to see the physics in action and how players would use them to their advantage.\n\nI'm 100% open to criticism and suggestions Lemme hear whatcha think."
kn2ddv,Co-op horror mechanic?,I've been wanting to create a VR Co-op horror game. I've had a few ideas but they just aren't scary. Could someone maybe nudge me in the right direction?
kn1xc3,"""Battle Royale"" Weird Idea","A nuke is about to explode in the middle of the town 60-100 (This could change) people are dropped in the map. The players will have 1 hour to do find resources and weapons, there will be proximity chat where you can recruit allies that can help you with objectives or kill them for their loot, the final objective would be to find the key to a bunker to survive the nuke (the key would have an specific bunker number that you can open that only the person that found it could see). I was thinking the game would be DayZ like experience where the game doesn't really tell you what or how to do stuff, you just know the nuke is gonna go off and you have to move and find stuff. If you manage to survive you can keep everything you looted and when you come back and play again you'd appear with the loot, in this case instead of playing the same objective again you could try for a bigger objective which would be to defuse the nuke, if you get killed tho you'd lose everything. (Idea in progress, I'm not really a game developer or anything, also I speak Spanish mainly so pardon my English xD)"

kmvoej,Ideas for multiplayer fps game,Im making a test game in UE4 multiplayer fps. Basicly a CSGO ripoff. I dont wanna add powers but any ideas to make it more intresting when playing with friends?
kmrxw3,SW:BF 2 but slower and more tactic based,The Battlefront games were genuinely fun at heart but I found myself looking for a more Squad-like game with more drawn out battles instead of running and gunning. The use of the modern vehicles and machinery from the Star Wars series flying overhead or stomping through a small village just makes my heart smile.

kmpxfb,God of War + Warzone = Naruto?,"So a little backstory before I get into the game itself. Naruto was the last anime I really adored. The series came out when I was about 11 yrs old and ended (at least it seems like) 10 yrs later. Since then I guess I’ve aged out of anime, nothing holds my attention the way it did when I was a kid. \n\nI’ve always had dreams of playing a Naruto like, over the shoulder, open world, pvp multiplayer game. A game that allows you to run freely, has awesome combat, and stealth mechanics that allow to outsmart novice players (hide in bushes, set traps, etc).\n\nWhen the original Ultimate Ninja came out, I got excited thinking “this would be it” and while I loved those games, they never delivered what I was looking for. I know the hardcore fans of that series would argue otherwise, but I never found mashing O to be very deep, or gratifying. Games like For Honor and Absolver have also come close but no stealth, so not quite. \n\nIt wasn’t until I played God of War for the first time, last year, at a friends, that I got a glimpse of what could be. The combat in that game is incredible. It was the first time I played an action game where the combat buttons are on the triggers as opposed to the face buttons. I thought this was amazing. Since, I’ve noticed quite a number of games, in the last few years, have also gone this route. I bought AC Origins + Odyssey, and those games had similar mechanics to GoW, plus great stealth mechanics!\n\nThis March, Warzone debuted, I was in the midst of quarantine, and thought “fuck it, why not?”, and decided to download it. It was the first battle royale I ever played (I played one match of Fortnite, didn’t get and gave up). After my initial frustrations, once I learned the mechanics, I loved it. Gameplay wise, I think it’s the most respectable addition to the series, since the perk system (maybe zombies?). The tension that builds as the circle shrinks, really ramps up the moment to moment gameplay in such a satisfying way. \n\nAnd this was when it all clicked. What if a game combined the strengths of both games into one awesome, hand to hand combat battle royale. Like all battle royale’s a large number of players would be dropped onto a large map, with a gradually shrinking play area. The goal of course would be to loot in search of preferred weapons and cash. I like the buy station mechanic in Warzone, so that’d be included. Instead of shooting, players would engage in hand to hand combat (I guess the time to kill shouldn’t be too high, to mitigate third partying). Players would also be able to shoot bow and arrows and use additional equipment (bombs, stuns, traps, etc.) by pulling the left trigger. Stealth would be a major factor. Players could hide in bushes and climb trees like the AC series.\n\nI know Darwin’s Project dabbled with a similar idea, but that game was too cartoonish for my liking. I prefer more grounded, less over the top games. \n\nWhat do you guys think?"
kmoi3o,"Legends Rising (I would love to hear ideas to this, and questions too, so hit me if you have any of ither)","(sorry for reposting...just cut out the deeper explanations, feel free to ask)  \n\n\n**Base:** RTS style, base building with a twist: The characters, bildings, heroes, ideas, alliences and such, are all designed by the player who wants to play them.

Use the tools akin to what an easy use game creation engine would have, to allow the players to create their units, buildings, heroes, their abilities, be it whatever their hearts desire, set to a universal resources and currencies that can be found in a fully destructable (and yes, limited size, and fully depletable) world, that the players inhabit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game itself would play out at first like any Civilization or Command and Concour game, meaning resource collection, upgrading, and remaking....and most importantly, evolution.

kmlz9l,An open world /sandbox Warhammer 40K game based on Titanfall mechanics and the Defense of Ryza,"(Long read warning) I’ve had this idea for about a year or two now. A Warhammer game centered around the defense of Ryza using titanfall mechanics. I’d love to see if this could become an actual game. If this interests you, please feel free to reach out to me so we could talk through any possible problems or add ideas. \n\nYou would take the role of the Titan princep for either The Loyalist forces of the Imperium/Mechanicum or with Warmaster Horus and navigate the world, assisting in smaller scale battles between other titans or ground forces. You are able to choose freely to do as you wish so long as you complete a set of objectives that advance the battle and the story. This would not be turn based and could be set for either first or third person view. \n\nYour Titan arsenal could be changed at the start of each level based on what class your titan is (warhound, reaver, warlord, and warmonger to name a few) and it would fall on you to choose the best load out to deal with other titans, ground forces or siege weapons. Each class of titan would also fulfill a different mission depending on how that titan is best used. So choosing a warmonger titan for a scouting mission would be ill advised, although you’d most likely be safe. \n\nEach class of titan would have its own difficulty and you would have to learn how to use each titan as they would not handle, traverse or move in the same manner (bigger isn’t always better). \n\nI still have more to add but this post is already very long. I’d love feedback or advice from others. In all honesty, I’d love to really dedicate time to making my dream a reality but I have no idea on where to start and don’t have the know-how to do this."
kmljtm,"Legends Rising (not fully flashed out idea, some things ay not make sense, please ask and not judge first)","**Base:** RTS style, base building with a twist: The characters, bildings, heroes, ideas, alliences and such, are all designed by the player who wants to play them.

But it would also enable the players who don't realy have a knack for fighting, to still take up the game, making for the most reliably support player, who collects, who advances, who makes and provides, so as to support the border players of any alliance, or even to form neutral alliances with many diffrent factions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, to adress the last thing in my idea: \n\n\*^(1) Admins:\n\nThese people would be the ones who manange the game and oversee the addition or even the usage of any players' evolution, to make sure no one would go too far and ruin the game, by making blaitent and unrestraind changes. \n\nWhat i mean by this, is these people would prevent OP and Experience breaking people from evolving their units to deal a million damage each, with little upkeep cost to them, with these players being allowd to alter already existing, or newly evolved content a player made, but only if thay can reason with the player why thay did it, to give a sense of honesty to them, with being forced out of a game still being a possibility, if the playre dosen't know or care for it.\n\nAnd by Experience breaking i don't mean a player, who disigns all their equipment on stealing from others, as if those pieces are regulated by someone, thay can be fair, and if done well enough, even be counterd by good enough security based buildings and units/NPC's made SPECIFICALY for that job!\n\n\*^(2) Powerlevel:\n\nThis would be an estimate on any given player's active potential in a conflict. Meaning, if someone were to try and take up arms against that person, that score would show off their most effective state's barrier, i.e. the raw power of their resoures and their usage of them. (few stats shown, like Collected resource estimates (not exacts), a unit production, and the number of evolutions the player went throu tords any goal, be it pieceful, harmful or neutral)\n\nThis would allow for deception on some part, as if someone has a low combat score, but high production, some may think to rob them, only to realise, that that person is positioned in an area thay know and have prepared (i.e. home stead advantage) with defences thay can't compete with, ergo thay need to find a way past it, be it social or physical, head on or deceptive, with all the tools and ways someone may stand up against anyone, or try to side with them depend and come from a player themself. \n\nI would love to hear ideas to this, and questions too, so hit  me if you have any of ither."

klzcu6,Soul Zones V1.0 tl;dr warning,"# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nSoul Stories is an instance-based 3D pseudo-MMO Action game with strong RPG elements. It borrows gameplay elements from Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Spark the Electric Jester 2, Phantasy Star Online 2, Super Mario 3D Land and World, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Incredible Mandy, Monster Hunter, and Genshin Impact.\n\n## Graphic Design\n\nThe graphics tend to be bright, colorful, and stylized with a cell-shaded style. All characters have a design resembling a mix of MegaMan Battle Network’s Net Navis and Viruses, Pokemon, and Stands from Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure.\n\n## Audio Design\n\nMost of the OST features a mix of techno audio and instruments prominent in various other genres such as orchestra, rock, jazz, and country depending on the scenarios associated with it.\n\n## Monetization\n\nThe game will be either purchasable with Triple-A pricing possibly with DLC-priced addons or free with optional premium currency including an optional subscription for a periodic allowance of premium currency.\n\n# Story\n\n## Background Lore\n\nReality is divided into multiple layers with different types of beings inhabiting each. Beings that live in higher layers have greater knowledge and power, but have fates subject to the actions of beings in lower layers similar to how humans live, die, and decompose in accordance to things smaller than they can see. On the highest layer, beings have very few limits to what they can do, but the worlds they live in are created and destroyed in accordance to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the beings on the lower layers. You are the consciousness of a being that was too powerful to end after your body died, so it was able to sustain itself by transcending to the highest layer and saturate itself into a mass of ethereal energy to create an object called a Soul that is able to interact with the Worlds around it from within a body so as to combat the beings that seek to destroy all worlds.\n\n## Terminology\n\n## Zone\n\nA Zone is a world within the highest layer of reality. There are new ones being created all the time. Different Zones have specific environments and are divided into areas called Acts, along with a number of gimmicks specific to it.\n\n## Acts\n\nActs are essentially the levels of the game that each have their own specific task to complete. From the Player’s hub, they can be accessed to go to. After a sufficient number of Acts are cleared, the player can go to a free-roam area within the Zone that has many different collectables to find, random events that can offer rewards of some sort, and services that can be performed. Most Acts have optional Tasks and branching paths that can be completed for greater rewards, sometimes with greater difficulty. Most Acts have gimmicks with different mechanics specific to the Zone that can aid in traversing it or benefit the player in some other way. Some Acts have periodic Events which can affect most of the mechanics within it. Acts can also possess Hazards which can either Damage the player with different Attributes or with skill can be taken advantage of to damage enemies.\n\nGoal Acts simply involve getting to the end of the Act, often combatting enemies along the way.\n\nDungeon Acts feature many puzzles that must be completed to get to the goal, often with some actions in one area affecting the environment in the other.\n\nHunt Acts involve finding one or more hidden or hard to access things called Objectives within an open area, but usually there are ways to obtain hints for finding and accessing them.\n\nBoss Acts involve facing off with an exceptionally powerful enemy of some sort, which can sometimes only be made vulnerable with gimmicks across the arena.\n\nChallenge Acts are special acts that often come with rules or modifiers that make it harder somehow or require different skills.\n\nLimited Acts are special and only happen in cycles of real-world time. They offer unique rewards and challenges not found in others.\n\n## Morphs\n\nA Morph are beings on the highest layer born from a concept created by the beings on the lower layers. They will spend their existence living according to their instincts to follow a specific purpose or pattern of actions and react in a specific way to certain types of stimuli. Different types of Morphs live in different Zones and may help the player if assisted.\n\n## Hollows\n\nHollows are the main antagonists in the game. They are essentially beings that lack Souls and are driven purely by Willpower and are born from it when it “boils over” as a result of the feelings of beings in the lower layers becoming intensified. They are very hostile to the Zones and any beings they may find. If too many of them are within one Zone at one time, the Zone will be destroyed, so most beings make an effort to destroy them when they find them. They can come in an endless number of forms with more being discovered all the time, each with their own sets of physical and supernatural abilities. The intelligence of a Hollow tends to scale with its power, with stronger ones being able to command and organize weaker ones. There are rumours of Hollows intelligent enough to communicate with Souls that are able to command Hollows across multiple Zones.\n\n## Quirk\n\nQuirk constitutes the substance of the world. All Quirk is made of the same basic subatomic substance, but can exist in countless forms depending on how the substance is structured and can possess one or more of countless properties in the form it takes. How Quirk is structured largely depends on the Zone it comes from.\n\n## Willpower\n\nWillpower is the energy that drives all things in the Zones. It can be applied an endless number of ways and serves as the fuel source for all supernatural phenomena in the Zones.\n\n## Symbols\n\nSymbols are objects made of Quirk that are saturated with Willpower. They are used to create or improve things in the universe by the Souls inhabiting it. Different Zones will play host to different types of Symbols. Symbols can be found by clearing Acts, completing certain Tasks, hidden away at certain points, by defeating Hollows, or by interacting with certain things in certain ways.\n\n## Traces\n\nTraces are essentially smaller pieces of Quirk saturated with Willpower that serve as the currency of the game and are used as a fuel source by most beings. They can be found pretty much anywhere and are required to complete most actions involving creating or upgrading things.\n\n## Egos\n\nAn Ego is a body a Soul may inhabit. An Ego is born from a great deed that was able to affect the lives of countless other beings in dramatic ways. With a Soul animating it, it can produce Willpower to use a gallery of abilities at its disposal called Corpus. Each Ego also has a usable object that it can make appear or disappear at will called a Figment. Figments can be either a handheld tool or weapon, an extension of their body, an animate figure that it can control like a puppet, or some manner of trinket or apparatus that serves as the medium for a supernatural force.\n\n# Gameplay\n\n## Gameplay Overview\n\nUpon first arriving, the player is instructed to choose one of several Egos that offer different starting experiences that can all be obtained at a later point. Players will obtain more Egos after crafting them from Symbols and Traces. All Egos can be upgraded a Level upon using required Symbols and the necessary amount of Traces. An Ego's capabilities scale from their Level.\n\nAll Acts have Checkpoints that can be warped between. It serves as a point where the Player can Regenerate a new Ego in their Party at once their current Ego is Defeated after losing all its HP. If all Egos are Defeated, the Player gets a Game Over and is forced back to their Hub.\n\nPlayers can also join or create Multiplayer Rooms to cooperate with and/or compete against other Players. If an Act requires an Ego with a specific set of abilities or traits, it will suggest them. If the player does not have that Ego in their possession, they can use a Rental Ego for use in that Act.\n\n## Controls\n\n## Dualshock\n\nA: Jump, Aerial\n\nB: Interact, Variable Input\n\nY: Unique\n\nX: Corpus\n\nRB: Guard, Deflect\n\nRT: Attack\n\nLT: Dash, Run\n\nLB: Lock Target, Lock Hold\n\nControl Pad: Select Item/Party Member, Use Item/Switch Party Member\n\nLeft Stick: Movement\n\nLeft Stick Press: Toggle Look Mode\n\nRight Stick: Camera\n\nRight Stick Press: Sneak\n\nStart: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nSelect: Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n## Keyboard\n\nSpace: Jump, Aerial\n\nF: Corpus\n\nR: Interact, Variable Input.\n\nV: Unique\n\nR: Dash, Run\n\nLMB: Attack\n\nRMB: Guard, Deflect\n\nMMB: Lock Target, Hold Lock\n\nDirectional Inputs: Select Item, Use Item\n\nWASD: Movement\n\n1: Look Mode\n\nMouse: Camera\n\nTab: Sneak\n\nEsc: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nTab: Character Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n## Combat\n\n## Basics\n\nPlayers have two meters that tell for three vital resources Hit Points (HP) and Will Points (WP) When an Ego takes Damage from an enemy Attack or a Hazard, they lose HP relative to their Resistances and severity of the Damage. When a player’s current Ego runs out of HP they are forced to restart at their last used Save Point or switch to another Ego in the Party.\n\nEvery Ego has a Normal Attack activated by pressing the Attack Input and an Advanced Attack activated by holding the Attack Input which often comes with certain mechanics that can amplify damage in certain ways or under certain conditions. The player can destroy Hollows by Attacking them and reducing their HP to zero. In response to Hollow’s attacks, players can avoid them by Dashing by pressing the Dash input or Jumping by holding it and going in a certain direction. If a player is adept at reading the Hollow’s attacks, they can take advantage of their momentary Recovery periods between attacks to damage them without leaving them a chance to defend.\n\nPlayers can also Defend against Hollows’ attacks by holding the Guard input, which neutralizes all damage on contact but if the number or power of blocked attacks passes a certain threshold, it puts the player into the Staggered state. The Defense constantly regenerates, but once Staggered the player can’t Attack, Defend, use Active Corpus, for multiple frames depending on their Defense Regeneration By pressing the Guard input rather than holding it, they can Deflect an attack instead, which drains an opponent's Defense instead, however this only lasts for a brief moment and can easily lead to damage if the player misreads the Attack. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded against without a shield of some sort, but they can be Deflected. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded or Deflected regardless of the presence of a shield. Most non-cannon fodder Hollows will actively Guard between Attacks and uses of Corpus, so the player must be aggressive so as to put them into the Staggered state. Some Hollows and Egos regenerate their Defense at an accelerated rate, but when any character has low HP they enter a state called Pressed where their Defense regenerates at a greatly diminished rate.\n\nPlayers also have opportunities to do increased damage to foes called Critical Hits. Their first would be to attack their Weak Point (Ex head), their Blind Side (Ex back) and while they are unaware of their presence (asleep), usually facilitated by Sneaking. Each Ego has a Critical Stat which determines how much a Critical Hit multiplies the damage.\n\n## Corpus\n\nThe most effective way of Damaging foes and Defending against attacks would be to use Active Corpus. Even Active Corpus used by Egos with Very Low Active Corpus Damage tend to do slightly more Damage than an attack with a Very High Attack Damage stat. The use of Corpus requires the expenditure of WPs. WPs are counted as sections of the WP Bar, which fills as the player Attacks, Guards powerful Attacks, Deflects at the last moment, and Dashes and Jumps to avoid attacks at the last moment. Different Egos have different lengths of WP bars. Most attacks have some kind of attribute that are either Physical and Energy based and each character has different Resistances to each of them. Physical Attributes are Slash, Pierce, and Crush. Energy Attributes are Pyro, Cryo, EMag, Bio, Chem, Grav, Psi, and Ether.\n\nCorpus can take many different forms such as some manner of specialized Attack technique, some manner of physical projectiles, magic spell-like Force projections, the creation of a Construct, a temporary Buff or positive Effect, self-healing, an Attack that bestows a Status Ailment, Debuff or Negative Effect of some sort, Attacks that do increased Damage once certain conditions are fulfilled, something that affects the whole Act, or something that isn’t always related to combat like an action that assists in traversing the environment.\n\n## Possible Advanced Attacks\n\nA few examples of Advanced Attacks include thrust attacks which can't be blocked or always deflected unless the target is using a form of shield, flailing attacks which can deal damage regardless of how the target attempts to block or deflect them and can sometimes temporarily disable foes' attacks, sweeping attacks which can damage groups of foes, low attacks that can only be avoided through aerial maneuvers such as jumping, ranged or projectile attacks which can harm foes from an extended distance, charge attacks where the character can quickly cover the distance to a foe, rush attacks which start combos that strike quicker in succession than the normal attack, burst attacks which strike multiple times in rapid succession, heavy attacks which do chip damage even if the attack itself is blocked or parried, and grab attacks which can't be blocked or deflected and can even launch foes into hazards or other foes for further damage.\n\n## Items\n\nItems are actively used objects that serve many purposes including healing damage or restoring critical resources. Some items can be stacked but in turn are consumable. Some items have multiple uses but must be recharged between Acts, and some have unlimited uses but are only useful in very specific situations. Different Egos have more or less slots for Items and the player can decide which ones in the party can get them between Acts.\n\n## Artifacts\n\nArtifacts act as the equipment in the game, boosting an Ego’s stats and endowing them with passive effects. Some Egos can equip more at once than others. Some dramatically increase some stats but endow a negative effect of some sort. Some endow very useful passive effects but “break” and disappear under the right conditions.\n\n# Specific Egos\n\nNote: Each Ego can have its color pallets freely swapped by the player and may have optional skins which change its model.\n\n## Morthir\n\n## Profile\n\nA tall Ego resembling a suit of plate armor with a cape.

klytfy,Soul Zone Stories v1.0 tl;dr warning,"# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nSoul Stories is an instance-based 3D pseudo-MMO Action game with strong RPG elements. It borrows gameplay elements from Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Spark the Electric Jester 2, Phantasy Star Online 2, Super Mario 3D Land and World, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Incredible Mandy, Monster Hunter, and Genshin Impact.\n\n## Graphic Design\n\nThe graphics tend to be bright, colorful, and stylized with a cell-shaded style. All characters have a design resembling a mix of MegaMan Battle Network’s Net Navis and Viruses, Pokemon, and Stands from Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure.\n\n## Audio Design\n\nMost of the OST features a mix of techno audio and instruments prominent in various other genres such as orchestra, rock, jazz, and country depending on the scenarios associated with it.\n\n## Monetization\n\nThe game will be either purchasable with Triple-A pricing possibly with DLC-priced addons or free with optional premium currency including an optional subscription for a periodic allowance of premium currency.\n\n# Story\n\n## Background Lore\n\nReality is divided into multiple layers with different types of beings inhabiting each. Beings that live in higher layers have greater knowledge and power, but have fates subject to the actions of beings in lower layers similar to how humans live, die, and decompose in accordance to things smaller than they can see. On the highest layer, beings have very few limits to what they can do, but the worlds they live in are created and destroyed in accordance to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the beings on the lower layers. You are the consciousness of a being that was too powerful to end after your body died, so it was able to sustain itself by transcending to the highest layer and saturate itself into a mass of ethereal energy to create an object called a Soul that is able to interact with the Worlds around it from within a body so as to combat the beings that seek to destroy all worlds.\n\n## Terminology\n\n### Zone\n\nA Zone is a world within the highest layer of reality. There are new ones being created all the time. Different Zones have specific environments and are divided into areas called Acts, along with a number of gimmicks specific to it.\n\n### Acts\n\nActs are essentially the levels of the game that each have their own specific task to complete. From the Player’s hub, they can be accessed to go to. After a sufficient number of Acts are cleared, the player can go to a free-roam area within the Zone that has many different collectables to find, random events that can offer rewards of some sort, and services that can be performed. Most Acts have optional Tasks and branching paths that can be completed for greater rewards, sometimes with greater difficulty. Most Acts have gimmicks with different mechanics specific to the Zone that can aid in traversing it or benefit the player in some other way. Some Acts have periodic Events which can affect most of the mechanics within it. Acts can also possess Hazards which can either Damage the player with different Attributes or with skill can be taken advantage of to damage enemies.\n\nGoal Acts simply involve getting to the end of the Act, often combatting enemies along the way.\n\nDungeon Acts feature many puzzles that must be completed to get to the goal, often with some actions in one area affecting the environment in the other.\n\nHunt Acts involve finding one or more hidden or hard to access things called Objectives within an open area, but usually there are ways to obtain hints for finding and accessing them.\n\nBoss Acts involve facing off with an exceptionally powerful enemy of some sort, which can sometimes only be made vulnerable with gimmicks across the arena.\n\nChallenge Acts are special acts that often come with rules or modifiers that make it harder somehow or require different skills.\n\nLimited Acts are special and only happen in cycles of real-world time. They offer unique rewards and challenges not found in others.\n\n### Morphs\n\nA Morph are beings on the highest layer born from a concept created by the beings on the lower layers. They will spend their existence living according to their instincts to follow a specific purpose or pattern of actions and react in a specific way to certain types of stimuli. Different types of Morphs live in different Zones and may help the player if assisted.\n\n### Hollows\n\nHollows are the main antagonists in the game. They are essentially beings that lack Souls and are driven purely by Willpower and are born from it when it “boils over” as a result of the feelings of beings in the lower layers becoming intensified. They are very hostile to the Zones and any beings they may find. If too many of them are within one Zone at one time, the Zone will be destroyed, so most beings make an effort to destroy them when they find them. They can come in an endless number of forms with more being discovered all the time, each with their own sets of physical and supernatural abilities. The intelligence of a Hollow tends to scale with its power, with stronger ones being able to command and organize weaker ones. There are rumours of Hollows intelligent enough to communicate with Souls that are able to command Hollows across multiple Zones.\n\n### Quirk\n\nQuirk constitutes the substance of the world. All Quirk is made of the same basic subatomic substance, but can exist in countless forms depending on how the substance is structured and can possess one or more of countless properties in the form it takes. How Quirk is structured largely depends on the Zone it comes from.\n\n### Willpower\n\nWillpower is the energy that drives all things in the Zones. It can be applied an endless number of ways and serves as the fuel source for all supernatural phenomena in the Zones.\n\n### Symbols\n\nSymbols are objects made of Quirk that are saturated with Willpower. They are used to create or improve things in the universe by the Souls inhabiting it. Different Zones will play host to different types of Symbols. Symbols can be found by clearing Acts, completing certain Tasks, hidden away at certain points, by defeating Hollows, or by interacting with certain things in certain ways.\n\n### Traces\n\nTraces are essentially smaller pieces of Quirk saturated with Willpower that serve as the currency of the game and are used as a fuel source by most beings. They can be found pretty much anywhere and are required to complete most actions involving creating or upgrading things.\n\n### Egos\n\nAn Ego is a body a Soul may inhabit. An Ego is born from a great deed that was able to affect the lives of countless other beings in dramatic ways. With a Soul animating it, it can produce Willpower to use a gallery of abilities at its disposal called Corpus. Each Ego also has a usable object that it can make appear or disappear at will called a Figment. Figments can be either a handheld tool or weapon, an extension of their body, an animate figure that it can control like a puppet, or some manner of trinket or apparatus that serves as the medium for a supernatural force.\n\n# Gameplay\n\n## Gameplay Overview\n\nUpon first arriving, the player is instructed to choose one of several Egos that offer different starting experiences that can all be obtained at a later point. Players will obtain more Egos after crafting them from Symbols and Traces. All Egos can be upgraded a Level upon using required Symbols and the necessary amount of Traces. An Ego's capabilities scale from their Level.\n\nAll Acts have Checkpoints that can be warped between. It serves as a point where the Player can Regenerate a new Ego in their Party at once their current Ego is Defeated after losing all its HP. If all Egos are Defeated, the Player gets a Game Over and is forced back to their Hub.\n\nPlayers can also join or create Multiplayer Rooms to cooperate with and/or compete against other Players. If an Act requires an Ego with a specific set of abilities or traits, it will suggest them. If the player does not have that Ego in their possession, they can use a Rental Ego for use in that Act.\n\n## Controls\n\n### Dualshock\n\nA: Jump, Aerial\n\nB: Interact, Variable Input\n\nY: Unique\n\nX: Corpus\n\nRB: Guard, Deflect\n\nRT: Attack\n\nLT: Dash, Run\n\nLB: Lock Target, Lock Hold\n\nControl Pad: Select Item/Party Member, Use Item/Switch Party Member\n\nLeft Stick: Movement\n\nLeft Stick Press: Toggle Look Mode\n\nRight Stick: Camera\n\nRight Stick Press: Sneak\n\nStart: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nSelect: Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n### Keyboard\n\nSpace: Jump, Aerial\n\nF: Corpus\n\nR: Interact, Variable Input.\n\nV: Unique\n\nR: Dash, Run\n\nLMB: Attack\n\nRMB: Guard, Deflect\n\nMMB: Lock Target, Hold Lock\n\nDirectional Inputs: Select Item, Use Item\n\nWASD: Movement\n\n1: Look Mode\n\nMouse: Camera\n\nTab: Sneak\n\nEsc: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nTab: Character Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n## Combat\n\n### Basics\n\nPlayers have two meters that tell for three vital resources Hit Points (HP) and Will Points (WP) When an Ego takes Damage from an enemy Attack or a Hazard, they lose HP relative to their Resistances and severity of the Damage. When a player’s current Ego runs out of HP they are forced to restart at their last used Save Point or switch to another Ego in the Party.\n\nEvery Ego has a Normal Attack activated by pressing the Attack Input and an Advanced Attack activated by holding the Attack Input which often comes with certain mechanics that can amplify damage in certain ways or under certain conditions. The player can destroy Hollows by Attacking them and reducing their HP to zero. In response to Hollow’s attacks, players can avoid them by Dashing by pressing the Dash input or Jumping by holding it and going in a certain direction. If a player is adept at reading the Hollow’s attacks, they can take advantage of their momentary Recovery periods between attacks to damage them without leaving them a chance to defend.\n\nPlayers can also Defend against Hollows’ attacks by holding the Guard input, which neutralizes all damage on contact but if the number or power of blocked attacks passes a certain threshold, it puts the player into the Staggered state. The Defense constantly regenerates, but once Staggered the player can’t Attack, Defend, use Active Corpus, for multiple frames depending on their Defense Regeneration By pressing the Guard input rather than holding it, they can Deflect an attack instead, which drains an opponent's Defense instead, however this only lasts for a brief moment and can easily lead to damage if the player misreads the Attack. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded against without a shield of some sort, but they can be Deflected. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded or Deflected regardless of the presence of a shield. Most non-cannon fodder Hollows will actively Guard between Attacks and uses of Corpus, so the player must be aggressive so as to put them into the Staggered state. Some Hollows and Egos regenerate their Defense at an accelerated rate, but when any character has low HP they enter a state called Pressed where their Defense regenerates at a greatly diminished rate.\n\nPlayers also have opportunities to do increased damage to foes called Critical Hits. Their first would be to attack their Weak Point (Ex head), their Blind Side (Ex back) and while they are unaware of their presence (asleep), usually facilitated by Sneaking. Each Ego has a Critical Stat which determines how much a Critical Hit multiplies the damage.\n\n### Corpus\n\nThe most effective way of Damaging foes and Defending against attacks would be to use Active Corpus. Even Active Corpus used by Egos with Very Low Active Corpus Damage tend to do slightly more Damage than an attack with a Very High Attack Damage stat. The use of Corpus requires the expenditure of WPs. WPs are counted as sections of the WP Bar, which fills as the player Attacks, Guards powerful Attacks, Deflects at the last moment, and Dashes and Jumps to avoid attacks at the last moment. Different Egos have different lengths of WP bars. Most attacks have some kind of attribute that are either Physical and Energy based and each character has different Resistances to each of them. Physical Attributes are Slash, Pierce, and Crush. Energy Attributes are Pyro, Cryo, EMag, Bio, Chem, Grav, Psi, and Ether.\n\nCorpus can take many different forms such as some manner of specialized Attack technique, some manner of physical projectiles, magic spell-like Force projections, the creation of a Construct, a temporary Buff or positive Effect, self-healing, an Attack that bestows a Status Ailment, Debuff or Negative Effect of some sort, Attacks that do increased Damage once certain conditions are fulfilled, something that affects the whole Act, or something that isn’t always related to combat like an action that assists in traversing the environment.\n\n### Possible Advanced Attacks\n\nA few examples of Advanced Attacks include thrust attacks which can't be blocked or always deflected unless the target is using a form of shield, flailing attacks which can deal damage regardless of how the target attempts to block or deflect them and can sometimes temporarily disable foes' attacks, sweeping attacks which can damage groups of foes, low attacks that can only be avoided through aerial maneuvers such as jumping, ranged or projectile attacks which can harm foes from an extended distance, charge attacks where the character can quickly cover the distance to a foe, rush attacks which start combos that strike quicker in succession than the normal attack, burst attacks which strike multiple times in rapid succession, heavy attacks which do chip damage even if the attack itself is blocked or parried, and grab attacks which can't be blocked or deflected and can even launch foes into hazards or other foes for further damage.\n\n## Items\n\nItems are actively used objects that serve many purposes including healing damage or restoring critical resources. Some items can be stacked but in turn are consumable. Some items have multiple uses but must be recharged between Acts, and some have unlimited uses but are only useful in very specific situations. Different Egos have more or less slots for Items and the player can decide which ones in the party can get them between Acts.\n\n## Artifacts\n\nArtifacts act as the equipment in the game, boosting an Ego’s stats and endowing them with passive effects. Some Egos can equip more at once than others. Some dramatically increase some stats but endow a negative effect of some sort. Some endow very useful passive effects but “break” and disappear under the right conditions.\n\n# Specific Egos\n\nNote: Each Ego can have its color pallets freely swapped by the player and may have optional skins which change its model.\n\n## Morthir\n\n### Profile\n\nA tall Ego resembling a suit of plate armor with a cape.

klve8q,To Hell And Back,"I would really love if there was First Person Game in which you are the Son/Daughter of a God and in order to stop Hades from killing all the other gods. You as your character have to travel all over the world learning about The Gods and The Titans (Cronus and his Siblings and Parents) to then gain your God Powers since you haven’t discovered them yet. Over the game time you will discover many allies and befriend lots of people whilst fighting many Enemies and Foes on your way to Hades. After confronting Hades, he corrupts the world with darkness and you have to fight him."

I would love a game where you different places and secrets and artifacts. Like a treasure hunter type of game or Indiana Jones. It would be so cool to find and learn about these made of civilizations.
kloxyu,Infinite magazine size which effects damage and reload time,"This is a mechanic for a non-serious FPS game. You can shoot as many bullets without reloading as you like, but the catch is that damage goes down slightly over time (which insentivises reloading) and the longer you shoot for, the longer the reload takes. This would obviously need some tweaking but that's the basic idea."

klgin8,"You're the death, grim reaper","You are the grim reaper. The one who is bringing dead souls to the afterlife. \nYou must pick conversation options to calm the dead and make them go through the 5 stages of grief. You listen to their stories and maybe visit their past in memories. Souls can refuse transportation. Then you can either give them up and collect them some other time, or leave them forever, or force them.\nWhy would you force them? Because dead relatives want to see them again in the ""afterdeath"" a place where all dead souls come after they die. From there it goes further to different options: heaven, hell, purgatory,  rebirth, valhalla and everything else. All exists to make the souls comfortable.\nYou must choose who to support. If you anger the long dead, they will do bad changes. If you anger the fresh dead, they will make a scene. You must determine what is best for the afterdeath. What you do will determine the way the afterdeath is going to be. Chaos? Special traditions of the afterdeath? New patterns of behaviour? Everything will be the same?\n\nYou must determine what the dead person truly wants. They might think they want something. But in reality you know they would much rather do something else or it may be better. Sure, you can lie. But that might not work. This might anger them.\nThe souls are mostly human. Some animals have strong souls and that's why you have to deal with them. (There's a grim reaper for animals, humans are too different tho.)\nYour ultimate goal is to keep the afterdeath nice and friendly. Your second goal is to have the souls calm and ready for transport. \nYour third goal is to have the old souls happy.\nThe least important goal is to be rather quick. It takes time tho. But spend too Much time on a soul and you have too much work, which means that you need much time.... the time limit per soul is very generous.\nI was thinking about a 2d pixelated style. You can decorate your reaper."
klg5mj,Looking for some new ideas!,"I've recently been kind of out of ideas, and due to this I've been way less motivated on doing anything at all. I'm looking for some new ideas, literally anything. If it sounds stupid? Who cares, whacky games can be really fun. Any ideas at all! Thanks for your time and support!"
kled9w,Breath of the Wild meets StarDew Valley meets The Edge Chronicles,"TL;DR- Sort of Skyward StarDew Valley/Breath of the Wild thing that focuses on taming and utilizing animal’s to maximize your production and upgrade to the highest quality homestead you can, while also building relationships and renown. \n\nBasically take all the exploring and atmosphere from Breath of the Wild and put it into game that’s more about managing your property, taking part in the game world’s economy and creating relationships with the inhabitants.\n\nHere’s an example of how I would build it.\n\nThe world is incredibly vertical, homesteads, towns, even the Capitol City are all perched atop large mesa’s and carved into cliff sides. They all build above the cloud line as there is something sinister about the haze.\n\nEveryone travels by magical sky ships that resemble sea vessels with some aerodynamic flare to them. You can purchase either entire ships, or their blueprints and build them yourself. Bigger ships are slower, but can take more hits and hold more crew to assist you, smaller ones can’t carry as much but pirates will have a hard time catching you.\n\nMonsters inhabit the ground level, claiming a majority of of the land for themselves. People only venture down to scavenge from the ruins of the old world and to gather up materials for crafting things. \n\nYou play as the typical, I’ve inherited this old run down farm out in the middle of nowhere protagonist. Maybe you just crash land who knows.  The Mesa you start on is relatively small, the aim being to earn enough to buy new bigger plots around the map.\n\nInstead of the focus being on farming, this games focus would be on animal husbandry. The animals are incredibly violent below the clouds, but when raised above them they’re perfectly happy and willing to assist you with gaining access to more and more valuable materials. Some animals produce them, others have abilities that aid you in gathering or tending to crops and that kind of thing.\n\nExamples:\n\nA Giant Cow slug creature who’s slime trails can be scooped up and turned into fuel, or even cooked into food.\n\nA giant gecko like creature that allows you to quickly access resources at the base of your Mesa without having to waste fuel for your airship.\n\nA flying mount that can be called should you fall and have to glide your way to the ground level.\n\nAn amphibious creature that periodically sprays nutrient rich water everywhere, feeding any plants nearby.\n\nSmall dexterous creatures that will gather crops and things marked for sale and put them into the trade box while you’re away.\n\nThe gameplay loop  is essentially take your airship down below, gather materials for crafting, some treasure if you can, and more importantly try and sneak away an egg from a nest, as that is the only way you can domesticate them. You’ll need to incubate it and then raise it to adulthood when it hatches. Only adults have the abilities and skills that will help you as you progress. \n\nOnce you’ve gathered a decent stockpile you can stick it all in your trade-box to be picked up and sold. The game basically works more like stardew valley than Breath of the Wild. There’s no epic story to take part, there’s no big bad to face. It’s just living in this world, making friends, creating a family, raising animals and maybe fighting a monster or two. There’s a calendar and seasons and different seasons will affect the biomes in different ways. \n\nI think a fun spin you could take with it is having to fend off sky pirates. Basically any time you send items through the trade box, there is a chance the delivery gets robbed and you lose all that supply. So you can opt out of that and just fly the items you want to sell to the nearest vendor yourself. Different vendors will offer better prices depending on their specialty and also the time of year. You can still be attacked but it’s much less likely and hiring crew for you ship will make the fight much easier. \n\nAnyway that’s just an idea I had while playing a Star Dew Valley-ish game. I just felt like man it would really be improved if you had some of the exploratory gameplay elements from Breath of the Wild, like climbing and gliding, as well as having an expansive map to explore. Plus I’m always down for some sky boats and magical monster shit."

Anyways, let me know your thoughts.\n\n\n\nPremise\n\nYou are the leader of a organization pitted against a rival political group in a game where resource management, public relations, and strategic prowess will be your main weapons. In gameplay combining real-time strategy, brawler-based combat, and RPG elements, your faction will have to manage your image to the public, avoid apprehension by the police, and successfully disrupt rival protests and demonstrations while masterfully executing some of your own. In times such as these, it is easy for things to descend into chaos but in a battle of ideologies, only one can emerge victorious. Will you come down hard on your opponents with propaganda, general hooliganism, or blunt objects? Draw up a battle plan and take the streets in the ultimate battle of wits between the dim-witted!\n\nOverview\n\nThe game is broken up into 6 demonstrations; 3 organized by your faction, 3 by your opponent. Your goal is to successfully defend or disrupt demonstrations using whatever tactics your choose. Your success is measured by three factors; mission success, public opinion, and police indifference. Mission success refers to how successful your faction was in disrupting or defending a demonstration; factors include propaganda put up or destroyed, how many civilians joined your cause, financial and physical damage caused to the rival faction, and the duration of the demonstration. Public opinion refers to your reputation in the community; factors include positive/negative interactions, illegal acts committed in public, and depiction in media sources. Police indifference refers to the response by police; factors include arrests of rival or affiliated members, damages to the public, and violence committed against police. At the end of each skirmish, points in each area will be averaged and at the end of the 6 demonstrations, a winner will be declared, which is determined by highest average score.\n\nFactions\n\nYou are the leader of a customizable political faction designed to oppose the agenda of the rival faction. You can choose your own name for the group, write a bio/description, cosmetically customize every individual member, and select the political stance of your group on a variety of topics. Your responses will give your group various boosts or penalties in various areas. The rival group will have ideologies randomly generated to generally contrast yours.\n\nTopics:\n\nAbortion\nLGBT Adoption Rights\nReproductive Health Funding\nGay Marriage\nSexual Assault Response\nGender Identity\nReligious Freedom\nWomen in the Military\nWorkplace Diversity\nCapital Punishment\nConfederate Monuments\nSafe Spaces\nMedically Assisted Suicide\nFirst Amendment \nBorder Policy\nTreatment of Illegal Immigrants\nImmigration Ban\nDeportation\nAssimilation of Migrants\nSanctuary Cities\nDual Citizenship\nCitizenship Requirements\nGun Control\nArmed Teachers\nReligion-based Surveillance\nCongressional Term Limits\nGerrymandering\nDrug Policy\nSocial Media Regulation\nData Protection\nDomestic Surveillance\nGun Liability\nNet Neutrality\nFlag Burning\nEminent Domain\nWhistleblower Protection\nSocial Security\nSingle Payer Healthcare\nDrug Price Regulation\nMental Illness\nRecreational Drug Use\nMedicaid\nEqual Pay\nWelfare Drug Testing\nTax Rates\nPaid Sick Leave\nMinimum Wage\nCorporate Tax\nWelfare Requirements\nGovernment Spending\nLabor Unions\nTariffs\nJob Outsourcing\nEstate Tax\nFarming Subsidies\nProperty Tax\nGovernment Pensions\nBanking Reform\nCryptocurrencies \nClimate Change\nAlternative Energy\nOff-shore Drilling\nPlastic Product Ban\nCampaign Finance\nForeign Lobbying\nRepublican Democracy\nVoter Freud\nCandidate Transparency\nMinimum Voting Age\nCriminal Politicians\nVoting Rights of Criminals\nDaft\nMandatory Military Service\nTorture\nRefugee Requirements\nTerrorist Rights\nForeign Aid\nForeign Military Intervention\nMilitary Spending\nGMO Labels\nMandatory Vaccinations\nPolice Body Cameras\nSolitary Confinement\nPolice Brutality\nPolice Discrimination\nDrug Penalties\nPrison Overcrowding\nPrison Reform\nStudent Loans\nCharter Schools\nPublic Transportation\nGender Equality\nRacial Equality\nDisaster Preparedness\nGovernment Accountability\nAnti-Fascism\nFake News\nViolence in the Media\nProtester Rights\nSquatters Rights\nProtection of the Homeless\nCollege or Trade Preparedness\nSecular Government\nDomestic Terrorism\nVeteran Services\nPolitical Prisoners\nDrug Treatment\nEthical Treatment of Animals\n\nYour faction leader has 5 skills that will determine their effectiveness in the following areas;\n\nInfluence; effects the ability to sway opinion\nCharisma; effects the ability to recruit new members\nResourcefulness; effects the ability to earn experience\nResponsibility; effects the ability to earn money\nElusiveness; effects the ability to evade police\n\nEach of these skills are on a 10 point scale, 5 being average, with no boosts or penalties.\n\nYour faction will have members to assist you in various aspects of the game. Some roles have great impact when preparing for an upcoming demonstration, some during the demonstration itself, and/or during both.\n\nBefore a demonstration, there are various activities you can engage divided into three categories. Category one is intelligence activities that serve to provide you with information about the next demonstration that can help your prepare. Valuable information include basic map layouts, police presence, media and civilian turnout, opposition numbers/roles, and potential for riots. The information gathered has a varying range of accuracy depending on the skill level of members tasked with intelligence activities. Category two is community activities that serve to either generate money for the demonstration or effect public opinion. This can effect public support, police turnout, media awareness, and earn money which can be used to purchase gear, demonstration tools, bribe police, or pay bail. Category three is preparation activities that finalize your demonstration roster, members gear, and allows you to spend XP on members to grant skill increases.\n\nDemonstrations are broken up into two parts. Part one is preparation mode. Depending on what roles you have to your disposal, certain things can be done to ensure success of the event. This gives you the opportunity to explore the map, examine police presence, make an impression on the media, and sabotage the opposition. During this time, you can either control the individual units directly or control groups overhead with limited control. Some actions require direct control of characters and some require overhead squad control. Part two is the actual demonstration itself. During this time, you can control individual members or squads to carry out a variety of tasks. You can vandalize property, put up propaganda posters, record events on camera, assault opposing members/police, distract police, disrupts demonstrators, fend of attackers, and cause a riot. A riot occurs when a “hype” meter is filled to full capacity. When a riot occurs, rival and friendly faction members have difficulty following orders, police arrest faction members indiscriminately, civilians join in on the action, general lawlessness ensues, and the demonstration ends once the crowd is dispersed. Your actions during the demonstration determine your overall event score.\n\nDuring gameplay, each member has 6 things keep track of; health, stamina, wanted level, visibility, spirit, and special. Health shows the health of the unit. When health is at 10%, the unit is incapacitated, rendering them useless until the are healed by a medic, apprehended by police, or fatally wounded. Stamina will drain over time while doing strenuous activity. If it reaches 0%, they are rendered incapacitated until stamina is recovered to 90%. Wanted level determines if police are actively searching for the unit or not. Visibility determines how many people are watching what the unit is doing. Spirit is a bar that indicates how enthusiastic they are about the mission. If the bar is full, they will resist arrest from police and follow orders better. The special bar allows for the units to execute special abilities."

kl7rfk,Team based fish game,"I was thinking of a team based attack game (similar to ow, maybe 5-6 person teams) where the ""heroes"" you use are different aquatic creatures. And maps are of course underwater, movement is swimming. \n\nI like the idea of classes, tank, damage, healing, etc. I think the roster size has some pretty great potential since there's a lot of shit in the ocean.\n\nThe most challenging part in my head would be making movement that isn't frustrating and allows you to easily play the objective or get kills or whatever playstyle you go with."
kl6re2,A Medieval version of Doom,"Feel free to use this idea:  This would be a Medieval 1st person shooter.  The mechanics should be very similar to Doom.\n\nStory: The game is set close to the end of the second Crusade in 1149.  The Church knew that it was going badly.  A desperate and angry bishop attempted to make a deal with demons to secure victory, and opened up a portal to Hell. The demons promised to unleash their fury on the Church’s Muslim enemies.  This was technically true, but in their conversations with the bishop, they left out the part about killing everyone else on Earth too.  As soon as the portal opened, demons poured out and started slaughtering everyone. The dead were transformed into zombies, and numerous cities became havens for undead and demons.\n\nThe protagonist:  You play the role of a city guard trained in the crossbow. You just completed your basic training, and are essentially some nobody that gets caught in the middle of this. You live in one of the villages that was slaughtered and reanimated.  Starting the game surrounded by your neighbors that are now undead monsters trying to kill you, you must fight to survive.  It’s up to you to fight your way through the Hellspawn horde, gradually figure out what happened, and defeat the demon lord Orcus and destroy the portal.\n\nPart 1: The Necropolis.  The first part of the game takes place above ground.  You must venture through numerous stages. Each stage is a village or city that has been destroyed and corrupted. You primarily fight with zombies and weaker demons.\n\nPart 2:  The Catacombs.  This part of the game is underground. The enemies are substantially harder.  Here, you battle liches, skeletal knights, and more powerful demons. At the end of Part 2, you must battle the bishop, who is now fully corrupted and loyal to the Devil.  From there, you take the portal to Abaddon.\n\nPart 3: Abaddon.  This is the region of Hell where the demon lord Orcus resides.  His intention is to build an undead army to conquer the Earth.  From here on, the enemies are difficult.  Once Orcus is defeated, you must destroy the portal and escape. \n\nWeapon: Your weapon would be a crossbow.  This would not change throughout the game. Crossbows fire bolts, and different types of bolts would have different effects. You’d start with standard bolts, but you’d also find rapid-fire bolts, explosive bolts, poisoned bolts, fire and ice bolts, holy bolts, etc.  Ammo would be found throughout the game much like in Doom.  When you run out of ammo, you have a dagger.\n\nManeuverability: The game allows 3-D motion.  A computer mouse should be used to aim, and the arrow keys are for moving in different directions.  For game systems with controllers, one stick should be for aiming and one for moving.  You can also jump, crouch, and run (which depletes stamina).\n\nHealth: 100% is full health, and you die when your health reaches 0%. If you die, then you must begin at the beginning of that stage.  Healing potions can be found throughout the game, which recover health.\n\nArmor:  You start with your clothes.  Later in the game, you can find leather armor, which reduces damage by 10%. Further in the game, you find copper armor, which reduces damage by 20%, and then iron armor (30%) and divine armor (40%). You’ll need those armor improvements, since enemies get harder and inflict more damage as the game progresses."

kkzzp1,Game that can be played for money,"So this is a concept that can be applied to most online video games first you would need to create a economy and through that economy prices of items could fluctuate depending on the worth of the coin ,the coin is like bit coin as in it rises in worth the less of it there is available. You would get the coin via trades monsters etc but you would get less of the coin depending on the worth. It would have a inbuilt trading and selling system where you could sell the coins(you would have to wait for a buyer so as not to lose the dev money) thus creating a money-making game that doesn’t scam you. Obviously you could as to make more money add dlcs that add more powerful items and the people that get the dlc can then sell those items to the normal players.you could also make it really expensive."

kkwl2d,a game set in a cyberpunk mega building with Metroidvania level design/rogue-like.,"It can be the setting for any game type really. But the best fitting ones could be either a rogue-like or an immersive sim.\n\nI came up with this while brainstorming my own game's outline. The goal for the setting was that it is small enough but also interesting enough to explore and would make sense lore-wise(Also justifies some level of repetitiveness in level design).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo those who are unfamiliar with the term, A ""mega building"" is a concept inspired by the now-demolished 九龍寨城 (Kowloon Walled City) in HongKong, that a giant building would house tens of thousands of people and provides them with all they ever need from birth to death, all in one place. Like in the building you would find restaurants, gyms, dentists, nail salons, even warehouses and funeral homes. Due to the size of the building, the environment may changes drastically as you go up or down. It may even have ""rough neighbourhoods"" and multiple community centres etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are featured, somewhat, in Cyberpunk2077. But it just feels like going into a condo building.  The concept itself however, can easily be its own game."
kkweo3,A Post-apocalyptic survival game where you play as a reactivated robot who is dead set on finding it's creator.,"You would play as a robot who was put to sleep right before the end of the world. When you eventually wake up, the world is a ruined dystopia with only small factions of humanity. You don't remember much but you have a longing to be reunited with your creator/master. You know your master has a microchip that can be tracked with advanced enough technology. A beacon of hope per se. You set out into the new world hoping for that one reunion.\n\nInstead of having to keep track of regular human conditions, you are a robot that needs Power (Sleep), Gasoline and Oil (Hunger and Thirst), and to take care of your Chassis (Health). Instead of sleeping at a bed, you recharge at a power station, you require gas and oil for functioning, and taking damage will slowly debuff you requiring to repair yourself to get back to normal. \n\nYou can craft tools and weapons, but you will be using most resources to make modifications to your robotic body. Ranging from arm laser blasters, to decreased oil and gas consumption, to night vision, to even robotic allies!\n\nThe world you are put into is like a post apocalyptic cyberpunk society, full of advanced technology but also ruin and decay, dead robots and a dying humanity.  You will run into some humans, but only a handful of them who aren't in a faction will be friendly.\n\nHave any questions, ideas, or feedback?"
kkv50f,Idea for a Football Card Game,"In the past, there is was a game called Toon Cup Superstars, I know the rule ""**Please do not post blatant copies of already existing games.**"" but since that game no longer exist, I don't see why not make a game that **only** has the same mechanics as this game.\n\nIt's very simple, the match begin with both soccer players in the middle of the field, you have 4 cards in your hand, as well your opponent, both of you can play a card to advance a specific number of steps with more steps more close to the goal you are, and the more closer you are to the goal, higher is your chance to make a score, there is also specials cards; cards that show your opponent's hand, a card that make you and your opponent go to the middle of the field and then you try to make a score to the goal, when your are in the opponent's field, you automatically try to make a score to the goal, but if the opponent is in your field they also will automatically try to make a score. And the cards can be upgraded to the maximum of 3 levels, but you can't upgrade specials cards, when you upgrade a card, it increased the number of steps you can make when you play that card, unfortunately, I don't remember how do you upgrade cards (it is with money, or repeated cards?)\n\nI wish I could explain more about that game, but it's been so long the last time I played that game, so I don't remember the game at all, I also tried to put here some screenshots from that game but r/gameideas don't allow me, so instead I'll leave a link to more information about [Toon Cup Superstars](https://theamazingworldofgumball.fandom.com/wiki/Toon_Cup:_Superstars)\n\n Sorry my english btw :)"
kkunth,50 players 0 informations,"50 players are put into a map, 25 each in a team.  The catch is you can’t tell who is on your team and have to figure it out using proximity chat.  Friendly fire is on and the last team standing wins.  There is no indication what the teams are and you can lie to backstab enemies or group up with your “teammates.”"
kku7h6,DISCORD/3D WORLD?,"Imagine a discord update/service (nitro exclusive for example idk) where every server has their own 'room' or 'world' similar to the likes of Second Life or Playstation Home. Members of the server can join (or if some members want to remain in discord chat, thats not a problem too) and customise their avatar and such. In the world of micro transactions, profitability wouldn't be a problem with virtual clothing items etc the user can have. Companies can have ads in certain places for certain promotions etc too. In the height of Discord's relevance with millions and millions of users, with Jason's background with game development and the possible connections that he has, I think it would really take off or even spark something in the creative team. Additionally, as the future of gaming is looking more and more into VR support, VR would be available but not a necessity for the service. Of course this is just an idea but I really think it would be a big step ahead for Discord in terms of social interaction."

kh4431,Typing based MMORPG,Games like Nitrotype have had an incredible amount of success because children can go onto these websites during their computer classes and have fun while being productive but what if someone were to make a multiplayer typing game with RPG elements. It should be pretty successful and much more engaging than something like nitrotype.
kh37s7,"Cartoon Network: Punch-Time Nexus (ok, hear me out)","When a game like ""Cartoon Network: Punch-Time Explosion"" is widely disregarded as a failed experiment, it sets a precedent that something like this is a bonkers idea that was either made out of corporate greed or being out of touch with the kiddos. The original Punch-Time Explosion is without question a half-assed Smash Bros. clone that had potential but fell miserably short. However, Cartoon Network's roster for serious and action-oriented programming is quite extensive and has only grown since that game's release. So you can't tell me a brand new Cartoon Network fighting game is impossible to pull off. It totally IS possible, and here are my dreams for such a video game!\n\nThe name also comes from the OK KO special ""Crossover Nexus"", which is a love letter episode to Warner animation fans and one of the main inspirations for this dream game, so the name would only make sense. From here on out, I will be abbreviating the name to ""PTN"" for convenience.\n\nInstead of being a platform fighter, PTN is a traditional 2D fighter developed by NetherRealm and is on par in quality with Injustice 2 and MK11. A lot of their same fighting game formula would apply here, albeit keeping it T / E10 Rated. 1v1 button and directional based attacks, combos, and specials that allow matches to carry as you can imagine when playing something like Injustice 2 or MK11 *(if you couldn't tell, this game will be similar to those)* just themed and wound to assorted CN properties. For the super meter, it will be renamed the ""Punch-Time Meter"" and the super move the fighter's ""Punch-Time Explosion"". Besides that, it will function pretty much to how it does in Injustice 2.\n\nWhich properties to select is where it gets interesting... In my opinion, there should be a grand focus on CN's action-oriented programming as stated before *(Ben 10, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, Kids Next Door, etc.)* but also not forgetting their all-time classics. Also, the Adult Swim stuff is hard to see appearing if we want the game to have a lower rating. Either way, this opens a fantastic opportunity for some wild and zany movesets that would be crazy in any other fighting game. Imagine Dexter using mobilized metallic gadgets and lasers to send out blows! How about Courage scaring his enemies with various shrieks, cursed items, and familiar faces from the show. Maybe even Eddy can con some characters or smack them silly with jawbreakers?\n\nI also love that the NetherRealm fighters incorporate character dialogue before matches. Again, great creative goldmines here to see animated characters of different eras colliding and sparring verbal blows before matches. Also, the little Steven Universe fan in my heart would love to see Pearl's reactions to various other warriors or oddballs she's fighting!\n\nCharacter customization and leveling stats are another must! Costumes from particular episodes or significant ones from a series would be pretty sweet, and leveling up characters can encourage replay value to receive rewards for using your main or favorite character from a show.\n\nFor a story mode, why not follow the one from Crossover Nexus? A masked menace who goes by Strike starts terrorizing the livelihood of fellow Cartoon Network characters and CN City, their town of residence away from their worlds. When some unlikely heroes are all that are left who aren't striked, it's up to them to save their friends and return peace and normality to corrupted cartoony worlds Strike has invaded as well. This could lead to travels in Townsville, The Park, Beach City, etc. with encounters from familiar faces and thickened drama all around, eventually leading to an all-out boss fight with Strike himself, or some other twist revealed mastermind!\n\nAnd the usual third-party offerings could be sweet as well, and in my opinion should follow the theme of children to young adult animation. Masters of the Universe, Thundercats, maybe some Dreamworks?\n\nIt's completely unlikely something like this will ever happen, considering how distant both companies are with working with each other. If someone DID make something similar or as I'm describing and was inspired by this post, I request my post and account be credited within the project and also some kind way to play it as well once finished or however the creator sees fit. I would also like to offer some of my more specific details I couldn't fit here. Thank you so much for reading! Have a great day!"

I then started to make some facial mocap and made it talk, and had the idea that the main character is a crazy hobo in subway tunnels at night (so no trains) he is talking to himself randomly, so you have to try to make him shut his mouth, maybe just by pressing a key and your hand would go in front of his mouth but you couldn’t aim then, to defend against the security guards that also have some dogs. And that would be just a simple doom like but with this feature.

kgxff9,A game where you play as the grim reaper,"Grim, you play as the grim reaper and will in the beginning be assigned to collecting souls and guiding them to the afterlife safely. \n\nCharacters that make it safely to the afterlife can be used to influence the ending, and choices you make will also influence their views of you. A hub world will also allow you to spend time with the people you brought over, and do other things like decorate your office space where you get jobs from.\n\nIf character isn't escorted safely to the afterlife, the character is lost and becomes trapped in purgatory - a.k.a ghosts.\n\nThis would mean things like, fulfilling their last wishes, letting them make peace, solving their deaths, etc. to make escorting them to the afterlife easier. It is symbolic of letting go, they will struggle if not ready thus making the journey back harder for the player. \n\nThe game will feature unique stories that are unique for all characters. I plan on making most of them tug on your heartstrings, and laugh from others. The moment they die/are dying you will be alloted choices, and maybe you can even give them more time to be alive at your expense. \n\nThis game will be done in a pixel art style too, with a cute asthetic despite it getting menacing when the need arises. Purgatory and other areas aren't the happiest places after all."
kgujvv,Among us with no meetings,"One of this big downfalls of among us is the meetings. Communication is really slow without voice chat and you don’t really have enough time to review all the evidence. Many games in that genre, like mafia, are exclusively meetings to give them more time.\n\nWhat if you had one with no meetings? My vision is in a randomly generated labyrinth, fairly small. Players can communicate via a small allotment of messages at the top of the screen (no menu required). It would be stuff like over here, or yellow did it. \n\nIf two players agree on who did it, they can join together for boosted movement speed and the ability to do one kill, but it would only last about ten seconds, so you have to get to the killer first."

Maybe a whole country a whole world. \n\nI think this game can have colonlys like groups and stuff. Big dense forests.

kgok1n,I honestly think this is a great idea that fits you peoples guidelines.,"WARNING: I spilt this up so you could get an idea of each requirement for a game, I want to thank u/Sir_Magic for his post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3kf4ty/why\_your\_game\_idea\_sucks\_and\_how\_to\_make\_it\_better/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3kf4ty/why_your_game_idea_sucks_and_how_to_make_it_better/)) it allowed me to follow some guidelines and come up with a layout. PS: sorry for the bad use of grammar, I never really learned how to use commas and periods. Sorry this was so long I just thought this was a good idea.\n\n|**CONCEPT**: (to be honest I was just getting sleepy and thought of cubes) so the game I was thinking of would be an FPS where each match is a 1v1 in which each player starts with a single bullet and a gun. When the gun is fired the bullet exits, and if it hits someone small cubes become detached from the victim and those become ammo for the victim’s gun (it would leave an entrance and exit hole through the person) but you gain health each time you hit someone. (this is a very simple concept, I just thought it would be cool to have others' ideas added to it) Also, an optional thing would be to add the ability to take some of your own health away to make bullets.|\n|:-|\n|**GAME SIZE**: the game shouldn’t be a game that requires next gen graphics, if you want the game to have better graphics then that's up to you. (by that I mean the game size is up to you I just want a game with the core mechanics I mentioned).|\n|**GAME STYLE**: think of Super Hot kind of cubes, how when you hit someone the part explodes and becomes cubes (of course there would be less cubes) it doesn’t have to be in the style of super hot, I just thought it fits what I was thinking. Though you can make it whatever style you want.|\n\nPS: not sure what the flair ""request"" is I assume is a request for someone to make the game, and I would be happy to see it be made."
kgohqg,Open world narcos game set in Colombia 1980s,"Someone seriously needs to make this. Think GTA set in Medellin, Colombia in the 80s. You could play as a Colombian undercover cop infiltrating the cartel, or as a street thug who gets betrayed by his gang, so he becomes a police cooperator and you fight on both sides of the conflict. Anyways, there's so many ways to go about it.\n\nThe point is, it would have all the crazy historical events (FARC civil war, Pablo Escobar's drug war, all the bombings, etc), plus it's easy to implement many different factions (Medellin cartel, Cali cartel, police, government, FARC, etc). If you read into Colombian history, there is so much interesting content to make this game's narrative intense and immersive.\n\nFor gameplay, it would be similar to other open world games, but with a South American setting, you could have favelas (or ""comunas"" as they're called in Colombia), which makes combat gameplay really cool because you would have tight alleyways going uphill (Medellin is in a valley) with balconies, small houses, plenty of different angles to engage enemies and dynamic uphill battles.\n\nLastly, the setting would be really cool because you would have old school cars, latin music, insane amount of historical characters and the possibility to make an authentic game of the period, while being fun and entertaining.\n\nOf course, if I was a game developer, I would jump on this idea, but because I'm just a hobbyist, that would take years and a team of hundreds. \n\nBut hopefully someone might see this :)"
kgnvye,A game where you can become a shadow to blend in,"Basically, you have 2 forms, regular and shadow. \n\nWhile in regular form you can pick up objects, interact with others, and use objects. however you are easily seen and can be captured by enemies.\n\nAnd Shadow form makes you nearly undetectable, so you can move past most threats, you can even get into certain places you usually wouldn't be able to. But light can kill you, and you can only move in 2d."

I think I might have figured out a way for Star Wars to have a Battle Royale game-mode. \n\nStarWars BattleFront II could be renamed to Star Wars: The Game and every new update from now on, including the apparent Jedi Fallen Order 2 would also go through this game as a separate game-mode. \n\nBattle Royale Setup:\n\n100 Players - Stage 1 (50 Players vs 50 Players) - The Beginning \n\n20 Players Remaining Alive - Stage 2 (10 Players vs 10 Players) - Party\n\n8 Players Remaining Alive - Stage 3 (4 Players vs 4 Players) - Squad\n\n4 Players Remaining Alive - Stage 4 (2 Players vs 2 Players) - Duos\n\n2 Players Last Alive - Stage 5 (1 Player vs 1 Player) - Final\n\nIf one side has less players then the other side, the game would automatically after each round update the side the player is playing in the next stage to always be even on both sides. \n\nDifferent random eras of StarWars with random locations of that particular era. The map would get smaller after each stage mentioned above. \n\n- Galactic Republic vs Confederacy of Independent Systems\n- Galactic Empire vs Rebel Alliance\n- First Order vs Resistance \n- Jedi vs Sith option\n\nThis could be as big as titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox or it could be a complete flop."
kgmldf,Ideas for a game with procedural planets,"I made a procedural planet system and it works great! It can create desert worlds, jungle worlds, ocean, lava, mountains, craters, even some cute little villages. I'm really proud of it, but i'm facing a big problem right now: I cant think of any game to go alongside it. My system is really flexible and can do pretty much anything as long as it fits with its scale (1km radius planets. think of the planets in spore, its pretty similar), so go nuts !"
kgkhfp,"Screw it, a community-driven Mandalorian game","It's Star Wars season and every time I finish a Mandalorian episode I can't help but think of how cool it would be as a game.\n\nThe show in itself is already like a game. Collect bounties for payments like beskar steel for armor, side missions, etc.\n\nI say community-driven because I feel as though big companies wouldn't do it justice unless it was Rockstar. It would be cool if experienced game-devs were able to make their own side quests for the game for other players.\n\nCustomization options would be a neat thing, maybe not ship stuff because making an expansive playable universe like no mans sky sounds so hectic in terms of development. Just being able to go on different planets would be sweet.\n\nI tried out Outer worlds, the vibe of that game just didn't do it for me."

kghswu,Grand strategy &amp; AOE Mixed RTS game,"I was thinking of a grand strategy game (like EU4) but without having to expand by tiles. Each player gets to pick a country on a world map and there is a colored territory overlay on every country. the player can move units around in their own territory and build an army. unlike other grand strategy games, it won't be tile based expansion, rather, the player gets to declare war on a neighboring country and move the troops that they built/recruited around enemy lands and the territory would expand to where their troops moved. they can annex the territory to a certain extent but have to pay upkeep and face cultural difference resistance and all that. So think of it as EU4 and AOE combined. The player can also build forts/cities/factories within their land but the enemy can take these strategic constructions as well."
kggowh,Infinite Instants: A game based on Zeno's Paradoxes.,"* Each main area is based on one of Zeno's Paradoxes.\n* The main mechanic is abusing the flaws in Zeno's Paradoxes to get to the end.\n* Several Main Paradoxes are used: The Arrow Paradox (if you cannot move in an instant, and time is made of infinite instants, we should not be able to move), The Grain of Millet Paradox (one grain of millet does not make a sound, but a thousand do, a thousand nothings making a something), The Paradox of Place (if everything has a place, place has a place, place's place has a place, and so on forever), The Stadium Paradox (half of an amount of time = double that amount of time), Achilles and the Tortoise (as long as something has a headstart, it should be impossible to pass them), and the Dichotomy Paradox (moving 1 unit requires moving 1/2 one unit, which requires moving 1/4 one unit, which requires moving 1/8 one unit, and so on, so we should not be able to move).\n* Basically, the Creator/Narrator is studying Zeno's Paradoxes, and decided to make a game to get his mind off it. It starts out normal, but he starts to subconsciously incorporate them into his game. As he incorporates them more, you are forced to abuse the flaws within them to complete the levels. He starts focusing on the Paradoxes more and more, and goes through an existential crisis at the end. With the final area, you abusing the flaws of the Paradoxes proves to him that they are inherently wrong, allowing him to come back to reality and finish his game.\n\nHow do you think I could incorporate the paradoxes into levels?"
kgge7l,Improved Clothing Ideas,"Though a lot has improved in games, the concept of clothing is still pretty similar, with most games either giving the player set clothing which has little impact on gameplay or have clothing with different levels of protection and weight, common in RPG and Medieval Games, though nowadays some games will have different NPC reactions depending on what you are wearing I think there are some rooms for improvement such as:\n\nClothing in games could attract or detract suspicion or questions if the game has stealth elements, like hitman wearing the right clothes to blend in is essential, but it could go further than that with clashes in clothing raising suspicions as well as clothing such as long coats and bandannas. \n\nClothing could also conceal weapons, with stuff such as trench coats, trousers with lots of pockets and so on allowing for more weapons to be carried as well as bigger weapons.\n\nClothing could also act as a deterrent to certain NPC's, lets say a petty thief in a game tried to rob you, they may run away or not attempt the robbery if your clothing looked imposing or heavily armoured.\n\nClothing could also be modified to have concealed armour underneath, secret weapons like in Assassin's Creed or just aesthetic. \n\nClothing could also be used for impersonation, again like in Hitman, but you could take this a step further by implanting it in regular games and by looking and acting like someone could access secret locations, get discounts in shops or so on.\n\nThese are just some ideas of what clothing could do, comment below about your opinion on them or if you want to add more ideas."

kg9ftr,A detective turn-based rpg.,"The game is basically your standard detective game, where you gather evidence and question witnesses in order to solve a case. The twist is that sometimes you will get turn-based battles.\n\nIn detective games, some of the evidence you gather is either a waste of space or a misdirection, since it’d be too much of a coincidence (and, not to mention, too easy of a game) if every piece of evidence you came across was used to make progress and solve the case. So, I thought it’d be neat if some of that evidence could serve a separate purpose in battles.\n\nNow, the battles don’t really work like typical rpg battles. They’re more like puzzles. Say you found a flashlight earlier that has no real purpose in the case; you could use it to blind an enemy and flee; Or if you learned that the attacker is afraid of dogs, you could use that to lie and say you have an attack dog outside and he should surrender if he doesn’t want the dog called in; Or you could simply use a gun to shoot the attacker. Whether you flee, capture, or kill the attacker will impact the story, though.\nEvery time you waste one of your turns, you take a hit. The detective can only take about five hits before going down. Once he goes down, he is either killed or has evidence stolen from him, making it harder to solve the case. \nThese battles happen very rarely at first, but become a bit more common towards the end of the game, as the detective is slowly piecing it all together and more people come out to try and stop him."
kg8wnh,What is acceptable in this sub?,"I like this sub because ideas are just getting thrown around and get more fleshed out in the comments. Many of the ideas don’t strictly have to be in games, but many of them are both good and applicable. \n\nHow on topic does an idea have to be to fit in this sub? A specific machanic seems like it belongs here. I personally like worldbuilding ideas, more on that later. Ideas that are not ideas should not belong.\n\nThis sub is the perfect place to put any ideas for a unique mechanic, or a mash of two different ones. I think these belong here.\n\nIt’s debatable if worldbuilding belongs in the sub. r/worldbuilding is dedicated to that, but what you see there is 95% art. The worldbuilding I see here is more abstract ideas encompassing the entire game. Personally, I think they should be allowed, barring that they’re ideas and not art. I have seen many that didn’t like them, though.\n\nAn idea that’s just a reskin of another game is not an idea. Like “what if we had gta5 but with Zelda characters?” That makes no sense. Unless you can extra worldbuilding or mechanics to something it is not an idea.\n\nWhat I’m asking here is, do you all think worldbuilding ideas should be allowed in this sub?"
kg7x4c,L4D2+Dead Rising styled Survival Game,"**Plot**\n\nSome survivors while escaping a horde of zombies they end up locking themselves in buildings (depend on maps) with barricade. Although the buildings were very big, they still want to get themselves out.\n\n**Mechanic**\n\nIt's a wave survival games\n\nBetween every waves is 2 minutes for players to loot the buildings (So the maps should be very large) and prepare things like traps, attachments, etc. When 2 minutes has passed or at least 75% players in a party have ready, the main entrance of the building will open and a wave will start. Notes: Before the first wave, some zombies is already in the building so they must be killed to start looting.\n\nA wave lasts 5 minutes. In the first 2 minutes, players must clear the zombies from the main entrance first. Then zombies will appear from other entrances (windows, back doors, etc). After every 3 waves, the loot respawn. Every 5 waves there is a bandit raid, it's just like a normal wave but with bandits. At the end of every wave is a mini-boss battle. \n\nIn the building there is two station (work like Warzone buy station). You get money from killing, then use it to buy from the station. Contents in the station maybe items (Grenade, Medkit, Armor), perks (Double Damage, Faster Reload), contracts activated with a wave start to earn more money (Escort, Rampage) or even reviving downed teamates. Each station can be bought one thing before every wave.\n\nYou can co-op with friends or with bots and the maps will change depend on the number of players. (1-2 players: small maps like normal house      2-4 players: Medium maps like office rooftop, subway              4-8 players: Big maps like Mansion, Bank, Hotel)\n\nThere are some minigames like Team Deathmatch (4v4 fight with chosen loadout)\n\nProtect the V.I.P (Like the Escort Contract)\n\nHardcore (An infinited wave survival with unlimited ammo, no station)\n\nIn the lobby section, you can do some stuff like Buying gun skins (gotten by opening crates, crates can be obtained by buying with a currency, doing missions or 0.5% chance to get every wave in-game), inviting friends, customize loadout for Team Deathmatch)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first post in this subreddit :/"
kg79my,"Third person open world RPG-lite, explorer in 19th Century South America","Basic premise: an open world, third person, RPG-lite (think: RDR2), set in 19th Century South America and/or Central America and the US.\n\nThe point: a story-driven game, with an action/RPG style. The game sees you as a 19th Century explorer, working for a museum / naturalist, tasked with exploring the jungles. The narrative arc would focus on the central character exploring / cataloguing the jungle, in an Indiana Jones / Uncharted style fighting / combat centric exploration. \n\nQuest lines allow you options. For example: the tension between industrialisation and traditional / native communities in the jungle. Do you take the side of the corporations (clearing the jungles, logging, turning a profit), or the natives (protecting their way of life, resisting the corporations). This would play out as choosing a side whose story you follow (think: Skyrim, choosing a faction to align with). The choices you make then inform how the game progresses, with a moralistic element (like KOTOR or Fable, minus the light / dark). You could yourself become completely corporate, clearing out communities and jungles but turning a huge profit. This might give you access to unique weapons (such as prototype advanced weapons); whereas choosing the natives and resisting corporations could also give you access to unique things - skills (training in stealth) and weapons (poison arrow frogs, to create poison darts).\n\nOverall, the game would be third person action adventure. You’re exploring the jungle and urban surroundings, meeting new people and following “main” story missions - such as discovering a community / artefact. But, along the way, there are fights (nature, locals, bandits, militias) and side quests to find. The focus would be less open world “bloat” (looting for the sake of it via crates, clearing area X) and more on things that advance the narrative - for example, a riddle about an important sacred artefact, wherein working this out allows you to find a unique item.\n\nReward / skill unlocks are less “add stat % x” and more things such as, if you choose to learn a language, it affects dialogue options. If Spanish is spoken in the local towns, you start the game with a certain baseline - so you can just about understand, with subtitles. But language learning skills mean you could go through different iterations - communicating at a basic level, communicating more clearly, fluency (at which point, what they say is no longer delivered as subtitles).\n\nRealistically, the scope / size of the game would depend on the budget - for a really detailed jungle teeming with life (again, as per RDR2 wildlife), the map isn’t going to be huge / some of that detail and/or graphical output is sacrificed.\n\nThoughts?"

kg2j5o,"A VR game in which you are a tiny alien piloting a human from inside his head, going about your days trying not to get found out that you aren't human.","The cockpit is like the panoramic ones in Titanfall, and you control your ""human"" with a bunch of retro-style levers, pulleys and switches. The premise is like Octodad in that you are pretending to be human while doing various odd jobs, except you also have to have natural-ish conversations using your limited speech module.\n\nThe story and ultimate goal is that you came to Earth in search of your loved one who became stranded here years ago. You were able to pinpoint their location to this corporate office building, so you infiltrated by pretending to work here as ""the new guy"" and now everyone is giving you random tasks thinking you work in their department.\n\nYou are certain one of these humans is your beloved alien partner (much more experienced at acting human).

kg27z6,Time travel attack,"Just an idea for a game mechanic that can be employed in various kinds of games. You are given an ability to time travel to the past, while keeping the original timeline. So basically you will duplicate at some point in the past. Your previous self will keep doing what you did the first time around (not unlike those ghosts in car simulators, but it will actually be a legit entity). And you are now controlling your new instance. Repeat this multiple times and you got yourself an army, where each soldier is you.\n\nI'm imagining this could be interesting in a game similar to Dark Souls.\n\nSome thoughts on the implementation. \n\nOnce you travelled back, you'll spawn at the same location where you were back then. So it may make sense to ignore all collisions with yourself and maybe skip rendering of the ""ghost"" if you are currently inside of it.\n\nAt the moment where you travel back, you disappear from the current timeline. So if there is a monster that can only be killed with a simultaneous strike from two sides, you'll need to time your travel, and actions after the travel so you can catch up with your previous self and sync your attacks.\n\n\nSome thought will need to be put into whether you just literally rewind back (so all your health, exp and equipment reverts to what it was back then), or your current instance spawns in the past with whatever you acquired since then. Also whether or not you can interact with your clones (to for example heal them)."
kfwtbe,Zelda and Metal Gear,"  Aight, so I've decided to start on this new project. Really, I think the two styles would blend pretty well, gameplay-wise seeing, as for a start, that they've both had entries that were top-down action adventures. \n  I'm thinking for the control side of things, use something like the two item system that the top-down Zelda games that most items and abilities can be mapped to, plus separate buttons for crouching, codec calls, and luring, (think MGSV for that last one.) \n  First couple of tech demos, I'm thinking like, a small open sandbox mapped out kinda like Zelda 1, (which I think works well bc of how similar Zelda 1's map system is to MG2's.)\n  As far as story, I'm thinking of working out the rest of the manuscript along the way, but influenced by MGS and the SMT franchise.\n  Any thoughts anyone?"
kfvaap,War Inc.,"Ok so i think everybody knows what plague inc is right?

Now the transmission symptoms and abilities are all changed. The transmission is how long they train, the symptoms are there weapons, and abilities are how long they can resist in cold or hot temperatures. U can also form alliances maybe ones that already exist like NATO or ur own new one u can change the main flag of ur new alliance and the name.\n\nYea thats kinda it i might add more"
kfrisa,Brainstorm: 2D with layers,"Not sure how to flair this post, but I like the idea of posing a topic, and coming up with ideas for it - almost like a game jam.\n\nThe topic is ""2D with Layers"". The idea is that, instead of a single plane on which the player moves, there are multiple layers. I have left a couple prompts below: \n\n* How will the layers differ?\n* How will the player move between layers? Physically or telepathically (i.e. having different playable characters on each layer)\n* Is it a coop game (a player per layer)? If so, how will players interact?\n\nExamples:\n\n* [Final Ninja](http://www.nitrome.com/games/finalninja/), which had a mechanic where you can enter the shadows when standing still to avoid enemies/spotlights\n* [Toodee and Topdee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EodWWKbK6Ng&amp;ab_channel=dietzribi), a game where you switch between a 2D Platformer character and Top-Down character in the same map to solve puzzles"
kfqso4,Small bug catching game,"heres a rambly idea from my notes app, nothing innovative just a simple game based on games i like (animal crossing, pokemon, stardew valley, yokai watch, etc.)\n\ngame where you explore a town and can collect bugs and display them in a small house you live in. Characters are all animals. Bugs would be found in trees, bushes, under rocks, dirt piles and sometimes in buildings. The town would have lots of houses and characters that you can talk to and interact with and you can learn about the relationships of the characters and such. You would have a journal which would keep track of the kinds of bugs youve caught and how many youve caught. The journal will also keep track of characters youve met and quests that they may give you which would all be some form of fetch quest. your house is customizable with you being able to display your bugs. Mechanics for catching bugs would be simple, there would be a certain chance to catch certain bugs within each item(tree, bush, etc) and when you click on the bush and you will either see an exclamation point meaning theres a bug or you will receive a message saying ""couldnt find any bugs..."" or something and if you see the exclamtion point you will click and you will either catch the bug and it would say ""you caught a ... !"" or ""it got away! :("". In the game there will be different kinds of nets you can buy that would improve in quality making you more likely to catch a bug and also be able to catch different kinds of bugs. These could be bought in the store except the best net would be gifted somehow(will figure out later). There will be many shops in town where you can buy furniture, nets, or honey to attract bugs. When you use honey itll make bugs more likely to show up. The goal is to catalouge every bug essentially and become a bug catching master. There are a few other characters in the game that also are bug catchers and some characters that hate bugs. You can sell your bugs in stores or to certain characters for different prices depending on how much they like bugs. Some characters would be offended if you ask them to sell them your bugs and wont talk to you for bit. If you listen to these characters dialougues they will make it evident that they hate bugs. These characters will also reward you if you catch bugs inside their houses or stores. The game doesnt neccesarily have an ending but major achievements would to meet every character and catch every bug. After youve caught the last bug you would be met with a message of congratulation and also a thank you for playing. You can still continue to play afterwards. Still thinking about whether or not their should be a day/night schedule and months and seasons. character selection you will pick between being a cat, dog, or frog and then you will pick between 4 clothing styles. The character will be genderless but will be referred to as young but old enough to live on their own. Possibly replace just clicking for bugs with a short mini game."

Nevertheless, at some point it is going to get me bored, because you just run around and fight. So I had the idea to make a combination of the both:\n\nThe player is a kid, living in the upper levels of his world. His grandpa was a famous Miner, but disappeared without any reason. After finding a book your grandpa wrote, you are determined to find him. Story goes on.....\n\nAt this point you made it to the big city where he was last seen going into the Caves of .... The main goal is diving deeper in to the caves. You are still free of moving, you are not chased by an enemy, train, snowball or whatever. The only thing that is haunting you is the light. You start of with a simple wooden stick on fire, which you gathered in world outside of the cave. When the light turns of you are teleported back to the city. Every time you go in to the cave, the same timer will go on. Unless (!), you upgrade your light based upon your skills and gathered recourses. At a certain level you can create a candelight, which burns longer, or you can create lighting in the caves itself. Anything that helps you to dive deeper in to the caves. \n\nIn the caves you will still encounter enemy's, can gather recourses etc. The only thing is that you need to watch the lights."
kflm05,I’ve seen people wanting a Simpsons Hit&amp;Run remake. I would love a Futurama open-world adventure instead,"I am new and a non-native English speaker so I am sorry if there’s problems with my post. If this game somehow exists already then forgive my blatant ignorance.\nI’m just daydreaming, hence the flair.\nOkay, here goes...\n\nI’m thinking a RPG/sandbox game set in the Futurama universe with the cartoony graphics like we got in Hit&amp;Run way back when (obviously improved). It would initially be set in New New York, with opportunities to travel to other planets (like in Outer Worlds).\n\n- I don’t have a specific main quest line in mind, but would be cool roleplaying as a new member of Planet Express, traveling the universe with Fry, Leela, Bender &amp; co. doing deliveries and getting into problems.\n- Possible antagonists: Nixon, Robot Devil, MOM, Lrrrr.\n- Side quests could introduce the protagonist to other famous characters, like Calculon, Elzar, Flexo, the construction worker who only speaks plural, to name a few...\n- Character creation would let you mix a lot of different species and robots we see in the TV show to add to the already diverse personalities of the delivery crew. \n- Body modification for sure\n- I consider Futurama to be a show mostly for adults, so features like partying, gambling, sex, alcoholism and drug use could be implemented. Some violence as well with all that future tech. I mean, there’s suicide booths... All this would also make a world with some depth, not just an empty shell.\n\nObvious problems: copyrights and voice actors.\n\nAppreciate all kinds of feedback."

Can also be done by groups or alliances with somekind of a king and can be transfered. The item is always to find on the map!\n\nGameworld made of different shards with  different sizes and abilities:\nConsistent shards are programmed shards by the developer.\nProcedural shards are ^^ procedural generated shards who disapear after a time.\nPrivate shards from the player can be individulized.\n\nCrafting:\nAll materials in the game world can be crafted into items (weapons, skins, skills ... what ever)\nSome materials (high shards) are very rare, so only a low amount of powerful items can be crafted. If the item gets destroyed by death of the player or by destroying/using it the raw material will respawn again in the game world. Some on known location, some random or hidden, some with a shrinking circle. Some will create their own shards with powerful NPC protecting the material shard.\n\nExample: A glove for fire magic needs te be crafted and maintained. The fire shards will be spawn again if the glove will be destroyed. They need to be collected and farmed on the location.\n\nThe rest is typical action and role play gaming. I would recommend fixed amount life points/ one 100% heath bar and  the items will increase/decrease life in a procedural way. (fire glove - fire ball - 1% dmg/per use/per sec what ever...)"
kfimhs,Contemporary cargo pirate,"Many pirate games have been developed but no contemporary pirate games. I think this game would work if it was developed by Kojima because the main hub could be like outer heaven from phantom pain. You could develop your own ship which would track down and board cargo ships. Then you could collect cargo or just sell the ship. It would also be cool if you could convert captured crew into pirates. In this world, cargo ships would have machine guns and private military to protect Maritime trading. You could also have different national navy’s protecting cargo ships. Starting from the bottom with some dinky ship but eventually obtaining a destroyer or something amazing."
kfi16d,PERMADEATH OR KILL YOURSELF,"First, I'd like to acknowledge that the act of self harm or suicide is very serious. If you or anyone you know is considering these acts please seek help immediately.\n\n\*\*GAME IDEA:\*\*A single player story focused stealth Horror FPS about a PC being stalked by monsters. The PC has a revolver with limited ammunition. They may use their bullets to shoot the monsters which only temporarily puts them out of action until it respawns or wakes up. Think Immortal Jack from Resident Evil 7.\n\nIf the monster kills the player it's permadeath and the player must start the game all over again.\n\nIf the player is trapped or doesn't think they'll be able to escape the monster then they may kill themselves. This may include jumping to their death from a great height or use one of their bullets to shoot themselves in the head. The player may then continue the game from the last autosaved checkpoint.\n\nThe conclusion changes depending on the number of times the player has killed themselves such as a bad ending for many suicides or a good ending for none.\n\nPOST EDIT:For those that dislike the Permadeath idea alternatively when PC is killed by the monster they start from the last autosaved checkpoint but number of times PC killed by monster impacts ending / all of their collected items needed to open a door or solve a puzzle are taken away then player must find them again."
kfhjvw,Hoarders: The Game,"I came up with a idea for a video game based on the show hoarders buried alive.  You have a house and you have to go around the neighborhood to dumpsters, trash cans, thrift stores, to find treasures and you pack them into your house and the more treasures you can get into your house the more points you get, working towards a goal. \nThe gameplay would be based on difficulty with the controls. so I'm imagining your arms being held out in front of you and you press a button to make them squeeze together to grab something and you can rotate your arms clockwise or counterclockwise like a claw machine to grab things at different angles. You could even have a power up that gives you a third arm to claw grab stuff.\nYou could have events where a fire springs up in your house and you have to put it out before it destroys everything. And you could have government officials come to shut you down and evict you and you have to go through some sort of side activity to get rid of them."
kfhfp4,A Memento-like game,"Rewatched Memento again and thought it could be interesting to use the mechanics in a game. If you haven't watched Memento - stop here, and go watch it and then come back. A must see movie! And don't read below because of SPOILERS.\n\nSo the game is broken into timed episodes (say 10 minutes each). In each episode you have to get to the next ""checkpoint"" in time. An episode can be anything - a puzzle, a multiple choice level where only one choice is correct, an action sequence, you name it.\n\nIf you don't solve an episode in time, you're returned to the beginning of the episode. If you do solve it - you enter the next episode, which actually chronologically comes before the one you just cleared (just like in the movie). \n\nSo the game starts with something like you defeating the biggest boss of the game (maybe in a very specific way with a very specific weapon, you are supposed to have acquired). And then you proceed by 10-minute episodes backward in time to figure out why you came here and why you had to defeat the boss. The beginning of each episode, is the ending of the episode chronologically before it. But for you it's gonna be the next episode, so it'll give you clues and you'll know what to look for. So, say, if the first episode starts with you walking through a red door and then killing the boss. In the next episode, you'll need to find that red door (the checkpoint). And this new episode starts with you falling from some height onto a platform. So you know, in the next episode you'll be looking for a platform that is down below. Etc. So aside from solving puzzles, mini games and doing some action, you and your own memory will be the analog of notes and photos Lenny had in the movie.\n\nSorry if messy and makes little sense, but I had to write it down... you know what I mean."

kfaan4,Are gameideas more about story or gameplay?,"As someone who really focus on the gameplay it feels weird to see every ideas being more about story than anything.\n\nLike you can tell me your game is a fps in a cyberpunk futur where you have to make deals with cyberlords to make money. And I still have no idea what the game is.\n\nAnd why do people seams to be okay with that? For me a good gameidea is when you can understand some of the gameplay loops, or the main one at least. \n\n""You have to travel in your armored car throught deserts to reach new cities in order to refuel and get new parts for *amazing task you have to do*"". Just that would be enought even if it doesn't explain how you deal with the travelling part, because you have one loop, a part with no ressources, the desert, and the opposite with the cities. You can already imagine that both places have very different dangers and goals, co-dependent of each other. And you have a main goal."
kf9ahr,Idea for a baking/cooking face-off game?,"So, I had an idea for a game wherein you can face-off against other players in creating a dish. This is mostly based off of Worst Cooks in America, where people face-off against each other in getting their dish to look and taste similar to like how the host chef previously introduced and created the dish. Obviously, since the idea for this would be implemented into a video game, you can't necessarily taste the dish - but you can definitely try to make it look similar to the dish you need to replicate. \n\nI haven't fully hashed out anything yet, but what do you guys think? Any suggestions/changes you would want to make?"
kf6yy5,a terror/creepypasta creatures hero shooter,"it would be a overwatch like 5v5 FPS with the heroes being monster of creepypastas or legends, such as the chupacabra, werewolf or even cthulhu and the grim reaper.  \nI already thougt of 3 ""heroes""  \n1. the pope lick monster: he would be a DPS kind of character with his axe as a primary, he would be very mobile being able to jump high and have a running speed a bit higher than most characters,i couldn't think of any abilitys for him, one could be a super jump, a dash cutting anyone in his path or whatever, his ult would be the train he uses to kill people, when used, a portal will appear and a train would come trought it, the train would be very fast and dealt high damage, but only in a straight line  \n2. Jack the ripper: he would be a flank char with a gun for his primary and a straight razor for his mouse2 attack, that if used correctly deals insane damage, but he would have fairly low health, his toolkit would help him approach his target for the straight razor kill, one ability could make him invisible and faster for a short period of time and the other one could be just him unloading his magazine in the enemy ( i didn't have creativity enough for this)  \n3. and last but not least cthulhu, that surprisingly enough would be a surport: he would attack with a ball of magic property that would inflict one of two debuffs, fear, that would reduce 25% of your opponent damage, and weak, which makes the target take more 25% damage, cthulhu can change between debuffs with mouse2, and since he is a priest he could heal his teammates with some eldritch prayer, and for his ult he would summon a big black circle with runes, and when a enemy steps on it they will be inflicted the terrified debuff, wich makes them take 50% more damage, do 40% less damage and take damage overtime (and it would overwrite both the fear and weak bebuff)  \nfor maps it could be the places where people see these monsters, there could be ruins of a cathedral of cthulhu floating in space, vlad's castle, black hill forest. (sorry if any engrish, english isn't my first language)"
kf3q8s,Hackusations Class Based Shooter,"You ever played an online game ~~called warzone~~ where someone was hacking? You ever done so good in a public lobby that you got called a hacker?\n\nLet's just make a game out of it\n\nHackusations would be a class based shooter game, where the classes have built in hacks. Such as X-Ray that allows you to see players through walls. Or an Aimbot (But with a weaker weapon to prevent it from absolutely laser beaming another player).\n\nThe core gameplay would be similar to FPS games such as CoD or CSGO. But the class system would be similar to games like Overwatch or Paladins (Where you have to play to unlock other characters).\n\nEach character would have a unique hack (X-Ray, Aimbot, Speed Hacks, Etc) and a weapon catered to their hack. (Speed Hack would have a weapon like an SMG. Aimbot would have a weapon like a Semi Automatic Rifle with a slower rate of fire so that way it wouldn't be too OP).\n\nHonestly, I have no clue how this would function in practice, I just had the idea when I was playing TitanFall with a friend and he said ""Fuck it, just give everyone aimbot and see what happens"". I'm open for ideas!"
kf387i,Feed em up Tower Defense,"I have a small child and don't want to expose him to guns and gore, but do want him to enjoy video games. So here is my idea of re framing the traditional tower defense game mechanic into something that it a little more G rated:\n\nThe Nexus you are supposed to defend is some really artistically decorated food item like a wedding cake. The mobs that are attacking you are hungry people or animals. Your towers shoot food of various types at the mobs so that they are no longer hungry and leave your Nexus cake alone.\n\nDifferent types of tower give off different types of food and different types of enemies will be ""vulnerable or immune"" to those types of food. For example vegetarians will be immune to the roast beef turret and the gravy dispenser.\n\nThis context also solves one of the big narrative flaws I see in turret defense. If the things you are killing are such a threat, why don't they attack your turrets?"
kf2drr,Post post apocalyptic game,"A game where society has already rebuilt in the aftermath of an apocalypse, but they didn’t ever fix the thing that caused it in the first place.\n\nYou could find out what caused it last time at the beginning, and slowly uncover that it’s still there.\n\nI have no idea how you would implement this game. I thought y’all might have some ideas."
keziui,Asymmetrical multiplayer game where one player controls a haunted house and the other one has to survive the night.,"So you know those movies where the house is possessed by something and has soul of its own.\n\nOne player would control the haunted house in birds eye view. They can control the basic features of the house like doors and windows or electricity, water, gas and devices. \n\nThen the other player (or more players) would be a journalist who has heard of this house and challenges himself to survive one night in the house. They play in first person perspective.\n\nThe goal of the house is to kill the player by provoking accidents through their remote control of the house, for example by creating short circuits and causing a fire and then lock the door.\n\nThe player has to just survive one night."
kew69r,Rogue-like but you play as a support character," \n\nHi everyone.\n\nI  have the an idea for a small rogue-like game (right now I was thinking  of developing it for myself/itch.io, not really commercial development)  and I am looking for some opinions before I decide to proceed with my  game development.\n\nThe game is more  or less a typical, 2D rogue-like; you enter a dungeon/area, kill  monsters until you die, use the gold/exp to upgrade gear and skills,  rinse and repeat. Here's the twist - the character is designed to be  more of an alchemist/support mage with few offensive capabilities. You  would get into the dungeon with some AI controlled mercenaries (or solo  if you want) and your job would be to support them with spells and/or  potions and debuff the mobs. There would be some offensive capabilities  of course such as weaker spells, skyrim-esque runes that would trigger  when a mob steps on them and throwing potions/poisons at the mobs.\n\nI'm  just not fully convinced that this game loop is exciting enough. Or  maybe I'm thinking inside the box too much and can't think of items and  abilities that would make playing support fun.\n\nEither  way, I would love to hear what you think about this. Do you have any  comments or ideas that would make this mechanic better? Or maybe there  are already games out there that force you into that playstyle that I  have completely missed them. It'd be nice to see this idea in practice."
kerxtu,Game idea!,I have a cool idea for a game where you live in a city that is only night. The reason for this is because there is a dome that was placed over your city to stop any light from getting in our out. The crime rate was so high in the city so the dome was placed there. The main point of the game will be to escape the dome and find the people who did this. This game will be a third person shooter/adventure game.\n\nStill thinking of a title.\n\nPlease do not steal my idea :)
keq02a,A single player fighting/puzzle game,"In traditional 1-on-1 fighting games, many players enjoy spending time in the training mode trying to figure out new or optimized combos, a process typically known as ""labbing"". Players will often spend more time labbing than they spend actually playing against opponents.\n\nMy idea is for a fighting game that consists entirely of this training mode style labbing. This would actually make it more like a puzzle game than a traditional fighting game. You would get a randomly generated character with different moves and properties each time you play. Your goal would be to try to string your moves together in a way to deal the most damage to a dummy opponent.\n\nThere could be things like daily challenges with a leaderboard, where everyone gets the same character and competes for the high score. The controls could be simplified in comparison to other fighting games, and I think it could work well on mobile."
keocwe,"Game where you have 1 minute to get to the next map by solving a puzzle, but killing enemies adds time","Pretty much the title. What do you think about a game where you start with like 1 minute, and each kill adds 5 or 10 seconds to the clock. Meanwhile, you have to try to figure out some sort of puzzle to advance to a mini boss, which defeating will put you into a new world where you do it all again. I’m thinking permadeath and the map is different each time and you have to beat a certain number of maps and a final boss to win."
kemxtt,Pvp (1v1) strategy/action: Detectives vs Monsters,"Abstract flair coz it's a vague, dream/recurring train of thought/imaginary game idea. In my head, it's either very basic 2D graphics or full-on VR, possibly cell shaded anime-style... well, anyway...\n\n__Basic Concept?__\n\nSome unknown monster is feeding on people, and the local police investigate to put a stop to it.\n\n\n__How is it a game?__\n\nSetting is a populated environment, probably a small town, with a relatively short day-night schedule. Randomly generated NPCs inhabit homes, run shops, work jobs, etc. and follow a vague schedule (maybe a simple morning/afternoon/evening/night rather than hourly), also other random NPCs visit during the day.\n\nOne side plays the monster(s). There'd be a variety to select from, ideally by combining some base elements, stats, perks, etc. For example, play as a small/average/large humanoid/beast/insect with an emphasis on strength/agility/intelligence, that borrows/jumps/flies, and reproduces by laying eggs/infecting humans/dividing in two, and burrows/pretends to be human/fires projectiles that stun. You setup a lair in the forest/sewers/old lady's apartment and begin your reign of terror.\n\nMeanwhile, the other side plays a detective from the local police force, with no initial idea of what kind of monster the other playing is playing as. Starting with a set size of police in their building and a number assigned to their team, they begin patrolling, looking for signs of trouble, talking to NPCs. Over time, the town begins to panic. People keep going missing... there's weird mucus near the sewer entrance... there's video evidence of someone getting their head bitten off... whatever, the mayor is giving the police more resources, whatever they need, just find the monster(s) and exterminate them before it's too late.\n\n__Mechanics?__\n\nFor the monster player, they need to be feeding to reproduce (either cheap drones you send to do basic tasks or expensive clones/lieutenants you can send to do better tasks or even swap control to) or level up (gain stats/perks), depending on the monster's playstyle (one powerful monster that doesn't reproduce but levels up quickly, a monster that stays weak individually but quickly swarms, or somewhere in between). No matter the monster type, eating humans is always required to some degree - maybe there's a base ""hunger"" of x humans per day or lose n health, + y per drone/clone or lose them, or beyond that you gain health and/or per z eaten gain a level/perk/stat boost.\n\nAlso, NPCs have a general ""panic"" stat for the population and an individual ""suspicion"" stat - one NPC is always eaten at the start to kick things off, then at least one resident NPC that shares part of their schedule (lives nearby/visits their store/works together) will gain suspicion, and will start ""investigating"" after a day or two (checking forest for their missing hiker friend/poking around alleyways/knocking on apartment door looking for missing old lady). Their suspicion continues to increase, at a rate based on current panic level, and they will go to the police (starting with concern, escalating to  instance on urgent action), and will also slightly raise panic level, increasingly so over time. Eating them will add slightly to panic, but at least remove their over-time effect, but a new NPC would beginning raising their suspicion level anew, so monsters can only buy time at best; even eating the minimum required in perfect stealth, there will always be at least one NPC that will gradually increasing panic, even if very slowly compared to eating lots of people and leaving witnesses.\n\nMonster stats would be Strength (how quickly can you overpower and kill a human), Agility (how fast do you move) and Intelligence (how sneaky are you, can you outsmart the humans), and might influence what perks you have available or their effect (e.g. min. 5 INT required to unlock, -0.2 sec from time to feed per STR point).\n\nIf the monsters remove the police, they win. If police remove the monsters l, llthey win . \n\nMeanwhile, the police would be aiming to increase their power to deal with the monster(s). Population number would be tracked but only updated when an NPC is confirmed missing/dead. Talking to NPCs out on patrol could confirm if other NPCs are missing (""shop's been closed for 3 days now, no sign, weird, huh?""). Monsters would leave physical evidence behind that can be picked by police, more so left when killing/feeding, and such evidence could be gathered at the police station (assuming the officer carrying it doesn’t mysteriously vanish en route) for a bigger ""bonus"". Based on missing/dead population, population panic level, evidence found, etc. there's an increase of department resources to utilise (more/better officers to send out, perks/abilities unlocked, upgrade HQ for bonuses like NPCs raise suspicion level faster or report directly police HQ sooner, security cameras placed to capture footage, etc.)\n\nBased on how resources are allocated, this would allow some choice in playstyle for police also - one super detective with great STR &amp; AGI stats and a lot of perks to take down found monsters, or a big team of cops collecting physical evidence to hand to scientists back at HQ to research a chemical-based trap to capture a live monster and get the army sent in.\n\nHopefully, this would lead to a dynamic where the monster decides between a hard &amp; fast play, swarming the police HQ early with better strength stat, or useful perks, or a small army, and taking it out before reinforcements can arrive... or spend points on intelligence to leave less evidence behind, learn which NPCs are more noticeable in their absence and gain less panic when eating, learn from NPCs what upgrades the police are purchasing with their resources so you can counteract/avoid, etc., while the police have to commit resources to gaining additional sources of info to get even _more_ resources later in the game, or get well armed boots on the ground to hunt down &amp; deal with the menace."
kema0z,Need an idea for a small crafting/survival game,"I'm working on a university project and we're trying to make a crafting/survival game where you collect and build stuff.

The barrier can't be crossed and is heavily protected by the government as it covers some dark secrets.

keglga,A Zelda game with Devil May Cry gameplay,"after thinking about it a bit, a legend of zelda game with Devil May Cry gameplay is an amazing idea.\n\nA lot of mechanics could easily be translated over, of course you would have your melee attacks with the master sword and ranged attacks with the bow &amp; arrow. The hookshot could be used in place of the Devil breaker. Link could also use multiple weapons and swap them with the triggers just like in Devil May Cry (switching between different arrows, switching between other Melee weapons like the Biggoron sword or Megaton Hammer)"

kecgm6,I-Ninja for the Nintendo Switch.,"If you’ve ever played I-Ninja on the GameCube, PS2 or the Original Xbox growing up, then you’d know how fun and difficult it was. \n\nThere were fast paced ‘Inertia Run’levels, combat arena’s, ‘Ball Rolling’ levels requiring pin point accuracy and cool showdowns in the ‘Final Boss’ levels. All of these things gave the game such an iconic feel that still holds nostalgia with me. \n\nIf ever Shuntaro Furukawa reads this “open letter” please consider remaking this game but on the Nintendo Switch &lt;3\n\nThat is all."
kebajz,A Persistent Idea,"One thing that I notice when playing a lot of the game is that your actions don't typically last long. If you involved in a gigantic shoot-out, chances are next time you stroll past the place you'll find that all damage has been repaired and the place looks good as new. \n\nTherefore, I would suggest the concept of a persistent mechanic, this basically means that throughout the game, whether you accidentally hit a tree when firing a gun or drop an object on the floor, it stays there throughout the game. Also, if there is a body, it won't despawn unless its in somewhere like a city where it would be presumed it would be removed after a while. This concept though definitely requires a higher end pc to be able to run smoothly if implanted in games, could help feel like your actions impact the game, and it isn't a matter of going to one mission, do the objectives, the game cleans up your mess and everyone acts like nothing ever happened, it adds some realism to the game.\n\nIf this seriously impacts less powerful PCs the solution is to simply make it available only if you select it in the options, or make it so only certain things don't despawn such as bullet holes and smashed objects rather than just the contents of your inventory you've thrown out or such."

ke83xq,A Post-Apocolyptic Survival Sandbox Game,"So, I'm a huge sucker for sandbox and simulation games and recently stumbled upon Rimworld, [shapez.io](https://shapez.io) (and got back into minecraft) and I wanted to create a game which basically combines the ""story"" aspect of Rimworld, crafting and survival of minecraft and automation from [shapez.io](https://shapez.io).\n\nIn my head, I can see sort of a base creation game where you try and defend yourself from creatures (say zombies) while providing for recruits or normal civilians who live within. \n\nStarting from absolutely nothing, you command just a couple of recruits before moving to become the commander of different divisions like Agricultural, Research or Military and tell a generalized group on doing certain tasks.\n\nThis process sounds tedious, which is where automation comes in. Once the player has reached a certain point in the game, automation can help relieve the player of many tasks such as telling a division to move items from one area to another or telling a military division to move around and defend one area before moving to another, that sort of thing. (It might be able to remove the military division completely if the turrets used to combat the creatures are automated but havent really planned anything in detail yet)\n\nWhile you're reading, you must be wondering where these people come from. Simple answer would be similar to rimworld where you go around different ""chunks"" of the map and look for lone or group survivors who are willing to go back with you to your base and become part of a division based on their character traits.\n\nI was planning on an infinite world, but also a finite world could be interesting...\n\nThe main reason I posted here is because 1. I wasn't sure if people were going to be interested, so if you would be please tell me :D (also if you think there could be something changed from this idea in mind, also comment that) and 2. It sounds really similar to other games and not sure if it would cause some upset since it's basically mixing together games to create a new game.\n\nThanks for reading hopefully you got some suggestions or ideas :)"
ke7cmv,Anyone wants to work on a game with me?,"Here's my idea for a game that wanted to do myself, but I currently have 2 projects running already.\n\nThe setup: The year is 3xxx, and the earth is pretty much a wasteland after an invasion of insect like aliens. There are very little human survivor bastions left. You, the protagonist belong to an intelligent unit, task to seek out resources for survival and defending your bastion. Your squad is a gatherer squad, equipped with a highly advanced Powersuit like robot. Your suit, the gatherer suit is less performant in combat, then a fighter suit, but the ai and sensoric/analytic functions are topknoch. One day, while out on a mission to retreat the power cores (most valuable item ingame) of a fightersquad that got eliminated by some epic battle, your team gets attacked, and all, but you and your suit get eliminated.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGoal: Far away from your bastion, and not enough energy to go back, you try to go back to the safety of your bastion.\n\nThe twist: Your suit is your safe space. Nearly nothing can harm you while in it. But you need to find food and water to survive. Inside your suit, you have access to all your options, but everything costs energy. Want to communicate with your ai? Costs energy Want to analyse the unknown  plant you gathered? Costs energy. Long range scans? lots of energy. Fly? Tons of energy. So the gameplay is an energy management system, while try to survive and get back home.\n\nFeel: The idea is, that the player should feel an emotional attachment to his/her suit, feeling save and highly capable while in the suit and very helpless without. Problem is, the more options you use, the more energy is used and the more the player will have to forfeit his options and get closer to danger, and eventually have to rely on themself, when the suit is out of energy (peak tension moments of the game). You can modify the suit with modules you gather/build."

ke6lkf,simple/raw FPS game for esports,"I'm talking about a game similar to csgo/valorant, that is to say, rather simple and for which it is easy to get high framerates. I would like a game where there is not much to learn, a game mainly based on aiming, where rushing is favored. Ideally, it would be even simpler than csgo/valorant, and less based on camping and holding angles. Rather, it would be based on rushing, creativity during action, aiming. A game thought toward competition. Simple, sober, efficient.I don't really like csgo's bulletspread and general aiming mechanics.\n\n*Let's imagine this game:*\n\n**Overall format:** Like CSGO. Except no weapons to buy. 5on5. One side has to plant 1 bomb among 2 possible bombs (this way, sides are balanced).\n\n**Weapons:** You choose between sniper rifle and machin gun (primary weapon), and you spawn with 1 grenade et 1 pistol as well. Nothing complicated here, you are either a sniper or an MG.\n\n**Weapon/Aiming mechanics:** Damage should be large outside the head (unlike in csgo) and shooting 3-4 bullets anywhere in the middle of the body should be enough to kill. Aiming for the head above all is not really something I'm a fan of. The grenades would have their trajectory altered with random noise, so that training for prepared nades is not a thing anymore.\n\n**Maps:** For this game to not be about skills specific to the game itself and its particular maps (like you need to know the timings, the usual moves and spots, in order to compete in csgo for instance), the maps would be randomly generated at each game, using artificial intelligence. Which means that the map itself is unknown, new, and unique for each game. And this way, there is no way to geek the map up (prepare tactics and nades). There would be a minimap where you see the map layout (like in csgo) with the location of the 2 bombs, and the location of your teammates.\n\n**Technical aspects:** Thanks to a sober game without complicated graphics, it would be easy to run 500+ FPS. This way, it would be compatible with the new generation of high refresh rate monitors, and motion clarity could try and approach real human experience (I own a 360 Hz monitor and it is a substantial improvement for competitive FPS, thanks to better stroboscopics - there is still a very significant room for improvement in this regard, and it is admitted by experts that 1000 Hz monitors are the future). Other technical aspect: cheat protection. The game design should be made with the constraint to not allow for cheats (I mean, the way the game works should be defined according to the constraint of having a highly-secure anticheat - say, very naively, that the client is not receiving information that he is not supposed to know?).\n\n**Game experience:** Rather fast paced, even though you don't respawn. Random maps, no need for prior knowledge and training. Simple bullet spread mechanics. Possible to rush your way to the victory, on unpredictible maps where creativity and talent makes the difference."
ke5vzz,Sum game,"I had a game idea where u build machines (kinda like scrap mechanic or besiege) and fight with them. A machine would know where the player is and so u could set it to follow you or something. Maybe some kind of AI? Also, maybe the player could be a smaller robot themselves? Maybe there would be an option to ""select as smol"" and ""select as big"" and the cockpit of the machine would be replaced with a brain in the smol version. In the big version, you would play in first person, and in smol version, you would play in third person or first person. And of course, since its a mechanic game, you have your pistons, rotation thingies, and other things like that.\n\nIn short: A mechanic game where the AI knows where you are."
ke5rr1,Drain,"I don't think the concept is very large but can scale to any format, so it's very flexible.\n\nA 2D or 3D (whichever you'd prefer) platformer where you play as a plumber in the year 2080 and you get stuck in the massive sewers that cities (now abandoned) hold, and you have to survive the giant labyrinth by learning from your surroundings like mutant plants or a ball of worms. I wanted the game to feel like a classic Mario or MegaMan game, but have a different sense of Metroidvania with the sewer. There will be a set of tools you can use while down in the sewers to unlock more of the sewers in order to get out. Now, the narrative would be about a girl plumber who loses her mind in the sewers (which is why it's called ""drain"") trying to get out.\n\nI have a ton more I'd like to share if you're interested but these are just a few of the key concepts, I just didn't want to overdo it, and follow examples left by the Moderators. In total though, I'd love to contribute to making the game by providing maps, tools, a weapon, puzzles, and enemies I've made."

I really need to be a game director and test so much motions games can go through, but I understand that my ideas might not make it to director boards, so I'll love sharing them with others so that they can learn from my work and maybe make something that I wanted to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Losing Rings** take time to pick up, and you can’t continue since they’re your health, but the game is about speed, so how about we make it so that collecting rings without stopping gives you invincibility or a set of lives every time you get up to 25 rings, or maybe, get rid of rings all together to make sure sonic doesn’t have to collect things on the way but find things like shortcuts, this can be applied by being rewarded for running for a time to invincibility or durability against the enemy’s attacks. Or if you’d like to, mix the two with collecting every 10 rings gives you a boost or increase in durability where you can beam through enemies for each collection of 10 rings(maybe for tougher enemies it’ll take 25 rings or something( or maybe a reward that regenerates every 5 seconds or so)) or use a homing attack(if we’re talking about bigger enemies it may also be taking 10 rings from you to charge your attack which gives you a speedy boost as well) to rid them if you want to save your durability, only when you’re not stopping so that the course is learning how to collect rings and the map all while not stopping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Boosts** are a control of how fast you’d like to go so that players can choose their comfortability, whether you’re a honed skilled player who wants to use your boost to reach unlimited speeds to literally speed run the game, or you would rather use your own level of speed and instead use the boosts that collect every 5 seconds to be able to collect attacks without using your energy or maybe more invincibility, this way it’s a sacrifice to your speed for defense or sacrifice your defense for your speed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Light speed dashes** should be a fantastic addition, therefore a way to fix the slowing down can be a mechanism that you have to wait 3-5 seconds (while running so that it doesn’t affect your game) to charge(for free rather than using rings) or just be using rings you’ve collected to dash instantly, a great boost and attack for ground enemies, why else would sonic look like a literal comet when he’s running?. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Sliding** should be used (maybe just as a drift in 3D)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* We can also change the rings for time running, but to not make you feel like you only run, the set up to the run is changed to a button you’ll have to press, so if you don’t want to run and solve the puzzles you can walk around safely, if you want to run across the map to pick up a puzzle piece(with a backpack or send tails, but ultimately I wouldn’t touch this unless it’s a last resort) or interaction with the world like Zelda dungeons you can run. Essentially this can be a bigger interaction version of Zelda dungeons which can be wild if done right. Then since that’s the running button, pressing it again can be the Light Speed Dash. The difference between running for the time would be the incredible skill for controlling your speed rather than your skill for the level. Take that “speedrunners”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Ziplines** may just be removed or can provide a boost for the player that doesn’t make the player feel slower and instead is an addition or tool for the player to get to a faster pace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Maps** are something we might have to figure out as we test sonic’s new abilities\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Puzzle mechanism** of the classic rotating wheel, but you have to hit the middle bar that rotates the wheels to change which order it goes. This is an idea that can solve many of the sonic issues about their little mechanisms, they usually slow down the player, but I’m trying to encourage the player to get through the level at their own speed to understand it better and let them have the option to go fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Snowball** level where sonic can run into a snowball and start rolling with it to crush enemies down its path- grants durable invincibility and slows down or rises speed based on your usual speed. Though snowballs may be a tool, they’re also an occurrence against sonic as he runs up a mountain and his enemies keep rolling snowballs. The snowballs are huge but slow while being an annoyance by being hard to get through at the bottom of the mountain so that they’re easier to dodge for slower players, but as he rises up the mountain, the snowballs get faster and easier to get through eventually becoming nothing compared to sonic, this causes an introduction paradox where if the player is knocked back they can still have enough time as the snowballs are slower behind them. I understand that the snowballs will be going after him and running towards them will be difficult, but I’d like to have this map as an introduction to the new sonic so that players try to understand how to play before trying to run straight into the action. I doubt this would work and players won’t like being non-accessible to his speeds, which is why it’ll be a one-time level Experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Just Sonic,** maybe we can make this fit as younger Sonic or something on the lines of his backstory(Which could also influence the shounen protagonist in Sonic like how Goku was), because I really like sticking to the lore, but this would definitely help the player feel that it’s Sonic who is the center of the game, that he is the reason you feel this joyful and excited to play this game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Ranking** your score based on alphabetical order would be broken by the speed limitations, so now you’ll be tested to beat your own scores through each course, this means the first level you play will place your first highest score in the game giving you an S tier, this should make players want to test their skill, have their own favorite maps they like to play, and be able to replay that map over and over again as they reach for a better overall score. This case would mean that any score higher than your previous highest would be an S tier. Then as you get better, the only thing that would happen would be the change in distance of the relations of the score, so the higher your score becomes over time the shorter the distance between each score, and the harder it is to get a higher score as you test yourself to your limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Mission** **Missions** will be placed on the world, a world? Think of the legend of Zelda’s BOTW and now imagine being able to run across the world with many challenges awaiting you, a free world structure that only requires you to free the world, and everything unlocked after you beat the game(or maybe the world). What I’m planning is either a world as a tutorial for players where they can test their capabilities in insane parkours around the map or be introduced into different mechanics. If the Sonic team would like a story rather than just an exploration through a huge world, then we can just make the world smaller (only a mission to beat at the beginning of the game as a tutorial), and have Dr. Egg man find Sonic and his strange speed to kidnap him for whatever reason. I’m also a pretty interesting writer, so I think I can probably also plot this. Anyways, this could just be a setup for Sonic’s running and the abilities can be introduced as Dr. Eggman could test Sonic as he tests the other animals, or whatever those things are. Then sonic can understand his plan (whatever that may be) and ruin it to run away, now sonic has to find his way back home and run away from Eggman who is trying to find Sonic. &lt;— lazy writing, but I think we could do better as a team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **No water missions** unless we could get through the problems they hold against speed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Disability** might be a huge problem with the game, well at least for the other games since this one isn’t made yet, but I’d love to dive deeper into this if I do get interested in Sonic more often (That means inspirations or things to fix, as I think the creators have this covered)\n\nSide- this means ideas that aren’t fully formed or really compelling to me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Maybe wall-running, bouncing off walls, or wall-running and jumping off of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Maybe add goggles to this speed devil"

kdquik,Trading card game,"Here is a simple idea for a trading card game. Its obviously inspired by monopoly but fairly different.\n\n\nEach player starts the game with 1 card of each colors. Values of the cards is in brackets. White (1), Yellow (2), Orange (3), Red (4), Black (5). Additionnally, each players starts with 5$.\n\n\nThe objective of the game is to have the most value when the game ends. Your value is determined by your money + total value of your cards. Additionnally, having 3 cards of the same color gives a bonus of 3 points. Its possible to have negative money (debt). Debt not only reduce your score, but its effect is double (2$ of debt removes 4 points from your score).\n\n\nThe cards and the money of each players is secret during the game.\n\n\nEach turns, you have to secretly craft a deal. Either you sell a card for a price of your choice, or you ask to buy a card for a price of your choice. For example, ""i want to buy red card for 4$"". Once all 3 players crafted their own deal, each players see 2 anonymous deals on their screens. You do not see who posted the deal. The first person to click on the deal gets it (speed game). If nobody clicks, then the deal is cancelled.\n\n\n\nThere is 7 rounds like this, then the game ends and scores are compared.\n\n\nObviously, the best strategy is to try and get 3 cards of the same colors, but also to try and sell your other cards for excess value."

kdk6co,A dating simulator that turns into a vertical scrolling shooter,"I’ve had this idea for a while now. I don’t know if anything like this has already been done before.\n\nThe idea is that the game starts as an average dating simulator, but when the player goes on a date the game turns into a vertical scrolling shooter similar to games such as Xevious and Galaga. During the dates the player has to reach a certain number of points to succeed, which can be done by shooting down enemies or certain obstacles. You also have to dodge bullets that the enemies send at you. If you don’t reach the number of points you need, the date ends in a failure. I think there can also be items that can upgrade the character during the dates and also some enemies that make you lose points if you shoot at them. Another idea I have is that you can give gifts to the characters before the date, and it will either make the shooting part easier or harder depending on if they like the gift or not."
kdi39s,A Top-Down Bullet Hell At Sea Where Bullets are Affected By Gravity,"Hello! I've really been into bullet hells lately, and this idea came into mind.\n\nYou're a guy on a tiny speedboat at sea and you have to take out huge ships with your cannon. As in all bullet hells, it's chaos as bullets fill the screen. It'll be your job to dodge them all.\n\nThe difference is that while most bullet hells use only the x and y-axis, this top-down game will have the z-axis as well. Bullets can fly above you before heading straight down your boat, enemy barrages have a set range, as any farther than that will have them sink to the ground.\n\nThis will lead to new strategies for both the developer and the player. The developer can then put way more bullets onscreen, with most still high in the air and some at the level that can hit your boat. It'll make the player consider the bullet's z-axis as well, so you can go under bullets still in the air while dodging a barrage somewhere else, move right outside the enemy's range, and so on."
kdfcbo,"Zombie game, but you’re a proper zombie","So yeah, we got some games where you’re a zombie, but you can’t infect people, you don’t get to watch a horde of fellow zombies tear through a human outpost, and in other games where you’re a zombie or have a horde of zombies, the humans just mow them down in a split-second \n\nSo my idea is a zombie game, a simulator if you will, you can have a sandbox mode where you can adjust the human populace and how far/close their outposts are to each other and how well defended they are(from just being a camp with no walls and makeshift weapons to being a heavily armed outpost with tall wood walls armed with pikes and traps), you can also adjust certain things about their behavior, like will group A raid group B’s outpost(leaving a bunch of corpses for you to turn) or will group A share resources with group B(this will make things more difficult for the player) or will group A and B be neutral with each other\n\nAs for the player, they can choose between a couple different zombie variations, I’m thinking of the current selection being crawler for stealth, tank for ravaging outposts, spitter for infecting/killing at long range whilst being frailer than glass, leaper for speed and stealth but being more easy to spot in the day time since they can’t hide well\n\nThe player will have a couple of abilities, some class ability ideas I got are that tanks will be able to unleash an infectious cloud to turn all the humans they killed, crawlers can spit out infectious blobs that infect whoever steps on them and anyone else nearby, spitters can spit out gas that lingers for a while, turns corpses but doesn’t affect the living, and empowers any zombies in the gas, and leapers can go invisible while still able to infect people and corpses\n\nSome “universal” abilities that are spread between all classes would be, the ability to call zombies to your area, the ability to send zombies to different locations, and the ability to move faster for a short period \n\nI’ll probably update this soon, feedback for this idea would be appreciated"

kdcral,"""Junk"" System for Open World/Sandbox games to handle unloading items","Over the last few years, I have come up with a lot of concepts for sandbox and open world games, especially in the same vein as Minecraft or Terraria. However, more interesting than any of those holistic ideas, one mechanic I had made up for one of the first ones kept coming back and being refined in each concept I had. At this point, I am much more interested in this mechanic than the rest of any of those games, since it solves multiple major gripes I have with every game in this genre I've played so far.  \n\n\nBasically, what if, when a game was going to despawn an item, it added that item to a table of items despawned in that location? The item would no longer be taking up processing power, instead becoming part of the world file. Then, things that draw random 'junk' items from a table (such as junk/loot fishing in Minecraft, or slimes containing items in Terraria) could remove items from that table instead of a static loot table (that makes anything in that table renewable). Items in the junk table could have a chance of being found by fishing, digging, fighting certain kinds of monsters, or any other way that makes sense for the game.  \n\n\nThis solves several major problems I have with these games, especially Minecraft, those being the inability to retrieve items once they despawn, and the random assortment of items made directly renewable through being included on a loot table. If Minecraft were to add this system, it could more carelessly despawn items (maybe even immediately upon a chunk being unloaded) to save memory, and instead use the fishing system (and upcoming archaeology system) to recover lost items. In the Nether, where neither of those options are available, the piglin bartering loot table could be replaced with a junk table representing the entire dimension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis System also adds a lot of interesting design possibilities. For example, some loot in dungeons/ruins could be hidden in the junk table, encouraging players to stick around and make them a temporary home to find the items. Also, monsters could arm themselves with items in the junk table as if they had found them. If a game were built around this system, it could even go so far as to run creature spawning tables, allowing specific monsters to continue stalking a location semi-permanently, or having a limited number of passive creatures available to hunt in an area before the population is depleted.   \n\n\nThere are a few problems I've noticed with this system as it stands, but I'm much more interested in any constructive criticism/feedback you all might have."
kdc7om,Any 2D Ideas for a new game designer?,Just getting into game design and I was curious if anyone has any good ideas that I can play around with?
j88w81,Buffing Heavies in Fighting Games - Weight Based Variable Hit-Stun,"Now, I know I don't have much experience in fighting games, but the ones I have looked into is that the heavies, or more accurately the Mighty Glacier Archetype, who rely on high defense and low speed, are generally pretty weak or low in terms of tier lists and the metagame, so here's an idea on how to buff them based on real life fighting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of fighting games have variable weight-based knockback from what I've seen (especially platform fighters), where lighter characters are thrown back further and heavier characters less so, so they become food for combo players. How about, along with that, attacks also do less hitsun to heavy characters, because if a small, skinny guy gets hit by the same punch a body builder does, the skiny guy will probably be stunned more, instead of equally like most games that I've seen do. This will make comboing heavier characters a bit more difficult and make them actually feel like defensive characters that utilize prediction more. It might also help heavies since their attacks tend to be slower, so having this will help them land attacks just a bit easier without completely breaking them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, balance is everything here, and if you have weight based variable Hit-stun be as much as it is in real life, it might get too powerful, since that's one of the big reasons why Weight-classes are a thing in boxing and wrestling, but I think its more elegant than super armor or not having it at all. What do you all think of this mechanic?"
j87o96,Open World game where the main plot is just side quests.,"Essentially my favorite part of Oblivion was just the side missions and exploring. As soon as I left the sewers I didn’t once touch the main storyline.\n\nAnd while main quests get so much focus on Bethesda RPGs, what if I just want to tell a story about my character that doesn’t involve a world ending event?\n\nWhat if instead of Fallout 3 being about the Vault Dweller and his father it was just about interacting with the various factions like in New Vegas. Off course New Vegas had its ending, but what if it didn’t? What if you got the chance to take out Mr House and just summon his robot army wherever you wanted. Caesar still walking around until you decide to try and storm his base on your own. \n\nYes you will miss out on big set piece moments, but this game is trying to be something different. Not to replace what already exists."
j874kq,I have an idea for a card game based on a road trip game my family plays.,The road trip game is very simple. Someone says a word and another says a word that is related to it in their mind. I was thinking about a card game where people have words on cards that are as unrelated to each other as possible and someone puts down a card with a word on it and someone else has to put down another card and justify how the two words are related. We called our road trip game 'connections' but I think something called that already exists. I'm not aware of any similar games but please let me know if this already exists. Also the idea might be a little too simple so suggestions to add to the game would be great.
j80693,A speedrun game where using glitches is part of the plot.,"When a player speedruns a game, he'll use glitches in the game to get a faster time. These glitches are plot-breaking though so what if there was a game where using glitches to get a faster time was part of the plot?\n\nFor ex: in assassin's creed your character gets into a fulldive vr machine and play the game's game through it, but this time the researchers monitoring your character's performance in the machine will take note of how long it took you to perform the mission. They will also tell you to exploit some the glitches in the simulated world to finish the mission sooner. These glitches will be intentional though on the irl game developers' parts. So the best mission score will be the one when the player fully utilizes the intentional glitches. But if the player can find unintentional glitches, then that will be even better and not break the plot!\n\nAnd then when the character gets out of the machine and does the stuff with the researchers there won't be any intentional glitches, but if the players finds some and utilizes them then the researchers should notice and freak out because they realize they're also in a simulated world. If the speedrunner is good enough and finds enough glitches to bypass entire missions, then he'll finish the game faster than the researchers would expect and  they'll note how something feels wrong like they don't remember you completing such and such mission or something like wow this research project is over way faster than expected....\n\nVery meta."

j7rclt,RTS with Coop vs dynamic campaign,"Sadly for the RTS genre, it became niche but anyway my idea:\n\n**The basic features**\n\n\- A RTS with the classic base-building &amp; resource-gathering game mechanics\n\n\- Procedural generated maps \n\n\- Factions (For variety gameplay styles)\n\n**The interesting features**\n\n*  Coop vs campaign: I remember that C&amp;C red alert 3 you could play the campaign with a friend, my idea is quite similar just instead of fighting enemy AI you would fight against other team of people. Not sure how this would scale, but a 2vs2 even maybe 3vs3 maybe doable and still balanced...\n*  Dynamic campaign:  Failure it's not the end of the campaign, if you or your team loses a previous mission, just the objectives shift according as the event unfold.  For example:  \n\n\n1. the 1st mission is to capture a nuclear missile silo, whatever team success at this, the next mission starts the missile silo and a stablished base\n2. the 2nd mission for the  winner team is to hold the missile silo, this is the chance for the opposing team to recover the missile silo\n3. Depending the outcome of  the 2 mission of the campaign if the previous winner team hold the silo the campaign moves onto the next area, or else the opposing team  next mission have nuclear strike capabilities available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Custumizable factions: I remember that petroglyph made a made in which you could customize your whole army, but it kinda sucked. Whatever,  if you what to specialize in infantry, but not only that, you get to choose the 'flavor', let's say your infantry squads specialize in urban combat and can clear garrisoned buildings with ease, or more like special forces behind the lines calling precision strikes against enemy units. Skills and equipment too. Let's say that your special forces squad may be equiped with better body armor, they take more damage but the are slightly slower."

j7if9k,Pike and Shot TDF,"This idea is for a plants vs Zombies like game with 5 lanes of enemies that takes place in the Pike and Shot era of warfare (15-16th century). You play as a mercenary captain who commands a regiment in different conflicts all over Europe. Battles take place like levels of plants vs zombies with swarms of enemies moving towards your line. The player's units occupy a 5 unit tall 4 unit deep section at the left of the screen. The units are purchased between battles and their initial formation set pre battle. However the skill in the game play will be to swap the units around to maximize the right type of fire power for the threats in each lane.\n\nFor example:\n\nArchers are good against lightly armored enemies and have long range\n\nMuskets have a slow reload but do high armor piercing at close range.\n\nPikes slow down enemies allong the length of the pike, unless they enemies are special pike breakers\n\nZweihander break pikes and do massive dammage at close range\n\nPistoleres have multiple shots at close range but take a very long time to reload.\n\nPavise have damage reduction vs ranged attacks \n\nBrezerkers do a lot of dammage at close range, but have low HP.\n\nGrenadiers do AOE dammage at medium range.\n\nThe game will have commands to advance and retreat, as well as a marker indicating how the rest of the battle is doing relative to your regiment. Advancing or retreating will slow the reload process for gunners and archers, but may be necessary to close distance on enemies that outrage you or keep up with the rest of the battle.\n\nIf the player's unit is ahead of the main battle line it will attract more enemies, than if the player is behind the main battle line. The more enemies it defeats, the higher the honor and loot the player gets for success in battle. Honor give the player access to more prestigious battles and loot allows the player to hire more men."
j7hwng,A story driven game about a disease called sickle-cell,"So, searching around on the internet, I have not once seen a game about sickle cell, even though it is a terrible disease to be living with; therefore, I decided to make one, as I have experienced a life with sickle cell. Here me out.\n\nThis game would take the player from a baby to a full grown adult. Throughout the game, you will face troubles in your life, from primary, to high school, and your work place. It would be like playing a visual novel. Okay look, I can't spoil much but I am a very decent programmer. All I would need to make this game come to pass are artists. Let me know if you know any, or if you are one yourself!"
j7h58g,Gravity/The Martian (the movie) (the game) + KSP,"(I just posted and deleted something similar, but made it way better so here goes.)\n\nIn either near-future Earth or an alt-Earth with a massive space program bordering on colonization, something Goes Wrong. About half of everything in space breaks, and Earth is out of contact and fucked enough to not be providing any help to stranded astronauts. \n\nYou play as a stranded astronaut. At first it seems like your job is to get home alive - KSP-stye orbital mechanics and jury-rigged engineering to get yourself into a return capsule and get home like you're starring in Gravity.\n\nBut, in the course of doing this, you learn you're not the only one in this situation. There are about a dozen other surviving people stranded around the solar system, all uniquely written with character and personality and all that, trapped with a few months' supplies but no way of getting home. Your job is to re-purpose what's available to get as many of them back on solid ground as possible.\n\nThe difficulty would come from limited supplies; saving 3-4 people would be relatively easy with a little quick thinking, but there's only so much fuel to scavenge and only so many readily available re-entry capsules. The more people you save, the more efficient you have to be with resources and the crazier you have to be about re-entry pods. Saving *everyone* would be possible (or at least, everyone but yourself), but require a near-perfect planning and efficiency.\n\nThis is where the writing kicks in; early on you might establish radio communications with someone on Mars who's funny and personable, but the resources you'd spend saving them mean not following up on ""3 people here - SOS"" running on loop from the lunar surface. So, you get Really Hard Choices about who you can afford to save, where the budget is how smart you've been and how few mistakes you've made."
j7gpi0,Competitive Naruto Game,"I have had this idea for a long time now so I am dumping it here. Sorry for the bad English I am Austrian\n\nBasic Information (skip if you know Naruto):\n\nIn the Universe of Naruto, Ninjutsu and Genjutsu are special attacks that utilize chakra in order to defeat an enemy. To activate a Jutsu one must use Hand signs that resemble the 12 Chinese Horoscope animals.\nThese Hand signs are the root of my vision for a truly competitive Naruto Game.\n\nBasic Gameplay premise:\nBind every zodiac sign to a specific key on the keyboard.\n\nIf a player wants to execute a specific Jutsu they are only limited by there ability to memorize and execute said Jutsu by pressing the respective Keys in the right order. This ensures following things:\n\nRoom for player Improvement: Since the speed of every attack is only limited by the ability of pressing the right keys in a fast manner players should be able to train this mechanic for a near endless amount of time and still see some improvement\n\nAccessibility: The Jutsus are freely accessible from the get go there is just no way for one to do one specific Jutsu consistently without learning, what specific hand sign combo triggers it, by hard.\n\nVariety: Since the players Jutsu arsenal is purely mental and no Jutus have to be equipped we should see different people use different fighting styles in a 1 v 1 Situation. (This of course only if the Jutsus on each combo level are equally balanced( combo level meaning 1 hand sign - level 1, 2 hand signs - level 2.....12 hand signs -level 12))\n\nAdditional thought:\n\nHow to learn Jutsus:\n\nThe player could learn how to use each jutsu by going around the town and asking NPC's to teach them in a mentor like fashion. The fighting style of a player would then resemble the fighting style of the teacher or teachers if they where to learn from multiple mentors, creating some interesting compositions.\n\nInfusion:\n\nA big part of the Naruto Universe are Ninja gadgets like kunais for example. If gadgets had there own bind one could hold the gadget key and press specific hand signs in order to ""infuse"" the gadget with chakra. I say infuse but think of it more like make the gadget do cool magic shit like in the animes.\n\nTaijutsu (hand to hand combat) could be a more neutral way to attack the enemy but could also be infused as well making some attacks hit harder.\n\nThose are just some of my ideas for a truly competitive Naruto Game. I d be open to brainstorm with you guys in the comment section. Thank you for coming to my ted talk"
j7fv5a,Haven and Hell,"You live in the world of Haven basic open-world MMO with all the basic world-building stuff. Quests with multiple solutions slowly evolving your character thru those decisions. There are PVE and PVP outside of towns guarded areas (the old guards pop in and murder the assailants).\n\nThe hook is when you die you go to Hell. Hell is an awful place filled with demons and other players like you who have been killed. there is no law in hell. and it is filled with junk loot that you can just pick up and start hacking at your enemies. \n\nHell is a mirror copy of Haven in black and white nothing is interactable but you are constrained by the landscape. Instead of woodland creatures, there are horrible demons. \n\nTo get out of hell there are options. If you have been a fairly decent citizen and have strong ties with the church you might try prayer. Your prayer may drop you in a church in Haven or it might put you in purgatory for a short period where you are basically set upon by plague-like shit until youre dropped in the church.  \n\n\nOr you can fight you'll have a score to settle depending on the person you killed and other factors. Settle that score with tounges and the head demon will send you out of the gates with a fresh set of bullshit armor to get you home. Of course, there may be others at the gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr you can work your way back to your home location. There you will find a copy of your home that you can not interact with except the bed which once used will drop you in your house."
j7fkb0,"Kerbal Space Program, but it's post-apocalyptic survival metroidvania.","KSP physics, orbital mechanics and part-by-part simulated ships. (So, you're building ships that have fuel consumption and actually dealing with stuff about orbital velocity, transfer windows, heat shields, all of that.)\n\nThen, get rid of the actual space program - no vehicle assembly building, no launch pad, no infinite supply of Kerbals. Instead, the player plays one pilot already aboard a ship somewhere in space. They're in a solar system that had a thriving space program with lots of satellites, mining bases and the like, but Something Bad Happened and now everyone's dead and half the stuff is broke.\n\nGameplay consists of navigating and scavenging, getting new resources and new parts to customize your ship (or build new ones) so that you can go to new places and get new resources and parts. There's a TON of stuff here, but could include:\n\n* Starting without an EVA suit, so until you find something you can dock with that has one, you're stuck with very limited interactions\n* Constantly managing a fuel supply, siphoning leftovers from orbital wreckage\n* Starting with only basic welding tools you can use to duct-tape small things onto your ship, but eventually finding an in-SITU construction platform that you have to get supplies and power to to make more advanced repairs\n* Lacking security clearance to properly board certain stations; you have to either come back when you have clearance, or get creative and smash a hole in the side to get access early while compromising it as a habitat\n* Needing something from the surface of a planet, so you can't get it until you're able to jury-rig a lander/orbiter.\n* Needing something from a planet that would be hard to built a land-and-return craft to... But there's a rocket waiting there fueled up and ready to go. But it's a long ways from the thing on the planet you want. So you need to plan ahead, maybe even dropping supply caches along your route.\n* Requiring radiation shielding and/or radiators for transit nearer the sun.\n\nI'm imagining this as a Hard Game, and one that would be possible to lose. It would be possible to run out of fuel before you get a mining/refinery setup back online. It  would at least be *possible* to break things required for advancement, since there's nothing you can't strap a rocket to and throw into the sun."
j7fi7i,UFO Abduction Game,"I've been toying with this as a broad concept for years.\n\nThe essential premise is that you fly around in a UFO and abduct people, animals and objects.  \nThere aren't a lot of games that really fit the bill and I feel like it's an untapped concept.  \n\n\nMy first thought is that it should be a kind of Stealth Scavenger-hunt. \n\nSo picture Small-Town USA, lots of isolated roads and farms around a small town with a sleepy police department.  \n\n\nYou get a list of objects, animals and people to collect for study and a bunch of tools to do it with.  \n\n\nYour UFO initially might only come with a low-powered tractor beam, suitable for loose objects and small animals. Upgrades increase its power, allowing you to uproot mailboxes and lift cows and cars.  \n\n\nYou can unlock Hypno-Rays to lure humans out of their homes, Lasers to disintegrate evidence, Cloaking Devices to hide in plain sight (for a brief time anyway) and Neuralizers to make humans forget they ever saw you.  \nYou can even abduct people who see you and do things to discredit or mess with their minds so they don't give credible reports of Aliens. (Cue the hilarious ""Probe Human"" button)\n\nI'm thinking each mission basically finishes with a score for how stealthy you were.\n\nFuture missions take into account that score, providing increasing levels of scrutiny from Men In Black, the local Police, UFO-Nuts come to catch a glimpse of you and so on. So if you're not stealthy, it'll make later levels a bit harder.  \n\n\nTo make the missions harder, The Townsfolk live to routines, so if you get tasked to abduct a particular person, you may have to catch them at a particular time of day and in a particular place. For example, the Police Sergeant works in the town center all day and only goes home after dark, and he has to travel down a long winding track to get to his house....  \n\n\nThoughts?"
j7f9av,Ghosts vs Humans PVP game.,"[MIGHT ALREADY EXIST.]\n\nA game similar to Dead By Daylight where there's a team of ghost hunters and you're a ghost. As a ghost, have to mess with the team's equipment (draining batteries, moving things,) without getting caught on a thermal imaging camera. You can't be caught on video if you're staying still, you only become visible when you move.\n\nPoints are awarded to the ghost player by draining batteries and moving furniture, with a proximity bonus multiplier. If a ghost is caught, then the ghost is ""dead"" and is done playing for the round.\n\nPoints are awarded to the hunters for evidence, with a point streak multiplier depending on how many pieces of evidence they recovered. The team with the most points win.\n\nI know this is crude and probably isn't half as complex as some of the posts on this thread, but this was a very spontaneous idea that I wanted to get jotted down before I forgot it."

j75oc5,Online TCG with a social Hub World,"I checked for other posts like this with no luck. \n\nThe idea is to make a hub world for players to meet and challenge each other. When these challenges are made the two challengers can decide to make the game casual or to add an ante for specific cards, cosmetics, etc. This could allow players to socialize between games and maybe even spectate friends.\n\nI thought this idea would be cool if any of the big CCG or TCG companies adopted this. Obviously, this idea would have a terrible time trying to gain an audience if it was a brand new TCG but I think it would be a cool twist on modern CCGs."

j72ohi,16-bit styled beat-em-up with heavy retro gaming references,"the plot:\nmason is an average used game store employee, he loves retro games, and is a loyal worker. BUT THEN... a notorious gang robs his store, and shoots him in a non-vital but still painful area. (not THERE you pervs!) in order to keep his job, and stop the gang's rampant violence, he takes to the streets to stop the gang and get the stolen games back!\n\n\nso, the general presentation is similar to retro city rampage, with a pixel artstyle and heavy 80’s and 90’s references, albiet with more of an emphasis on gaming and almost none on the rest of the pop culture spectrum. \nweapon pickups include a star that lets you throw fireballs, a throwing knife, a wooden sword, a long-range whip, and a familiar orange light gun (as well as a super scope parody). \nyou can find a roast turkey by breaking down a wall (complete with mentioning it somehow is still like it was fresh cooked.), \nthere is a store between levels where you can buy upgrades for mason and player two,( like double dragon neon ), discussed next.\nplayer 2 is mason's coworker kevin, based on captain n: the game master's titular hero. the two can also do team attacks with the right weapons, such as using the light gun to shoot a shot at the other guys reflective shield, which then hits enemies with their own shields that would normally need to be knocked out of their hands. \nprogressing throughout the game allows you to unlock arcade machines, allowing you to play minigames such as an asteroids knockoff, a 1-on-1 fighting game starring mason and kevin, and a game inspired by a certain lawsuit-causing game that was the debut of a certain well known plumber. \nalso, a tiger electronic handheld appears as an item that increases attack power for a short time, due to pissing off mason and kevin with how crappy it is.\nthe enemies include an abobo knockoff, r.o.b lookalikes, space invader enemies, wall climbing ninjas with katanas, hammer Wielding turtles (of the teenage mutant variety, sleazeball!), and spear wielding bulldog/pig mutants based on zelda 1s moblins.\n\nthat's all i can think of for now, but you can probably add more in the comments!\n\nalso, please notify me when someone starts a project based on this pitch."
j72a4l,GTA but science,"Right so, here's what I'm thinking. It's a game kinda like GTA, like you do missions, maybe some that involve stealing things or even just helping people, stuff like that. But instead of having weapons or beating people up, you use science to progress in the game. What do I mean by that? Well let's say to keep it simple, you focus on 3 main sciences, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. You have three characters, each one specializes in one of these sciences, as well as having other skills. Like for example, the one who specializes in Physics is really good at stealth or something like that. And basically, if you're the character who specializes in Physics, you use Physics to do certain parts of the mission. \n\nSay you need to disable an alarm, so you decide to throw an object at it. To do that, the game makes you calculate stuff related to projectile motion to do that, complete with a tutorial on how to calculate it, and when you get the correct answer, they'll of course throw the object. It could also be used in fighting, with you perhaps having to use principles related to momentum to give yourself the upper hand in a fight. \n\nWith Biology, perhaps, in the game, you have the option to have an animal companion, and using Biology, you could selectively breed a companion with the traits that you think are useful. This could also be useful for fighting, since you could use your knowledge of adaptations, or even how cells in your opponent work, to give yourself an advantage.\n\nWith Chemistry, you could create things to say, melt down objects, explode things, or maybe even freeze things if you need to. All of which, you have to do some sort of calculation related to it to do. Say you need something to melt down a metal door, you then have to do a enthalpy equation correctly, to make the thing that will melt down the door. It could also be useful to make the mission easier. Like if the building you have to raid or something, is full of a poisonous gas, you could use Chemistry principles to take away the gas.\n\nIn this game, while a single character can do mission by themselves, there are missions where they're all together. In these cases, and you know, if they're next to eachother, you could use multiple science principles together to solve a puzzle, or defeat an enemy. For example, if the Physics and Biology characters are trying to defeat an enemy, the Physics character uses torque to swing something at the enemy, and then the Biology character uses their knowledge of well, Biology, to hit the enemy's weak points.\n\nWhile this game is technically educational, since the way you'll calculate momentum is actually how you'd calculate it in real life, it's not a full on, in your face educational game, like those math games you'd buy for your kid. And there is some kind of story going on in the background."

j6xsxl,Sky continent open world merchant.,"# An open world in the sky\n\nOpen worlds are usually set on the ground. A more creative setting imo would to make the setting of the world be floating islands in the sky. The main type of travel would be with flying machines. As for the theme, any of the ""punk"" themes would work fine (steampunk, dieselpunk, clockpunk).\n\n# Story\n\n""You are a troublemaker who have had a dream of exploring the world and maybe even chart the ""unknown territories"". You've just saved up enough to buy a flying machine and begin the life as a traveler.""\n\nAnd from there every Island has it's own ""main story"" and side quests. As every island has its own culture and people. There could also be quests that spans several islands. Or some islands where you have to complete the main quest to be allowed to leave.\n\nThe idea is that the story is a picaresque narrative. Picaresque narrative being an episodic style of fiction dealing with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero. \n\n# The World\n\nThe World would allow for a lot of different settings. Some Examples are:\n\n* Castles / temples like Laputa from The Castle in the sky.\n* Uncharted Islands of different biomes (snowy, tropical, pine forests, jungles, etc.)\n* Different kinds of cities based on different cultures\n\nThe paths between islands should also have different obstacles that you can upgrade your ship to handle or even exploit. Some examples are:\n\n* ""debris fields"" areas that are filled with dangerous junk ( to pass through unscathed your ship might need a shield.\n* Pirate zones. places where ""sky pirates"" are active (weapons would be used here to defend yourself).\n\n# Vehicles \n\nYour first flying machine is a small transport ship that you upgrade throughout the game. Upgrades like shields, carry capacity or weapons. \n\nYou earn smaller vehicles through main and side quests. Things like:\n\n* a smaller flying machine akin to a plane who are more  maneuverable that the main ship.\n* a jetpack for when you need that vertical maneuverability when exploring an island by foot.\n* Hoverboard/hoverbike for exploring the cities."

'Shield slam' can only be used by heavy armor classes.\n\n\nNot sure should be MMO or single player. \n\nsingle player would alleviate some balance issues, as less emphasis would be needed to keep things balanced. If players want to be overpowered, why not let them?

j6dtn0,a vr arcade simulator,"the gist is being able to simulate an arcade cabinet in vr. the games can all be thinly-disguised versions of real arcade games, and there should be an air hockey table, a ski ball machine, pinball, and maybe even a lazer tag™️ game!"
j6cagd,A raft-like game where you build and expand your own planet,"It's a game where you start on a very small planet and collect space wreckage to expand the size of your planet, also the player could make buildings, grow trees and improve the planet to make it attractive to potential colonizers and guests who can settle on this planet."
j6c7rf,Oregon Trail and then some,"I would like to see a new game that’s about the early stages of America. I would love an Oregon Trail type game but with actual 1st/3rd person adventuring. You find new plants and name them yourselves. Have to scavenge resources to survive. Encounter native Americans and befriend them or raid them. Or even something where you play as like a Lewis and Clark type explorer and you are making discoveries in the new world. Is that too much to ask for? Sounds like it would be a big project but I think many would enjoy it. Let me know if you have questions, I would love to discuss as this game idea has been mulling in my head for years."
j6bbr2,A slime life skills base game,"You start as a low life form, maybe a slime, but it does'nt really matter. You have three skill slot, mouvement, attack and extra. I was picturing something like terraria without the terraforming part, you can explore caves, castles, etc. But each minion you kill have a chance to drop their skill, like kill a frog, you might get the tongue attack (attack skill) or jump skill (movement). The skill would change the look of your caracther.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach time you die, you can keep one skill, and you have bosses hidden, like say on a mountain, but you need the climbing skill or flying skill to access it and other stuff like that, this way, you would seek out skills to explore further and become an unstopable machine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still thinking about what kind of inventory system and story. I'm not dead set on the 2d way too, i'm not sure i could pull of 3d but i could go on an isometric view from the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys have any other ideas?"
j6951i,Sixth Sense - multiplayer social deduction,"A multiplayer game played in first person, set in a creepy mansion. Players play as either ghosts or humans, with the twist: **everyone's identity is concealed and you don't know which team you are on**. Your own avatar is invisible to you. No nameplates are shown as well.\n\nPlayers spawn randomly and roam the mansion, trying to spot other players while being discrete. Once you are able to deduce your identity (e.g. from spotting other players, such as in a 3 ghosts vs 3 humans, you spot 3 different humans) you can commence to achieve your team's win condition. \n\n**Humans**: activate X number of collectibles to exorcise the ghosts for good before time runs out.\n\n**Ghosts:** attempt to kill off the humans. \n\nEveryone gets a knife that can kill humans in a swipe (not ghosts). Once humans are killed they are removed from the game. \n\nPlayers who deduce wrongly may hurt their team's chances. E.g. humans can chase other humans and kill them but that hurts their chances at winning. Ghosts can try to activate the collectibles which hurts their chances at winning. There could be a cooldown after making any successful kill, to ensure players make kills strategically.\n\nAt the end of the round, winning team is announced, everyone's identity is revealed, and key actions taken during the game (who activated what or killed who, including any actions done in mistake) are also announced.\n\nThe number of ghosts and players needs to be balanced for the deduction to work (else one side can easily guess if they spot everyone from the opponent team), with an edge granted to human numbers as ghosts can eliminate humans. The game seems doable with 2 players (just chase a human if you see it, and try to be sneaky if you aren't sure of your identity). Making the characters e.g. ghosts or humans very distinct (such as with bright colors) would make it easier for the opponent team, while making them similar would make it very tough for the opponent, so that could be one way to balance between ghosts and humans as well - I'm thinking for ghosts to look the same while humans to have distinct features. Although that might work in converse: if ghosts look the same the ghost team with team size &gt; 2 may find it even harder to determine that they are the ghost.\n\nThe game is expected to work without voice chat, but voice chat could introduce some hilarious twists and mindgames, although I'm not sure how useful it'll be. E.g. two friends A and B who play together in the game may agree to meet at a spot to tell each other who they see without harming each other. A who spots a ghost walking into the room may chicken out and hide, or try lying to B to mislead him into thinking that he's a human. \n\nAll the Among Us hype has me thinking about similar styles of social deduction gameplay. Keen to hear any thoughts on this and if there's any design flaws or areas to improve."
j68wjt,Let's talk Ambushes and Traps,"Context: Systemic 2D Stealth Action Game\n\nThroughout the late-game I'd like to have sections in which the enemies have created tricky set ups for the player to overcome.\n\nLike rooms that would trap you and start filling with deadly gas or getting crushed by the walls, belts that would send you into a chasm and stuff like that.\n\nThere would also be ambushes, the player being trapped in a room with guards swarming them and the player might be able to turn it around... and quite possibly have to play very defensively.\n\n#How to survive deadly traps of death\n\nThe most obvious way for the player to survive these traps would be the fact that the machines would trigger with any input. That means you could throw a guard's corpse in  there and go to a security room to open those doors again if you need to.\n\nIn addition, there could be items that could help the player, like a gas mask, long fall boots, parachutes, that kinda stuff.\n\n#Predicting\n\nObviously, the player would have to be able to somewhat predict that there is a deadly trap of death up ahead.\n\nWell, obviously I could task a NPC to talk about it, but it would start getting repititve if there's someone informing you that there is a trap every single time.\n\nBut, as I said in earlier posts... the enemies build the level while you're playing it. Or rather construction worker enemies.\n\nThat's right. They're gonna prepare a trap and you can break it by taking out that one guard with the activation mechanism or something along those lines."

j64aaf,"A battle Royale, but it's in a neighbourhood/town and the characters you play are neighbours","I'm kinda craving for a new battle royale game that isn't just a mundane shooter. I want mayhem and craziness. Something unique.\n\n\nThis game would comprise a selection of characters with different abilities. Every character will be able to interact with different things around the map and have an ability to summon an object, weapon or vehicle, e.g. Grandma with the ability to summon a modified mobility scooter that drives fast, or the dad with the ability to summon a large lawn mower to mow down the competition. All of these characters would have abilities that will give them an advantage in some way. Somebody could lock house doors to delay opponents from getting in whilst you prepare.\n\n\nThese characters could include:\n\nMum/ Dad\n\nSon/ Daughter\n\nGrandma/ Grandad\n\nPolice Officer\n\nAnd others like workers, a parkour guy FBI guy etc.\n\nSome objects can be picked up and used as weapons, like a baseball bat from the shed or a knife from the kitchen drawers. Machined weapons will obviously be scattered about the map for the players to use.\n\n\nDifferent parts of the map could have shops that you could walk into and purchase items like weapons, aid or vehicles, with the Mall giving you the best variety of items to choose from.\n\n\nI also considered a different way of starting the game, rather than jumping from the sky out of a plane (like almost every other battle royale) players could choose a location and pop out of a manhole cover from the ground at that location.\n\n\nAnyone else have any suggestions.\n\nMan I wish I could develop games"
j62w1n,A game in the spirit of the Air Warrior Games or Warbirds (or maybe even Homebrew DOSBox Games?),"I'm feeling a bit nostalgic, because I rediscoverd Air Warrior yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my suggestion is:\n\n\- A game in the spirit of Air Warrior or Warbirds (from 1996, I believe, another game from my childhood), with simple graphics (maybe slightly better, like Air Warrior 2 or 3, and of course much better resolution).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- A procedurally generated map like in the Worms games, with a randomized terrain and bases on random locations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- 3 or 4 factions (in AW it was simply A, B, C, D), color coded. Bases would, dependant on map size and amount of factions in the game, be divided evenly and also be color coded. Neutral bases would be gray (if the amount of bases is odd).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- You can pick your starting base. On the map (only those that belongs to your faction).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The game software is built up simple and accessible, allowing for modding or just custom skins (can not be used in online games unless you are the one hosting). In Air Warrior there was a menu point called ""Directories"" which specified the location of sprites and film recordings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The ability to record your own game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Simple game modes such as capture the base, air fights, bomber missions, races, and free flight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Airplanes mostly resemble WWI or WWII era planes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Maybe, for Nostalgia reasons, coded in C++ or maybe even Java. Game Engines are fine too I guess, but it's not the same really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Or even a Homebrew DOSBox game. There is already a small scene for Homebrew GB and GBA Games, so why not X86?"

j5z5kk,A Cowboy Samurai game.,"In the game you play as a Native American who has learned the ways and techniques of a cowboy and samurai master and has decided to mix them into his fighting style. The main mission in the story is basically the Cowboy Samurai taking down this big gang(I haven’t came up with a name for it yet) and some outlaws.If there were to be a sequel i would have it take place in Japan.The game would be a hybrid between a third person shooter and a hack and slash. Similar to RDR2 there would be an sort of deadeye in the game for projectile weapons. For melee there would also be a sort of deadeye except its like the sword slash in anime where the character hits a bunch of people then seconds later they drop down. Speaking of weapons the weapons would be a mix between american and japanese weapons. You can hold up to three weapons primary, secondary, and melee. Each weapon you can customize them the way you want it(except for melee).Some enemies may require you to use your guns while others you will need your sword. \n\n\nWell thats all the ideas i got for this. Feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below."

j5xh8k,Puzzle platformer that focuses on climbing a tower and delving into a submerged city.,"The game would have the player seek through the ruins of a skyward reaching tower for a key or devise that would allow them to go under water to search the ruins for a key or devise that will allow them to get higher in the above water ruins and so on and so forth. The player would slowly get upgraded allowing them to stay underwater for longer with the puzzle solving mechanics of Legend of Zelda or Darksiders that reward backtracking once you have the new tools that opens up new areas that have new upgrades.\n\nNo combat, just peaceful puzzle solving and platforming. I've never put much thought into the story of the game. I'd just love to play a game like this or make it myself one day."
j5w9pj,A game where you use randomly generated resources to conquer the galaxy in a 2D space shooter,"Basically, my inspiration started with me playing with Tinker’s Construct (a mod for Minecraft) and thinking “Wouldn’t it be cool to have random resources instead of having the same ones every single time? I always go for the same weapons every playthrough”. It evolved into an idea for a 2D space shooter like starblast.io that featured planets made from the custom resources that could be harvested to upgrade the ship’s weapons, armor, boosters, and the mining laser in different ways. \n\nLike Tinker’s Construct, your weapons, armor, etc, have different component parts like a battery, processor, etc that can each be made of a different material. Your ship starts out made of fairly common resources that have good enough stats to hold you down, but collecting different materials will be key to victory. Each material has properties like durability, conductivity, and melting point that determine their viability as different parts, as well as traits that give them special abilities; so a material like titanium would make a better booster frame than one similar to silicon, but silicon might make better heat shield plating or something. Maybe a resource named “Thor” makes batteries that hold lots of power, but “arbium” makes batteries with more efficiency. A “dor” laser core might ignite targets with its special trait, whereas “for” might freeze enemies solid. A resource’s rarity determines its maximum stats. \n\nExisting resources like titanium and silicon are predefined, however. That way, you don’t have scenarios where “gold” is red, a non-metal, and is super common. Random liquids and gases may or may not be a good thing to add, depending if they have enough use for things like fuel or chemical weapons.\n\nThe goal would either be to defeat the AI space pirates if it was single player, or the other players in a multiplayer setting. I guess the AI space pirates would likely appear in multiplayer as well, trying to amass their own materials and become the rulers of the galaxy themselves.\n\nLet me know what you think! I have no idea if such a gimmick is too similar to Tinker’s for copyright reasons (because you can actually copyright mods, apparently), however; so the resources would likely need some tweaking to make them feel more like their own thing rather than like a bootleg."
j5vmqi,"Battle royale, but you play as kids trick-or-treating on Halloween.","Battle royale, but you play as kids trick-or-treating on Halloween.  \n  \nIve been playing a lot of warzone, so it's similar to that, but all BRs seem to have a cycle of loot/eliminate teams/circle closes.  \n  \nYou ""loot"" houses to get candy. Use candy to buy nerf guns/ammo. Fight other teams with nerf guns to steal their candy. Easily monetizable with different costumes. Map is a town with like 50 blocks of resdiential houses.\n  \nMaybe: if you run out of candy, you're eliminated? Not sure about the specific mechanics but trick-or-treating fits really well with battle royale imo."

j5naj2,Game with multiple beginnings where starting a game will give you a random character. Death playing that character is permanent but consequences of their actions as well.,"I know, this would be like Octopath traveller but the idea is when you start a game, you'll thrown with a random character with random stats to work with. The game will have the same story objective regardless of your character. The twist though is that the character you played will be part of the world of the next character you play as (effects of their actions will be permanent in the world). This will go on until you finish the game or run out of characters (number of characters is predetermined and will have different stats and storyline).\n\nWhat do you think? When I thought about it at first, I really think it's complicated."
j5mlbr,RTS Faction Creep Hive,This is an idea for a RTS faction similar to the Zerg. Instead of spawning units that can freely move about the map this faction must grow tendrils out from its core hive to wherever it wants to exert influence. Growing these tendrils will have a minor resource cost and require a conscious decision by the player as to where these tendrils will go. \n\nAll the player's resource and fighting units must travel along these tendrils. If the tendrils connecting back to the main hive gets severed all units on the disconnected side go idle and don't defend themselves. If a connection back to the hive is restored the units reactivate. \n\nBalance wise this faction's units would probably have to be faster and tougher than the other factions to make up for the tactical limitations of imposed on the tendrils. Perhaps this faction will need an air or water unit that allows it to establish a 2ndary tendril hub separate from the central hive.
j5icel,A game about someone who can't feel pain,"Not sure if a game like this already exists but I'll take my shot.\n\nA game about a hero who doesn't flinch when struck but takes damage nonetheless. Well I think that's pretty much any game with a bad physics but here's the gist, you don't have a life bar. All you have are visual cues. You can enter a place with poisonous mist that should make your skin feel hot but your character will just stand oblivious of the damage his currently taking. Something akin to that, it's interesting how a game with that premise will be made. And to see you character dying without you knowing the cause unless you're paying attention and you just neglected to do the appropriate measures to solve the problem. \n\nAlso, if this will be a game with combat involved, a guy who can't feel pain would rip/damage his own arms and strike so hard he wouldn't even know if he has caused damage to himself (strike with more damage but with the repurcussion that you might cause damage to yourself) and you won't know if it's already too late because suddenly you can't even hold your own sword (something like that). I know this is all vague and I am just interested with that kind of mechanic. Because you as a player don't really feel the pain and it would be interesting to see you take care of your character, lol."
j5hl08,Multiplayer Post-WW2 Horror Shooter,"Looking for feedback on an idea I want to pursue:\n\n\n- A multiplayer PvP horror shooter set in an alternate reality 1966.\n\n\n- Maps set in various parts of the world, but all very spooky in their own way. Maps start off at sunset and turn dark.\n\n\n- Maps have hot spots with objectives that offer extra XP, benefits, and rare loot to attract players together.\n\n\n- Players choose weapons and gear from their individual inventories and fight it out solo or in teams. Dead players get their gear stolen. Players die permanently and lose all equipped skills, weapons, and gear. This makes death meaningful and stressful, but players can be revived from death up to 3x per game as long as 1 teammate is still alive.\n\n\n- Paranormal and unexplained anomalies occur randomly or as a result of player actions that either help or hurt players in specific ways. Ex: a UFO crash leaves super valuable loot in an open field. Ex: some parts of the map randomly heal players really slowly of their wounds. Ex: vampires stalk players in the woods if they break line of sight. Ex: Ghosts make footsteps to fake out players. Ex: players experience time travel. Ex: Sounds and lights in the distance to distract players etc. Basically weird and creepy stuff can occur, some good but some bad. None of it is game-breaking though.\n\n\n- NPC's can help or hurt players depending on player actions. Ex: the creepy palm reader lady that lives in an old horse-drawn carriage in the woods can either grant you a lot of XP for visiting her or steal XP if you draw a bad card. Of you torch her carriage her screams carry for a long time, giving your position away. Ex: a butler in the derelict mansion seemingly teleports around the house carrying helpful items if you can catch him.\n\n\n- Emphasis is for sure on gunplay, eliminating players, finding better gear, and the thrill of the fight with so much on the line, but the randomness and risk vs reward of certain things happening makes things spooky and a little different everytime."

j5crs7,A game where a human model is running towards you.,"So hear me out this, this game was inspired by the scene in “Get Out” where that one guy was sprinting towards the camera in a very menacingly pace. \n\nThe Plot of the game is just that idea. However, it’s sort of a psychological terror game. In the beginning the human model is very far away and he just looks like a dot. You have a gun that can only be loaded with one bullet at a time and reloading is fairly fast. As the game progress the dot is getting bigger and he’s running towards you but when you aim at him he’s doing anything to his physical power NOT TO TOUCH YOUR CURSOR or be in your line of sight. What makes the game even more frightening is that the sensitivity is locked, but he’s just avoiding your line of sight in a normal human way, he’s just very acrobatic. \n\nTo add a little bit of suspense, when’s he’s just the tiny dot. There’s music playing in the background that’s probably too high pitch for some people to here. But as he approaches the decibels get lower and lower AND LOWER UNTIL ITS JUST THE THX NOISE!\n\nNow to add a surprise factor. Sense this man is absolutely hard to shoot, once you shoot him! He hurls over and seems like he’s dead, but then he positions himself into a track starting pose and SPRINTS TOWARDS YOU! NOW HE REALLY WANTS TO KILL YOU. \n\nNow for the scare factor, there is no pop up or anything it’s all reliant on the suspense and Music of the game. Once he captures you it just restarts without you knowing and the music starts again as he approaches you. \n\nNow if you win, from shooting him a second time your character looks at his gun and cries, because you just killed an innocent man. You look back at the body and it’s gone. And the game restarts all over again\n\nThis Game could be an open workshop so you can add your own movement and skin towards the human model. And your own gun but it can only be loaded with one ammo/bullet. \n\nI’ll gladly take all the criticism because I just wanted to get this out of my head and save it for later when I have the talent to make this."

j5a4po,VR Cave Explorer,"Dark VR games are great and intense in my opinion. I really like games that have dark areas that require a flashlight to see (like some areas in Half Life Alyx). I would love a game that takes this idea and implements it further. \n\nTraversing a pitch-black cave in VR would be pretty intense. I think it would be interesting to only be able to see what your flashlight allows. Maybe the game could allow you to find items such as flares, flashlight batteries, a head mounted helmet flashlight, etc. Wielding a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other creates for some exciting combat experiences imo.\n\nThis idea could also create a good roguelike. Maybe the the cave you traverse could be randomized. You could find shrines with different items/perks. And the items you find (flares, batteries, ammo, etc) would be randomized."

j56l42,Idea time: Knifefighter Online (VR),"The basic idea is that you and an opponent are in a somewhat small arena with the choice of one or two knives to wield. You can only use knives because it would be the easiest to use and there wouldn't be much balance that has to be done. You can fight someone online or locally and you have to hit someone's weak points with lots of momentum to deal max damage. You can control where your weak points are, which adds some strategy to where you have to hit. Your attacks will land in your opponent and won't move anywhere until you get it out of their body. That is all right now.\n\nTL;DR, you use VR controllers as knives to attack someone's weak points."

j53v68,"Game where going back to previous saves changes the most recent/main ""save"".","Perhaps a 3D platform puzzle game where you have to move ladders/blocks to different locations across multiple saves in order to progress. Or possibly something more abstract with complete changes in environment. Maybe even an RPG where you need to go back and rescue different characters in specific moments to advance the story.\nOf course, there will have to be a weird system in order to track saves successfully. An overarching global save that ""saves"" your other ""saves"" individually while creating a separate slot for the save with the most progression. \nUnsure if this has been done before, or if it could even be executed thoroughly enough to be a full game."
j53mlh,Game where you drive through BLM protestors in big trucks,"I might even make this with my limited Unity knowledge. So you get a car or truck, and you choose the protestor type (blm, antifa, anti Trump and whatnot) and you start on a street with a massive group of protesters in the street. They act like typical zombies (running towards you and when they get close enough to your car they start bashing it with skateboards and bicycles). You drive through them with cars and trucks going fast or slow. When they get hit it activates ragdoll physics. You can get points for more protesters hit. If you are in the POV camera mode then you get a gun. If the protesters are too close to the truck for too long they will pull the door open and you will start taking damage. If you fire the handgun they all run away from you. From there it becomes a first person shooter if you want, or you can drive away. The goal is to reach the end of the road, marked by flag or line. The protesters can get more and more violent as you progress through the game. You can customize your truck with Trump 2020 flags and American Flags. Maybe a multi-player mode could be added too. \n\nI think this is a great idea for a game and I might make it myself. I know how to use unity and have made several games in the past but I would have a lot to learn if I wanted to add everything here. \n\nThe idea came to me after seeing BLM attacking a truck that was trying to drive down the highway. They shouldn't have been in the highway to begin with. They acted JUST LIKE zombies in a typical zombie game. \n\nI absolutely love this idea."
j53ht7,An MMA RPG where you not only create your character's stats but learn and collect moves from several different fighting styles,"So I've recently been getting back into my previous passion of practicing martial arts and self defense so once I got this idea my mind has been racing. \n\nI had an idea for this 3D fighting game (I'm thinking the art style should be 32 bit to keep it simple) that is grounded in reality for the moves, so no fireballs or teleports or such. When you create a male or female character (mixed fights will be available) you'll be able to set your character's stats:\nStrength determines power on your attacks\nEndurance determines your max health and limb health\nSpeed not only determines how fast you sidestep or dash, but also how fast your moves can come out, including blocking.\nDexterity will decrease the time needed to parry as well as be the main stat needed for training more difficult moves and styles.\n\nBut the main star of the game will be the fighting styles. You can choose to spend points both when you start a character and when you level up for ""experience"" in a fighting style or even multiple fighting styles. As you learn more from an art you retain more of that styles moves and combos. Theoreticallyno move should conflict with another but you can always ""deselect"" moves you learned and have no intention of using. This way you can either stick to one style or make a combination from many arts to form your own style! The fighting styles to choose from, there's boxing, kickboxing, karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Judo, and i would like some ""out there"" styles like Keysi and Kali. Each style has their own strengths and weaknesses. Keep in mind that even though its an RPG, it is a fighting focused game, not a stats focused game. You still need to know how to utilize your moves effectively.\n\nWhile the game is story/single player focused, there's an arena mode where you can fight other players, with other players watching similar to Mortal Kombat's King of the Hill mode.\n\n\n\nOTHER NOTES:\nThe story will be more about underground fighting. You can also choose what story you want with the ""What do you fight for?"" Setting when developing a character, with those options being: For respect, For Love, For Revenge.\nThere are a lot of characters to talk to, not all of them fighters. And you can improve or diminish your standing with them by talking, doing certain tasks, or fulfilling requirements in fights. Your relationships will determine the branching paths of the story, which will lead to different endings. Also characters you might think are good in one type of story like ""For Respect"" might be different in another type of story like ""For Revenge""."
j52pe9,"Die Hard, with elements of Among Us, Tarkov, and Payday","The main map is Nakatomi Plaza, a skyscraper with several floors.\n\nAll players but one are terrorists. Their job is to complete several tasks around the map to complete their heist. The other player is John McClain (the saboteur), who spawns randomly on the map. Their job is to kill all the terrorists, or make conditions that allow the police to overrun them.\n\nThere are enough tasks around the map that naturally the terrorists will need to split into groups. The two most important tasks are maintenance: control intermittent SWAT attacks on the bottom floors (SWAT are bots), and guard the hostages. The terrorists are on a soft time limit to complete their tasks -- the bot waves attack intermittently and start small, but become more aggressive and plentiful as time passes. Eventually, this will require more resources from the terrorists and eventually overrun them. Bot aggression spikes prematurely if the hostages are freed by the saboteur, so guarding them is mission critical.\n\nThe saboteur will lose most engagements that aren't an ambush 1v1 or (possibly) 1v2. Their main advantage is mobility: they can hop between floors and rooms very quickly using rappel and vents, while terrorists are stuck with stairs and elevators. A large group of terrorists jumping from task-to-task is a bad fight for the saboteur, but they can break up these groups by hopping between floors and creating distractions that require the group to split up into two or more areas (ala Among Us and o2 sabotage.) For example, they can fuck with the bomb on the roof, reactivate power to the safe, sabotage the escape vehicle, etc. If the terrorists do not split up to deal with these new tasks, they will be so bogged that they will not have time to finish everything before the bots start to overwhelm. However, the saboteur needs to be careful of where they sabotage! Some sabotage tasks take more time than others, and some rooms have cameras that will notify terrorists of your location after a certain amount of time. Getting caught in the process of sabotaging puts McClain in a very bad position because they will probably lose against a coordinated ambush.  \n\nFor terrorists to win, they need consistent coordination between groups and clever management of their resources. Chasing the saboteur is a strategy, but not necessarily viable if the saboteur is good at using their mobility to escape detection.\n\nFor McClain to win, they need to pick engagements wisely and gather intel about where the terrorists are (and where they will likely go next). Surviving the early game is challenging because of your bad starting loadout and small bot distractions, but if you aggressively divert or even ambush terrorists at the right times you will snowball into victory.\n\nFull games take approximately 20-30 minutes."

j4xglt,"Battle Royale Night Edition, With elements of survival (Zombies)","So, I have this idea for quite awhile now, but haven't posted it since I needed to iron out all of its details until it's fairly complete. It's not going to be a short post so just bear with me here.\nI've been playing the BR genre for some time now, and while I'm not a huge fan (playing MOBAS mostly) I do have a couple dozen hours or so on PUBG (I don't play fortnite, never really gotten into it)\n\nOne thing is missing in my opinion, in the genre, and I realized what it was, at least for me. The thrill and excitement of the first time that you're playing a battle royale, quickly changes into just competition as you play it more often. And while by itself it isn't really a bad thing, I do believe that I takes away a big chunk of the experience and simply turns it into an almost tedious task, which makes it hard for any BR game with maintaining a stable player count without the players ditching for other games.\nAnd so here's my idea. A BR game that should get your blood pumping and your heart racing more than once, or twice. Each play through should feel unique, and here's how.\n\nPLOT:\n\nThe game has a light plot (or story) behind it. The year is 2046, the entire population of the world got infected in a virus that basically turned majority of the population into zombies. If that is not enough, the planet's rotation had extremely slown down, leaving half the planet in an almost eternal darkness, and limited resources. Earth Is no longer a suitable place to live on.\nSome people discovered that they are in fact immune to the virus, and therefore now have to fend for themselves amidst all the chaos. Other than those, a special unit of police forces was kept alive as well (using special equipment that allows them to survive, like gas masks), in order to try and prevent the remaining civilians from killing each other while trying to get resources in every way possible, including killing, which leads me to the two classes the game has:\n \nCLASS SYSTEM: AUTHORITY VS REBELLION\n\nLike I just mentioned, the game will be divided into two groups, in which players will be able to engage in. The first group will be the rebellion, these are the citizens who stayed alive, are armed, and ready to go hunting and scavenging for supplies.\nThe second group will be the authority, which as you already guessed, the police task force that was sent to eliminate the rebellion. However, the Authority can turn on each other and they don't have to follow some code of friendly fire, this is the end of the world after all, meaning that teams and players from the Authority WILL have to face other teams from their side and vice versa.  Please note that while it sounds like Authority will have the advantage in terms of weapons and technology, the game is meant to be balanced enough to a point where it won't matter which role you'll end up getting, and the differences between the two classes will only include slight advantages in both ways.\nThe game will allow a single player team and up to 4.\nIn order to create an organic gameplay, players (or teams) won't be parachuted into the map, but instead will be randomly placed and scattered on it in various locations, in order to prevent rushing to the same spots and locations right at the get go. Let's talk about the map shall we?\n \nMAP AND ENVIORONMENT:\n \nThis is basically the core of the game, and the most important aspect of it as well. The map size will be around 10x10 square kilometers, and will be consisting mostly of a large city in the middle, a sprawling urban area with lots of buildings and a suburb area, all being either abandoned or swarming with zombies. Around the city there will be some open areas with a lake, a river and some tiny villages here and there. The time of the day, as you guessed it, will be at night. But it won't just be a night as it appears in most games – I'm talking about an almost pitch-black night, with only the light from the moon, your flashlight or a working streetlight guiding your way. Most of the city is under complete darkness, some streetlights are working here and there, but players will be able to shoot them and decrease the visibility in that area. Imagine being chased by a rebel, you both running in the street and he's after you. finally you reach a dead end and have nowhere to go. You realize you're in a light zone area, you shoot the nearest streetlamp and it all goes dark. Suddenly you have the advantage, you hide behind a car and surprise that motherfucker with a rail of bullets to the neck. The idea of darkness has a big impact on how the game will play, since there are other entities in the world other than rebels and Authority – and I'm talking about the zombies.\nThe zombies themselves can be attracted to players both by hearing them or seeing their light emitting sources (flashlights, laser targeting devices etc) so it won't be too wise to just open fire at every occasion you have, because it'll draw a lot of unwanted attention, from both players and zombies. It basically means that if you enter a building, and find a good spot to snipe someone, you should take into consideration that there might be a passing zombie horde down in the street, and your shot might give them an excuse to enter and check out the building when you're in it, leaving you the choice to either jump for it or try to fight your way down the halls, killing everyone in your way. Imagine how scary it can be to enter a nice lonely suburb house, search for some ammo, and have a zombie charge at you from one of the dark rooms, and you have to fight that fucker or make a run for it. Without knowing what can be hiding right across the street, right across that room or just a floor above you in the same building,  players will stay on their feet the entire playthrough or until they die. The game won't feature an active map (in the corner of the screen), so it means that if one of your team members lost his way while searching for stuff, the entire team will have to help him getting back together or try to save him if he gets caught, based on environment description only. Zombies will be present in various ways across the map. They can go solo and roam around, or they can come as a horde, which will force the players to make quick decisions on how to get around from point A to point B. another thing to point up regarding the city – most if not all the buildings and houses should be completely accessible, giving the players the chance to both search for items and find shelter during their playthrough. \n \nWEAPONS AND ITEMS:\n \nThe weapon range and variety in the game will be rather big, ranging from light pistols to some heavy-duty machine guns and sniper rifles. Various attachments can be found and equipped on the weapons seized, and some of them will include scopes, laser targeting sights and more. RPG's, grenades and C4's will also be present. Night vision equipment will be in the game, but getting ahold of it is going to be incredibly hard in order to preserve the balance of the game, so these kinds of items would be very rare and not easy to find to begin with. It's also important to stress that both classes will start the session with some items and weaponry from the get-go, including at least one melee item in order to have a chance against zombies in the early game.\nOther items in the game will include various types of foods to regenerate health and stamina, different types of shoes (some really quiet which is useful, other less quiet but increase your running speed, good for other situations) and also armor vests helmets. Each player will also have a flashlight right at the beginning of the match, the batteries on these can run out but you can find new ones along the way. The use of flashlights is not always recommended, and for obvious reasons. However, if you want to signal your location to a team member, this can be a good way to do it if they got far.\nThe game will have some cars, but even if you or your team manages to get a working one, you'll probably want to drive with the lights off to avoid detection as much as possible, if the sound of the engine won't turn you in first. Some cars won't have gas, but it is possible to find gas and use it for that purpose.\n \nEND GAME AND VICTORY\n \nLike in other BR games, the last surviving player or team wins the match. However, the game won't feature the traditional ""circle"" that pushes players towards a randomly selected center, and instead will overrun some areas with so many zombies, that players will have to get away from those areas and find new places to settle, until eventually players from all across the map will find each other roaming the streets and houses and close fighting encounters break here and there, as often as the game progresses till the very end. Matches should take between 30 to 40 minutes and sometimes even more. I don't want the matches to be too short, and I want each player to play at their own pace in order to build up the tension and enjoy the immersion of having to fend for your own, unassisted majority of the time.\n \nSo that's pretty much it, that's my dream concept for a battle royale, and I'm pretty sure it'll be a very controversial concept for many, specifically because of the night setting. But I can assure anyone who's worried about it, that it can be super refreshing comparing to what we have today. It poses a way bigger challenge because not only players will be struggling with a lot less visibility, they'll have to differentiate from other players to zombies, not an easy task under all circumstances. Tell me what you guys think, and if you have any questions feel free to ask them below, I'll do my best to answer. Thanks for reading!"

j4t7a8,bio- besiege. A creature engineering game.,"Pretty ambitious idea, have no clue how it would be made, just an idea. \n\nThe concept in summary, inspired by the movie ""The Thing"" and the game besiege. Similar to besiege, but instead of machinery, you are using living tissue to shape a creature. \n\nGameplay consists of building up biomass of various types, using that living material to shape your abomination, and controlling your abomination as it hunts for more prey.\n\nThere would be two main modes of gameplay, the action adventure mode, and the creature creator mode.  \n\n\nWhen in the creature creator menu you can change you creature in many different ways. adding limbs, moving around bones, growing new organs. Depending on how you shape your creature, depends on its performance while you control it. Not adding enough limbs, or strong enough legs will cause you to move slow, or be immobile. Adding jutting bone from a swinging limb could be used as a effective weapon. Or growing more brains and hearts to increase your overall performance.\n\nThe game could be played casually, making a creature that is simple in design but effective. Or you could dive into the more complicated. Example of simple would be a creature that has large horns and rams prey to impale them. More complicated would be a creature who through a series of muscle groups and joints, spits sharp bones as a deadly ranged attack.\n\nAs you explore in your environment, you have to adapt to it, legs capable of climbing vertically, protection from new enemies like a shell or thick skin, and new weapons to kill your prey when what your using stops being effective.\n\nThats pretty much it."

There should be at least 10 people in your hometown by default, i think it would be a good idea if they had different personality traits, opinions on each other, and different ideas on how they should handle this. Perhaps one of your people will rebel against your orders because they believe their own idea works better. The main focus of the game should be on both making good decisions in terms of management and controlling the people you are leading so they dont mess up.\n\nAnd of course food would be scarce so youd have to send people out to scavenge, maybe they can also find weapons and stuff to reinforce the town with or other people who have been surviving here like you have.\n\nMaybe when the military does come back there should be different endings depending on what you did, like if you didnt kill any of the enemy soldiers and just had your people hide and scavenge then maybe the enemy country wins the war or something like that.\n\nIdea kinda just came into my head I thought id post it here, maybe add other small features like mapping out the surrounding area over time."

itdq60,Transformers: Hero Shooter concept,"If there’s two things in this world that I love dearly it’s the Transformers franchise and Rainbow 6 Siege. My dream video game would see these two properties combine into a true labor of love project: Transformers Warzone.\n\nCore Gameplay Loops: Sieges influence will mostly be from the idea of unique characters with slightly customizable but fairly distinct loadouts or kits. The tactical gameplay wouldn’t compliment the Transformers franchise well, instead more traditional arcade hero shooters like Overwatch. Classic G1 transformers had character bios on their packaging that generally detailed their “stats” but more importantly outlined special abilities and weapons which will be the foundation for the unique kits. While Siege has Attackers and Defenders, TFW will of course feature Autobots vs Decepticons. Standard game modes like TDM, capture and hold flags, and possibly a payload mode similar to TF2s just for some variety. I like the idea of having 3rd person and 1st person options but for simplicity’s sake if I had to choose I’d say 3rd person only. As far as actual minute to minute gameplay goes, gunplay would be weighty but still have a fluid arcadey feel, kinda hard to articulate via text but I suppose the closest example would be the War For Cybertron/Fall Of Cybertron games mixed with the more immediate feedback of a game like TF2 or Overwatch. No strafing in vehicle modes, one of the issues I had with the WFC/FOC games was how transforming didn’t have a huge impact since you were basically still in robot mode just with a sprint button. I want transforming to be a give and take system, sacrificing combat for mobility. Weapons would still be featured in vehicle mode but would require more finesse to use. Transformers with animal modes would essentially be sacrificing that mobility for alternate ways to fight or support their teams. Team sizes would vary but the default would be 6 and a big team battle mode would have 10. Duplicate characters would be allowed. Characters would also have melee attacks in addition to their weapons and abilities.\n\nThe characters: this is the lifeblood of the whole project, the characters of the Transformers universe are a match made in heaven for a hero shooter with all of them having distinct silhouettes, personalities, and weapons. I think it’s important to not only draw from Generation 1 but from all eras and corners of the TF universe. As a game conceived by a fan for fans I think it’s crucial to have representatives from all major series although I won’t lie G1 will def have the most representation. I can list the characters in the comments but I’d like to launch with around 30 characters. Further updates would add more characters for free. To give a better idea of the characters and the variety I’ll list 3 Autobots and 3 Decepticons \nA1: Rhinox. Aside from G1 I’d say the Beast era is one of the most beloved eras of the TF franchise with Rhinox being among the most fondly remembered. His weapons would be his chainguns and his special ability would be a ramming shoulder charge.\nA2: Hot Shot. While the Unicron Trilogy may have suffered from poor translations and shoddy animation there’s still a lot to like about that era. Hot Shot, the now almost mandatory kid appeal character, grew to be a fairly well liked character and I think works well as a representative from this time. Weapon is an energy pistol, special ability is his hidden cannon on his back.\nA3: Windblade. The first fan created bot featured in the IDW comic books, Windblade is a great addition to the universe. Gameplay wise her weapons would be her swords, she would be exclusively melee. Her special ability would be her jump jets which would allow her to reach places other characters can’t. \n\nD1: Scorponok. That’s right, even the Japanese series of transformers are a possibility. This version of Scorponok is from the Headmasters era. His special ability would be to shoot venom darts out that do damage over time with his primary weapons being his claw cannons. \nD2: Sky-Byte. The oft-forgotten Robots In Disguise from 2001 gave way to this beloved Predacon. A lover of strategy and poetry, Sky-Bytes weapon would be his Fin Gun while his special ability would be torpedoes hidden in his shark tail arm. \nD3: Lockdown. Transformers Animated was a breath of fresh air when it came out, with stylish designs and a deceptively dark storyline. One of the key players in later seasons was Lockdown, a bounty hunter with a brutal streak. His main weapon would be his plasma hook which he could use to grab Autobots and strike them from afar or reel them in. His special ability would be his EMP Block which would disable enemy abilities for a short time.\n\nFurther Details: this section will be bullet pointed mostly for clarity but also just because it covers a variety of finer points and details.\n-Monetization: while the labor of love that is this project is reward enough, obviously people gotta eat and the game would need to be sustainable. I picture the game either being free to play or having a reduced cost, maybe $20 or $30 but that would be pushing it. There’s no story mode or really anything outside of collectibles/galleries and the core gameplay modes (at launch anyway). Cosmetics would be the key here, palette swaps would be the easy route but the fun thing about transformers is several characters exist in different eras and universes of the TF mythos and these alternate versions could function as “legendary” skins. Like the Alpha Pack system of Siege, TFW would have a similar pack system awarded by leveling up and winning games. \n-Abilities and the idea of influence: so something key I think is important is no “ultimate” abilities. I don’t like the idea of pressing a button and wiping an enemy team. 1 ability with relatively long cool downs feels like it would be a better approach both in terms of encouraging creativity and not lowering the skill ceiling. \n-Maps and objectives: so while writing this I noticed how most Autobot abilities tend to be more utilitarian or defense based while Decepticons generally have more aggressive abilities. While the other game modes above would certainly be included I think the main game mode should be an attack the base/defend the base mode. Autobots would always be the defenders, Decepticons always the attackers. Maps could range from various eras of TF but the showcase map would be The Battle Of Autobot City, a pseudo retelling of the same battle from the 1986 movie. Similar to, say, Team Fortress 2 or Star Wars Battlefront, the attacking team would have faster respawns but ofc the map would be built against them, while the defenders would have longer respawns but have more chokepoints and possibly defensive structures. Something else I’ve considered and may be more open to is MOBA style minions that spawn in, a PvEvP addition similar to Monday Night Combat or even Destiny 2s gambit mode to an extent. \n\nThere’s some ideas I haven’t fleshed out yet (Minicons, combiners and if they could even work, etc) and would love to hear suggestions and just general feedback. This was honestly really fun to write out and made me wish I had a way to visualize  but hey that’s the fun of this subreddit I guess."
itco51,Tropico but it is set in the Medieval Time Era,"Just as the title says. I would love to play Tropico as a Midieval time era. I want to build an empire and also be threatened by other empires but also have to deal with citizen's problems and such. One of my favorite games was metropolismania so if there is an aspect of walking around to chat with townspeople. Would really love to have this, maybe its already out there."

ita1m5,What do you think about this Naruto game idea?,"So i came up with this idea and it felt pretty interesting to me. So I thought of a VR Naruto game. And the idea is this,it will be a battle game where every justu has a normal level(which means you have to be that level to use it) and a difficulty level. To use that kind of jutsu you have to KNOW how to do the hand signs,and it will activate when you finish the hand signs, which means the faster you do the hand signs,the faster you will use it in a fight. \n  How do you move? \n  As maybe some of you know, the japanese(i think) have invented an infinite treadmill and I thought that would be interesting to dodge other jutsu \n  I know that the VR sistem only has a stick to represent the hand in the game,but maybe in some time it will be like a glove or smth\n  (Btw i am not a game developer(yet)or anything, i just thought this would be really cool)\n   I have a lot of ideas about the concept of this game but i just wanted to know how do y all feel about this?"
it2y9c,Wolfenstein Russia,"The Wolfenstein game series has taken place in a lot of interesting parts of the world during WW2. However, it has never gone to Russia. I know that Russia isn't the only country it hasn't gone to but to me it is probably the most interesting idea for a Wolfenstein game. The already drab and depressing looking cities could have a lot of potential for the Wolfenstein aesthetic. There could also be a lot of cool weapon ideas that take inspiration from the AK. I don't know, just a thought."
it1cvz,Mech Mechanic Simulator,"The title says it all (mostly).\n\nA 3d, first person, simulator where you rebuild and refurbish mechs in a similar vain to Tank Mechanic Simulator or Car Mechanic Simulator. From small industrial power lifters to gargantuan military weapons.\n\nIn order to get parts and money, there is a trade system and jobs board. Some jobs will simply be build, repair, or refit. Other jobs could entail piloting a mech in a small mercenary battle or in some industrial or construction setting.\n\nThese jobs can be completed with the employer's mech (for a pay cut) or with one of your personal mechs that you build from the ground up throughout your career. \n\nThere could also be a tool/workshop upgrade feature. Make your shop bigger to allow you to work on larger projects, get better tools to increase work speed and quality for better payouts or improved stats for your personal mechs.\n\nFirst time posting here so lemme know what you think. Anything you would remove/add/tweak?"
isz9bo,A game where the boss scales in difficulty the more quests/time you take getting to them.,"Not really a game concept in itself, and this might have been done to some degree already?\n\nThe main issue i have with a lot of open world RPGs is that if you take your time and finish all the side quests you end up being extremely powerful and basically one shotting the main boss.\n\nBut what if time wasn't on your side? It could be that you could go straight to the boss at any time (akin to BotW) but if you take your time the boss ""levels up"" as well and by the time you get to them they're a harder version then what you would have fought earlier. \n\nIn my opinion this would give a sense of danger in preparation, but also wouldn't make the end boss feel like a wimp. \n\nThis could be tied to game difficulty in some way as well?\n\nWhat do yall think?"
isy7o3,A futuristic parkour game,"Let it be known that I have no idea if a game like this actually exists. I checked Steam prior to this post, and I couldn’t really find anything. Anyway, here’s my pitch.\n\nI’m imagining a game similar to Ubisoft’s Hyper Scape in its mobility and graphic elements. I really enjoy the game, yet I think something with a bigger parkour focus could be more my speed than a Battle Royale, and I think some others might agree. I picture the same power-up type mechanic, and like the idea of sprinting through buildings, trains, etc.\n\nThat’s all I have to say at the moment, and, while it’s just a really bland concept, I think it might have some potential. I have no experience in game design, and I don’t plan to make this myself (nor am I asking anyone else to do it).\n\nPlease let me know if/when this’ll be a thing.\n\nHave a nice day!"

islruo,Fireboy and Watergirl 3d Remake Multiplayer,"For the 90's kids who grew up in Y8, Fireboy and Watergirl is a platform puzzle game. The partner collects elemental crystals, avoid obstacles, and simply reach the exit. The twist is some objects are only obstacles to you but not your partner, e.g. only Fireboy can swim in lava, only Watergirl can use blue buttons. This exclusivity gives some pretty cool scenarios and puzzle sequences. For a kid, it's a very good brain-training game.\n\nBut most of those kids are adults now, they would want something more appropriate. The old game was just a 2d platform puzzle. Now, imagine how fun would that be, playing as Fireboy, avoiding your obstacles while helping Watergirl get over hers, like the old days, but in 3D. Maybe, throw in Airgal and Earthdude in the game too, so there's 4 of you.\n\nThere might already be 3D platform puzzle coordination games, but Fireboy nd Watergirl is already a classic, at least maybe from where I grew up. This could be nostalgic and nice if done right. :)"
islejm,Mobile Carrier &amp; ISP Tycoon,"Hi,\n\nI am planning to start developing a tycoon style game about running an Mobile Carrier/ISP, in a few month.\n\nFocus will on the business managing an economical leadership of our company.\n\nSetting will be in one big city ,3D - low poly style.\n\nThere should be AI competitors to play against, but I ve got huge respect implementing that.\n\nIn that city you will have to place antennas at the optimal places to reach as many people while keeping an eye on your infrastructural cost. Same will apply for running copper or fiber cables. U ll also have to spend money researching new hardware and technologies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere will be a big focus on the realism side, but also stripped down. I wont be able to do a city skylines style or a self growing city.  I think it will be a fixed city with sub urban parts and parks too, to cover much diversity in needs of people. I dont rule out that the city need will be dynamic which will force our management to adjust its infrastructure accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you like to share any ideas u would like to see in such a game like ( stock market, ability to offer different plan and even prepaid sim cards)  Please add your dream mico management visions...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncheers \n\nFrancis"

isj2ra,An unrealistic game in need of a stupid story.,"Hi there, I'm working on a game inspired by Baldi's Basics.\n\nI'm searching for a fitting story about the game. \n\nThe name of the game is Boneless Bobby, it's also the name of the main enemy.\n\nI really like the name, but I haven't figured out who the enemy is exactly is.\n\nThe looks of the game is very 'meme' and the art style is sort of 'bad' on purpose.\n\nThe whole game isn't meant to be taken seriously and is very random.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some WIP screenshots of my game: [https://imgur.com/a/LQGp1fY](https://imgur.com/a/LQGp1fY)\n\nThis is a mix of some rooms, halls and AI's that I'm showing, there's a big chance that the final product will differ a lot!\n\nFirst let me tell you what the game is about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe player starts in a building.\n\nThe building is randomly generated and consists of large halls leading to different rooms.\n\nEach room contains a simple object that represents a puzzle, when the player clicks on this object a 2D puzzle appears. \n\nThe player has to complete the puzzle in order to get an object\*.\n\nAfter completing a x\*\* amount of puzzles, the player is able to leave the building and finish the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever there are multiple AI's making it hard for you to escape the building.\n\nThere's the main enemy, whenever he touches you, you are 'death' and the game restarts. \n\nAnd there's multiple other AI's, they can't 'kill' you, but will obstruct you in getting to the rooms.\n\nFor example one AI is able to freeze you for a few seconds if he is close,\n\nthis makes it so the main enemy/AI is able to get to you and then you're done.\n\nThe main enemy wanders everywhere and the other AI's only wander through the hallways.\n\nThe map will contain different elements besides AI that can help or obstruct the player to get to his location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you know that the game isn't trying to be realistic and logical but rather funny and stupid,\n\nI'm looking for a fitting suggetsions to make the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- What exactly is the building the player is in? (Is it a fantasy house? Is it a meme prison?)\n\n\- Why is the player in this building? (Was he captured because his memes were to bad? Is he dreaming? Perhaps he was summoned there because he ate all the boneless pizza wings?)\n\n\- Who is the main enemy aka Boneless Bobby? (Why is he boneless? Where could his name come from?)\n\n\- What kind of objects has the player to collect in order to leave the building? (Does he have to collect skulls, apples, photo's of Karens?)\n\n\- If the player got all the objects, what should he do with the objects? \n\n(Does he have to deliver them to a certain person in a room who gives him the key to escape or do something else?\n\nDo all the objects together form a code that he needs to fill in to escape?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\* I haven't determined what the object will be that the player has to collect.\n\n\*\* It isn't determined how much puzzles the player has to solve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a basic story before I started developing this game, but I didn't like my own story. That's why I'm asking you guys to fill in the open gaps I'm stuck with now.\n\nI'm curious on what you guys can come up with!"
isgvih,3D Shipbuilding and management Company Simulator,"Im a very big maritime enthusiast and i got this idea years ago. Im sorry if my english is not good on this, im not a native speaker, so im sorry if there are mistakes. A game where you control a ship company (transatlantic only, set in the late 1800s and through the 1900s with 3d graphics) Example: White Star Line in the 1900s, or Cunard Line today. I will go throught this by topics:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How the game would work: You start naming your company, then you choose a starting country (UK, USA, France or Germany). You can design your ship with pre-made models of the hull. Example: Small Bow, Medium Bow, Large Bow, etc. And they can be unlocked by research with research points (that are gain with building ships and searching other companies ships) or as the eras go through. Both singleplayer and multiplayer would be available. \n2. Exterior Design: This tool would show a shipyard and you start the construction of your ship. You have multiple hull options (small, medium and large and diferent models throught the eras) and you would be able to make a few changes in the design, but nothing extreme. You can scretch the ship or increase its lenght if you please (to a certain extent, of course). Details: Windows (portholes or diferent sized windows), enclosed or opened promenades, small polls, funnels (also small, medium and large), lifeboats and railings in desired areas, crow's nest, etc. You can also the ships painting can be customized with a color wheel. You can also name your ship.\n3. Interior Design: This tool would show you options of areas you want to do on the ship, such as lounges, smoking rooms, dining rooms, stairs, relaxing areas (like Turkish Baths on Titanic), kitches and bathrooms. There would be 5 wall designs: Wood paneling, wallpapers, tilings, iron and plain wood. There would also be flooring designs: tiling, wood and carpet. Furniture: Normal furnitures, like fireplaces, couches, tables, etc. All these would have a color wheel as well. New furnitures and designs would be unlocked throught the eras. Each furniture would be set as their marked interior (Lounge would only have couches, chairs, fireplaces, etc).\n4. Eras: There would be three eras at the passing of time: Victorian, Edwardian and Art Deco. Victorian Era would be in the beggining of the game, then Edwardian and Art Deco. The styles and eras affect your ship's rating and potentially, its success. Opinions matter for your company to profit and thrive over your competition. Example: A Edwardian styled ship in the Art Deco wouldn't be as popular and profitable as a Art Deco styled ship. After the Art Deco era ends, the game's story also ends and the Sandbox would be unlocked.\n5. Sandbox: Its a sandbox. You can do whatever you want without worrying about money. Opinions still matter, but you can lock the game in the era you prefer.\n6. Competition: In the game's story, there will be four main companies that compete with you (Their names are random, it can be White Star Line, Cunard Line and fictional companies too). Through the entirety of the game you will want to keep being the in the first place of the companies ranking that are composed of how many ships you have and how good are they rated. This will have a direct impact on your company's profit. You can also buy other companies by a certain amount of price.\n7. Routes: Routes are a very important aspect. Routes will have a public interest  porcentage to them. Example: Public Interest in the London - New York is in 80%. When choosing a route, you click on the Map button and the world map will open with the main ports on the world in each continents, some continents may have more routes then others. \n8. Rating: The public ratings are released after the ship's maiden voyage. Bathrooms, interior designs, cabins, size, safety, lighting, speed and stability are factors that influence the ratings. \n9. Publicity: You can spend money on publicity to increase the expectations to the ship.\n10. Events: In voyages, events may happen. Such as fog, storms, sinkings, etc.\n11. Propulsion: Ships have multiple propulsion forms, such as propellors, turbines, coal power/steam power, etc.\n12. Management: You can edit your ship's crew as you like. You can't edit your crew during voyages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to build on this idea, feel free."
isez2j,Evil Dead video game,I imagine this game to be Sekiro meets uncharted. Since Ash has shown multiple times that he sort of has a hard time killing deadites this game will be sekiro levels of hard. Im not sure what the story could but maybe someone steals the Necronomicon and Ash has to hunt the person who stole to get the book back. You fight deadites and the bosses will be some demons.

isbe92,Time Traveling Detective Game,"You are part of the Synchronatic Defense Agency and its your job to preserve history and to ensure what should happen does happen. \n\nThere are various criminals, some accidental and some purposeful, who travel the time stream and change things, screwing up history to disastrous results if not stopped. \n\nYou have to go to different periods of history and piece together who the culprit is and how thy will or have screwed up history using clues in a kind of ""LA Noire"" style of piecing things together. \n\nYou also have to determine how to deal with them. You have different options and tech at your disposal but, of course, if you use it on the wrong person or if it turns out the culprit, themselves, is somehow important to the time stream then you can do more harm than good with your actions. \n\nOther than the basic approach to the detective work, I'm not sure what else would be involved. It certainly is a larger overall project than I will be tackling anytime in the near future (pun intended) ;)\n\nI'd love to hear some thoughts on this."
