okl36y|Racing game FIFA|Imagine a big licensed game with the same concept of fifa (hear me out) it has F1, F2, F3, IndyCar, WEC, Formula E, Karting etc etc. And the leagues are like FIFA, F1 is the Premier League, IndyCar is La liga etc. Transfers can happen. You can manage teams, player career starting in karting would be amazing I think (will never happen unfortunately) but would be sick eSports racing would be easy to do as it would all be in the same place as well as that there would be much more variety, you could go for the triple crown, you could have a multi year career like Fernando Alonso where you try to win everything everywhere. Also to add on there could be a massive player/driver database so you could manage your favourite team in your favourite series with your favourite drivers. You could make Pato O’Ward at McLaren in F1 happen you could make up for lost time by maybe giving Wehrlein that Mercedes seat he never got or even sign your favourite young driver like Logan Sargeant to your team you currently manage like Penske to their young driver academy? All I know is some of these companies have the money for the licensing. But whether this game could work or if it could happen is very doubtful

mhmtee|Rhythm-based Jukebox musical martial arts shooter.|Hey everybody, this sounds like a bad idea, but I’d like to try something new and different. \n\nConcept title- Phantasia Wonderland.\n\nGameplay- Your attacks are synchronized to a song that plays throughout the level. The song changes once the previous one ends, setting a whole new mood and pace to gameplay, and can create soundtrack dissonance in certain areas. You are at first equipped with nothing but your martial arts, which then get upgraded into a new hybrid style that takes the best from all others, and can be utilized in a unique way- dance. \nYou of course find guns and other melee weapons throughout the game, and the game encourages you to use certain types of guns, your newfound prowess in dance fighting, and melee to keep your multiplier high. Your money for weapons, ammo, and scrolls are earned through how well you play. The better and riskier maneuvers and shots boost the money and score points you earn.\n\nStory- A young geneticist and cyberneticist create an unstoppable killing machine, and send him around the world to learn various skills, A la “Samurai Jack”. At the age of only 3 he completed 99% of his mission, only to find monks practicing in the tropical and beautiful Ryukyu islands. After they take him in, he undergoes unbearable training that stun the masters, and convince them to let him learn their true martial art which he soaks up like a sponge, however jealous monks and overzealous archaeologists uncover an ancient radio, which the broadcasts a signal that metronomizes- or rhythmically realigns- the world to follow its tune. Our protagonist however, is emotionless, and doesn’t understand the joys of the cultures he experienced, their spark of life, or anything really. He just followed orders. He learns to enjoy the small things, especially music, and ends up befriending his companions through their music and cultures. (I will add more tomorrow, including the weapons and artists featured).
m9tiir|souls like moba game|"A game that combines souls like pvp action and creative build creation along with capture the flag style moba team fighting could create really competitive and interesting gameplay. Games would be 5v5 matchups with  a simple arena with three lanes and towers blocking them. Each player would start with a certain amount of ""souls"" which they could exchange for equipment or stat leveling as well as ""runes"" which would give certain perks. Equipment would be able to be sold for a certain amount of souls back as well. A player would be able to teleport back to base to exchange equipment and level up stats of choice at any time in a game.\n\nAs the game continued the players would gain souls from killing enemy players as well as game generated bots which they would then use to buy items and level up their avatar to create a unique build. In what order players purchased items and level up stats would be entirely up to them. The arena would also contain a few souls like bosses which could be killed with a team easier or solo killed by a skilled player at certain levels. Killing these bosses would give the team a buff as well as each member a bonus of souls.\n\nMatchmaking would be determined by levels. At low levels only basic items would be available and the max amount of stat allotment a player could achieve would be lower (not by too much) as well. As players progressed they would level up from playing games (faster by winning or doing well) and gain money which would allow them to unlock new equipment packs which would then be available in the in-game store. Random rewards would also be given occasionally. This would keep new players from getting overwhelmed at first and encourage people to continue playing. At a certain level, players would be able to activate a ""ranked mode."" High level players would have access to a diverse array of equiptment and spells with very powerful and complex effects.\n\nThis game would have the potential to become extremely competitive with games being a chess match of creating a constantly evolving build to counter and outplay opponents. How well someone would be able to do would be entirely determined by their intelligence, game knowledge and mechanical abilities. The opportunity for creativity would be enormous.\n\nThe graphics would be decent but have no need to be hyper hd. Fluid and near perfected gameplay would be the main goal. Combat would have a similar pace to dark souls, demon souls or maybe even bloodborne. I would want fights to be based around thoughtful and deliberate outplays not button smashing."

m1i4he|Paranormal Investigating Simulator|"Hello! I would like to start by giving a brief introduction. My name is Teal and I am currently taking Game Design courses at Full Sail University. My skillset currently is self taught when it comes to software (Unreal Engine). Programming, C# is currently my weaknesses. Over the few months I've been doing this, I would say I'm more interested/suited for Level/Environment Design. Before I begin, I'd like to say I am still relatively new to Game Design as a whole. So please, bare with me and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or constructive criticism of any sort. Feel free to give me tips and advice. Now on to my idea:\n\n**Paranormal Investigation Simulator** (Title in progress)\n\nThis month, I am taking Intro to Programming. I am starting to get a SLIGHT understanding of C# and coding language, to an extent. I've had this idea for a paranormal hunting game for awhile. In learning about coding/programming, I was brainstorming certain things to implement into this game, or if they would even be possible.\n\nThis game could be classified as a ""ghost hunter simulator"" if you will, but I don't necessarily see it as a full on simulator. You begin with basic ""Investigative Equipment"" (EMF detector, camera, spirit box, EVP recorder, etc). As you explore locations and  ""Log"" evidence (apparitions on video/photo, EVPs, etc), you will earn in-game currency which you can spend on new equipment for your investigations (maybe even attire for your character if character customization is implemented). There will also be multiple locations to explore. If this idea takes off enough, I would like to even implement REAL-WORLD haunted locations into the game. If that were to happen, it could really be a ghost hunting ""simulator"" of sorts.\n\n**Location Examples:**\n\n* Alcatraz\n* Cecil Hotel\n* Amityville Horror House\n* Conjuring House\n* The Exorcist House\n\nHaving real-world locations could implement a story aspect. The history of said locations can also be brought in and the player will learn about the events that took place in these places and the people that once resided there. \n\n* Example Cecil Hotel: Players will learn about the dark history of the motel, as well as the evil individuals that resided there (Richard Ramirez, Jack Unterweger). Maybe players will even unlock some of the secrets surrounding Elisa Lam? \n\n**Apparition System:**\n\n* Different types of apparitions that can be encountered or ""Logged""\n* Different spawn systems depending on type of apparition\n* Boundary system for apparitions \n   * Example: Shadow figures can only creep on you from a certain distance, and only come into view when you aren't looking. They only appear as a solid black mass or silhouette and can be seen with your peripheral vision. The closer your view gets to a shadow figure that appeared, it slowly disappears. This allows the player time to capture the shadow figure with a recording device, or at the very least, with their own eyes if they happen to see it in time. **They can be lurking ANYWHERE👀**\n   * Example: Solid apparitions are the rarest to appear. They are the ultimate in gathering evidence. For that reason, they should only appear every so often and only in specific areas. They can appear directly in front of a player, or even in the distance (similar to a shadow figure). Implementing how often an apparition appears can greatly increase the replay-ability of the game. Each time you go to a location, you won't have the same experience as the time before. You could gather different types of evidence, every time you decide to return to a location you already investigated.\n\n**Apparition Types:**\n\n* Shadow figures\n* Solid apparition\n* Mist\n* Smoke/fog\n* Orbs\n\n**EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) System:**\n\nThe EVP System can work in a similar way as the apparition system. Voices, moans, cries, screams, laughter, growls, hisses, footsteps. All of these types of audio evidence can be captured with EVP recorders. These noises can also be heard by the player, but occasionally some noises will **only** be heard through a recorder. Meaning you could catch virtually an unlimited amount of EVPs in many different locations. You could hear something different each time you go to or return to an area.\n\nThis is just a brief (I guess more than brief) rundown of what I currently have in mind. I still have a plethora of ideas swirling around in my head. Please let me know what you think of this concept. I am not sure how many ""ghost hunting"" titles that are out there. I did not look that up before typing this out so I hope I didn't embarrass myself 😆 Thanks for reading this far if you did! 🙏🏻"

l6v6mz|A horror game about surviving your own mutated cancerous tumor|Ever since I heard the term “teratoma” I’ve had an idea for a game called “terror-toma”\nBasically it’d probably be a short game where you wake up in a hospital bed and find blood, a lack of people and other spoopy hospital things (how original, I know) eventually you discover that your teratoma that could’ve been lethal was surgically removed (if you don’t know what a teratoma is, it’s like a tumor that can grow teeth, hair and other bad stuff) however you have a unique case where it continues to develop outside of your body, eventually mutating into a large fully sentient creature. It’s makes hospital people go bye-bye. I think this idea has potential but I haven’t thought much of it through and as of now I lack the skills to code it into my own game so that’s why I’m putting it out there for now.

kw6w8f|Unique LoZ Idea|"Imagine a Zelda title, set in a post apocalyptic Hyrule which has been ruled by Ganon and his mighty army for many years. The princess is kept locked away in Ganon's dungeon to prevent death and rebirth. All the while, the fated hero destined to defeat Ganon and seal his darkness has not been seen since Ganon's initial take over of Hyrule. A small village of beings of all races and species exist outside of Ganon's watchful eye, trying to do their best to survive with the absence of the hero. You are then introduced to yourself, a green tunic wearing, blond hair having, left handed sword wielding knight. You believe you are the reincarnation of the hero's spirit destined to save Hyrule and defeat Ganon. After trying to head straight for Ganon by travelling through an underground passage through his prison, you notice a figure whose features strike a sense of familiarity within you despite never seeing him before. An older, bearded, Hylian man, wearing a dirty green tunic covered with a tattered cloak along with a makeshift eyepatch. The truth hits you that this prisoner is the lost hero incarnate, kept alive just barely to avoid any chance of him having the abilities to combat Ganon, but also to prevent another reincarnation of his spirit. While he doesn't speak, you and this hero coordinate together to improve your weapon and magic skills as well as gathering intel and strategizing an attack plan to finally defeat Ganon and free Hyrule. To replace dungeons, you travel through different wings of Ganon's castle to defeat his minions and reclaim the sacred weapons he had locked away and guarded, the last of which would be the Master Sword. While the sword does not respond to the faux hero you play as at first, after a scripted loss against Ganon himself and verging on death as the last and only hope for Hyrule, the sword grants you as a worthy ""successor"" to the hero's spirit and lends you its strength and abilities to defeat the all powerful Ganon."

kt4qub|Just an idea for a 3D superhero game.|"So . . . It's a superhero-esque game, with simplistic 3D features. you'll be a flying superman that punches monsters and launch laser beams at them.\n\nYou will fight monsters that invade some kind of city you reside in. Some other superheroes with special abilities will help you fighting the monsters. Finally, after each round, you will fight big monster bosses.\n\nThe huge monster bosses will be funny and comic-esque. Your character will occasionally give speeches about freedom, love, justice, etc.\n\nAfter the speech, or after you defeat the boss monster, you will return to a house of some kind, where it seems that you live alone. You can interact with some things in your house. Just for fun, not plot changing. To end the day, you can sleep in your bedroom.\n\nAfter you sleep, you will wake up in a darker version of your room, with lesser items or some kind. There will be somethings that are covered in red auras. Your character will automatically run away if he's too close. There are some auras that are dimmer. If you proceed to approach it, it will reveal red shapes that seems to have monochrome patterns, some which are random numbers and texts, some are random drawings.\n\nIn the darker room, you must search for 'A glass of water."" You must then drink it. After that, you have to exit your room, and go to the 'Cleansing Room.""\n\nYour house will be a little darker. And there will be one or two ""Demonic Presences"". They appear as glowing red humanoids. They move randomly. If your character if too close, he will run away. You must maneuver through your house to enter this room.\n\nAfter entering this room, a loading screen appears. And after it loads, you will be out of the room. You must go to the bed and sleep. While moving through your house, you will encounter the demonic presences again, and you must get past them.\n\nLater in the game, you will be rewarded with some key items, The Book of Light, The Astral Trigger, The Holy Water, and The Holy Fire.\n\nThere will be some bosses that are creepy and grotesque, and you must fight them alone. They will insult you, or say generally bad and depressing things. After beating them, you wake up again in the darker version of your house.\n\nThe final boss, which you will fight after fighting a super big monster as a superhero, is a doppelganger of yourselves. Insults will appear on random text boxes that appear frequently when fighting him. Finally, when the main battle is over, the screen will turn into a hall of some kind.\n\nThe doppelganger will give a rant about how useless and bad are you, and occasionally talk about ""Them"", which he will portray as two evil beings that manipulate himself and you. And about how sad and miserable you actually are.\n\nThe doppelganger will then give you three offers :\n\n1. To be free from your misery and achieve happiness : You will be instructed to take the Astral Trigger, point it at him, and then trigger it. The Astral Trigger is then revealed to be a gun of some kind. He instructs you to shoot him. After you shoot him, the screen cracks, and after awhile, it goes all white. You will then acquire the **""Happy Ending""**\n2. To purify the demons which control you : You will be instructed to pour the holy water through the halls, and after that, you will drop the holy fire. Lights and aurora will appear through the hall, and soon, the screen shifts into a white screen. You will get the **""Vengeance Ending""**\n3. To reject his offers : The hall will soon crumble, and you will automatically wake up in the darker version of the world. A cutscene happens, where your character will walk to a table, and turn on the table light. He will then proceed to read a book, and finally, the screen shifts and displays ""**Redemption Ending**"".\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nAlso, should this game get a psychological horror tag?"

kbfvrv|Deckbuilding roguelike, except your deck is a shotgun and the cards are extra barrels with varying effects|Came up with it while thinking about how Mothergunship would have been more fun if there was a more static base gun to build around but more variance in weapon parts, which immediately brought my mind to deckbuilding roguelikes like Slay the Spire.  I had the idea of a roguelike where you started off with a basic double-barreled shotgun, but through exploring would find more barrels to attach to the shotgun that could do different things, like have elemental properties or shoot slugs instead of pellets.  There could be incentive to position the barrels in ways (barrel synergies?), as well as reasons to either go for high-barrel or low-barrel runs (more barrels=longer reload?).  I think it'd be a pretty fun way to create an FPS roguelike that still had a deckbuilding-ish strategy to it

jv0glr|Star Wars fighting game.|"So with all the various kinds of video games being made about the saga, especially with both *Jedi: Fallen Order* and *Squadrons* being revivals of past franchise titles like the *Jedi Outcast/Jedi Academy* and *Rogue Squadron,* why not dial into this niche market as well?\n\n*Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi* was not a beloved title for the brand's gaming wing and it could be argued with good reason. Still, that's an entire genre of gaming left untouched because of one bad outing. Not only that, *Star Wars* honestly is better suited for a fighting game than a lot of other big pop culture names. With the number of iconic characters to fill out the roster with interpersonal rivalries, philosophical divides, and different skill sets, there's a lot you can do with the right team.\n\nFor starters, the game would be considered semi-canon. Which is to say, it does not take place in any specific era or part of the timeline but all of the characters have the same motivations and histories that they do. Which is part of one of the game's big selling points, character interactions. *Mortal Kombat* style banter between different combinations of characters before and during the fights. For example:\n\n**Kylo Ren vs. Darth Vader**\n\nKylo: ""I've given everything . . . to be like you.""\n\nVader: ""Compared to the power of the Dark Side . . . you are a mere shadow.""\n\nKylo: ""No! I'll prove you wrong!""\n\n**Round One: FIGHT!**\n\nI can see this title shaking out in two ways and they both diverge because of one thing, lightsabers.\n\nIn one version, we stick to characters only equipped with lightsabers. Which factoring in all of the Jedi, Sith, and others, that's still a pretty hefty list. Or another version which includes many others with differing weapons. In either case, this is what would separate this game mechanically from most other fighting games. In most fighting games, you deal blow after blow to your opponent trying to drop their health bar to zero. If this game did that though, it would greatly diminish the effect of a lightsaber's lethality. (As Teras Kasi did.)\n\nSo instead, the game's combat would more work on a kind of ""diminishing defense"" mechanic. When one watches the films, one realizes that not much contact is made during the lightsaber duels. The telling blow is usually the winning blow. With dismemberment and scarring serving an important narrative function. So attacks that connect in this game will always be ""blocked"" but when that meter runs out, the fighter becomes open to an attack that will end the round or fight. Perhaps some kind of special move is the only thing that can finish off one or the other once their meter is depleted, so no ""poke victories."" Blocks and parries will still be a thing. Because otherwise the game would be slanted to favor characters and players with higher combo capabilities. Just that actually negated attacks and hits that connect will both have the character avoid direct contact but one will look like a confident parry while the other like they barely managed to intercept.\n\nHow would this work for the fighter's not equipped with lightsabers or weapons that can parry them? Like Han for example? The lightsaber-wielding character will simply whiff them but it still ""counts"" as a hit to their defense. You can only bob and weave around Darth Maul for so long.\n\nThis would obviously involve a lot of intensive work for programmers and animators. I'm working with the premise that the actual creators signed off on this project rather than planning some fan creation of my own.\n\nMechanics aside, each character would have their own story in arcade mode, where they fight thematically appropriate matchups from across the eras before reaching their final battle. The narration, framing, etc. suggesting the chosen character is experiencing something similar to Luke's vision in the cave on Dagobah. Since the Force transcends time and death, their own internal journey can be ""real"" without messing with the physical world too much."

You’ll be exploring a cave system & some ancient temples! \nWhat makes this game unique (as far as I know) is that on the outside of the submarine there are 2 arms. Their movements mirror the movements of your hands, sort of like Pacific Rim. The right arm is a hand, which you can use to grab objects and move them around. The right arm has a laser cutter.\nUnfortunately, I suck at coming up with gameplay ideas and that’s where I ran dry. Can anyone help me come up with some other tools I can attach to these arms that would allow for making & solving some cool puzzles?
jfxmxc|Gambling, but with strategy and no pure luck.|I'm thinking about making an app with multiple games / minigames where you compete with multiple players based on a buy-in, and after you reach a certain amount of in-game currency, you can check-out your money in your credit card. Matchmaking will be extremely carefully planned and balanced, money-free entries just for training would be available at any time. I myself find this idea pretty cool giving that strategising and thinking are most encouraged, and there'll be no luck involved at least in most of the games, but i'd like to hear other people's oppinions.
jdsi29|Zombie beat 'em up|"An idea that's been kicking, no pun intended, in the back of my head for a long while. The basic idea is that this will be a level-based linear brawler like *Final Fight, Double Dragon, Streets of Rage,* or more recently *Mother Russia Bleeds,* but with zombies!\n\nYou play as a martial arts expert from a possibly fictional, possibly actual, U.S. city. One day he's practicing in his home gym when he hears on the news of a zombie attack, moments before his undead neighbors break down his door. The tutorial level is our hero fighting the zombies hand to hand with plenty of weapons along the walls to try out and get acquainted with. Once the zombies in his home are all dead, our hero braves the outside world, armed up and ready to kick ass and meet with other survivors . . . only to get steamrolled by a horde of zombies he couldn't possibly take on all at once. \n\nBUT, our hero rises again a couple of hours later as a fresh zombie. BUT BUT! In his undead state, he's presented with a room full of zombies like before, and the player is instructed to fight them just as the character did when he was alive. Albeit with a very different fighting style, akin to drunken boxing to fit the shambling and bizarre movements of the typical zombie. The level is spent with the player in full control, moaning through sections of zombies and beating them up. At the end of the level, there's a woman trapped in a warehouse by the zombies. The player character beats up the zombies and the woman comes out to greet her rescuer . . . only for the player character to kill her savagely like a monstrous zombie and the player has no control over this.\n\nThat's the outline of the first half-hour or less of the game. Throughout the other levels you will stumble by radio broadcasts or overheard human conversations (that the player character can't reach) that build exactly what's going on. The city has been quarantined to keep the zombies from spreading throughout the nation but there are special cases where certain zombies retain skills that they had when they were alive. You are one of these ""revenants"" and the skill you retained was your martial arts abilities and desire to fight. You'll encounter other revenants as well, some just hanging out doing their thing, like endlessly fishing or working in a factory assembly line all alone, but others will be the bosses of the game. \n\nThose revenants that retained combat skills like your own, including other former martial artists. Zombie boxer, zombie archer, zombie lumberjack, zombie sniper, zombie demolition derby driver, etc.\n\nThere's a story going on beyond this but the gameplay loop mainly consists of learning new moves to fight more regular zombies as well as the revenants. You start with the full move set and weapons in the tutorial and have to rediscover them as you play the game. The idea being that our hero is slowly beginning to remember more and more as he continues to fight.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Opinions? Critiques?"

j9mla5|Special Operations Forces Battle Royale|Special Operations Forces Battle Royale\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. 5 players per squad. You will have weapons with you, Assault rifle/Sniper rifle/MANPADs rocket (pick 1), handgun, knife, frag grenades, flashbang, smoke grenade, standard issued SOF gear (like helmet, body armor, Night vision google, etc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. 100 players battle royale. The map has its own enemy call Private Military Contractor (PMC), player need to fight this PMC in order to survive. There will be also random weapons spread all over the map. This PMC will guard the main area like Airport, Military Base, Town, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. You start the game by para jumping from a plane. Team leader can control this plane and fly anywhere on the map. You will be given 2 minutes to fly to your location. After the timer goes up, you will auto paradrop on your location.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The map is huge. Your objective is to survive to the end. Similar to PUBG, player need to go to the new zone. However, if player out of the zone when the timer end, player will be automatically disqualified (in pubg, player will lose health over time slowly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. The game will have all the modern weapon and machinery, including, a fighter jets, helicopter, tanks, mortar, toyota cavalry, combat superbike. Player can drive the jet and do a dogfight with other players in the air. Tactical drones, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Building can be destroyed. Player who pilot a jet can destroy the building with airstrikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Side mission. Rescue and evacuate a VIP on the map. There will be one VIP npc randomly located on the map and been held hostage in a prison. There will be NPC Private military contractor (PMC) enemy that guard the VIP. Defeat the PMC and save the VIP.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter you successfully save the VIP, talk to him and he will generate a random extraction zone location. Go to the extraction zone and wait for the helicopter. The VIP will get in the helicopter and the helicopter will drop a precious weapon to you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weapon is a Predator Missile Laptop (PML). PML will allow you to attack your enemy with an airstrike. This will be usefull at the late game, when the play area is smaller and you no longer can use fighter aircraft for air support. It is game breaking and really give a huge advantage to the player that own it. PML will drop upon death, but can be destroyed in the explosions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. Realistic injury. Serious injury will be permanent. Sometimes you need to continue playing with a penalty to movement, health, weapon (you cant equip certain weapon if your hand is injured.). Eat food wont heal you, but increase your movement speed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Photo realism graphic. Like pubg but more realistic. Intel HD 4000 can play the game with at least 30 fps (And of course you can play with the latest graphic card at the max setting). It will be free to play with competitive ESPORT and cosmetic shop. You can play a male or female operator. No nonscene cosmetic, most of the item are decent looking SOF, secret agent, modern clothes (no bunny suit or clown suit). The game will teach the player about modern warfare and Close quater combat (CQC). The game will have a real life scale, 100 meter will be the same like 100 meters in real life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. The game start a random time of the day, it could be at night, or during the day. The weather also random, it could be heavy rain or a fine weather. You will have several map like snowy map, sand map, jungle map, urban map (some looks like european, tokyo, south east asian, american).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11. Cross platform. The game will available for PC, mobile, playstation, xbox\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12. Character creation. Player can choose their character face, body height (150 cm to 200 cm), body weight, hairstyle. Player can choose their clothes including, Special force uniform (SPETSNAZ, SAS, SEALS TEAM 6,etc), secret agent clothes, or just a normal modern looking clothes.
j88f1l|spiritual successor to half life 1|"I've had an idea for a game for a bit that's sort of a spiritual successor to half life 1. Story wise it's very similar to half life one, even taking some scrapped plot points from half life 1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story:** Somewhere in a secret base, scientists have contacted aliens and have been working with them to create a device to open a portal to their world. When they open the portal the aliens start invading. You, a scientist start out trying to escape before finding out that there is a way to close the portal. The machine on earth has been destroyed by the time you get to it  but the portal is open and find that you have to destroy the portal on the alien world too. There's two endings to the game, one where you destroy the portal and get stuck on the alien world, sacrificing yourself, and one where you collect parts to fix the machine on earth before destroying the alien machine, getting back to earth, and destroying the earth machine closing the portal while on earth. \n\nThere's also a side plot about the chief security officer, at first he tries to protect the scientists telling them to make it to a specific area where he can defend them, but quickly he becomes a dictator violently enforcing his will. ""I'm the king of the world now. I've been killing aliens like they're ants for days, the millitary has no clue the kind of weapons we've been cooking up, and most of the scientists haven't held a gun a day in their life!"" There's a point in the game where you have to kill him to get past an area. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay:** \n\n**Map:** I would imagine this to have a map that is something between an open world and a linier experience. With you returning to previous areas of the map with new weapons or after unlocking areas that where locked before, while generally finding new places as the game goes on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NPCs and Enemies:** I'd like to expand on half life's ""run think shoot live"" idea by expanding enemy AI. I'd want every enemy to have all five senses (well four, taste doesn't really matter), able to smell long-dead bodies and the smoke from explosions, hear gunfire and things clanging around, feel the vibration from large explosions, notice bullet holes in walls and dead enemies, ect. Each NPC would have a slightly randomized personality matrix that was still within the boundaries of their NPC type (fear for example, scientists would generally be cowardly, with the bravest among them picking up a gun and defending themselves instead of running away, while the military NPCs would generally be brave, none of them running from gunfire, but some of them retreating when at low health and others fighting to the death.) There were ways of baiting enemies in half life 1 but I feel like they weren't implemented well enough.\n\nThe military's in this would actually be neutral, ignoring you but fighting aliens they come across. If you ever attack kill them they'd all become hostile, for the rest of the game. NPCs would however be able to tell the difference between accidentally hitting someone in the heat of battle with a mutual enemy and cold blooded killing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Weapons:** I'd like for all the weapons to be creative and a bit off the wall. Alot of them would interact with the environment adding to the intellectual simulationist nature of the game. The weapon concepts I have right now are  \n\n\n\>A sonic gun that you fire by spinning a record player, the sound of it's attack would line up with the music being played in the game at the time of use  \n\n\n\>A shotgun that fires flaming bullets (like dragons breath shotgun) that could be used to light things like oil puddles or wooden doors on fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\>A gun that shoots rubber bullets that SPEED UP when they bounce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think it'd be cool if acquiring some of these weapons required you to break into a test chamber ala-portal with messages from a cave-jonson-esque mad scientist character explaining how they work\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Power armor suits:** Similar to half life, the main character of this game would have power armor suits that help them in combat. By default, without a suit, when you take damage your screen would turn red, more and more until you die, like alot of first person games. However in this game you dont heal over time, you're stuck like that until you can find a first aid station. When you take damage this way your aim gets worse, and your turning and walking speed slows down.\n\npower armor suits would have an energy gague like half life, with it lowering when you get shot, and if it reaches 0 the suit breaks and you must find a new one. A suit could be recharged at a suit matinence station. some suit matinence stations have suits but not all. \n\nThere would be multiple suits, some with special abilities that also draw from it's power. \n\n\>Default: The default suit protects you from damage and has a limited oxygen tank that reduces the suit's power when you go underwater or in areas with gas you cant breathe.\n\n\>Mariner suit: The mariner suit is a lighter version of the default suit. You can breath underwater and in gas with this suit without any power being lost, and by pressing the action button you can also climb on certain walls with this suit, which lowers your power. this suit would have 80%\~ of the power of the default suit  \n\n\n\>Speed suit: An even slimmer version of the mariner suit visually, the speed suit has no oxygen tank, and 60% the max power of the default suit, with a use of the action button you can run up walls and across water, with a burst of speed. this burst of speed can also make it harder for enemies to hit you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\>High-power suit: A bulky version of the default suit with 200% the max power of the default. this would be the rarest suit to find. It grants you super strength at the cost of power, being able to super charge melee attacks and rip open certain metal doors and bars. \n\nThere may be more but those are the ideas I have so far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I have for the idea. but basically the idea is a game where you have to think your way through it with the tools given to you. maybe a bit too similar to half life 1 but half life 2 went off in a totally different direction."
j1ikf5|A post apolypic Video game set in Houston Texas|my idea for this is it has been 50 years after humans just disappeared. not died. disappeared. all the animals in enclosures and cages are set free. there is no limit to the animals. you come home after a long day at work then take a nap. you wake up in this new world. the buildings are not destroyed, just taken over by plants.
izh1cs|My idea of an (probably) over ambitious open world game|Hey all this is my first post here and I wanted to share my idea of my ultimate open world game that can be played with or without people (best if you play alone)\n\nThe idea's:\n\n- Open Wold\n- - the world will evolve as you play\n- what you do in the game could effect the game world\n- - Fully explorable\n- all structures will have interiors\n- - all construction sites will be explorable\n- all abandoned structures will be explorable\n- - fully destructible environments\n- emergency units will respond to your actions\n- - random events will happen \n- emergency units will respond to the random events\n- - natural disasters will happen\n- man made disasters will happen\n- - the black market\n- stock markets\n- - economy\n- terrorist groups\n- - weapons\n- military\n- - aircraft\n- seacraft\n- - vehicles\n- building/structures will evolve as you play\n- - you can go to jail\n- you can brake out of jail\n- - new technology will appear and evolve the world\n- you can build new technology/buildings/vehicles/ect\n- realistic building damage/destruction\n- and much more...\n\nExamples of some of the idea's:\n\nEx 1:\n\n- if you explode a store the store will stay exploded until you or the NPCs will deal with it so if you don't  repair or destroy it yourself the NPCs will repair/destroy the building them self, the fire/police/medic departments will come and investigate the incident and will lunch investigations into why it happened and you can get caught if your not careful enough.\n\nEx 2:\n\n- Construction sites will pop up and will build over time and you can even build your own structures (or just burn them down of you want).\n\nEx 3:\n\n- as time goes on in game new technology will appear and buildings and more will change to fit with time.\n\n\n\nSo this is my dream game, feel free to add/change/give ideas to me, and thank you for reading it!
ivev9p|A Harry Potter horror game set in Azkaban|So the idea is you play as a witch/wizard trying to escape Azkaban, and you have to hide from the Dementors. Jumpscares need not necessarily be a game over, it could just mean your soul is being sucked out and needs to wrestle away from the dementor in question or cast a Patronus.
ip18tm|Video Game Ideas and Poll|I am a indie game developer and I was asking for some input on some new games that I was thinking about creating and if you could tell me which game you are interested in and any ideas you would have for it.\n\nInterstellar Battle Ground Tournament- 3D- This game is based off of a game that was played in Ender's Game. The game takes place in a 0 Gravity Environment. The game also uses guns that paralyze the player instead of killing. I would try and partially adapt this by making it so getting hit causes the players screen to darken and distort sound. I aims at being a tactical game. There would be a class system and in the environment I would put basic obstacles that would allow for cover. Another feature would be a jetpack system that has a set but replenish able fuel to help navigate the field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeak- 2D- This a pretty simple game that I think would be fun. It would be a game with specific characters. The game would be a platformer where the players would have to fight there opponents while jumping up the platforms. Each character would have a ability set. Its a really simply concept that if executed properly could be quite fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpace Force: Fleet Battle- 3D- This game would be a tactical objective based game. I personally think this game would be the best if done properly. Each Spaceship would have its own stats and passive ability and a ability that would be activated. There would also be different guns that are attachable to each ship. I was thinking it could be a 10v10 single elimination best of 5 round game. The attackers side would have to destroy the capital ship while the defenders need to defend it.
ios8op|Manhunt with battle royal elements.|I'm a 19 year old beginner artist with an interest for game development and I was inspired while watching a youtube video about some guy doing a manhunt with his friends in minecraft. At first it was just hunters vs a single alien but I ended up adding a third faction and increasing the numbers because it sounded fun to me. The goal of the game for everyone involved is to survive and the other goals are just steps to get there. I've decided to work on this on my own for a bit and see how close I can get before needing more help. I would love to hear what you guys have to say about it!\n\n(The three factions start in different spots across the map, think of the map size as a massive stretch of land with a diverse environment)\n\n(The matches last a 2 month in game with a day and night cycle)\n\nThree factions on an alien jungle planet. During the night sleeping heals for a much higher amount and the planets predators and deadly plants awaken.\n\nFire is harder to maintain as violent winds ravage the jungle and the hunters lose the ability to hear footsteps and it becomes harder to see for the hunters (Except the survivalist and the Automation)\n\nPoisonous plants and animals will also come out but they posses beneficial abilities and traits that the hunters and certain alien types can use to their advantage.\n\nNew sources of food will also become available that are stronger than the food that can be found during the day and heal you once eaten.\n\nThe rays from the 4 moons have an adverse effect on hunters and animals and will increase radiation levels if they are exposed for long amounts of time.\n\nThe predator must find a spot to create a nest or use an already existing one to sleep and spend skill points as they mature, have to eat before they can manually sleep and if they wait to long\n\nthey will enter a forced sleep and awaken in a day long weakened state and the traits they have chosen will be permanently weakened.\n\nThe alien has the option of either sleeping the entire night away healing up by a massive amount health and stamina or bath in the moons light to gain a new ability.\n\nThe alien has the option to sleep after that but will heal for less and health and stamina.\n\nThe hunters can either sleep to heal and increase their maximum health by 50 and fill up their stamina bar or spend their skill points and sleep and increase their health by 25 and fill their stamina.\n\nSleep is optional for all factions but the predator and they take 25% more damage from the first attack while sleeping.\n\nDuring the night all dead creatures become hosts to a parasitic fungus and will rise from where they had fallen if the remains are not burned.\n\nhost creatures will posses 65% of their stats and can pass on the fungus if they get the players health down to 15% killing the player instantly and turning them into a host with 100% of its stats.\n\nThe closer to day it becomes the lower the hosts stats become till it reaches 35% their original stats, their health will continue dropping until it reaches 0 and all hosts will enter a dormant state once the sun rises.\n\nIn the dormant state they can be burned to eliminate them, any items dropped from them must be purged in warm water or else usage will give the player a dormant strand of the fungus that will awaken if touched\n\nby moonlight. Once the fungus awakens the player will begin taking 20 points of damage per second that grows stronger the longer they are under the moonlight.\n\nThe damage will only stop once the player is either dead or the suns light touches the player. It can be removed by bathing in warm water under the sun.\n\nLiving things can become infected by interacting with dormant hosts or the fungus itself. The fungus shrooms will not start spawning until day 20.\n\nThe infection will come during the night every night including the first.(The player can be infected from the start of the game so caution is advised)\n\nAll factions must eat and certain factions have access to foods that are toxic to the others.\n\nCertain types of hunters, aliens, and predators can communicate with each other and have the option of entering a pact with different rules.\n\n(hunters max health lowers by 20 each day and stops lowering at 850 or 950 depending on class(other stats lower by 25 each day to their own limits)\n\n(Predators health grows by 375 and its defense by 200 each day and its starting stats change based on the alien's(every predator has a weak spot and take 2 times as much damage from the food and material they are weak to)\n\n(Alien's stats grow by a constant amount every day and can be further altered by eating certain foods and materials(certain foods and materials will lower stats)\n\n(All factions have food and materials that they are weak to that deals bonus damage to them and can give them diseases if they are unlucky)\n\n(Diseases take 2 and a half days to recover from)\n\n(Predators intelligence will begin at 500)\n\n(All factions have a hunger and thirst meter that must be filled and if it's empty for to long they begin to take damage that rises as time passes)\n\n(The predator cannot be turned or damaged by the fungus, it cannot become a host until it dies)\n\n(Predators size, hunger, and thirst increases the more days pass)\n\n(The hunters physical stats will drop as time moves on but the power of weapon's such as guns, explosives, mines, and blades will not lower)\n\n(The hunters in each group will be from random classes)(Different groups can work together and form pacts up to a maximum of 2 different groups)(Hunters may kill one another for their resources so caution is advised)\n\n(Just like predators hunters can break a pact and and deal bonus damage on the first attack)(The first hunter to shoot will deal the bonus damage and the others will deal normal damage)\n\n(Aliens can do the same but the same type of alien cannot betray each other)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(100-150)\~HUNTERS\~ (Weaker than the other factions but have access to advance tools,specializations, animals, machines, and human adaptability)\n\nThe first faction are the hunters, specialized mercenaries sent to hunt down hostile alien lifeforms. The hunters will be split into even groups and work together to survive.\n\nThe humans have a limited amount of time to hunt the creature as the planets atmosphere is dangerous to earthlings after long periods of exposure.\n\nThe longer they are on the planet hunting the weaker they become and the more likely they are to either get sick or suffer radiation poisoning and die.\n\nHumans have the option of training themselves while on the planet and can spend points on a biologic reaction skill tree that adapts the hunter based on interactions with the\n\nalien and the environment. Hunters skill tree will differ depending on what they do during the match. The hunters will also have a class skill tree with abilities that depend on their role.\n\nDuring the day humans can spend energy and ores to call in a delivery every other day after a group vote and receive 1 thing from the earth. It can be either supplies, animals, or machines.\n\nIf all hunters are dead they lose, if the aliens are killed by them before the predator is born they win. If the predator is born and they kill the alien they have to make it to the landing site and escape.\n\nIf all hunters are eaten by the predator they lose if they manage to kill it they win. The ship will only be at the landing site after the 8th day the aliens are dead.\n\n(25)\~ALIENS\~ (The alien is stronger than the hunters but weaker than the predators and different alien types have special abilities)\n\nThe aliens are a foreign species to the planet and have to avoid dying and survive until an opportunity to escape reveals itself.\n\nThe aliens must deal with the human hunters chasing them during the first 10 days its just the hunters and the aliens but after that the predators be born and will begin hunting the alien as well.\n\nThe aliens are stronger than the hunters but weaker than the predators. If the predators manages to kill all the aliens then the aliens lose the game.\n\nIf the aliens manages to kill and eat the predator then the aliens will evolve into a more powerful state with half the predators stats and becomes much harder for the hunters to kill.\n\nThe aliens win condition will remain the same so they can choose to either actively hunt the hunters or evade them till the 2nd month is up and the escape ship lands.\n\nThe aliens biology will adapt to the planets atmosphere as time goes on slowly boosting their health regeneration and giving it new abilities as days pass.\n\nThe aliens can eat the hunters they kill, eating the hunter will increase the aliens intelligence by 100 and give teach them how to use the equipment the hunter had. The aliens can create tools and traps from the environment as their intelligence grows.\n\nThe aliens can eat each other if they are a different type, this will give them a weaker version of the consumed aliens specialty. The alien that consume another will be marked and will no longer be identified as on the aliens side.\n\nThe marked alien can be killed and eaten without receiving a mark and the stolen ability will be given to the alien that kills them. Marked aliens can enter a pact with other aliens and win with them as if they were never marked to begin with.\n\nA marked alien can break the pact but will no longer be able to make a pact with anyone after this and will be treated as an enemy to every faction.\n\n(10)\~PREDATORS\~ (Strongest attack and health equal to an aliens but have very weak defense at the start. They grow stronger each day and have access special abilities and skill trees)\n\nThe predators are newborn beast native to the planet, they are the apex predators and posses no natural enemies besides each other. The predators goal is to kill everything they deem a threat.\n\nOnce the threats are killed the predator wins. The predator must be careful though as it is easier to kill during its newborn state and must be smart when it hunts.\n\nThe predator has a mutation meter that fills by eating. The predator gains skill points both from killing and eating. The predator heals for 250 health each time it kills something and 500 when it consumes it.\n\nThe predator gains a mutation point when it fills the meter and a new mutation depending on what it has consumed most. Once it filled the meter it's counter is reset and it can eat a different creature or material for a new mutation.\n\nThe predators gains a mutation points each time they consume a hunter and gain two when they consume an alien.\n\nEach time a predator eats a hunter its intelligence will increase by 100, it will be able to make and disable traps and tools once it's intelligence reaches over 1000.\n\nMutation points can be spent on modifications that alter their physical form and give them new abilities and make it easier for the predators to hunt.\n\nPredators can make non aggression pacts with one another but at the end only one can be the APEX predator. When in a pact any attack at one another will have no affect.\n\nThe pact can be broken without the others notice at any point with no visual identifier. The predator will still be immune to the others attack but the other predator will take damage and be alerted that the pact is broken.\n\nWhen the predator that broke the pact attacks the other it will deal bonus damage for the first attack. A pact can only be made once with each predator.
ihcb6e|Doom meets the Last of Us|Hi, I'm a 13 year old indie game developer and concept creator need of help of pursuing one of my main dreams in lie. The game I want to present is a fast paced melee focused shooter set in an overpopulated and poverty run streets of the U.S. In this game, the setting takes places in the west area of a nearly fully submerged U.S. goes into a deep poverty like most of the other countries in the world due to the ice caps melting caused by a failed experiment also releasing toxic gases into the air. Due to the poverty and overpopulation, it is required by all countries to eliminate those who are elderly or suffer from any major disorder, except for a rumored island. In the game, you play as a broken man suffering from PTSD and many other mental disorders. He's also an amazing fighter but loses greatly to one of his opponents, causing him seemingly irreversible problems, further giving him the idea to end himself, due to his cruel past and his self hatred. Before he tries to off himself, he meets a kid with cerebral palsy and swears to protect him. The world is full of drug addicts, thugs and even zombie like enemies due to overdosing a new drug being used with the toxic chemicals from the explosion. Locations consist of mostly slum and poor areas, with some warehouses, former houses and buildings, and other broken down locations. I want this game to be mostly melee oriented with some guns the player can use. Due to the main character losing interest in life, and his severe wounds, he's forced to relearn his old fighting skills so he can learn new abilities as the players progress. How the fighting will work, there will be two types of attacks for each melee weapon, a basic and a sharp attack which can both be charged up for more of an impact. A sharp attack is pretty much an attack that uses slightly more time to perform than an average one but deals more damage and has a higher chance of stunning the enemy, this is mostly useful for sharper objects. Also as you progress, you learn more abilities and traits through a skill tree sort of style, for both melee and firearms. How guns work: guns can be obtained by finding on the ground or later in the game, being able to de-arm them from enemies. Guns can be used until their magazine ammo has been depleted which unless using an attachment, can not be used again. Later in the game, the player will be able to do things like holster certain weapons and even throw them at enemies once their ammo has been depleted or if the player decides he no longer wants to use it. Other abilities involve damage reduction taken by the player, stronger attacks, faster movement, more combat and mobility stamina and stamina usage, higher chance of getting a critical or stunning hit, higher abilities with certain weapons, etc. The main goal of the game is to travel across the country t try to reach this rumored island of equality and less poverty. Overall, i want this game to be similar to Doom (2016 and Eternal) when it comes to combat while also subverting players into thinking that this will be a fighting based only game, but I also want the game to be super emotional and tear tugging. Overall, i want an experience close to the last of us with amazing gameplay with stellar storytelling that doesn't sacrifice any element of a good game. Also, through the game you enter environments, bringing back flashback from the main characters past with someo of it being important in the present. During the game, your companion with cerebral palsy gets kidnapped and separated from you multiple times.

When the player earns enough [experience points](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point) to gain a new level, they unlock an ability. When the player allocates more points to a statistic, more abilities can be unlocked. These perks can be upgraded to improve the protagonist's efficiency and to further unlock abilities.

In the beginning of the game, players create their own Division agent by customizing the character's gender and appearance. In the game, players are equipped with different [firearms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm), including [assault rifles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle), [sniper rifles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper_rifle) and [Submachine guns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun), and [explosives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosives) like [grenades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade) to defeat enemies.

Gear can be either bought, or found as in-game loot, or crafted from gathered materials.\n\nFocuses on cooperation and teamwork . If a survivor falls off a ledge, then they may automatically hang onto it and can only be helped up by another survivor. If a survivor's [health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(game_mechanic)) is depleted, then they become incapacitated and can only be revived by another survivor, at which point they continue playing with a low amount of health that decreases over time. If a survivor has been incapacitated and revived twice without tending to their wounds, then they will experience distorted black-and-white vision, and the next incapacitation will kill the character. If a survivor takes enough damage while incapacitated, or is not eventually helped up by teammates, then the incapacitated character will die. During ""Campaign"" mode, if a survivor is killed, then they will [respawn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawning_(computer_gaming)) in a closet or other enclosed space after a period of time (except during key points in the scenario), but must be freed by another survivor to rejoin the team. Otherwise, the player must wait until the next level. The AI is incapable of accessing the ""respawn closets"", so if all human player survivors are killed or incapacitated, players will have to restart from the last checkpoint. Survivors can share [first-aid kits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-aid_kit) and pain pills and help each other heal. The survivors communicate by voice commands that are accessed by quick menus, and some may sound off automatically when performing actions such as reloading or spotting infected.

There are few [bosses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_gaming)) in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation.\n\nThe game provides several options for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the gangs, monsters and turrets. The player can [hack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)) into any of Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Galaga,Space Invaders,Centipede,Crisis Force and M.U.S.H.A. With failure each time to complete in time costing XP for them. In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotguns. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies."
idrqn5|Paraiso Lost: a metroidvania concept using Filipino folklore, set in my take on an alternate history colonial Philippines|"I know the industry is littered with these puppies (and is that a bad thing? haha), but I don't think I've seen many based on this setting.\n\nI have an idea that I'm fleshing out for fun on my IG (@paraisolost) with artwork and mechanics beginning to take shape - which I update regularly.\n\nI envision a Romanesque horror, metroidvania, action RPG, platformer, that takes place during the ""fiery tinders"" of the fire to come that is the Philippine Revolution/Tagalog War. It is more supernatural than historical, and sees you play as a demi-demon freed from her earthy prison, due to a series of tell-tale signs of doom that befall the land.\n\nGameplay is set in a provincial area; locales connected by warp points. Combat is tactical, with the inclusion of a fatality type finisher to use for extra xp or ?\n\nWhat sets this concept apart is the Filipino'centric aspects I want to introduce as mechanics. For example: (inspired by Persona 2's Rumour system), a Superstition mechanic allows you to interact with objects and NPCs; experimenting with dialogue choices and actions (you can get clues from NPC dialogue and lore to be read) that can bestow positive, lasting & temporary effects in the game - if you heed the superstition correctly. Bad luck of course can be an outcome if the superstition is incorrectly applied/ignored.\n\nwhat do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wypu8zqbxai51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5200e8f6acbf518a28bd7f554c296ff19f1c4440\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bzeifrbxai51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c83cd0b8d42507c5b74eec38cc90dd356ec97a3d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjioiyqbxai51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cd66430cd34f8ba0b7f934eea547e4daaf86479\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/211u62rbxai51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=688b8b140f4099c9321399b1d350372d68cdcc78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5f6c0rbxai51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f47ed7013aa58700e4659e2ec5fd0d83946bb9ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63pgi4rbxai51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81021075d546c35d895bad39337f6242c064e7c"
icjj8p|A new Horror game|Before I start, note im not a game developer, but I am a concept artist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe name of the game will be Wander, or something like it. It will be a realistic survival horror game based around sleep walking and multi-tasking.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: You play as a 32 year old business man who makes his living by doing deals on behalf of his company, but you aren't pure, you also rely on underground deals that end up bringing up unwelcome eyes on you. Due to one of your latest deals, you worry for your safety, as such, you employ measures to protect yourself before you sleep. Also, you know you have frequent sleep walking incidents, you also add measures to protect yourself while you do sleep walk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGameplay: The first part of each day will revolve around settling emails, signing paperwork, or other business work all the while checking cameras and locking doors and windows.  The second part revolves around whimsical dreams that you can explore all the while you sleep walk.  During the sleep walking dream, you have to watch for odd sounds, strange images, or reactions from your character to avoid IRL danger.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should note that during the first part, you can upgrade your protection by properly answering the business work. This stuff could include a security gate in the hallway, to prevent you from walking downstairs for about 1 hour, motion sensors that ping, auto reply email systems to ease your work load, and etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis entire game would evolve with each of your actions, wrong mistakes could increase your risk the next day, while solving issues can make risk non-existent.  Imagery in the dream will be detail based off all of influence you put around you, suck decor and security.  (Yes, if you get every security item, it will seem like you are in a prison while in the dream sequence)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is all really, if there is any other good ideas, I would love to hear them, this would be my first solo idea about a game I wanted to create, please give any feedback, or let me know if there is a game that is similar, as I would rather not rip-off another game creator with this idea.
i8wcbt|A game I might create sometime in the future: Shadow Rogues|I just thought of this RPG game about ten minutes ago, and I have only thought of the battle elements, but here goes:\n\nA battle starts by approaching an opponent. The battle starts by both characters entering on opposite sides of a 6x6 movement grid and an 8x8 attack grid. There is the character on the 6x6 grid and the shadow adjacent to the character on the 8x8 grid. There is also a spotlight tethered to the character on an adjacent tile.\n\nYou and your opponent each have a weapon, shadow energy, and a spotlight. There are a few actions: Hit, Shadow Weapon, Spotlight Move, Run, and Pray. You can do two actions per turn.\n\nThe basic RPG moves are Hit, Run, and Pray. Hit is essentially your main weak attack move in the game; you approach the opponent and hit them with your weapon, dealing a small amount of damage. Running will reposition you one to two tiles away on the small battlefield grid, allowing you to dodge an oncoming Hit, change your shadow position, and/or getting closer to a shadow. Praying will either increase your stats or heal the praying character by a small to medium amount.\n\nThe less traditional elements are the Shadow Weapon and Spotlight Move. Both actions cost some shadow energy. A Shadow Weapon move can only deal damage to a shadow, but it does a lot of damage. A Spotlight Move will reposition the spotlight to a cardinal tile on the grid, which also changes the position of the shadow.\n\nI will draw up a more comprehensive version of this sometime soon. Thanks for reading this dumb idea!\n\nSincerely,  \nMe

i4gfbp|A stealth game with a twist|This idea came to me when I was home brewing an encounter for D&D. Basically, it’s a top-down 2d stealth game where you have to get from point A to B. There are guards that have a line of sight that needs to be avoided, just like most stealth games. However, this takes place in the lair of a magical creature. Instead of the guards moving, the walls move. For example, a wall might cover a guard’s LoS at the start of the level, but later it’ll move and the guard can now see the area.
i2g0gs|"A ""typing trainer storybook"" game where the story is narrated bit-by-bit, and then the player must type the story correctly (grammar, punctuation, etc.) onto the ""page"" or the story will begin to have bad things happen, resulting in multiple story endings based on writing skill"|"So, Typing of the Dead was a fantastic way to get people excited about typing fast and properly. So, how do we make a game that encourages professional writers (and authors, and editors, proofreaders and so on) to have a strong command of the written word?\n\nImagine a game that comes onto the screen like an interactive storybook (let's say it's about rescuing a rare, ancient book from being burnt into ash by an evil king in a heavily guarded castle): The first ""page"" of the story would present as an in-game scene of the castle off in the distance (just like an illustration in a storybook), and the narrating voice would say\n\n>Once upon a time, there was a very important book in danger of being burnt to ash by a ruthless king who desired to keep the truth from the good people of the kingdom. Fortunately for our hero, no storms lingered in the air to impede their sneaking through the gates to rescue the book.\n\nBlah blah, so on and so forth. The writing would be much more complex, however. Anyway, so the player would then type the story (freely, and able to edit, delete, and fine-tune their written transcription of the storybook page before committing their writing ""to the page"" (via a magic pen and ink set from medieval times, of course!) And then, if their spelling, grammar, punctuation were all good enough, the story would carry on with sunny weather, but if they made some mistakes, the story would turn cloudy and dark and make it hard to see something on the next page. If they made a LOT of mistakes, the sky would go dark and stormy, and perhaps lightning would knock down a tree over a trail and change the course of the next page.\n\nSo this would go on until the end, with story branching affecting the progression of the story for better or worse after each attempt at the player writing down the story without error. As mentioned, there would be a ""hapilly ever after"" ending, a ""total and complete destruction"" ending, and all the ones in between, based on how well the player transcribes the story throughout.\n\nI think you can take it from there! There could be many challenge rules that could player could elect to turn on (like Skulls in the Halo series games that change the gameplay for more challenge yet greater rewards): One could elect to only be able to hear the narrator one time per page, or disable the backspace/delete keys, or put a timer on that makes each ""fail state"" depend also on how quickly they can write and edit their transcription, etc.\n\nThe idea would be to have lots of short stories with themed visuals that match the theme of each story, and probably an overarching ""story master"" ranking system that pitted their overall writer quality score with other players online, granting various in-game rewards for their writing prowess, like decorations for their ""writer's room"" of choice in one of the story worlds (like a castle-themed writer's room, or a cottage-themed one, or a library-themed one, or a sci-fi one, or a murder mystery one, etc. and lots of other bookish places to choose from)\n\nAnd of course, it counts as an edutainment game that, done right, could be marketable for almost-all-ages that has different levels of story complexity for different age groups or reading/writing proficiencies. The concept essentially gamifies literacy. But, if you make the game, please don't make a game \*just\* for kids because the whole point of the concept is to make a ""game"" that encourages adult, professional writers improve their self-editing skills when word processing professional work, writing their screenplays and book manuscripts, writing blogs and articles, sending emails, posting on social media, and far, far beyond!\n\nMy personal motivation for this concept is that I'm a fantasy novel author that would love a gamified way to improve my punctuation and sentence structure skills when writing things like dialogue tags, complex and compound sentences, and the other hallmarks of prose fiction manuscript writing."
hzawwa|Bringing Back Dune RTS|I had an idea some time ago for bringing back Dune. Although my concept isn't quite finished. I managed to put together some key concepts, like which houses would be playable. In the original Dune series, usually only Houses Atreides, Ordos and Harkonnen were playable, but one of the major ideas I had was to make more playable houses, like Ix and Tleilaxu.\n\nLike I said, these are only conceptual ideas and I doubt anything will ever come from them. Feel free to take a look and discuss. I have a few more ideas to put to document before I'm done with this little project.\n\n [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12cueCktKd1AACDoUaz-ofpqLzCnG-6sv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12cueCktKd1AACDoUaz-ofpqLzCnG-6sv)

""Last 2 games you played have now merged"" \n\nOkay here me out: 3rd person view Megaman Battle Network but played like Valorant \n\nPick your choice of Navi that has a certain Element, ability, stats etc. But when you pick it's like a draft pick similar to LoL. \n\nEach round you get chips that come in buy phase. Same concept of CS and Valorant where different chips have different cost but here's the twist. \n\nChips come in random at set prices.\nEx: basic chips like Cannon or sword are low, medium costs get more elemental chips and high cost chips have like big aoe like an ultimate but those only come in super scarcely\n\nAlso like the games you can do like elemental combos with chips and do it where they fuse(cant remember what it's called right now) when you have then in a certain order\n\nEach Navi has a common buster for firing, their own charge buster shot and different stats accordingly\n\nMaps are still on a grid but not the basic 3x3 their side/my side. I was thinking the chips still act like they are with their hit boxes moving like they were on a grid but in a more 3d environment if that makes sense \n\nHope you all like this! I feel like it would be super fun to play and hope you all actually read it"

On their way home on the day before their second-year college finals, Richard received a mysterious letter. Inside the message was a key, at first he had no idea what it could open, but later out of pure curiosity, he found out it was the key to a box left behind to him by his deceased parents. What Richard found inside were papers with strange symbols, when Richard grabbed the little paper with a skull on it, his hand burned and on his palm was a skull tattoo. What he also found were documents that raise the possibility his parents aren't dead, and a location to go to, an abandoned mansion in Iceland. The next morning, Richard and Jacob decided after their finals, they would go the place in the documents. There, they will meet four people, all with different goals, helping each other, form bonds, and...\n\n\nTotal Planned Play-Hours:20-28 (5-7 per playthrough)(4 playthroughs in total)\n\nGameplay: the main character will have to explore the four areas of the mansion(lower floor, back of the mansion, mysterious cave, and upper floor) while fighting enemies, solving puzzles, and finding items to aid in battle. The player, though this will be planned and only happen at certain times, will have to run from the boss of the area and try to escape from it.\n\nBattle: the player can control 3 characters in battle, it operates on a timeline. depending on their action they will be sent back by a certain distance. each character has an assigned element and attack type, Richard is both darkness and slash, while Jacob is wind and pierce. each character also has a unique set of abilities and playstyle.
g6jx4w|Backup|So, I developed this game idea from a strange mechanic i thought of, with the high tech style of Portal.\n\nGame Mechanic:\n\nSo basically you have a device which allows you to put a saved state anywhere, and you can restore to it while keeping your momentum. Dont understand? Here are some drawings.\n\n[Yeah, strange mechanic.](https://preview.redd.it/hkx84os0fju41.jpg?width=1962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=222ffaffbbf32d9cbfd74fbd6b9aacfa844265c0)\n\nStory:\n\nI thought of a storyline to go with the main mechanic and here it is.\n\nYou are an employee working at InErTIa or INnovative ExpeRimental Technologies IncorporAted. Butchered acronym supreme. You are assigned to test a new device, the LTRD (drawing) in a series of tests. You are guided by the announcer who introduces the mechanic. I have incorporated saving into the story, save points work the same way as the LTRD. Eventually you make it to the surface and the Endgame Procedure Manager (see what I did there) activates and attempts to delete your conscious and reset the game. The announcer helps you escape from the EPM deleting you and the EPM resets the game, sending you through a cutscene of you watching all your gameplay backwards. If you save and restore during this you will be sent to the room you saved in and the announcer will offer you to reset the game without deleting your conscious (the game will reset but  the save won’t be deleted), but if you turn him down the EPM will find you and delete your conscious and reset the game (that save will be deleted). Also a touch to the final choice, in the backdrop will be you playing the level over and over in a time loop. If you don’t save and restore you will be sent back to the first place in the game where you started, and your conscious will be deleted (the save is gone). phew that was a lot of story.\n\nThis game is just a concept so some of these things might be a bit much to ask. Anyways hope you like it! Here are some more concept drawings!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some other things](https://preview.redd.it/2al4rup9sju41.jpg?width=2331&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7df3eaa7e42161052a85f94f51a173004286b804)

f535p2|Semi post-apocalyptic RPG|"I'm starting to get better at programming and designing video games, so I came up with a possible story for a game I want to eventually create.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe story is of the player trying to get 6 ""plates"" for a cuboidal frame that grants power to the bearer so you can defeat the main villain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTh backstory of this concept is a story of 6 societies. The people in these societies once co-existed and thrived together until disaster struck, causing the old society to collapse in on itself, and the people to flee. The 6 societies were shaped based upon this disaster: the places where they fled to were where they worked (and they began to adapt and evolve to match their surroundings), and the event affected them all in different ways, causing them all to have very different outlooks on the world and (more importantly) the others that fled.  Each of them took a plate out of the frame of the cube, leaving the frame behind. They use their frame to power their new societies. Your job is to collect all 6 plates to unlock the powers that each society has. If you have one plates and activate it while it is in the frame, you take on the appearance of the people from that society and gain their abilities. You could retrieve the plates in separate ways, and they'd all have effects on the other societies (for example, you could disguise yourself as a person from another society and start killing other societies' citizens, causing them to wipe each other out, and you can get 2 plates. However, this would make the other societies very paranoid, making it tougher to interact with it's people.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe story still isn't complete or definite, but I thought it was a good idea. Any thoughts?"
eoox70|[Concept] More complex 2D Farming game with RPG elements|So I have a concept in mind of a 2D Farming Simulator based on Stardew Valley. Then you add more RPG Elements to it and make complex additions to the game (examples below).\n\n## Farming Simulator basics:\n\nOf course the farming aspects of those games on your own farm with your own farmbuildings, but add like expansions to your farm and more controllable expansions to your farminghouse.    \nAlso keep the Crops and Animal features\n\nObviously, the day and night and seasonal cycle the game has but try to not make the winter as boring as it is in most farming simulators (I know this is a problem for a lot of people and they can't make it through the winter in games like this)\n\nSome kind of Quest System where you aim for some bigger tasks (like Community Center in Stardew Valley) and Sidequests you get from NPC's\n\nThe tools in general like pickaxe for stones, axe for trees, watering can and hoe for planting and scythe and hands for harvesting\n\nAdjusting market due to supply and demand and seasonal impacts or events, so you have to adjust as a farmer with the stuff you grow so you can't just rely on like best profit plants each season\n\nThe NPC system with a small village of about 20-30 villagers with which you can interact/ unique cutscenes/events and also add like competition like another NPC farmer or shops like Walmart and local shop (jojo, pierre’s)\n\nHire NPCs to do stuff for u (water fields, feed animals, ...)\n\nCapsule all those different fields (farming, mining, combat, fishing) to specific NPCs and or buildings like the guild for combat, wills hut for fishing, mines and quarry for mining and so on\n\nMore interacting with NPCs especially marriage and children  Like your children grow up and can help you on your farm and your wife/husband interact with your gameplay more adjusting to her/his personality, like make the adventures woman follow you to the dungeons and make the agricultural person help you on your farm and so on\n\nCompletely redo the friendship/hearts system to be more “unstable” for example through events and questions and answers systems to be more impactful on your relationship with a character\n\nI also like the fishing aspect of Stardew Valley so I'd like to keep this too but with another minigame\n\n## RPG Elements to add:\n\nHealth, Energy, Hunger, Mana maybe Thirst, …\n\nMake the energy deplete passive over the day\n\nFor the hunger aspect more cooking elements (meat (butcher animals), …)  Of course if you butcher an animal like a cow you have to make it worth for the player to do so like give him a lot of meat to make up for the raising costs, barn and the milk it could have given  or force him to do so cause of like a nutritionsystem with fruit, vegetable, grain, protein or so but this would make it too complex i guess\n\nAnd Potions to brew like health potions, mana potions for magic and speed potions and so on\n\nMake a skillpoint feature where you can skill passive and active skills/ learn magic you can collect those skillpoints like the stardrops in stardew valley through completing specific task, unlock achievements and so on (make like 1-3 slots on the bottom right of your screen / next to the hotbar where you have 1-3 slots for those skills)\n\nMore Dungeons/ adventures/ explorations  Better combat more weapons, bows, armor, gear in general\n\nAlso make more craftable interfaces like anvil for gear, …\n\n## Conclusion and Suggestions:\n\nIn conclusion, make the game more complex and kinda remove the simplicity of Stardew Valley so you have more to think about and more to explore and better combat system. I am still unsure about things like the nutritions system and thirst and what the dungeons/ adventures/ explorations should look like.\n\nAlways open for suggestions and additions.

e7ltvf|Nostalgia|You start in a Log cabin, and you're a dude wearing a heavy plaid jacket, a Trapper hat, and some dark brown jeans. This is first-person, mind you. A Fire is roaring in the fireplace, bookshelves on the wall filled with actual books that you can pick out and read. Classics, Like Moby dick, harry potter, Etc and so on. You have a Deer head mounted over the fireplace, an old but functional rifle mounted right below it that you can use to hunt! the world outside is a vast, Lush forest that changes seasons. You can go on hikes, watch birds with binoculars, and camp! Wildlife encounters are dynamic and happen at random. Nothing in this world is set in stone or going to happen one way or another. Multiple Log Cabins are dotting the landscape in scenic, beautiful areas of nature. And with time, you can befriend the wildlife around you! to provide a more mystical or tense environment, you have a chance to encounter Mythical beings and Cryptids such as Bigfoot, faeries, Gnomes, Mothmen, etc. You can also find Mysterious structures! Such as; Faery circles, Stone henges, Scary old cabins with a past, and suspicious ritual sites.. well, that's my Concept for an Exploration/Survival game. Hope you liked it! other ideas are also welcome.
e5kr5r|The Mandalorian|Like many people right now, I am obsessed with “The Mandalorian” and it got me thinking this morning...\n\nHow cool would it be to have a Mando game in the style of Read Dead Redemption 2 mixed with Elite Dangerous or one of the other space exploration games out there. Mix a western free roam with space exploration in the Star Wars universe!\n\nYou would hop planet to planet in your ship collecting bounties, defending townships, and hunting dangerous rare animals (like RD2 you would need specific weapons or ammo to get good kills). All the while upgrading your armor, weapons, and ship. Better armor with customizable color schemes. Cool gadgets like flame throwers, grapple hooks, and of course a jet pack! Different rifles, knives, and blasters with different ammo like incendiary, poison dart, and stun rounds. \n\nLike RD2 you could decide to be a good guy or bad guy and each would change  the gameplay accordingly. Help people, double cross them, or like the show some bounties may be morally questionable and you can choose your path. Maybe you burn bridges with certain bounty dealers, or you can climb the ranks starting with low end dealers and work your way up to accepting jobs from big names like Jaba!\n\nYour ship would act as your “camp” and You can customize and upgrade it. Maybe you start out and you have to deliver each bounty one at a time. Eventually you unlock a carbonite freezer so you can hold multiple bounties at a time in your ship. You continue to upgrade how many bounties you can hold before running out of space. Upgrade fuel cells so you can travel farther without having to refuel at a port. Upgrade shields and weapons, engines, autopilot, weapon/gear storage and so on. \n\nHunting dangerous animals on different planets to make upgrades from their tusks, horns, poison fangs, ect. Maybe some online multiplayer or Co-Op where you can team up with friends to take on high stakes bounties that you can’t complete alone and split the riches. \n\nI know this is a massive concept, but HOLY WOW would this be a fun game! Anyone?

dz5xml|War for New Earth|This was originally a concept for a story I wanted to write a while back, but after posting something similar on r/WritingPrompts, I came to the conclusion that it would probably be better suited for the medium of a videogame than a book. Please be gentle, this is my first time posting here.\n\nWith the looming threat of Global Warming finally rearing its ugly head in a catastrophic extinction event, all 7.1 billion people on Earth come together and travel through a portal to another, hospitable Earth. However, nobody accounted for there being another population of 7.1 billion people already there. With no way for the planet to withstand a doubled population, there was only one option New-Earth’s authorities could think of. Cull the herd.\n\nA law is passed that in order to half the population, everyone on New-Earth would have to fight one other person to the death. If you came from dying Earth, you had to fight the person with the matching identification number of New-Earth and vice versa. If you win, you live. If you lose, you die. Of course, there were exceptions.\n\nMarco Romado was one of those exceptions. He came through the portal and arrived on New-Earth and was finally given his shot at freedom from the system after a couple of years. He fights, and he loses. However, when his opponent is given the opportunity to kill Marco, he hesitates. A sign of weakness. Players go through this as a tutorial to learn how the combat works. The authorities execute the victor on the spot, and he’s almost certain that there has to be another path forward. However, Marco is still seen as weak since he lost the fight, so he’s taken to a prison where other exceptions are kept, either people who refuse to fight, or people who are like Marco, who lost their fight and their enemy pitied them.\n\nWhilst Marco is kept in the prison, he bands together with a group of inmates who are also keen on finding a new way to sustain the 13.7 billion people that remain. Their escape caper functions as a tutorial that teaches more advanced combat techniques, like tagging new characters during the fight and learning how they all work.\n\nSince the story takes place in what is essentially another dimension, or a parallel universe, rules change a little bit. Some animals and landforms from the dying Earth remain while others are noticeably absent. There are also some completely new species, geographical features and environments unknown to anyone from the dying Earth, such as trees with glowing leaves, caves with shifting walls, that perfect blend between fantasy and reality. Players would be given the opportunity to explore this world in small sections before advancing the story.\n\nThroughout their journey, they come across many people who have already earned their freedom by killing in the arena. Also, New-Earth’s authorities continue to hunt them down, meaning multiple encounters and ambushes happen.\n\nTowards the end of the story, they stumble upon a revolutionary discovery that could save the planet the group has been fighting for. It’s a portal to another, larger Earth. It’s completely uninhibited. No cities, no humans, just the world as it would have been if humans hadn’t dominated. After a short expedition into this new world, they step back through the portal only to find themselves surrounded by the authorities, and this is a fight they cannot win. They’re defeated, knocked out and taken back to the ‘Culling Pen’ where the fighting happens.\n\nWhen they wake up, they’re all back in the feared arena of death. But Marco fears death no more than he fears the death of 7.1 billion people. Cameras are everywhere and the announcer explains they must all fight to the death in order to escape. Only one can remain. The cameras are broadcasting to the world, the perfect opportunity to get their message out. They take it in turns to state a part of their message before they’re shot for not fighting. Despite being killed, they instilled a hope in the world. A hope that would allow for them to break free of the culling system, overthrow the government and find the portal their saviours had lead them to.\n\nThe remaining 12.9 billion humans start over on this ‘New-New-Earth’ returning to their survivalist roots. It was time to treat their planet right. They’d make this one last. Statues were carved in the honour of Marco and his group, happy ending, blah blah blah. The fact that the main characters die may upset some people if they are invested in them enough, but that’s all up to the story writing to get the players invested in the cast.\n\nThe Cast:\n\n1. Marco Romado, aged 27, will have some affiliation with sword fighting. Since he studied swordsmanship in Dying-Earth, he was allowed to try and use one in his fight. He originates from Italy and has been diagnosed with a mild case of Asperger’s. His dad abandoned him and his mum the moment he won his fight in the culling pen, without even coming back to visit them. Months later, his mum is called up and loses her fight, thus ending her life, leaving Marco alone. In the combat, Marco fights with a sword.\n2. Richter Krause, aged 34, a gun expert. Hails from Dying-Earth,  born in Germany, lived in America for most of his life and ended up an enthusiast. Lived on his own since he was 14, after his parents were killed in a store robbery, now diagnosed with PTSD and learned how to use a gun to ensure he and anyone he loved would never die the same way. Over time, those people turn out to be the heroes he fought alongside. In the combat, he fights with a few guns.\n3. Aiko Kitagawa, aged 26, a survivalist expert from Japan. Born into New-Earth’s equivalent of the Yakuza family, but decided to lead the crime in another direction when she took over. They were running a survival-training boot-camp until the worlds collided and her family was thrown into discord. Her remaining family has already died in the culling pen by the time she meets Marco in the prison. In combat, she fights with a survival knife.\n4. Ora Sanchez, aged 19, a mixed martial artist from Spain. Has grown up with anger issues her whole life, her parents decided it would do her good to find a way for her to vent it out on training dummies. At her school, she was shunned for the fact that she was different in the regard she had a short temper, so that only made her angrier. By the time she was 17, she was a fierce martial artists. She plays a key role in Marco’s escape plan. Fight’s using mixed martial arts.\n5. Daniel Gray, aged 23, an English twitch streamer. Born on Dying-Earth, he found at a young age that his sense of humour was popular and sought after, so a lot of people listened to him all the time. Later on, he discovered that he could use his voice to do more than joke around. His charisma and way with words allowed him to build a large following on Twitch, and his ability to create teams and communities aids Marco in rallying the people of the prison to prioritise escape. Doesn’t fight, but instead provides stat boosts with his encouragement. He would stand on the side lines\n6. Audrey Lee, aged 27, a Geographical expert from Canada. Audrey lead a sheltered life on New-Earth. She was sent to an all-girls school and came out of it as a closeted bisexual. (Will likely be revealed at some point during the story) She studied Geography and Cartography while she was there, finding that she had some natural ability to exceed in the subject. Her main role throughout the story would be navigating the group throughout the world. Also doesn’t fight, but instead of buffing the fighters, she informs them of nearby items and formations that could be used to their advantage, cliffs to knock enemies off, chasms to throw them into, violent wildlife to set on them, etc.
dgaf8o|Magic System|"# THIS IS NOT A GAME CONCEPT ITS A MECHANIC CONCEPT\n\nTo begin i will first say that i LOVE magic in video games and movies, cause i mean who doesn't want to shoot fireballs? however in games i always wished for more freedom with my spell casting so i came up with my idea for the ideal spell casting system(at least in my opinion)\n\n# THE IDEA\n\nI call it ""words of power"" basically instead of obtaining a spell like ""fireball"" you obtain words and combine them into spells so instead of fireball you would combine ""Shoot"" and ""Fire""\n\nthe more words you use the longer the spell would take to cast so a spell like ""Shoot fire"" would be faster then ""Summon water dragon"" it would also consume more mana or whatever your game would use\n\nmana consumption would also depend on how specific your words are so saying ""summon armored fire dragon"" would have a bigger cost then ""summon rock""\n\nanother thing to note would be that player's could be given spell's however the spells would be unnecessarily long encouraging player to look at their spells and ""optimize"" them"

In the game will be an option of resources, plush food of nature, pairing, construction, development, learning.\n\n3. The map will be relatively large (island).\n\n4. The graphics will be beautiful but minimalistic.\n\n5. The game will be super feasible including 24 hours and monthly periods including variable weather.\n\n6. On the map will be: streams, rivers, trees, shrubs, fruits, vegetables, old tribes, communities and small villages.\n\n7. The language of the game is unclear if it will be mixed or in one language.\n\n8. The game will not include things from the modern world like iron weapons and things.\n\n9. In the game there will be skills for the development of ""RPG"" and gathering resources of trees stones and anything necessary to build and develop food and home equipment.\n\n10. The game will have a conversation and talk interface with other tribes and other people, an option of politics and battle wars.\n\n11. There will be the possibility of peace and brotherhood and connection in between as well.\n\n12. People's clothing will be very minimal so the climate on the map is warm.\n\n13. There will be option for digging the land and planting.\n\n14. Nature in the game will be very invested and beautiful.\n\n15. Starting the game The player starts with nothing and alone.\n\n16. The game focuses on survival and early human development.\n\n17. The game will include sections of astronomy and star reading including star counting skills and star map reading.\n\n18. The game may include the option of multiplayer play with people on the net (but the game is single player).\n\n19. In the game there will be a possibility of raising children Family and death passes to your child It is worth continuing the game, death in the game is perpetual and remains so that if the player dies the game passes to someone you choose in your family as the wife or child and more.\n\n20. The game will also include art and construction sections in advanced stages of the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat other ideas and improvements can you come to know about all of these topics, and what do you think of the rules?"

d8ju70|A historically based town-building game|"This is an updated version of a game idea I posted over 3 years ago. Now that such games as Ostriv and Foundation are in development, I think such a game as I am proposing is becoming more and more possible. With that out of the way, let's begin.\n\nOver the years, I have enjoyed many city-building games, among them the SimCity series and, as of late, Cities Skylines. While they are excellent games, there is always something (maybe slightly) on my nerves.\n\nFor example, in SimCity 2000, the earliest starting year was 1900. However, you are stuck using modern style buildings. So while the date in the sim might be 1900, the city doesn't look like a city from 1900. Being a history fan, it sort of irks me.\n\nThat got me thinking. What if there was a game in which you could manage a small town from its early days all the way to the present day?\n\nThus became the idea that has been developing and evolving in my mind for years. I feel the best way to describe it is to take you through a ""game"", so let's begin.\n\nThe game would start with a typical main menu, with a historical theme. After clicking ""New Game"", you are taken to the region selection screen. The screen resembles a map of the continental US. From here you must pick which region you're town will be built in. They way your town develops will be based on which region you select. After selecting your desired region, you must name your town and select the starting year, which will again be based on which region you select. For example, towns in New England can start as early as the 1600s while towns in the Midwest can start in the 1800s. After you have named your prospective town and selected your desired starting date, the game proper begins.\n\nYou start with a procedurally generated landscape. I'll use a Midwest example, since I'm much more familiar with that part of the country, with a starting date in the 1800s. In most cases you will have a river somewhere on the map. The first step in this case would be to build a sawmill, but you must first cut down some trees to obtain the wood needed to build it. To accomplish this, you'll start out with a random number of people, for now known as settlers. They will cut down some trees, which in turn will be made into lumber by hand and be used to construct a sawmill. Depending on if a road was generated initially, you might need to subsequently build a road to connect the settlement to the rest of the world.\n\nAfter the sawmill is built, buildings will begin to be constructed, such as houses, general stores, etc. This will happen dynamically. For instance, commercial buildings will appear mostly on the main thoroughfare while houses will be built elsewhere. You can build the streets/roads in the town (provided you have enough resources to do so), but the game engine will mostly decide where stuff gets built. You can of course override the game engine if things don't look right to you. There will be plop-able buildings, such as the aforementioned sawmill but also including churches, schools, etc.\n\nWhat you can build in your town (as well as what technologies are available to you) will be dependent on the current year. For example, you will not be able to pave the roads/streets in your town until paved roads become a thing at the turn of the 20th century. You cannot build houses with plastic siding until the 1950s. Speaking of which, the game will come with historically accurate structures which are appropriate to the region you select as well as the year the structure was built and your current resources. To make further variety possible, the game will come with an asset editor similar to Cities Skylines.\n\nThe game would have a day/night cycle as well as a realistic weather cycle. There will also be disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc. depending on where your town is located. Outside events, such as wars and societal changes will also have an impact.\n\nTime will pass in real time, and of course time compression would be available. This means that when one day/night cycle passes, that is one whole day in-game. The seasons will also cycle, again depending on where the town is located.\n\nA tutorial would take new players through the history of a coastal New England town to introduce them to basic game concepts.\n\nFuture updates (or maybe DLCs) would allow players to start towns in other countries.\n\nSo, in summary, this would be a game like Cities Skylines and SimCity, but with the micromanagement aspects of RCT and Paradox games.\n\nIf you have any questions about the concept, please ask, as I'm sure I may have missed some things. But nonetheless, I hope someone thinks it's promising/"

cq083r|A more casual gamer friendly RTS|Hi everybody! I am looking for some feedback on my RTS idea. Any feedback is welcome. Thanks in advance!\n\n**IDEA**\n\n**Genre:** Historical Real Time Strategy (RTS)\n\n**Platform:** PC/Mac\n\n**Time Period(s):** Classical Era\n\n**Game Mechanics: Resources**\n\n*Primary Resources and Resources Gathering*\n\nThe four primary resources will be Food, Wood, Iron, and Coin. These are gathered from farms, forests, iron deposits and gold deposits respectively.\n\n*Resource Transport*\n\nResources need to be transported from their gathering points to a player’s City Center. The rate that a resource arrives at the City Center depends on the distance between the resource’s gathering point and the player’s City Center.\n\n*Resource Processing*\n\nOnce a resource has reached a player’s City Center it needs to be processed before it can be used. This is done passively by granaries, lumber mills, smelters and mints. Processing buildings can only work so fast therefore in order to gather more resources a player must add the corresponding number of processing buildings.\n\n**Game Mechanics: Training, Building and Maintenance**\n\n*Unit and Building Upkeep*\n\nEvery unit and building will require a periodic upkeep after it is produced. The resources type and amount needed will depend on the unit/building. As a general rule of thumb the more powerful or technologically advanced the unit/building is the higher the upkeep will be. Military units will incur additional upkeep the farther they get from the player’s City Center (See “*Supply Lines & Attrition*” section).\n\n*The Upkeep Cycle*\n\nThe Upkeep Cycle is the amount of time in between upkeep payments. The time will be known and made obvious to the player, however, it will change from game to game so the ability to use a preset build order is kept in check.\n\n*The Citizen Unit*\n\nThe unit with the lowest upkeep is the citizen. All citizen units will have three primary roles (1) gather resources (2) build/repair structures and (3) serve as a prerequisite for all other units.\n\nInstead of being trained on demand like other units, citizens are spawned automatically right after upkeep payments are paid. The maximum number of citizens that can be spawned equals the total amount of surplus food/upkeep cost per citizen unit. The exact number of citizens that spawn each upkeep cycle will be random so the player is unable to plan anything with exact certainty.\n\n*Producing Military Units*\n\nIn order to produce a military unit, a player must designate a citizen unit to undergo the appropriate training, have the necessary training and productions buildings finished and have enough resources to train and equip that unit. This incurs a trade-off since a citizen that is training to become/is trained as another unit can no longer gather resources or build/upgrade structures. The new unit will also have a larger upkeep.\n\n*Military Infrastructure*\n\nThere are two types of buildings needed to train troops (1) supply buildings such as armories and stables to produce the equipment as well as (2) training camps for prepare the citizen units for their new roles. For the sake of simplicity, supply and training buildings will work passively so no additional clicking is needed. If these building are destroyed, however, the player will not be able to produce new military units.\n\n*Failure to Pay Upkeep*\n\nIf upkeep cannot be paid, military units will revert to citizen units. If there are no military units to disband, citizen units whose upkeep cannot be paid with start to lose HP over time. All buildings a player cannot afford to maintain will also lose HP over time as well as lose efficiency over time. For example, a damaged smelter turns iron ore into usable iron slower than a smelter at full HP.\n\n*Building Restrictions*\n\nPlayers can only build buildings in areas they control. Control of the map has two forms (1) Territory and (2) Sphere of Influence.\n\nA player’s territory is the area surrounding their City Center (which has a limit of 1 per player). Territory cannot be taken unless the City Center is destroyed.\n\nA player’s sphere of influence are areas of the map where they have won battles and skirmishes. Influence over these areas will continue to shift based on the outcomes of future battles/skirmishes in that area.\n\nAny buildings that are in an area which switches from one player’s sphere of influence to another can be used by the conquering player assuming the conqueror has enough resources. If the conqueror does not possess the resources needed, the building(s) will be destroyed overtime.\n\n*Unit, Tech & Building Upgrades*\n\nThe vanilla version will **NOT** have unit or tech upgrades to ease game production and testing how well the key mechanics reduce importance of build orders and fast clicking.\n\nWhen these upgrades are added in expansion packs, however, the player will need to upgrade their training and production buildings in order to train more advanced units. A real-world example is that building a battleship requires a more advanced shipyard than building a trireme.\n\n**Game Mechanics: Combat**\n\n*Supply Lines & Attrition*\n\nSupplying an army becomes more difficult the farther away it is from its supply bases. This will be implemented by increasing a military unit’s upkeep cost as it gets father from the player’s City Center. The penalty will also be affected by the level of influence the player has over a certain area. The penalty will change from game to game.
ckd522|Would you play?|So having played fallout 4 for the first time ever yesterday, I can to find myself VERY disappointed in their settlement building. This got me thinking about a game idea. If it exists please tell me.\n\nMy idea is a 3D stardew valley like game set in a post apocalyptic world cause by either Aliens or a natural disaster (leaning towards alien invasion) In the game there would be a severely damaged city/ settlement that you would begin fixing up. There would be a story line (not yet determined) that would lead you to finding other people and discovering why the world is like this. As you fix things up the building would go from broken down and dilapidated to brand new. You’d have to gather materials and build a community while fixing up everything.\n\nMy question is, should I scrap this idea or build on it? And if you have any idea please feel free to add
cghxo1|Military History Game|In recent years games have shown that making a game accurate to a time period is not all that difficult if a good amount of care is taken. I think a game where the main concept is military technology throughout the ages.\n\nStarting the campaign all the way back in the stone age with combat being very basic. Stone axes/ spears fighting against rival tribe members or wild mammoths/ sabretooth tigers. maybe even running into egyptians and stuff like in the movie 10000 BC. \n\nThen it sort of goes forward through time eventually adding more advanced weaponry and combat gameplay watching the tech advance. \n\nMaybe playing as the bronze age celts or vikings, the romans in the invasion of britannia, the battle of hastings, the founding of the first shogunate, the crimean war, ww1, ww2, vietnam, korea, desert storm, etc. There’s probably a lot more that i haven’t even mentioned.\n\nUse actual accounts and records from people who were there and base the players experience on their experience. Maybe even add historical figure to specific conflicts like florence nightingale. \n\nPlace emphasis on the advancement of military tech. like the advancement from axes to swords to maxes to flails, the introduction of combat archery, firearms, drone warfare. maybe even the things that aren’t even completely military like illness and cleaning wounds to avoid infection (florence nightingale).\n\ncould be used to tangentially teach history about a variety of topics through a format that is all too popular in media. the fps.

c78lvh|Draft for a 2D turn based RPG based on systems from Darkest Dungeon, Suidoken, Octopath Traveler, and Chrono Trigger.|This is the abridged version of my Turn Based RPG. This was made for easier reading and writing. It has taken many forms since 2010.\n\n**GAME**\n\nYou have a party of 3 (or less) characters. The battle system is turn-based. You choose which of the 3 characters to start the story and tutorial with. The other two heroes are recruited before you start the main quest. There are two other kingdoms and 21 other characters to recruit. 15 are recruited through the main quests, and 6 are recruited thru side quests.\n\n**STATS**\n\nStrength (**STR**) – Affects health and scales well with **Sword** and **Shield**. **Plate** armor adds **STR**.\n\nAgility (**AGI**) – Affects movement and scales well with **Dagger** and **Pistol**. **Weave** armor adds **AGI**.\n\nIntellect (**INT**) – Affects energy and scales well with **Rod** and **Orb**. **Thread** armor adds **INT**.\n\n**BATTLE**\n\nThe battlefield has six spaces, one side for the heroes and the other for the enemies. Each hero uses two weapons to fight. Mattering on the character and weapons, they have preferred placement on the field, but experimentation is recommended! For example, a character with a **Shield** is ideally on the first space, but with certain abilities/weapons, may do well somewhere else. A character with a **Pistol** ideally belongs in the middle but may do better in the third space with different abilities/weapons. A character with a **Rod** may do better in the back row but may do better in the front space with the right abilities/weapons.\n\n**WEAPONS**\n\nThere are 6 weapons. Two for **STR**, two for **AGI**, two for **INT**. Scaling means a character with a higher than average stat does more damage with that weapon. Each weapon has two upgrade paths. Each upgrade improves a certain stat of the weapon. Each of the 21 characters you find wields a combination of these two weapons.  \n \n\n**Sword** – Close range with medium damage and low critical. Can become **Saber (+DMG)** or **Katana (+RNG)**.\n\n**Shield** – Close range with low damage and low critical. Can block attacks. Can become **Gauntlet (+DMG)** or **Tower (+RDT)**.\n\n**Dagger** – Close range with low damage and medium critical. Can become **Kunai (+RNG)** or **Claw (+CRT)**.\n\n**Pistol** – Medium range with low damage and medium critical. Can become **Revolver (+RNG)** or **SMG (+DMG)**.\n\n**Rod** – Close range with low damage and low critical. Focuses on debuffs. Can become **Wand (+RNG)** or **Blade (+DMG)**.\n\n**Orb** – Close range with low damage and low critical. Focuses on buffs.  Can become **Force** **(+DMG)** or **Summon (+RNG)**.\n\n**ELEMENTS**\n\nFor **INT** uses, each **INT** weapon is tied to a natural element of the world. Each element has a buff to characters. Still working on magic system (suggestions welcome!)\n\n**Fire** – increase INT temporarily\n\n**Air** – increase AGI temporarily\n\n**Earth** – increase STR temporarily\n\n**Water** – heal HLT\n\n**Light** – heal HLT slightly and slightly increase one stat temporarily\n\n**Dark** – take damage and greatly increase one stat temporarily\n\n**INTRO CHARACTERS**\n\nThere are three characters that make up the intro to the game. You get to choose one of the three to introduce yourself to the game. Due to story reasons, the ages of the characters range from 16 to 24. The names are placeholders (suggestions are welcome!) They are:  \n \n\n**Knight** – A wielder of **Sword** and **Shield**. An officer of the kingdom and protector of the royal family, he must find the princess he is sworn to protect and secretly loves.\n\n**Mage** – A wielder of **Rod** and **Orb**. A scholar who is looking for the lineage of family and is a fervent fan of magic.\n\n**Thief** – A wielder of **Dagger** and **Pistol**. A former noble who is looking to riches to reclaim her family’s status and save her father.\n\nThese three characters (childhood friends whose lives took different paths) reunite to solve a threat to the kingdom and meet new heroes through their journey.\n\n**PAIRED CHARACTERS**\n\nThroughout the journey, you will meet a character you recruit after a short quest. During their side quest, you will be introduced to another character with some relation to the quest. The second character will be weakened when recruited but can become restored thru a small quest. Once both side quests are resolved, the pair of characters will unite to defeat a final foe. After that, the side quest for both are done. There is still leveling and gaining gear, but both characters are recruited and able to use team attacks. \n\n**Paladin** – A wielder of **Rod** and **Shield**. A guardian of the kingdom’s church adopted after her family was killed. She is trying to find the source of the church’s corruption.\n\n**Dark Knight** – A wielder of **Sword** and **Rod**. A warrior who is tasked to kill innocents by an unseen force. He is hunted by the **Paladin**. Who is behind that helmet?  \n \n\n**Pirate** – A wielder of **Pistol** and **Sword**. A former noble who was sent by his mother on a boat as a kid to escape a war-torn home. He treats his crew like his family.\n\n**Ninja** – A wielder of **Dagger** and **Rod**. A shadowy figure hunting the **Pirate** for reasons unknown. He has a device attached to his chest… for what?\n\n**Hunter** – A wielder of **Dagger** and **Orb**. A cheery and excited youth from a village known for powerful magic. She is hunting the monster who wounded her brother.\n\n**Druid** – A wielder of **Sword** and **Orb**. A large and intelligent figure and the brother of the **Hunter**. His right arm is missing after his defeat. Will he find a way to redeem himself?\n\n**Samurai** – A wielder of **Sword** and **Dagger**. A silent and stoic woman who is hunting the man who killed her master, a practitioner of a deadly martial art.   \n **Monk** – A wielder of **Dagger** and **Shield**. A former student of the master of the **Samurai**. He has abandoned fighting, buy why is that?\n\n**Ranger** – A wielder of **Pistol** and **Orb**. A young officer of the kingdom, she is on her first mission, that being stopping a rogue faction of the kingdom from using a new weapon.\n\n**Fighter** – A wielder of **Shield** and **Pistol**. A young soldier of the kingdom, who survived an ambush. The **Ranger** needs his help. How will he continue when he is wounded?\n\n**Medic** – A wielder of **Rod** and **Pistol**. A scholar and former teacher of the university. She has shunned wealth to help those in need, especially with a virus killing her people.\n\n**Engineer** – A wielder of **Shield** and **Orb**. A former student of the **Medic**, he survived the virus, but it left him unable to walk. He is a tech expert. Will this cure his affliction? \n\n**LEGACY CHARACTERS**\n\nThere were 6 heroes that existed.  A master of each respective weapon, they saved the world some time ago. Somehow, they were corrupted by evil… and they are not heroes anymore. However, their abilities won’t die with their heroism. Each of the paired characters are tied to a former hero in some way. Once a pair is unlocked and their main story is complete, there is another character to recruit.  \n \n\n**Barbarian** – A wielder of **Sword** and **Sword**.\n\n**Guardian** – A wielder of **Shield** and **Shield**.\n\n**Assassin** – A wielder of **Dagger** and **Dagger**.\n\n**Mercenary** – A wielder of **Pistol** and **Pistol**.\n\n**Summoner** – A wielder of **Orb** and **Orb**.\n\n**Battle** **Mage** – A wielder of **Rod** and **Rod**.
c5w8qg|Avatar Game|"I've always been deeply captivated by the culture and mythical nature of the Avatar world, and I am aware that I am not the only one. The ability to control elements blended so well into society makes the feeling of having said ability so surreal to the viewer. Beyond this, however, there is martial prowess and high-level weapon skill commonplace, to make it feel as if everyone has a place in this fictional world, bender or not. Because of these reasons, I feel that being able to immerse myself in this world, beyond the show, would be an amazing experience; the issue with this is that this would best be achieved by a video game, yet there is no game which truly captures the experience of this world. I believe that an RPG, possibly MMO, would be the best format for an Avatar video game, which would overall be a very fun and popular game. I know that for a video game as complex as this one would need to be, it would take the resources, experience, imagination, and drive of a veteran game-creating company- the perfect candidate being Bandai Namco. It would seem that they are most suited to the task of creating an Avatar game due to the fact that they have the experience, skill, and desire to sculpt games into everything an avatar game would need to be. Namco always incorporates a plethora of creatures and NPCs into their games, none feeling similar to another, always keeping the desire to encounter them all, alive. They are undoubtedly excellent world builders, making many ""larger than life"" views and making the world feel very intertwined (My favorites being DS3 and BloodBourne). Another crucial element which they may assuredly deliver is the combat- Namco has regularly been able to blend magic and abilities with weapons, especially in Dark Souls games. They would be able to make a game with a smooth and streamline combat system. They'd have no trouble with item progression as they've been able to keep us searching for gear without proving to be an overly-arduous obstruction to game enjoyment or progression. I don't know the extent to which it may help, but because Bandai Namco is and asian company, they would have a better understanding of asian culture, which is very prominent in the Avatar world. \n\nFor combat, there is obviously the standard HP bar, with a regenerating stamina bar and a regenerating chi bar. A player can focus their character on entirely weapon, martial arts, and chi blocking, to master bending, or find a nice balance in the middle. Weapons (perhaps coming with some abilities, like in Dark Souls games, as an example, martial arts skills (some possibly requiring a weapon), and bending abilities, would be progressively found throughout the game. It seems reasonable that there'd be a skill tree, allowing the user to unlock passive or minor active abilities which work in tandem with the standard slotted weapon/martial arts/bending abilites. Travel abilities can be utilized (based on the element of choice) such as an air bender flying with an air glider, or a water bender being able to traverse water easily. Travel could also be achieved with a mount, however, so non-benders or benders out of their element (pun inadvertent) wouldn't be held back in terms of commuting. Roughly every sub-bending type would be usable, with balance, of course; the balance being the abilities not being too powerful, and the user only being able to slot a certain amount, with more powerful abilities possibly taking up more space. Considering the scope of the world size in either of the Avatar shows, the game would require a vast world to explore, ranging from open wilderness to run of the mill secret areas. The game would blend Story with Multiplayer, opposed to a separate story with a distinct PvP or multiplayer mode. \n\nI don't want to go too far into detail, as I'd like to hear others' ideas, and should I be very lucky and have this go anywhere, leave room for changes where necessary.\n\nTLDR: Avatar video game made by Bandai Namco."
c37ach|How to gamify philosophical (ethical) thought experiments?|Hello!\n\nI find thought experiments like the Trolley problem, Tunnel problem, Experience machine, Ticking time bomb scenario, How many men? etc. very intriguing.\n\nAs a game developer I would love to create a game exploring as many such scenarios as possible and put the player into the shoes of the person who needs to act in such scenarios.\n\nThe intriguing part is that most of the time there is no subjective right or wrong answer so the game could continue in most cases and give the player a unique experience. I am also thinking about optionally showing the player arguments and counterarguments of taken action and group the player into schools of philosophy at the end.\n\nHowever, I am not quite sure how I can make enjoyable gameplay out of that idea of going through a collection of different scenarios (with ethical philosophy being the common theme).\n\nWhat gameplay approach comes to your mind that you think would make most sense? What would you like to see as a component of such game?\n\nAny general thoughts?
c2ngdi|I can't think of a title for this.|Okay, here's the idea\n\nStory: This game takes place in an Archanpunk (Magic+Science) world, and you control an unnamed protagonist, who takes the job of hunting monsters. In this world, monsters were actually once people, but both their minds and bodies are twisted. Sort of a combination of human and monster. All they do is seek to spread their corruption, and it's your job to keep them from doing that.\n\nHowever, during one of your missions, you yourself become a monster. You slaughter your whole team, but your last teammate, before she dies of blood loss, uses a forbidden spell on you that temporarily restores your humanity. (It was forbidden because it causes the user to die)\n\nUpon regaining your humanity, you embark on a revenge-fueled rampage through all monster-kind. And *nothing* is going to stand in your way. \n\nGameplay: Ever play Painkiller? Imagine that, but with melee weapons as well as guns, along with a slew of monster powers and spells. As well as faster movement speed, along with more open-ended levels. You'll fight all sorts of beasts, from flower people with tentacles, to monstrous snakemen, to literal dragons. They'll all fall before you.\n\nWhat do you think?
c2eqhc|Crying Nightmares|"I had idea for many years now and today I'll show to you, tell me what you think and share your ideas about this.\n\nSTORY - You play as a loner girl who is desperate to find her sister whom has been missing for 7 weeks, then one day you decide to go to a abandoned mansion which was rumoured to be haunted, it's also where you and your sister used to go to when you were little. the place hasn't changed a bit but you never went inside it because you were so afraid of the rumours, as you descend into the mansion, you are greeted by a fortune teller that is sentient and knows were your sister and why she got lost. the fortune teller then tells you that in order to find your sister, you must collect relics from 20 realms with ungodly and horrific monsters.\n\nthe fortune teller tells you that there is an elevator that can the player to multiple dimensions, like I said, these dimensions (or as I call them ""realms"") have monsters who will be preventing you from getting the relics. each monster represent a random fear along the realm. the fortune teller will give you three elevator buttons, not with numbers but with menacing faces.\n\nI won't show them all but here are the first 3 you'll get:\n\n* The Bunker - In this level, you are in a WW2 bunker, you are not alone in the bunker as a ""Demon Nazi Solider"" lurks within the bunker.\n* The Amusement Park - In this level, you are in a hellish amusement park with twisted rides, a ""Killer Mascot"" will be ready to pop out of nowhere and kill you.\n* The Slaughterhouse - In this level, you are in a slaughterhouse where poor animals get butchered mercilessly, the ""Pig headed Butcher"" doesn't seem to like people like you distracting them from their work.\n\nThe relics themselves are important to the monsters and taking them will just cause the monsters to go into a violent rage. why are taking the relics? because you must finish the task that the fortune teller gave you and collecting all relics will make the fortune teller release your long lost sister.\n\nand lastly, how did your sister went missing? the fortune teller says that ""The Nightmare"" took her away because she lost a bet to it. if your wondering, yes, The Nightmare will be the 20th and last monster you'll encounter.\n\nnow onto the game itself:\n\n'Crying Nightmares' will be a upcoming first person-adventure-survival-horror video game, it will be made with Cinema 4D and ZBrush. The game will have a lovecraftian vibe to it. the game will NOT be for kids and those with faint of heart or epilepsy because it will contain:\n\n* Swearing\n* Blood and Gore\n* Violence\n* Sexual Violence\n* Sexual Content\n* Jumpscares\n* Drug Usage\n* Flashing Lights\n* Nudity\n* Offensive Symbolism\n\nThe year that game will take place in the game will be the 90s."
c0rigb|The Vindicator - Brand New Video Game Concept|I've been conceptualizing a video game for a while now. This idea I have is extremely ambitious and challenging. I aspire to be a video game director, writer, and designer. This new game I have in mind is called The Vindicator. The main gameplay hook relies on Extreme adrenaline pumping action with gunnplay and melee combat, an 80s retro inspired neon atmosphere, a thought-provoking story featuring multiple characters with multiple story paths, and an epic synthwave soundtrack that would rival the Hotline Miami soundtrack. All of these elements are what makes this game unique and special. I've been collecting artwork and music and ideas over some time now. I have folders of concept artwork that I have borrowed on various internet platforms that feature characters, environments, enemies, combat, Etc... I have borrowed songs from various artists, building a playlist of songs that Inspire the soundtrack I want to hear in my game. I have even completely conceptualized how combat and level design will work in my game. The games that take inspiration are Max Payne, Hotline Miami, Doom 2016, Bloodborne, and Maximum Action. It also takes heavy inspiration from 80s neon retro, 80s action movies and horror movies, and HP Lovecraft stories. All of those games and movies and stories feature mechanics and gameplay elements and design aspects that I would like to use in my game. But I also want to create something new that people have never seen before. And I have it all planned out. I'm just very hesitant in sharing more of the story and ideas I have, in fear that someone might steal some of my ideas. Because what I have in mind is very special I believe. I believe my idea is possible to accomplish if the right team of people were assembled and the passion to create were strong. If any of this sounds interesting to someone to discuss, please let me know how we can share some more ideas.
bwy7bv|Ive had an idea for a video game since mid october and i decided to make a good video detailing my ideas. Its called Noltros Quest. A mix of Mario 64 and Zelda 64. If you have ant questions or suggestions to add, comment on the video or here. Id like to hear your ideas and thoughts.|
btxbsq|Arcania|You are are born in without magic in a world where most people have some in one way or another. People without magic are persecuted and used as slaves, but you create magic tricks to trick people into thinking that you have great and powerful magical powers. e.g. tricking people into thinking into thinking that you have teleportation/conjuring powers by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. You decide to get revenge on this unjust system by fighting the heads of each form of magic. These forms of magic can be anything from time manipulation to necromancy. This would be a side scrolling pixel RPG platformer, kind of like shovel knight. I think that this could be a great concept if fully fledged out. Be nice, I'm quite young. P.S. I know a little programming but I'm not too competent.

atq14n|PvE Battle Royale, PvP enabled zones|"I don't have any skills to help make this into a reality. If somebody wants to take this idea just pm me that it might become a real game and I will play it.\n\nThe idea is that it's PvE only except in certain areas of the map that are intentionally difficult to get to by map design or mob spawns. Players might be able to survive solo early on but after enough time the hordes of enemies should force enemy players to at least survive near each other to cover each others backs.\n\nHaving voice comms would be great. Although a fully voice ping system like Apex would be ideal, to prevent shear toxicity over vc.\n\nThe pvp zones should allow dueling, so 1v1 only. Or 2v2/3v3, etc; depends on the game mode I suppose. The main purpose is to allow the final players to push through the mobs to a goal and fight one another rather than ""Fight until the other guys make a mistake and die before we do.""\n\nOf course, people don't have to duel if they don't want to but if it isn't against the last other player(s) then it should reward decent loot. Maybe a guaranteed tier of loot depending on the time into the game."
at26gl|Battlefield: Chronos|Alright so this is my first video-game concept i'm actually putting on paper (metaphorically speaking).\n\nSide Note: I'm a non-native english speaker, so if there are any difficulties reading it, PM me so i can make myself clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere we go\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright so the concept is just a regular Battlefield game (First-Person Shooter), but the twist is, time is involved.\n\nI'll start with Multiplayer, in normal Battlefield (let's take Battlefield 4 as an example, as it is my favourite Battlefield game) you have Conquest mode, a mode where you have to capture ticket points to drain the tickets of the opposing team. In a normal round of Conquest, the duration of this game is 60 minutes as default (i believe, but we'll take 60 minutes as an example). The twist however is that every 10 minutes (in this mode and time duration atleast, it can be tweaked if a game lasts 30 minutes or indefinite) the time changes. What i mean with this is that you start the match in the Prehistorical age, you can choose weapons from that age (e.g. early spears, bows, clubs or slingshots). After 10 minutes time shifts to the Ancient Age (Ancient Rome or Greece etc.), now you can choose weapons from the Ancient Age, such as short swords, daggers, upgraded spears and upgraded bows. After another 10 minutes time shifts to the Middle Ages (Medieval Ages), now you can choose weapons such as Long swords, Broadswords, Halberds, Crossbows and upgraded bows. After another 10 minutes, time shifts to the Age of Exploration (1500-1600), now you can choose weapons such as muskets and flintlock pistols, upgraded melee weapons such as pikes, upgraded ranged weapons such as bows and crossbows. After another 10 minutes, time shifts to the present age, with upgraded ranged weapons (firearms can range from WW1 to present). Melee weapons won't play a huge role, so for now i only have combat knifes noted. After 10 minutes, the final phase of the match ensues, the Future Age, in this Age you can have all weapons from the earlier ages, but upgraded (e.g. a Halberd, Handbow, Shortsword, Club, Slingshot etc.) but upgraded (e.g. a Halberd will be a Laser Halberd, a Handbow will shoot laser beams etc.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for player customization, players can have different skins, and can adjust those skins with color grading (e.g. a color palette). So for example in the Prehistoric Age, you have a caveman with a leopard skin robe. With the color Palette you can adjust the skin tone of the Player Skin, but also adjust the color of the Leopard Skin. Also in later ages such as Ancient, you can choose from a wide selection, such as ancient roman soldiers, but also Germanic or Brittanic Barbarians or Persians. In the medieval ages you can choose from different factions such as the Byzantine Empire, Holy Roman Empire, Chinese Dynasties, Mongols, African Empires or Indian Empires. For the Age of Exploration you can choose from European Empires such as Portugal, Netherlands, Spain or Italy, American Factions such as the Mayas, Incas or Aztecs. In the Present Age, you can choose from soldiers from the 1st and 2nd WW (for example german, english, american, french, russian, eastern-europese, chinese, japanese, korean, indonesian, northern-africans, eastern-africans, western-africans, southern-africans, arabic, middle-american or southern-american troops). In the Futuristic Age (cloning will be a thing in the distant future (IRL), so in this game it will also be possible), you can choose characters from all previous ages and adjust them with the color palette. (e.g. a Ancient Roman soldier running around with a Laser Sniper as ranged weapon and a Laser Halberd as melee weapon)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor most modes in Battlefield i haven't thought about how it will be compatible with this setting, but with gun-game i can see it working out. It works because in gun-game you kill someone, and you get a new gun, and in this game if you kill x amount of people, you can shift between ages (e.g. from a slingshot to a roman shortsword).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what i can improve about this concept, i think it's a cool concept and i can see it working in a First-Person Shooter or a Third-Person Shooter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you guys enjoyed this concept, and i sincerely hope that one day a develepor (Indie or Triple A such as EA) will pick this idea (or some form of timetraveling shooter game) up and make a game.  
ag9iut|My idea for a game that is a combination of Stardew Valley and The Sims| \n\nYeah i know that i've posted this before, on other subreddits, but here is my idea:\n\nGameplay:\n\n1. Farming like Stardew Valley\n2. Traditional combat system\n3. A family system+aging like in The Sims\n4. NPC's can remember what you or a member of your family did\n5. Building your houses/stores/etc. and work/live in them\n\nGraphics\n\n1. Handpainted Graphics\n\nSetting\n\n1. On the land\n2. No electricity, that means you have to do all by yourself\n3. But you can hire NPC's\n\nIf you have any questions or improvments, let me know in the comments
aez2dp|Game Concept: A 4X/Sim game where all players start on Earth|"So, I have absolutely 0 ability to (or time/inclination to get the ability) to actually make a game. Let alone one like this. But I like to come up with game concepts as a way to relax, and for some reason felt like posting this one somewhere. This is really an amalgamation of dozens of ideas about 4X games that I've had over the years. So, here it goes:\n\n# RACE FOR THE STARS\n\n# Game Start (Empire Selection)\n\nThe fundamental idea comes from playing 4X games and Grand Strategy games, which of course also means Stellaris. Then the thought has occurred to me (and I don't think I'm the first or only one to have the idea tbh), of a twist on the traditional symmetrical start. Here instead of all players having symmetrical starts in different systems, they have the same start in the same system: Earth. Here's how it would work in my version:\n\n* In 2200, Earth and the Sol System is at peace. War has simply become so costly, it is not viable. As a game mechanic, internal war on Earth and within the Sol System is not possible.\n* At the turn of the century, FTL drive is at last discovered, opening up the stars for exploration and colonization.\n* All 'players' (by the term I'm including human and AI players) play either a nation, or a federation of nations, or an international organisation, whatever works, which has the will and means to exploit the final frontier. Each nation/organization will get to make a number of choices at start-up, which determine its Government and its starting Pops.\n* Pops are a concept from Paradox's Victoria and Stellaris series. They represent population. This game would follow the Stellaris version more than the Victoria version. Each Pop will have: An ethnicity (purely graphical), a culture (corresponding to your organization), a wealth (poor/middle/rich), and an education (low/middle/high). In set-up, poor and lowly educated Pops will be cheaper, and a larger number of Pops will provide a larger migration push (increasing colony growth). But, richer and better educated Pops will provide economical and research bonuses.\n* A key idea is that the Pops you start with do not change or grow. Population on Earth is stagnant. Changing your Earth-bound population is something you'll only be able to do per random event or at great costs. So at its core, original Pop set-up is about choosing a balance between economic strength, technological strength, and colony growth which stays with you for the rest of the game. (With the idea being that these three are equally balanced, and the decision is about playstyle, not one of the three always being better.)\n* Government set-up can provide some additional, more unique bonuses. For example, one idea is an ""out-of-the-loop"" option which starts the player off without access to the newly invented FTL for the first 5 years of gameplay. Putting them behind on exploration and colonization, but in exchange for other bonuses such as perhaps more points to invest in Pops. Or another example would be a ""long-standing space enthusiasts"" option which starts the nation out with a number of nearby solar systems already mapped.\n\n# Early Game\n\nThe early game would be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and researching.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nSimilar to Stellaris, the location of all stars on the map will be known to all players at start, but not anything else. Players will have to fund exploration missions to specific solar systems to discover what's there, and open them up for expansion and exploitation.\n\nExploration missions will work like decisions and events. Players select the star system they want to explore, then are given: a time cost, a credit cost, and a mission success chance. The success chance will depend upon the player's researched technologies, and any government bonuses or malussen. But, the player can choose to increase funding, pay more credits, to improve the mission success chance. Mission success chance will at its worst decide if the mission is a failure all together (the star system is not explored), but primarily decide how much of the system's features are uncovered.\n\nEach system will have a number of stars, planets, and moons. Any successful exploration mission to an unexplored star system will immediately reveal all stars, planets, and moons in the system. It will also reveal whether planets and moons are habitable or not (more on habitability later). It will not, however, reveal all system features.\n\nSystem features are things like resource deposits on planets, resource-rich asteroids, rare cosmic features of scientific value, and alien habitation or artifacts (more on aliens later). In general, certain features (resource deposits) are more likely to be discovered upon first exploration, while others (rare resources, alien artifacts) are more likely to remain hidden. Once a system has been first explored, it is possible to explore it again to uncover more system features, but building outposts or stations in a system also adds a passive chance each month to discover as of yet undiscovered system features. (So it's a choice to either spend a lot of money for a second exploration, or expand to the system and led the passive exploration uncover its secrets.) The idea behind this is to give a bit more uncertainty to a systems' value. Players should not feel 100% certain about the value of theirs and their rivals' systems until the mid-game phase.\n\nAfter having explored a system and/or revealed system features, the exploring player will be the only person with information on said system and features for a certain amount of time (5\~10 years). After that, the discovery will have 'leaked' on Earth and become public knowledge to all players. Certain government bonussen or malussen can increase or decrease this timer.\n\n**Expanding and Exploiting**\n\nOnce a system and its features are explored, the player will obviously want to start taking advantage of them (especially while they are still the only one who know about the system and its features). Players here have the option to build either stations or outposts, with most or all system features only being exploitable by one or the other.\n\nStations are just basic stellar assets. They cost an up-front cost and time to build, with both increasing the further the system is from Earth. Once built, they take a flat maintenance and provide a flat bonus based on the feature they're exploiting. With more advanced technology, stations can be upgraded (again for a distance-scaling cost and time), which increases their output. Once a player has build a station on a system feature, no more stations may be build on it (neither by them or by rival players). System features that take stations are generally asteroids, gas giant mines, stellar features, etc.\n\nOutposts are burgeoning colonies. Outposts can only be build on planets and moons, and will always exploit any system features on said planet or moon as well as provide some base resource production regardless of features. Outposts will start with a single Pop, and then proceed to grow more Pops at a speed determined by the Outposts owners' migration push (based on their number of Earth-bound Pops). I'm not sure how complicated this system should be (Stellaris 2.2 levels or something less than that?), but at minimum more Pops will mean greater resource extraction and production. In addition, for every Pop a player has in a system, they gain a decrease in the cost in time and resources for any construction they do in the system. Each player can only have one outpost per planet/moon, but multiple players can build outposts on the same/planet moon.\n\nFor the costs of building and maintaining colonies, habitability comes in. Planets and moons are divided into two classes: terrestrial and non-terrestrial. The latter are classified as non-habitable, these are toxic worlds or barren worlds without atmosphere, where habitation always requires underground or bubble colonies. These have flat penalties that greatly increase both building and maintenance cost (including costs for keeping Pops happy and supplied). In general colonizing such worlds is only worthwhile if they have very lucrative system features, or the player just wants a colony in the system and there are no better options. The former, terrestrial worlds, are classified as habitable, but start the game with a habitability rating. Going from 0% to 100% the habitability rating determines the penalty for building and living on the world, with 0% being equal to a non-terrestrial world and 100% requiring minimal upkeep. In the mid-game terraforming will allow improvement of terrestrial worlds' habitability ratings.\n\nIn this early game phase, finders-keepers will be the name of the game. Players will have little to no ability to act aggressively against each other, but will instead be trying to be the first to build stations or outposts in key systems.\n\nThere would be a natural but complicated balance about what systems to aim for. Systems closer to Earth would be cheaper to explore and expand to, but this would go equally for your rivals. Systems far away are more expansive to explore and expand to (and more numerous) and thus less likely to find competition. The intention is that this balance leads to strategic decisions. Players more focused on research will be in a better position to focus on far-Earth systems, whereas players more focused on expansion will be in a better position to focus on near-Earth systems, with players more focused on economy somewhere in-between. But there's always the option for research focused players to just want that one great research system feature in a near-Earth system. Or expansion focused empires to want to contest that very resource rich far-earth system.\n\n**Research**\n\nI don't have any innovative ideas for research (pun intended). In the early game, the main advantage of higher tech would be that it enables research players to focus on a more tall play-style where they expand to a few far-Earth systems but are able to largely monopolize all resources in those systems.\n\n# Mid-game\n\nSo, the early game is largely about strategic decisions as to what to explore, and where to build stations and outposts. With the goal of beating your player rivals to key systems and resources. The idea is that this is a very competitive, but otherwise largely peaceful phase of the game. This is then shaken up in the mid-game, when several key features become prominent. There would not necessarily be a clear breaking point at which these features activate, and it might be possible to make limited use of them in the early game too. But overall the game would scale where due to cost/tech/etc. these features move from peripheral to core as the game goes on. (Similar to how, for example, exploration moves from core to peripheral, as the map becomes largely explored.)\n\n**The United Nations**\n\nThe governments on Earth are slow and bureaucratic, but eventually they do notice the rapidly growing interstellar expansion. The Sol Navy is increasingly equipped with FTL drives, and non-FTL capable nations begin to want to meddle in the affair of the (player) FTL-capable nations and organizations. This would work as follows:\n\n* In principle, the United Nations is always neutral. When attacked, attacked assets will defend themselves against the attacker, but the U.N. as a whole will remain neutral. When the U.N. goes on the offensive, it are specific assets (i.e. specific fleets) that switch to being hostile to the target of a U.N. offensive while all other U.N. assets remain neutral.\n* As a faction, the U.N. does not have Pops, and does not have research or an economy, etc. Neither can the U.N. build assets, but neither does the U.N. need to pay upkeep, and so on. All U.N. assets are created by event-driven mechanics, and assumed to be supported by a general budget supplied by all Earth nations.\n* Each player gets a U.N. influence rating going from -100 to +100. Players with positive influence can spend influence to have the U.N. take certain actions. Some examples of actions are:\n* Demand U.N. control of Station/Outposts: *The U.N. makes an official demand to a rival player to transfer one of its Station/Outposts to the U.N. The rival player can refuse, but this will lower their U.N. influence.*\n* Demand Freedom of Information: *The U.N. makes an official demand of a rival player to share one of its researched technologies, instantly giving it to all other players. The rival player can refuse, but this will lower their U.N. influence.*\n* Give up U.N. control of Station/Outposts: *The U.N. gives one of its stations or outposts to the player.*\n* Various alien-related interactions (more about aliens later).\n* U.N. influence would naturally accrue for all players, but certain actions such as donating stations/outposts or resources to the U.N. could buy additional influence.\n* If the player's U.N. influence goes in the red, there will be an increasingly larger chance of them suffering bad U.N. events. At first (around 0 to -50 influence) these events will involve the U.N. demanding stations or outposts from the player. Even they refuse, their influence will go down even further. At the lowest levels (-50 to -100 influence), the player becomes at risk of having a U.N. fleet send to their systems to have stations and outposts seized by force. After giving in or losing to such a U.N. action, the player's influence will increase (so there shouldn't be a U.N. death spiral).\n* Player's can take hostile actions against the U.N., but obviously this will incur hefty influence penalties. In the early and mid-game, the U.N. fleets should be virtually unbeatable. Meaning the player has some leeway in how to deal with the U.N., but should assume that the U.N. will always get their due.\n\nGenerally, the U.N. would be a mechanic for players to harass each other without going into open conflict.\n\n**Colonies**\n\nWhen an outpost has grown to house a certain number of Pops (5\~10), it becomes possible to (relatively cheaply) upgrade it into a colony. There should be no downsides to upgrading outposts into colonies. Instead, outposts open up new abilities and strategic decisions for your settlements:\n\n* Regional discounts: Whereas outposts provide discounts to building costs (both time and resources) in the system they are in, colonies provide discounts to building costs in the system they are in *and* in all neighboring systems. Thus players with colonies in a system will find it increasingly easier and cheaper to expand in said system and neighboring systems. (The result would be that the mid game is when the player starts fully exploiting all system features in systems they control, but also that said control will begin to consolidate in specific regions where their main colonies are.)\n* Terraforming: In the mid-game, players will unlock the technology to be able to build terraforming buildings on colonies on terrestrial worlds which will give a monthly/yearly increase in the planet's habitability (up till 100% ofc). Meaning terrestrial worlds will become increasingly more populated and productive.\n* Military logistics: Colonies will provide military logistics for their own and neighboring systems, opening up the military aspect of the game.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe player will have some ability to build FTL-capable military ships from the start, but these will be limited in their use due to military logistics.\n\nMilitary logistics would basically be a supply rating. In each system, every player has a military logistics rating. This rating multiplies the upkeep cost (credits/resources) of any military ships the player has in-system. The scaling would be something like:\n\n* A system in which the player has no bonuses is x20\n* A system in which the player has minimal bonuses, such as a system where the player only has an outpost, or a system which is only supplied by a small neighboring colony is x10\n* A system in which the player has a colony, or which is neighboring a large colony, or which is neighboring Sol, is x5\n* A system in which the player has a large colony, is x2\n* The Sol System is always x1\n\nThe idea is to have the overall costs be straightforward and intuitive: military action in systems close to Sol or your own colonies is cheap. The further away you get the more expensive it becomes.\n\nMilitary conflicts in the mid-game should primarily be border skirmishes, and conflicts over systems in which multiple players made colonies/outposts in the early game. It should be possible do to more daring strikes against distant targets, but it'll be very risky and costly.\n\nIn addition, any aggressive action against rival players will lose the aggressor U.N. influence. (This also helps the U.N. become a bit of a balance mechanic, where more peaceful strategies can use the U.N. to deflect and harass more aggressive players who are low on U.N. influence due to their aggression.)\n\n**Culture**\n\nAn additional development in the mid-game is that colonies should start to develop their own, planetary culture. Each system will have a 'system' culture group within which each planet has their own planetary culture (which is the same even if multiple players have colonies on the same planet). Newly founded colonies will have the Earth colony of the founding player, but in the mid-game pops will begin to switch over to the local planetary culture. Pops with a different culture from the player will produce unrest and desire for independence. In the mid-game this independence desire should be mostly manageable, but the larger colonies get with more Pops of local culture, the more difficult it will become to manage. Naturally, failing to provide for Pops what they need in upkeep can drastically magnify these cultural issues and make them a severe problem even in the mid-game.\n\n**Aliens**\n\n\*Insert Aliens meme here.\*\n\nPlayers will already be able to discover aliens in the early game, but it is in the midgame that players will start being able to meaningfully interact with them. There would be roughly four kinds of aliens:\n\n1. Alien Relics and Alien Wildlife: Left-overs from bygone alien civilizations, or non-intelligent wildlife. These will show up as system features, and provide special resources or open up unique technological research paths.\n2. Alien Primitives: Intelligent aliens, but with pre-modern level of technology. These will exist as neutral outposts, which do not block player factions from building their own outposts on the same worlds. In the early game some minor random events can happen around sharing a world with alien primitives. But in the mid-game, tensions will flare, and players will have to decide how to deal with alien primitives long-term. (Wiping them out, integrating them, or isolating them in some kind of reservations.) This will also open up new U.N. features where players can push for the U.N. to take up official position on how to deal with alien primitives, for example encouraging players to wipe them out, or forcing players to abandon outposts on worlds with alien primitives.\n3. Alien Rivals: Intelligent aliens, on roughly technological parity with the players. They will generally not allow players to build outposts on their worlds or stations in their systems unless as part of some kind of diplomatic deal. These can be burgeoning interstellar empires in their own right, or lone colonies separated from their homeworlds. Meeting these will also open up new U.N. interactions. Generally, in the case of the more powerful alien rivals, the players will not be able to challenge or deal with them in the mid-game. But, the U.N. can be pushed to either sign diplomatic deals or declare war on alien rivals instead. In the late mid-game/early late game it would be possible to have the U.N. declare total war on alien rivals, or sign permanent trade and peace treaties, dependent on which players have been pushing the U.N. in what direction.\n4. Alien Superiors: Intelligent aliens, that are massively more advanced than the players. They can be friendly or hostile, but generally act as a kind of mini-U.N.'s. Players cannot openly challenge or defeat them, but can incur favor to gain boons or move them to act against the players' rivals, or players can incur favor just to prevent themselves from being targeted.\n\n# Late Game\n\nIn the late game, the galaxy has changed. Billions of humans are now living in colonies spread across dozens of star systems, and are growing increasingly resentful towards control from Earth. New mechanics rise to prominence.\n\n**Earth vs Colonies**\n\nIn the late game, the majority of Pops on colony worlds should be of local culture. In addition, several worlds will have become massive, with dozens or even hundreds of Pops. In addition to being unstable themselves, these worlds will began to export independence desire to neighboring systems.\n\nPlayers will have to make a choice which side to support. Though some hedging will be possible, overall players will need to choose either the route of maintaining direct control from Earth (though this could be done through both democratic and autocratic routes), or else the route of moving their own government to the colonies and seeking freedom from Earth (whether peacefully or militarily). In the early and mid-game players will already have faced choices between improving their Pops and situation on Earth, or on their colonies, but in the late mid-game to early late game these decisions will ramp up towards a definitive split.\n\nMilitarily, players will now be able to field fleets capable of challenging and defeating the fleets sent out by the U.N. Though, at least initially, Sol will still remain untouchable. Players who built themselves for aggression should also have the ability to launch major offenses to grab whole systems or regions from rival players or even rival aliens.\n\n**Doomsday Clock**\n\nDependent on the course of the game so far, tensions will begin to rise on Earth. Old grudges will re-appear, and the long-preserved peace will be increasingly challenged. New U.N. options will allow players to push for peace or for war on Earth. The latter will be represented by the Doomsday Clock, which will tick up as more players, through U.N. actions and random events, ratchet up tensions on Earth. If the Doomsday Clock reaches its maximum, the U.N. will dissolve and all out nuclear war will break out on Earth.\n\nThe result of Doomsday will be unpredictable. Generally, there are three possibilities. In all cases, Earth will cease to be treated as a special case and instead becomes just a planet like any alien world:\n\n1. All life on Earth is wiped out, and the planet becomes a tomb world. Considered non-terrestrial for habitation purposes.\n2. Most life is destroyed, but some nations survived. This will be represented by one or more player nations (largely chosen at random) getting colonies on Earth, with a population derived from their Earth Pops. Earth will be considered a terrestrial world, starting at 0% habitability.\n3. Most life is destroyed, but the U.N. reforms and takes direct control. All players will be evicted from Earth, and instead Earth will become the center of a new AI player faction called the United Empire of Earth. The U.E.E. will start with a considerable fleet and all technologies researched by any player, but will henceforth need to manage an economy/etc. like any player (and be vulnerable to conquest and annexation and so on). Earth will be considered a terrestrial world, starting at 0% habitability.\n\nAn alternative to the Doomsday Clock would be if players goads the U.N. into declaring war on a powerful Alien Empire, and the U.N. loses. An invasion/orbital bombardement of Earth by aliens could lead to similar, but appropriately different, results as the above.\n\n**Victory**\n\nIn the late game, victory becomes a possibility. Generally, victory conditions will be about establishing a new status quo. These can for example be:\n\n* Establish a Free Colony: *As an independent colony, have at least X amount of pops and control at least X systems, and declare independence. The U.N. or the U.E.E. must be dissolved or else have officially ratified your independence.*\n* Establish Direct Control from Earth: *With Earth as your homeworld, control least 80% of all human colonial pops, and declare the Imperial Charter (outlawing colonial independence).*\n\nGenerally, the balance would be that players who focused on Earth will want to be more aggressive in the late game, and players who focused on their colonies will want to be more defensive in the late game.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo, obviously, there is still a lot missing. But generally, anything I didn't mention (such as buildings on colonies, starship design, etc.) are areas where I feel standard 4x mechanics would be fine. Or, at least, where I don't have any better/alternate ideas.\n\nAnyone interested in providing thoughts and comments, or has their own ideas that fit well with this one, you're very welcome to share. As I wrote, this is not something I expect to ever be able to make, so it's just fun theory-crafting and imagining a kind of game that does not seem to exist and no one seems likely to make in the near future."
aedtvf|StillBorn|You are a person who lives in a world where there are three types of humans--the AirBorn, people who live in high altitude ares, the WaterBorn, people who live near the sea and on islands, and the EarthBorn, people who live in flatter, landlocked regions. Each possess specific attributes that let them transverse those areas--AirBorn have wings, WaterBorn have gills and fins, and the EarthBorn can roll across the lands at high speeds. You possess none of these attributes. Being unable to move through this world like the others, you are StillBorn. However, you're very clever and by breaking into the seven puzzle-ridden temples that are scattered across this world, you can steal technologies from these people that allow you to build gadgets that enable you to transverse the world like they can. Slowly but surely you acquire a litany of methods to move through and across this world that work alone and through practice can be used together for great affect.\n\nExploration and puzzle-solving would make up a major chunk of the gameplay and it all goes towards freeing up and improving (specifically the fun of) moving in the world, providing a constantly improving gameplay loop. There would be some combat as well, which the gadgets and technology you create and steal would also play a big role in.

I'm willing to pay 70$ for one (just replace the mouse buttons and make 2 mechanical keyboard buttons fit in place)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPICTURE: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/210909819631042560/505535105092026369/image0.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/210909819631042560/505535105092026369/image0.jpg)
9pemwv|An anime Hero based RTS.|This crazy idea combine two major aspect that normal RTS gamers usually hate:\n\n- Anime aesthetic: I have seen plenty of player who dislike any kind of anime related on RTS game.\n\n- Hero based RTS: Some people really hate the RPG and hero mechanic which lead to MOBA style for a RTS.\n\nNote: This idea was meant to fill the niche interest of a smaller community as I believe some of us may like either two of those aspects I mentioned.\n\n1) Heroes Design:\n\nSince I wanted to give a good example I will use Warcraft 3 as an example for easier understand. Unlike RTS game with Hero like Warcraft 3 you only maintain about 2-3 heroes at the time and started to farm everywhere on the map. This game require you to use a lot of them but there is a few major different about them:\n\n-Those heroes doesn't scale, as they worked exactly like the normal units (albeit with a few active abilities). Basically you would have some worker hero who do the normal structure building like normal worker unit like WC3 Peasant. The role doesn't changed except for more ability instead.\n\n-No item, no farming, no level up. In order to upgrade your heroes you have to buy upgrade and upgrade them like the normal unit. And since there is no level up all of the heroes started out with the full abilities.\n\n-You can only control one hero for each hero at the time. It's mean you can create a huge army with a lots of heroes but none is the same as you can only have one for each. You can only buy that same heroes again if they are dead.\n\n2) Economy Design:\n\n-Since I wanted to promote small skirmish over the large battle I wanted to find a way to force player split their force over many different location at once. For that solution I decided to follow Company of Heroes design. \n\n-By creating a map filled with multiple resource point to capture both player have to capture as many as possible as not only they generate income but if one player reached a critical mass of points they will automatically win the game. \n\n-This force player have to be very aggressive in order not to fall behind. Also, the map need to be filled with choke point for each capture point to promote defensive/positional heroes to shine in that role.\n\n-Also, player are still able to build structures for research, building unit or defense. And with the huge amount of heroes you would have even more ‘units’ to think of which force you to think what heroes is useful for each situation. And with the population cap you are not allowed to spam them but this also mean it somewhat reduce the burden of micro as microing and multitasking a huge heroes based army is extremely hard to do it.\n\n3) Aesthetic and setting:\n\nThe setting took place in a fictional world which follow Gothic aesthetic. The story would follow the Gothic Horror trope as it provide many different races and characters for the game variety (I prefer to choose Gothic trope as Medieval Fantasy seemed to be very cliché from what I experienced). \n\n4) Heroes Roles:\n\nSince those heroes basically act like normal units their role would be somewhat like normal unit as well except for a few things. Here is a list of roles for them:\n\n-Worker: All of the spells will focus mainly on increasing resource, building and scouting.\n\n-Frontliner: Basically tank or any heavy unit which is used for frontal combat. Their spells will focus on durability and survivability.\n\n-Harasser: Worked as a scout and harasser. Their spells is usually involve with mobility and high burst damage but their will fall short once they run out of mana. As there is no scaling like MOBA or Warcraft 3 they would be very fragile and their damage will not be useful in frontal combat.\n\n-Artillery: Long range heroes which engage in long range. Require cover and support as they are fragile.\n\n-Support: Support with aura, healing and buff. They are also stay in behind as they are the easy prey for the harasser with the high burst damage and mobility.\n\n5) Important Note:\n\nThere are a few important notes about the mechanic that I think of:\n\n-Line of sight: All of the unit vision are not a circle but an arc. By this kind of shape you can be flanked very easily if you don't cover enough vision around you. This allow fast and fragile unit to out flank the enemy from a different rear. The line of sight is varied depending on the balance and unit.\n\n-Slow turning rate: Due to the need to punishing player from positioning in a wrong way the slow turning rate will make any successful flanking become more fatal. \n\n-There will be no stun or any heavy disable along with blink mechanic as I wanted all of the spell have heavy drawback so that player can interact or make the counter play with it. The main form of mobility will be increasing speed or teleporting (but it would come with heavy drawback and long delay). The main form of disable will only be slow, negation of damage and soft debuff on the enemy. As any player with higher skill will be able to run out of those disable easily.\n\nAlso, here a list of pros and cons for this idea.\n\nPros:\n\n-Some people may love it as normally there is almost no anime RTS which is popular on the market.\n\n-Anyone who wanted something that is unique in term of playstyle with heroes instead of normal unit (even though this idea would not be good as intended depending on different people opinions).\n\n-And since the normal RTS setting are either scifi/modern warfare/world war2/cold war or Medieval Warfare/Medieval Fantasy the Gothic setting would be something less common than other. Again the setting would be a niche as well I think.\n\nCons:\n\n-Plenty of anime hater would dislike this idea. I don’t blame them anyway, people have different taste.\n\n-People who love traditional RTS with resource building, normal unit and a smaller role of heroes unit. My design goes completely against this common though.\n\n-Very micro intensive and require multitasking. Since my design goal already promote both of these casual player may not be happy with it.\n\n-Due to the high amount of heroes needed to increase the quantity of units for the purpose of splitting and bigger combat many of them would be overlapping in term of role and usage.\n\nFinal Note: The reason for this design is because I wanted something new and different from the normal path of RTS game and it also comes from my own secret love for anime aesthetic as well.\n
9mmezl|Boogieman vs. The Home Invader(s)|So this idea has been buzzing around in my head for some time now.\n\nYou're a Boogieman. Your purpose is to create fear, and feed off of it. The more fear you consume, the more powerful you become. However, the kind of fear you must feed off of is a fear of the unknown; should someone find you, identify you definitively as the source of their fear, your power will be lost and you will quickly fade from existence. For this reason you've never tried to get more fear than you really need, content with the shivers of a child in bed at the unseen monster in the closet.\n\nThat changes when someone decides to target the family. *Your* family. This outsider threatens their lives, and with it your source of fear. But with them so terrified, you can feel yourself becoming more powerful than ever before. Powerful enough, perhaps, to protect them, and make this outsider pay for their mistake.\n\nThe basic mechanics of the game would be that the more scared each family member gets, the more powerful you become, starting with being able to make distracting noise and moving small objects to causing thunder to shake the house and moving large objects like a poltergeist. Obviously more fear means you can use these powers easier, but the more fearful any family member becomes, the less rationally they will behave and the more likely they'll do something that will get them killed. So the game is a balancing act of keeping them scared but also safe, all while keeping yourself out of sight.\n\nI imagine each character might have different reactions to fear (maybe a parent might get more protective and throw themselves at threats, while a child might be able to handle fear so long as they've got their stuffed animal, but they'll wail if they lose it). I could see a story/campaign more with a set group of characters, with multiple endings based on who survives. After completing this there could also be a challenge mode where you mix and match the kinds of characters you're protecting and perhaps even the nature of the threat (ranging from mundane home invaders right up to a full fledged nearly indestructible slasher movie antagonist).\n\nSo any thoughts on this idea?

9kb4yu|Civilization meets Street Fighter|"So I have been playing a lot of Civilization VI lately. (Like an unhealthy amount of ""a lot"" if you know how those games work.) On the opposite side of the gaming spectrum from top down grand strategy and politicking to pure one v one fisticuffs for deeply personal offense, I love the Street Fighter games as well. They both appeal to me in different ways but on one account in which they appeal to me in the same way is there emphasis on world cultures. In one it's a semi-historical overview of great nations and their leaders, in the other it's a more caricatured but light-hearted romp around the world with fighters that represent broad vertical slices of their culture.\n\nI like them both for such similar reasons despite their disparate game play that I actually got an idea kicking around in my head. What if there was a game in which you played normally in a top down strategy board as one of several factions, and when combat broke out, you'd switch to a selection of fighters from your nation and fight one of the opponent's champions?\n\nThe mechanic could be used as an alternative to total war or a semi-peaceful way for two parties to settle a dispute. It could even change the fighting game's normal stances on killing. Instead of knockouts or fatalities, the fight could either be to knockout or to the death depending on the cultures involved and the context of the fight. For instance, a trade disagreement would probably be settled non-fatally but whether an entire city comes under new ownership or not is probably better settled when the champion of one side or the other is slain. Here's the kicker then, if your character is killed in combat, they're eliminated from your playable roster for the game. So all sides have to be careful how many times they throw down the gauntlet or else they risk running out of ammo and being defenseless.\n\nIf such a game did exist, would you play it? What are your thoughts on what kind of factions would there be? Would it be real world countries like in the examples above or some other theme? If so, what kinds of factions would you put in? What about the fighters? Should each side have an exclusive roster only they can use or should fighters be able to be recruited to whichever side wants them? How would they range on the plausibility scale? We talking Tekken, Skullgirls, or something in between? \n\nWhat are your guy's thoughts?﻿"
9k8gb2|"""WHAT IS IN THE CORN?"" An Indie Horror Game sees Volunteer help and Supportive community."|Hello and welcome.\n\nMy name is Twilightwolfy and I'm a nobody that has no life or anything to look forward too in life. I want to develop and create a game from scratch with no prior knowledge of how to use systems or programs. The only true talent I have is writing and creative ideas. I want to create a game entitled “WHAT IS IN THE CORN?” A horror Indie game that takes place in Ashwind farms, a farmland nestled somewhere within Nebraska.\n\nIn the game you play the role as an investigator. You start your investigation during the day time hours by collecting and gathering intel from eye witnesses and then you start setting up various cameras and sound recorders for the night investigation. Once night descends the horror begins. The atmosphere grows more intense and dramatic and the creature finally starts to make itself known.\n\nYou must be immersed and attempt to capture evidence of the said creature before dawn or before you risk exposure of a heart attack. You are equipped with a Heart Rate Meter which beeps whenever your heart rate spikes. If your heart rate spikes to high, you are at risk of having a potential heart attack.\n\nThis game has four unique maps. The Barn, The Windmill, the Cornfield and the Farm House. You must travel back and forth between each location because the cryptid beast will continuously go from place to place. The main goal of the game is to stay alive throughout the night and attempt to collect enough evidence to earn evidence points. Evidence Points will then be used to help level up your character to unlock newer and more improved equipment that can help get better evidence for more points.\n\nEach night that passes a new creature immerges and different eyewitnesses come forth to discuss what they had seen.\n\nI have high hopes that this game will become incredibly popular. Now I know that I do not have any college degrees in gaming or what not, but I hope that with the right amount of people and creative minds, together we can make this game a reality.\n\nBear in mind that this is going to be volunteer work. Whatever you do whether its music, developing or programming you won’t get paid for the time being. I being the game’s inspiration and idealist I cannot pay others to help create this. I wish I could but unfortunately I’m unable. This is just in the “Idea” stages of creation and hope to let it develop in time.\n\nIf you still insist on helping me out in creating this game, that is awesome! We also love support. So if you want to join us in supporting the game then you are more than welcome!\n\nI look forward to working with you! You can find our Discord invite below this message!\n\nPS: Yes I had posted this once before but got depressed and deleted my old posts. But am back again reattempting to do this again!\n\nWhat We are looking for:\n\n**Supporters**: People who support the idea and want to see it come to life.\n\n**Music Composers**: People to compose haunting and chilling atmospheric sounds and music.\n\n**Programmers**: People who know how to properly program.\n\n**Artists/Designers**: People who are talented in the art and design category to help produce posters and more.\n\n**Project Manager**: Someone who can manage the project, keep everyone in line.\n\n**Quality Assurance/Game Testers**: People who are willing to test and try out the product and give reviews on how the performance is.\n\n**Producer**:Someone to help produce the game and its products.\n\nIf you wish to apply please go to our Discord channel and @ me there!\n\nDiscord Channel - [https://discord.gg/DM6uTDM](https://discord.gg/DM6uTDM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nHere is our Gdoc which contains more information about the video game and what you can expect from it and what else is to come!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WAwj2-uZWZb2sMaZc-4cG9ShEww9FKn7RHBpKaeOkS0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WAwj2-uZWZb2sMaZc-4cG9ShEww9FKn7RHBpKaeOkS0/edit?usp=sharing)
9jpzu2|What is in the Corn? (An Indie Horror Game based off a fictional farmland in Nebraska - WIP Updates frequent)|  \n\nWHAT IS IN THE CORN? \n\n**Game Concept**:  For nearly a year now weird and strange things have happened within the corn growing in Ashwind farms. Paranormal encounters and the like have been reported within the vast field spooking away farmers and local residence. \n\nBut of course a team of investigators do not believe the rumors that are linked to Ashwind farms. Some have reported seeing cryptic beasts that are only believed to be mere myths.  You and your friends form this investigation group that must investigate the strange happenings around Ashwind farms. \n\nLocals who have visited Ashwind farms have reported sightings of various creatures. From the Mothman, Goatman and even the Jersey Devil had been reported slithering, wriggling and roaring through the corn fields of Ashwind. It is up to you and your team to investigate the fields and farmland in which the sightings have been most reported. \n\nSpend your daytime setting up cameras, gear tents and even traps that you can use to attempt to capture these alleged beasts that roam the farm at night. \n\nMaps: There are three maps available for Ashwind Farms. The first is the **Barn**. The barn is a large structure that contains most of the animals that live among the farm. These animals reside in the barn during the nighttime hours. Horses, Chickens, and cows are kept safe from the horrors outside the barn. \n\nThese animals are a great source to your team to help you identify whether or not a monster is close or near the farm for the animals will start acting distressed. You are able to place cameras and voice recorders near the barn to help you hear the animals at HQ. The best time to start investigating is when the animals start making distressed noises. \n\nThe second part of the map is the **Corn Field**. The Corn Field is a massive field of corn that can hinder your view upon entering. One takes a great risk when entering the corn. Most of the reports of these sightings have happened inside the corn itself. Crows can be within the corn and are vital for you to watch. If you see crows taking off into the sky at a distance, you are not alone within the cornfield. Crows only take flight when a creature is within the field.  \n\nThe third part of the map is the **Windmill**. The Windmill is a large structure that is ancient and old. Some say that it lures in the paranormal. But most sightings around the windmill involve ghosts and specters and strange light anomalies. These strange light anomalies are most active when a cryptic is nearby. \n\n**Nighttime**: Nighttime is when the action begins. When the hour grows late strange occurrences begin to happen that attempt to spook you and your teammates. You and your team are equipped with heart rate monitors to judge your fear levels. The more fearful you are the more the beasts will be attracted to your scent. \n\nYou are equipped with a flashlight that is used to help illuminate dark areas and spot anything that catches your attention. \n\n**Heart Rate Monitor**: Each investigator is equipped with a built in heart rate monitor on their HUD. The heart meter helps indicate how much health you have available. The lower the heart rate the more likely you are not to die. The higher the heart rate the more likely you are to die. \n\nIt is important for investigators to keep their heart meter down. Whenever they are in within a short meter range of the beast their investigating/hunting the meter will begin to beep frantically. Investigators must then attempt to hide or be immersed in order to lower their heart rate. Running and begin in the fear zone of the beast only makes the heart rate go higher. \n\n**The HUD**: Survivors have a HUD display on their screens. This HUD displays the following. \n\nOther Survivors Names down to the bottom left screen, small hearts near each of the survivors names will pulsate red or start to pulsate if their near a creature or at close range of the beast. \n\nThe survivor’s own heart rate monitor is on display on the bottom right side of the screen showing the heart rate number on the side.

9ckop7|My concept for an alien hunting game (some inspiration from Gantz)|So I guess to start off it would mostly be a 4 player Co-op game where you are trapped by another human like species that is significantly larger and more technologically advanced. There you are pitted against other various aliens and monsters that are for the most part stronger than you. Each fight will consist of one boss and multiple minions each awarding points that'll allow you to buy upgrades for you weapons and cybernetic suit. \n\nNext off my vision for the game is for each battle to be in a random arena against a random enemy. I want large quantities of fights and arenas, no fight should feel familiar. I want players to be terrified of what they fight like you never know when an enemy might just pull out some surprise move. Also I never want a skill you aquire for stats like agility or melee weapons to feel useful all the time because this game won't allow tactics that are cheesy to be frequently employed. Once again every encounter should be scary to go up against even if you've fought them before you should constantly be on edge. Another thing is enviorment should mean something, I'm so sick of not being able to use enviorment to attack enemies, of course it shouldn't always be effective either. Most of all a victory should be hard earned, every win should feel amazing and awarded as so. \n\nNext it's time for some gameplay details. Everytime you kill a boss some execution based on your weapon will happen, for example so a spider like creature that you kill with your bare hand will get it's leg ripped off and plunged into it, or a demon Ronin that is killed by a sword will have some showdown execution where both dash past one another while striking. Now killing a boss should automatically end the fight and start awarding points, the player who finished off-the-wall boss will usually get some sort of weapon from them and certain bosses that are defeated by a designated weapon time will get an extra special weapon. Time for skills now, skill should be tree based and investment heavy but be very impactful in certain situations, likewise they might be a hindrance or nearly useless in some scenarios but every perk tree will have perks for every situation. Example being something like in agility you may have wallrunning which is useful in condensed areas like cities but useless in a wide open field however another perk like sprint that would boost speed by a percentage when running in a straight line. So for skill there should be two perks awarded for every 100 points earned, one for a attribute skill and another for a weapon skill. For attributes I had the following ideas, agility, strength, defense, intellect, stealth and willpower whichbessentially boosts special powers outside of regular weapon attacks. And for weapons, primary, secondary, heavy guns, melee and ordanace. Each tree will have several types like melee including swords, Katanas and axes or primary including assault rifles, smg and machine guns. \n\nI have way more stuff but I can't list it all in this one reddit post. If you are interested message me here or on instagram @bebop_blues2071.\n\nI can't code so if anyone thinks this game is interesting and can code please message or even leave a comment, I really think this could be an awesome game. 
9443xl|Super Smash Racing concept|I've had this idea bubbling in my head for a while: a kart racer (not unlike Mario Kart) starring many Nintendo characters! It would be kinda like many kart racers in the sense of there are items on the stage you can use and the tracks are varied and have occasional things you have to avoid, but the racers are all Nintendo all-stars, specifically ones that appear in Smash! The characters vehicles are vehicles they ride in their games: Mario on a kart, Link on Epona, Kirby on a warp star, Ness on a bike, Fox in an arwing, Samus in a little gunship, Donkey Kong on Ramby, you get the point. The items you can get are (like in Smash) both original items (a bumper, a bat, maybe a beam sword) and stuff from the Nintendo games (mushroom, star rod, Mr. Saturn). Also, each character has a unique ability they can use by filling up a meter. The ability would be different for each character (Mario would have a fireball to slow down other racers, Link would use a sword to hit racers that get too close, Kirby would inhale and spit out racers at other racers and maybe copy their unique attributes, Ness would use PK Thunder which would home in on racers and stun them for a bit, etc). Each racer would have unique attributes with speed, acceleration, and the like. The race tracks would be based on stuff from games (Peach's Castle, Hyrule Fields, Onett, Skyworld, yadda yadda.).  How is my idea? Any other things you wanna add onto it? What would the characters, items, and stages be like? Thank you! \n\n-garrett
907fu5|L.A Noire 2 Story Ideas?|So I really enjoyed playing L.A Noire and in fact I did another play-through and I just fell in love with it again. So I got to thinking, how could a sequel work and I came up with a few ideas. Let me know what you think?Oh and just to mention there is spoilers to the game, obviously. \n\nFirstly, lets say that Cole and his mistress had a baby on the way and he/she eventually grew up to be a cop. Then they start asking questions about their father, how did he die? Why was he suspended and eventually given a demotion?\n\nUpon hearing the true meaning behind the demise of their father, the main character then becomes hell bent on revealing that his or her father was not a bad man and was only after the truth.\n\nI am fully aware that the game will be set some years after Phelps's death and so instead of going after the men who ridiculed their father they go after their children and the main character finds that the children are much worse.\n\nI think that the LAPD could have links to organised crime and the mafia as well as taking bribes to look the other way. Seeing as this would be set some 19-20 years after the ending of the original game in the 1940s the game would be set during the 60s and so could look at racism within the force too.\n\nWe could also see a showdown with the guy whom everyone hated, Roy Earle as this was the guy who ruined Phelps's career.\n\nWe could see the main character having to sneak around Earle’s mansion trying to find evidence about his involvement in the whole Brenda scandal.\n\nWe could also see some characters from the original game come back too such as Stefan Bukowski and Jack Kelso and could help the main characters by giving interviews or the like. \n\nIn terms of cases and missions, I believe that there would be a mixture of regular cases where the main character does actual police work and then cases where they would look for evidence against the corrupt officers within the force.\n\nAfter working and finding enough evidence to send the corrupt officers down he goes to the press, and with the officers private deals all over the newspapers they are all arrested and face trials.\n\nThe final scene in the game in my opinion should be when the court is sentencing Roy Earle.\n\nJust as in L.A Noire there will be street crimes where you can respond to crimes going on all over L.A however I think they should include the ability to pull over cars, check licenses and partake in police chases  that sort of thing.\n\nAnother idea I have is instead of going several years after Phelps's death. Rockstar could go straight after the death of Phelps's and put us in the boots of Jack Kelso who by know is the DA's investigator and the whole story will be focused around the reformation of the LAPD.\n\nThis way we can see the scene I think everyone who has played L.A Noire would love to see and that is Roy Earle getting his comeuppance with him either ending up dead or in jail.\n\nAnd of course Rockstar could just go in a completely different way and get a new setting in a new city with a new story and a different time. For instance, the Miami drug war during the 70s and 80s. I feel it would be cool but could maybe not stand up to the original setting of the first game.\n\nSo let me know what you think?
8v8sfh|A massive game and... Platform?|While not explicitly a videogame concept, I have for awhile now been mulling over a concept that could help indie developers and gamers alike. There is a game, but I'll put that later.\n\nBasically, I have a distaste for leaving games and characters that I've poured hundreds of hours into, made them look good and powerful, etc. After watching ready player one and rewatching SAO and SAO2 (again), I came to the conclusion that I should at least try (mostly because there's no major game maker that would sink the time and money to make something that wouldn't make them super rich).\n\nSo, it must start with a game engine and acompaning software, like world and object creation tools, art stuff, etc. All the things you can find with the big names like unity, unreal, etc. with an important difference. No character creation should be on a by game basis (very SAO here). A separate software would be for character creation, and that caracter would be transferable between worlds (likely through a separate server to check for malicious coding, as Minecraft had an issue with malicious skins, and I'm sure they're not alone). This caracter would have traveling stats, possibly reductions between worlds, options for stat clearing, etc. \n\nThen the worlds themselves could range from small, simple, single person in their bedroom, to large development team making massive worlds and complex stories. Emphasis on anyone and everyone who wants to make a game can make their game (like unity). \n\nAnd then a game to show it all off.\nThe game that would be built in parallel to the engine would be a massive, underground world with emphasis on vertical (SAO style), where you can do anything or be anyone, like what I understand Skyrim is like (I confess I have not played it). Lots of hidden entrances, traps, the likes, and enemy scaling, depending on play style (single player vs party). Always online (as much as I don't like it, it is the best use of a massive world), with parties, guilds, the likes (of course), and stories that vary depending on what character you make, to help cultivate lies and tension between the races (like the real world)\n\nThe default races would be along the lines of \nDwarf - short good builder/smith\nElf - magic, good range/healer\nHuman - good short range/tank\nFaries - farmers and ranchers/archers\nCustom - make whatever you want, good for high end gamers who are looking for special characters.\n\nThe goal of the game is to get out of the ground, to get home, but ideally, it would take several years of complex gameplay to actually beat the game. The alternative to dungeon hunting, mapping, and trying to beat the game, is to do things like chefs, cosmetic shops, smiths, breeding/taming, once again, anything you can possibly want to do you can do. \n\nI do have extensive external documentation for lots of details.
8rhs2k|My concept for an open world RPG like no other!!!|For a long time now I've been wanting an open world RPG where the various species of the world are like insects and the world they inhabit towers over them. Trees are like skyscrapers on crack, mushrooms are like normal sized trees, etc. You get the point I hope.\n\nInstead of being insects though, the various races of the world are humanoid and share similarities based on actual insects, and their cultures are influenced by these insects but also the fictional world they inhabit. Gravity would be extremely toned down of course to compensate for the extremity of their tininess, and each species would obviously have their advantages and disadvantages relevant to the world, kind of like The Elder Scrolls.\n\nThis world, in my mind, would be extremely vertical as well as horizontal, and rather than a world threatening catastrophe, it would be more of a personal story, perhaps unique to the species the player chooses, and I imagine it would be like a classic Bioware game in which relationships with NPC's could be developed, explored, ruined, etc. Obviously player choice would be important, and the game would adapt according to the choices made.\n\nI think a large vibrant world that towers over the races inhabiting it would feel so unique and so cool, and the physics associated with that could be fun to experiment with as well. It's fresh, exciting to think about, and if done correctly could be a game that is talked about for generations.\n\nMonsters roaming the world could also be based on other bugs, maybe more predator-type bugs like spiders, pray mantis, etc. Or even perhaps based on tiny reptiles or other animals that prey on insects. It all looks so fantastic in my imagination, but I can see it all and what I see is so gorgeous and so epic.\n\nIf anyone reads this, is inspired or just really likes the idea, and is good at drawing, please feel free to post concept art for my idea that would be amazing! Start a discussion with me about this too, I'd love to bounce ideas off each other and build on my concept. Thanks! 
8r941m|Multiplayer Free to Play Action RPG idea|code: Sovereign\n\nA multiplayer online survival mech strategic action rpg shooter simulator where players are mercenaries that carry out contracts from simple farmers to corrupt business executives. Complete your missions in highly sophisticated mechas called Sovereigns.\n\ncode: Sovereigns take place in an alternate reality from our own. The big bang created different circumstances for the humanity. What we know as Earth was named Erdeunia. Once humanity had obtained Space Travel, the pursuit to find many Earth life planets set forth a different age of colonization. Within a few millennia, Erdeunia has become a city planet, barely any nature, ground to near orbit, Erdeunia is filled to the brim with megacorporations, megacities and a dwindling government.\nWhat makes this game exciting for players is that they can do missions and when they amass enough resources they can open up their own mercanary company that can be populated with real players and AI units. Everything in this game is gained by the players themselves through contracts and careful reading of terms and agreements or through the in-game clan system or with their friends and family who play code: Sovereign. My hope with this is that the economy is ran by the players similar to that of Eve online and Warframe economy, I'm hoping with less intervention from devs.\n\nSovereigns are a new thing to bless the mech genre. Taking inspiration and paying homage to popular franchises\nMecha Design Style for Player Characters: Zone of the Enders,  Xenogears\nMecha Deisgn Style for Enemy Characters: BattleTech, Warhammer 40k\nHow the Mechas operate: Armored Core\nHow the Mechas function in the game world: Gundam, BattleTech, Macross, Custom Robo\nCombat Style: toggle switch between first/ third-person shooter\n\nOnce the player is introduced to the game world after customizing their avatar. They will choose their starter Mecha a la Pokemon style. The goal would be for Players to have a many Sovereigns in their hangar that can do a variety of things or if they choose, a Sovereign they believe can do everything.\nEvery Sovereign is created by a company and has a make and model. Players will get to know the strengths and weaknesses of said brands and will mix and match parts like we do a fancy sleeper car. And like sleeper cars, you will need to invest into your Sovereigns to see results. \nWhen obtaining new Sovereigns, you can outright buy them from dealerships, other players/NPCs or get blueprints and build them from the ground up, all with their risk and rewards.\n\nSo it's an online survival mech action strategic RPG shooter simulator, what does that mean?\nMecha Maintenance is essential: Refueling, Rearming and servicing your Mecha will determine it's effectiveness in battle.\nInsurance: when haters hate. People destroy what they can't understand, NPCs and fellow Players can't understand why you're winning and they're not so they want to humble you by destroying your property.\nUpkeep: cash rules everything around you, you gotta pay to live in that fancy apartment with the fancy hangar and the fancy maid.\nAlso if you own a mercanary company, the NPCs and players you hire have needs that need to be met and salaries paid. \nSocial interaction: your player character does have to eat, sleep and shit and also has a social life. Your character does have responsibilities, for example paying off tickets or fighting it in court or bring sued by other players.

8mcckc|Looking for feedback on multiplayer game idea|You play as a human\-animal hybrid. At the beginning of the game, you choose an animal species to be. The species you are effects some of your stats \(for instance, a cat might have high speed but low defense.\) \n\nYour character can take two different forms: a humanoid with a few animal\-like characteristics and a non\-human animal. You press a button to switch between the two different forms, which each have their own advantages and disadvantages. The animal form allows you to use a special power specific to that animal. For instance, transforming into a bird allows you to fly, and transforming into a fish allows you to breathe underwater. This form\-switching mechanic is \n\nHowever, while in animal form, you can't use weapons, armor, or other tools, and some of your stats will be different.\n\nThe game consists of a large open world, with many secrets to find and sidequests to complete \(many of which are specific to your species.\) There's also a LAN multiplayer functionality that allows players to play the game together, either competitively or cooperatively \(and I think this would work especially well in the bossfights.\) Playing the game multiplayer can be extremely useful when the players' species complement and balance out one another.\n\nThe towns in the game serve as a place for the players to trade and rest, but they also are home to interesting random events that shake up the gameplay. For instance, a random event that might happen would be a boss siege, where a boss takes over the town and players must defeat the boss to return the town to its former state.\n\nSo, that's my video game idea. How can I improve it?
8m0spv|Project godlike - An idea for a 2D fighter game.|# The idea\n\n‘Project   godlike’ is a 2D fighter with the twist that every fighter is made as   ridiculous and overpowered as possible \(hence the name ‘godlike’\).   Things, that would be considered gamebreaking in other games, are   somewhat a standard here. The game is kept balanced due to the character   variety and rock\-paper\-scissors mechanics, which can be found in games   such as Smash 4 or Overwatch \(‘counter picking’\). Additionally, this   game full of mechanics and has a high skill ceiling to keep it fresh and   fun.\n\n# The formula\n\nJust   like in Skullgirls, the player can make a team of 3 characters when   playing in a 1vs1 battle. Every character introduces new mechanics and   maybe even their own health bar. Most often, characters are in a 1v1   situation, but can call others for assists \(again, like in Skullgirls\).   The stages are flat, and don’t have obstacles \(for more see: stages\).\n\n# (Possible) Characters and abilities for the characters that would fit this game\n\nGenerally,   the cast should be kept small so that balance can still be focused  when  characters are created. The bigger the roaster, the less balanced  the  game. This means, that multiple ideas can be used for just one   character.\n\n· **The zombie**:   Can revive themselves in fights. This ability should be limited. On  the  other hand, this character might have a small healthpool.\n\n· **The vampire**: Drains health as they hit you.\n\n· **The tide\-turner**:   A character, which can swap with any of the opposing team’s characters   for one of the own. Obviously, this character must have weak attacks   since this ability itself can be very strong, and the ability to swap is   limited \(a certain amount of damage is dealt, a cooldown, or something   else\).\n\n· **The dodger**:   A fighter, which is able to dodge most attacks easily with the help of   button inputs. The twist: The character only has 3 life bars, where  one  depletes after a single hit by the opponent. This character should  also  deal moderate damage to fit to the high\-risk, high reward  gameplay.\n\n· **The wall**:   A character, which can’t deal any damage, but can stand in between the   fighters. It can take a lot of hits, but the characters which are  being  protected can block combos and stronger attacks. While this  sounds very  strong, the player having this character basically only has  2 characters  to fight with and the other player can also prevent the  wall from  coming in by pressing a combination of inputs. The ability of  both the  player and the opposing player to bring in or block the wall  by using  this input should also be on a cooldown to make the impact  more  significant and not spammable.\n\n· **The one\-hit\-KO Wonder**:   This character deals no damage but fills a meter next to his health   bar. When the bar is filled, and the according input is used, the player   can one\-hit KO one of the characters. Can be mixed with the dodger.\n\n· **The character which opens a rhythm\-based minigame and the one who wins, kills the other**: Ridiculous, right? Perfect.\n\n· **The character which is in some form controlled by the opposing player**:   While this sounds like it would make you lose, it will interrupt all   ongoing attacks by the opponent. Can be mixed with the wall\(?\).\n\n· **The character with big hitboxes**: This character can deal damage over a large portion of the screen.\n\n· **A character that can swap between stages**: Why not.\n\nWhen looking at these ideas, we can already see some rock\-paper\-scissors\-relationships and interesting dynamics:\n\n· The vampire can abuse the wall and leech health for his own good when he predicts that it comes in.\n\n· The dodger is a counter to the vampire, since he has little health to drain.\n\n· The one\-hit\-KO Wonder is countered by the zombie.\n\n· The dodger counters the one\-hit\-KO Wonder, since he is able to block/dodge all the attacks.\n\n· The wall can’t do much against the one\-hit\-KO Wonder, which attacks may be strong enough to hit both wall and shielded player.\n\nIt   should be noted, that the ideas can be combined: A zombievampire who   can heal and revive themselves or a one\-hit\-KO Wonder which is more   dangerous because he is also a dodger. We have no limits, this is the   formula of the game!\n\n# The stages\n\n· **The stage with no walls**: You can’t get cornered in this stage, it will keep scrolling in the according direction indefinitely.\n\n· **The point\-blank stage**: Characters stand at point blank.\n\n· **The normal stage**: Just a normal stage, like it can be found in most fighters. How boring!\n\n· **The stage with teleporters**:   There are teleporters on each side of the stage which lead you to the   other side \(Alternatively: No teleporters, if you go in at a side you   come out on another, like in Smash 4 on the Stage balloon fight\).

8cgi27|Horror Game Idea (trigger Warning)|"I see this as a short-to-moderate length indie game, and could work with a number of different graphical styles--the one that sticks out in my head is a minimalist pixel art style, though, something akin to the Last Door series.\n\nThe basic premise is this: You're a child in a broken home, routinely exposed to violence and abuse. You have tasks to accomplish over the course of the day, and the things you've been able to do, and the way you've done them, affect just what happens at night.\n\nThere's a catch: The abuse you endure has had a profound effect on you. You *can't* do certain tasks, as there's simply too much pain attached to it, or because it would take more emotional energy than you have. This emotional energy can be restored by recreational tasks, but not reliably--often, you'll play a video game, read a book, phone a friend, etc, and receive no energy bonus, leaving you with one less hour in the day and nothing to show for it.\n\nAt night, the monster comes home. Depending on what you've accomplished, the monster might behave differently. Depending on a large number of other variables--variables you don't have control over--it may fight something else in another room, simply depleting your emotional energy for the next day. It might approach the room you're in to attack. Your cue here is that the door it's entering through will darken, and that darkness will spread until it encompasses the room, at which point it will enter, the darkness will abate as you see the ""monster"", which will flicker between the simple human form of your parent and a more monstrous, abstract form. If you leave the room when you hear the footsteps and see the darkness spreading, you can evade the monster, but if they enter the room before you leave, you're paralyzed with fear and have only moments to do something to lessen the monster's wrath, which may or may not work depending on what you've achieved that day, or week.\n\nEach of these encounters takes from your emotional energy for the next day, starting you out with less and less reserves as the week goes on. Eventually, this will lead to a day on which you start with close to zero and you'll have a complete breakdown, which triggers  an early ending.\n\nI'm thinking a number of endings; some will be better than others but none 100% happy. Some might end in divorce/separation, running away from home, CPS getting involved, where others would see the family acknowledging the problem and trying to make things work, or trying to make them work without acknowledging the problem."

7tdegk|Captain N & The Game Masters remake|I don't think this game would ever get made but would love to see a concept build to submit to Nintendo.\n\nFor those not in the know.  Captain N was an animated series on television from 1989 to 1991 the concept was about a kid that got sucked into their Nintendo Entertainment System and was trying to stop Mother Brain and a team of bad guys from taking over  Videoland.  \nThe game would not be a continuation but a complete reimagining of what Captain N would be.  \nThe game would feature various hub worlds comprised from different Nintendo Games that the player would explore and fight enemies across  With 3 AI companions in an action based rpg type of format.  The companions would be comprised of the original ones from the show but redone to fit within the context of the game.  The companions would be Mega Man, Kid Icarus, and Simon Belmont.  Captain N would no longer be male but a female lead who wears a red and white varsity jacket with an N on it and a cheerleading outfit with white leggings underneath.  The game world would be set in the late 80's with only games from the original NES being used for the hub worlds.\n\nThe Overall Pitch for the game would be a Nintendo Themed version of Kingdom Hearts.  I would love to see a game like this running on Nintendo Switch and I have some Idea as to how the story would go but won't get into it here.  Let me know what you guys think.
7h6sm5|2D Side Scroller that has 3 playable characters|"Okay this is gonna be really bare bones because we're still in the early stages of development here. But basically the game will have 3 playable characters, each with their own playstyle. We're trying to stay away from Sonic or Freedom Planet type stuff but we still are gonna have 2 ""Zones."" per world. The first one will be more of a linear style with a ""Get to the End"" sort of feel. The second section will open up more and allow the player to explore and maybe have a few sidequests. Feel free to ask any questions about it, or provide any constructive criticism about anything I've said."

7fs1kg|Custom Moba were you buy minions and towers instead of items.|My concept is a Moba that tries to do something unique. I thought, instead of having to buy items to make your characters stronger, what if you put that money towards upgrading your towers and minions instead?\n\neach minion wave would have 'slots' for different kind of minions and you can buy new minions and put them in whatever slot you want and they come out every wave on a rotation. you can also pay a large amount of cash for a 'siege minion' that is added in addition to the normal rotation, but once it dies, its dead.\n\nsimilarly you can spend gold to upgrade towers to be better against some team comps or minion types or game states. maybe even spend a large sum of gold to effectively 'rebuild' a fallen tower.\n\nI have designed the concept for a few characters, and I am interested in hearing peoples opinions on the characters. These characters are without a doubt not balanced, but what I'm focusing on is: Is the core design fun? If so, there worth my time. If not, I can try to figure out why and rework them.\n\nI'm very afraid of flooding people with too much information so ill simply leave two concepts that I am particularly proud of.\n\n---\n\nThe Warlord of the Sands.\nClass: Warrior\nGimmick: Special minions, strong single target CC, great teamfights.\nName: Talu'Nakar\n\nLORE:\n\nOn a far off Planet, two ancient powers sought control of the lush, jungle world. These beings were as powerful as Gods\nand created people based on there various traits to fight for the planet. Amongst this race was the Trucance, people\nresembling scorpions, they were based on the god's most dominant trait: The desire to conquer the planet.\n\nThe people were made for war, raised in war, and died in war. The only thing they knew, was war and conquest.\nThey were there most formidable soldiers, but there methods were so brutal, that they destroyed the very land they were trying\nto capture. The lush jungle, became a barren desert, all the plant life trampled by the marching soldiers and the wild life\ncaught in the crossfire.\n\nThe God saw the destruction, and felt regret for what he had created. In an attempt to fix what he started,\nhe sealed the Trucance underground in a tomb. However the warriors didn't die, they not only survived underground but thrived,\nthere sheer willpower keeping there people alive. Thousands apon thousands of years later, the tomb crumbled to time, and there\ngreatest warrior emerged. \n\nTalu'Nakar was the strongest member of there race, at the time. He battled the underground monsters\nand each other as there champion, but he had never been in a true war, and his blood craved it. War was what they\nwere created for, and he had the primal desire to sate his curiosity. \n\nWhen he broke the surface, his people saw no war, without purpose, they were lost. \nBut when there greatest warrior rose to lead them, they didn't question his orders. Now, Talu'Nakar explores the land\nseeking to carve a future for his people the only way he knows how: War, and Conquest.\n\nABILITIES:\n\nPassive: Warlord of the Sands\nTalu'Nakar leads the people of the desert. He and his allies may recruit/Buy his solders in the base\nto fight on the front line as powerful lane minions.\n\nFirst ability: Burning Stinger\nTalu'Nakar jabs forward with his mighty stinger. If it hits an enemy, that character is poisoned, and begins to take DOT.\nIf an enemy champion infected by the poison casts an ability, they take immediate bonus damage. \nHe may use this ability well casting his second ability.\n\nSecond ability: Overwhelming Crush\nGrabbing the nearest enemy, Talu'Nakar squeezes them between his claws, dealing damage and then throwing them\nin the direction of his choice. If a thrown champion hits another champion, both of them are stunned. If he throws the\ntarget at his feet, the impact causes the ground to shake around them, dealing damage to all enemies \nin the area and briefly rooting them in place.\n\nThird ability: Adrenaline Rush\nThe excitement of war surges threw his veins, getting pumped up for battle, he gains a movement speed boost\nand an immunity to slows well this is in effect. If he strikes an enemy with Burning Stinger or Overwhelming Crush\nfrom outside of combat with this ability up, he gains a brief power buff. Entering combat cancels this ability early.\nIf he uses this ability well his sandstorm is up, the movement speed and power buff is doubled and\nbeing forced into combat will not stop this ability channel.\n\nUltamite: Zealous Sand stream.\nSumming the power of the desert, he bathes the entire battlefield in a mighty sandstorm. Well the sandstorm is in effect\nTalu'Nakar regenerates additional health overtime and has increased vision, well enemy minions have decreased vision.\nHis people are empowered by the sandstorm, gaining bonus damage against structures. If his soldiers are nearby\nTalu'Nakar well in a sandstorm, they share his bonus life regeneration. \n\n---\n\nThe Void Terror\n\nClass: Assassin\n\nGimick: Good single target lockdown, high mobility, mana dependant. \n\nName:\n\nLORE:\n\nIn deep space there is a race, a rare one. There a massive species of dragon-like creatures. Resembling a wyvern, \nthey have black narrow bodies and fly threw space, teleporting around by forming black holes and consuming the energy of stars.\n\nOne such 'void wyvern' was flying towards a star, passing by an asteroid. The asteroid was populated by a small alien village, \nwho's religion foretold of a giant black monster from space that would destroy them entirely. When they saw the beast\n passing by, they panicked, and attempted to kill it.\n\nWhen he was attacked by these people out of no were, he naturally turned his full wrath on them. the people inadvertently brought \nthere doom right to them, fulfilling the destiny when they tried to stop it. The cultists of the planet\n took a desperate attempt, using there magic to try to bind the magic of the wyvern.\n\nThey only got half way threw there spell before he stuck out and slayed them. With the people slaughtered and feeling weak \nby his spell, he teleported threw space and flew to a random planet to rest. He had been transformed, becoming much \nmore animalistic then a wyvern, much of his power was drained.\n\nNow, he was hungry. Starving for mana and weak in his new form, he'd need a lot of mana to regenerate\n\nABILITIES:\n\nPassive: Manic Hunger\nThe Void Wyvern feasts on mana, and the less mana he has the more hungry he gets. \nHe gets bonus power for every % of his missing mana.\n\nfirst ability: All seeing sight.\nThe Void Wyvern opens his fifth and sixth eye, gaining a buff that increases his vision and \nallows him to see threw walls as well as increasing his movement speed. His mana constantly drains well in this state.\n\nSecond ability: Shadow Slash\nThe Void Wyvern slashes forward with magic infused claws, if he strikes an enemy, they are dislocated\n from the space time continuum, dealing damage and forming a time rift at his current location. \nIf he activates the ability again in the next three seconds, the target is teleported to the time rift and stunned.\n\nthird ability: Carnage\nThe Void Wyvern chomps down on all enemies in a cone in front of him, dealing damage and stealing there Mana. \nEnemies hit begin to bleed, taking damage over time and leaving a trail of blood behind them wherever they go.\nBleeding enemies take bonus damage from his basic attacks, at the cost of his mana. \n\nUltimate ability: Black Hole.\nSmashing space and time, The Void Wyvern forms a black hole at his target location, and a second one at his current \nlocation. These black holes constantly drain his mana, but remain in effect so long as he can supply them with mana. \nBy looking at a portal and reactivating the ability, he may teleport to the black hole, gaining a speed boost \napon exiting the portal and removing the portal. Any portals that he is not looking at when activating the ability \ninstead implode, pulling nearby enemies inside it, and dealing massive damage to them.\n\n---\n\nPlease tell me what you think of the general concept and the characters. Any opinions are welcome, more voices will help me better design characters.\n
77tuxb|Ninja Rabbit Video GAme|Looking for people to help with a game idea.  I've got the bare bones for a story and am looking for artists and coders to help make it.\nThe game takes place in Japan with bipedal animals in the roles of Samurai and Ninja's instead of people.  You would Play as Kano a Rabbit Ninja who upon returning from a mission where she destroyed a bandit fort finds her village burning to the ground and the other rabbit residents missing.  Upon following some tracks she finds some of the villagers in a cage escorted by wolf warriors who are working for the lord of the region.

Kano will have to defeat each general and destroy each camp to rebuild her village and gather an army to defeat the feudal lord.\nGame Type: Open World Game\n\nGameplay:\nCombat plays similar to the batman games.  With Kano able to use her increased senses to inner a mode where she can ease drop on enemy conversations and hear nearby heartbeats to sense nearby enemies.  Throughout the game Kano will be able to challenge masters that when defeated teach her a new ability that unlocks in her skill tree.\nDruken Master unlocks perfect counter ect. \nKano can do siqe quest’s by helping out other villages and npc’s which help her gain experience to level up and unlock new skills.\nKano earns new armor and swords either but completing quests or finding them hidden throughout the environment.\n\nWell that's the basics let me know what you guys think.\n
6qfr0p|Just a massive community build game|A game where development starts around an area, say New York, then it is slowly expanded so everything that is mapped on google earth is created. The game would centre around economy and would be an MMO that has people fighting over power. Bots equal to the population and when someone signs in, they possess a bot (kinda like matrix agents) and when you log off you are leaving your characters standing up to others. Super unrealistic and would most likely require super pc.
6qduxm|A video game concept about different forms of rock and metal music.|"This Idea I had has been drifting around in my head ever since I saw a movie with my family called Rock Dog. It was produced by Mandoo Pictures, which is some studio in china. A part of me hated the film solely for how much they missed out on a huge, far more interesting idea for a story than what we actually got. The jist of the movie is that it's about a dog who likes rock and he tries to make rock music. That's it. It's boring as hell, forgettable, and cheaply made. The only part of the movie that caught my eye was the idea of the protagonist's ""Powers"" (Which he only uses 2 goddamn times in the whole movie) would only be activated by him using his guitar. Think of it as some sort of supersonic wave that would shoot out of his guitar. With that idea in mind, I thought that it would be way better to expand this idea of super powers and rock into a full blown game. It would be a Metroidvania type of experience. (Exploration with Dungeon crawling and characters who have unique abilities and traits that set them apart) Each character would have a different type of guitar, and their attacks should sound different depending on what era and type of music they're into. I want the characters to be total weirdos, Like Hair-metal enthusiasts, Heavy Metal Psycopaths, and so on. You could learn different guitar riffs all over the world by finding secrets, doing side missions, or buying them. After you get them, You can play them by pressing buttons on your remote (or keyboard) in the correct order, MUCH like the ocarina from The Legend Of Zelda, Except far more fleshed out and intense. and depending on what you played, you could unlock doors, become invincible briefly, deal more damage, and so on. Your main attacks would be a ranged shockwave that comes out of your guitar, and a powerful, close ranged smack to the face. Perhaps as I think it over more, I could think up more interesting combos you could preform that could keep the game interesting. Because I want it to be challenging, but also easy to get into. I haven't really thought up a story to this, because Im focused on fleshing out a story of my own currently, But over time I hope I could eventually be motivated enough to create a story on my own.

6phzy7|predator|ok, here is an idea which I think would be a great video game. Just recently, the game Friday the 13th came out. I was thinking that if there is a indie video game developer company out there, they should compete against the devs at Friday and make this game! \n\nThe setting would be in a jungle.\n\nOk so basically how the game would work is, 1 random person out of 10-11 soldiers becomes the predator, the other remaining 10 are soldiers who have to find weapons, make traps, hide and over all work together to kill the predator. Predator (player) basically hunts down the soldiers one by one and kills them, just like jason from friday the 13th. If a couple of players are dead within those 10 people, 1 random person would re-spawn as Dutch (arnie) which is a bit more powerful than the other soldiers. Just like Tommy Jarvis from Friday. I have pictured this in my head, it's literally the same concept as friday the 13th but predator style. I really hope one day this game gets developed and released, I would definitely buy this game! What do you guys think? 
6od1rk|Idea for a '60s/'70s retrofuturistic game.|"We have steampunk, dieselpunk, atompunk and cyberpunk, but there is one kind of retrofuturism that isn't getting any love: transistorpunk. \n\nThe 1965-1980 period is filled with sci fi classics with awesome imagery. Logan's Run, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Alien, Soylent Green, Westworld... there is plenty of sources of inspiration to build a retrofuturistic world. \n\nPlus, if you look at a city like New York City during the 1970s, you see a dirty city with a dystopian look where crime is rampant, the perfect setting for a video game. \n\nI envision the game to be a mix of Fallout and GTA. It would be an RPG in the vein of Fallout, where you develop your character and make choices, but with an environment more akin to GTA. You could drive a car in a dirty, smogy, filthy, dystopian retrofuturistic version of New York City. Cars would have looks that resemble cars from the years 1965 to 1980, with futuristic features. Modern technologies like computers and cell phones would be bulky. Radio stations would play a variety of music genres from the afformentioned year range, with maybe a station playing ""classics"" from the 1950s, considering '50s nostalgia was big back in the '70s. The caracters would have '70s haircuts, some with pornstaches, as they have come to be known as. Imagine a movie like Dirty Harry if you wanna get an idea of the kind of character that would be featured in the game. The game would also be very graphic and extremely violent, just like the '70s were known to be. You could dismember NPCs, like in Fallout, but alive. You could use torture to get information and you could even rape adult NPCs and kill children. It would affect your karma, like in Fallout. You could also use and sell a variety of real and fictional drugs, including, but not limited to bootleg alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and LSD. You could do good and be a vigilante punishing criminals for the good of the city, Taxi Driver style, or be an immoral and evil libertine and kill, torture and rape people whenever you feel like it.\n\nI like Fallout and the '50s, but let's give the '70s the love it deserves.

6jmt8r|Multiplayer Game - One Player is a Ghost, Everyone Else is Trying to Survive/Escape|**Premise**\n\nSo you have a lobby of 12-24 players in a map that can be (small or large)/(open or congested) depending on the experience you want. One player is selected to be an invisible phantom (a *ghost* basically) with the intent of eliminating the rest of the players.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe *ghost* can fly at great speed, sense prey, go through walls, and possess bodies/limbs/tech for a short time. Additionally his attacks are devastating and heavily one sided in his favor, eitger instantly killing or maiming. He is not meant to be apprehended directly.\n\nThe *player* can decide to work alone or with others but the game will not encourage or discourage either play-style. The player will have to find weapons/tech/armor that would increase his chances of survival and potentially neutralizing the ghost.\n\n**Gamemodes**\n\n*Last Man Standing* \n\nThe last *player* to survive in addition to the ghost is the winner. If the *ghost* is neutralized or the time runs before the second to last man is killed, the remaining *players* win and the ghost loses.\n\nThe will produce interesting gameplay as *players* may decide to work together or kill others to maximize survivability. *Players* may also choose to either hide and wait it out or attempt to apprehend the *ghost* depending on the the items they have.\n\n*Zombie Mode*\n\nThe *ghost's* objective is the same, but every *player* he kills will join his side amd become a *ghoul*. *Ghouls* are weaker and slower in addition to being visible. They help the *ghost* eliminate the *players* thus securing a victory before the time runs  out.\n\nThis game mode is fun because *players* that strategize by hiding will feel forced to come out, find/loot items and face the music as their discovery will be inevitable with time.\n\n**Items Found in the Map (Randomly Placed)**\n\n2-4 Med Packs (depending on size) for *players* that have sustained heavy damage and move slower because of it.\n\nJust one gun designed for paranormal purposes with only 6 shots. One shot will neutralize the *ghost* amd end the game.\n\n2 Vests that allow *players* (or *ghouls*) to sustain more damage\n\nOne chamber in the map the *ghost* can be trapped in if the player(s) are careful and clever. This will als9 end the game.\n\n2 Laptop like devices that allow the *ghost* to be detected or even seen if he is within viewing range of the screen. This device can be used with the gun.\n\n2-4 guns meant for *players* that want to defend themselves or kill others if they want. This will not affect the *ghost*.\n\n2 grenades cause fuck everybody right? This also will have no affect on the *ghost*.\n\nOne baseball bat, one crowbar, (and one knife if the map includes a kitchen) for melee purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThanks for reading all that. Please leave any ideas or criticism if you have any.
6fjwaz|cyberpunk-style Story/rpg game|Sort of like the CD PROJEKT RED'S upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 RPG, but based purely on survival and vengeance. You play as a low-life that progressively becomes dependent on 'cybernetic enhancements' that can alter your senses and make you become more robot than human. A possible choice later on in the game that the player may face is whether or not they would like to be more robot than human, and possible consequences due to either choice.\n\nSplitting off from either option grants the character an entire new upgrade system, ie if they chose 'robot', then they can get mechanised limbs capable of superhuman abilities, or even abilities to hack into anything with a computer chip(mini games could spawn from this idea too), whereas if they chose human then they could upgrade clothing or attain better weapons, even anti-hacking devices that help them not to be hacked by robots.\n\nThe two branches could also help in developing a split story, where in the end it all ties in one big ending... or maybe not?\n\nkey themes are dystopia, morality and the existential purpose of humanity. I believe these ideas can help the player in making important decisions, and hopefully teach the player that in the real life, there is no such thing as 'the right choice', only opinionated decisions based upon outside impacts.\n\nI would love to hear what you guys think about this idea and please feel free to comment on any suggestions/improvements/constructive criticism. Thank you for your time!\n
6eg9d5|Cyberpunk Matrix|Game set in a simulated reality like the matrix but everyone knows theyre in a simulation. At diffrent points in the game, it switches between real life and the simulation, kind of like Assassins Creed. You play as a hacker, so can get 'body mods'. In the sim, body mods act as a skill tree and you can upgrade your stamina and stuff like that. Outside the simulation, you can get like augmented reality contacts or usb implants or something.\nYou can steal this idea, i think it might make an interesting game.\n\nEDIT: Typos
653679|Kingdom creating online game|PLEASE READ THIS: This is like a mix of survival, strategy and fighting. You start with nothing and collect resources and find stuff to craft weapons, armour etc. there are other players and AI As well running around and you can fight them and take some of their stuff. The fighting is like in For Honor and depending on what combinations of weapons and armour and stuff you have you can unlock different abilities for battle like a shoulder bash or something (for example if you have  certain boots and a certain spear or sword you can do 'swift kill' or something idk). So you can kill them and get some of their stuff but not all and they resonance with the rest (it is random what they lose and keep). \nAnyway- if you get enough in game money (idk where you would get it) you can make a kingdom. It starts as a small hut but you keep upgrading and spreading and taking land. You also hire little AI soldiers that can be one shot or AI mercenaries which are as powerful as players (you can also recruit players as fighter). Being the king gives you certain boosts so you are harder to kill. \nYou can go to war with other kingdoms and stuff. If you kill the king enough times in a row or destroy the base or something you can conquer their kingdom and get all their soldiers etc. \nalso if you are hired to fight for a kingdom you can steal resources from it or start a rebellion, and persuade other players or Ai to join you (for Ai it is a chance that's generated by how much food and stuff the king gives them). Then you can become the king.\nI know that was Long but yeah I thought it was really cool please reply if you think this would be fun too.
63amix|an Army game where you fight giant monsters|There has been a number of both really good turn based strategy games and real time strategy games within the recent years. However, one thing I have been hoping for is a game where you are an army fighting against giant monsters. A game where you see the lives and resources lost when you fight a really giant monster.  \n\nJust for the sake of conversation, here are some ideas for the mechanics of the game: \n\n1) You as they leader of this army or defense force are trusted to eliminate this threat to mankind. By controlling research and development of both your defenders going into the field, the vehicles they pilot, the equipment they use and the weapons they fight with. \n\n2) At the moment the monster I've been thinking of should start off as a recurring monster that you form a relationship with. You see them at first as something that needs to be destroyed. A goal for you and your men but through gameplay that this monster is more than just a simple creature. They think like you, the grow like you and learn from what you do. This is not just your character's foe but you as a player's foe. At least that is what I think. \n\n3) This game should make you feel bad not just for losing, but for what you could have done to help the world more. While fighting a giant monster, people might still be escaping. Power plants might cause the place to explode or make it harder to fight this monster. These are just a few things that would make this game a world you care about and not just for fighting the giant monster but to defend those who can only watch in horror of a beast from an unknown origin. \n\nPost some ideas yourself and lets chat about this ideas together, thanks for coming by ;3 . 
5y74o2|A weird but cool game idea!|"This Idea is dumb but I just want to tell you this to see if you like it.\nThis game is called (working title) ""Clown-Bruhs"".\nThe engine is Gamemaker studios and it is an Open world/sandbox/Point and click (like diablo)/action/adventure game.\nI am not sure yet what is the premise but it could be about a clown looking to have fun or be dank as hell by doing crazy stuff at many locations. But the game is more like Grand theft Auto with a bit of The legends of Zelda: Breath of the wild. Im not sure but it could be cool. Platforms: Pc/Xbox ONE?/PS4?/Switch?\n\nThanks for reading."

5tpnkf|I thought of a good idea for a dating simulator|It's about a conductor in training that gets to conduct his first orchestra only to find out that some of the instruments are actually cute anime girls with different personalities (one woodwind, one brass etc). Throughout his career he will eventually fall in love with one of them. Each route will tell the player about a secret about an instrument.\n\nIt's kind of random. I just randomly thought of it while eating ice cream.

5r0hpc|A bird video game|I know it sounds a little off, but a game where you can be an eagle, hawk, falcon, and basically any bird. A bird of prey hunts and a bird that is prey; say a pigeon, evades.

5om2o4|A game about engineering... Kind of.|I thought of a good concept for a first-person or third-person game, in which you are an electrical engineer in the 22nd century, where you work on a space station. The goal of the game is to discover the hidden true purpose of the station (for example, illegal weapons housing) by using engineering methods (following wires, etc.). I have always thought this was a cool idea.
5nuwbj|A game about water sports|I literally thought of this a few minutes ago.. \n\nI've been playing Ubisoft's Steep a lot lately and was browsing /r/Steep where I saw a post about adding snowmobiles to the game. I was interested, so I clicked to look at the comments. The first comment I saw mentioned adding tow ropes to the snowmobiles, and that's when I thought of this game idea.\n\nIt could include sports like wake boarding, water skiing, kneeboarding, slaloming (which is just water skiing, but with both feet on one single ski), and possibly more that I can't think of right now. \n\nSnow sports have been appreciated in games like Steep, SSX, and the 1080 series, and I feel like it's time water sports got some love, too!
5nm7ua|Rory's Super Mega Awesome Party Adventure|You play as Rory, a stuffed animal red panda who had been purchased as a christmas present. If you follow the linear, way pointed storyline, its a heartwarming story about a toy who just wants to fit in, and throws an awesome party in the hopes of making friends. If you deviate away from the linear story and explore outside of your boundaries, you find out that Rory is not a human toy, but a dog toy. The story changes to a chilling thriller of trying to escape being ravaged by the family's two pit bulls. 
5n8zs4|Indie wrestling game|WWE 2K games have basically ran the sports entertainment wrestling games for well ever. My idea is a game that takes my fascination with indie wrestling and moves it into the forefront. \n\nThe basis of the game is a basic wrestling game, quick matches and all the likes with the different stipulation matches that can be put in. But where I think a game like this can really thrive is on a career mode where you start out in a country of your choosing and move across the country wrestling for different promotions and advancing your own career along the way gaining fans allowing you to wrestle for top tier promotions and their respective belts. \n\nMy only downfall is that most if not all of these promotions would have to be made up or more or less based off the more popular promotions from different countries. However, some indie wrestlers popular indie wrestlers at that could possibly be allowed to loan their likeness to the game giving it a somewhat more realistic feel to it. 
5loj6g|A JOJO INSPIRED RPG|Hello reddit,\n\nI came here because I have a game idea and I wanted to see how everybody would respond to it. \n\nI thought about making an RPG game that would closely resemble EARTHBOUND's graphics. The plot would be loosely based on JOJO's BIZARRE ADVENTURES - DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE with a similar color pallet and many dramatic scene cuts.\n\nIt would take place in a fictional town in the U.S. where a series of weird murders have been happening. The player controls a boy who is looking for his friends who went missing. As the adventure progresses, he gets involved in a game of cat and mouse where the rules are always changing. \n\nWhat do you think about it? Leave your thoughts below please.\nHave a nice one guys. \nHappy 2017.
5g7v2n|Assassin's Creed needs to evolve|"I used to love the AC games but now I can't play them anymore, because I always feel as if I've already played them, all of them. They all feel the exact same to me and I think Ubisoft needs to rethink their direction with the franchise. Here's an idea I came up that would allow freshness into the franchise while maintaining the AC identity.\n\nIt takes place 2 or 3 hundred years in the future, instead of the past, and the world has evolved into a collection of dystopian states. You are a futuristic assassin with any number of potential gadgets like hover boots that allow you to run up vertical surfaces and jump really far distances and like skate across the ground but actually air. Maybe the hidden blades are like laser blades, etc. You discover an organization that doesn't seem to care what's going on in the world around them. They go straight for what they're after and don't care what impact they have anywhere. The first act is discovering this organization, figuring out who they are, maybe Templars? Maybe not. Figuring out what they want and what they're after, and slowly, yet surely, getting a target on your back. Eventually they realize what you're up to and their #1 priority becomes taking you out. \n\nAct 2 will be the cat and mouse game between you and this organization and possibly creating an alliance with either another organization, or a select few individuals with their own talents. This act will lead to the capture, torcher and extraction of information from a member of this organization who reveals to you that your world isn't real and hints at a possible escape but dies laughing never telling you how to do this. And this act would continue by switching the focus from the organization to attempting to gather as much info and potentially a means to ""escape"" until finally, you do. \n\nYou wake up in a self contained prison with some sort of technology trapping you in place. Later you learn this technology is animus technology. You break out of it and learn that you're on an alien spaceship and that Earth was destroyed 1000+ years earlier. You are a descendent of Desmond, and the only hope the thousands of other animus prisoners have of escaping. You learn that the organization you were fighting in the animus were humans (perhaps Templars that conceded they'd never become more powerful than their captors?) sent in to seek out pieces of something the aliens need to analyze and learn from, in order to complete construction on something, and they only learned of its necessity after they destroyed the planet. You must stop this organization from helping the aliens accomplish their goals.\n\nAct 3 will lead you back to an animus station and back to the dystopian future 1000+ years in the past. This is when you learn what the aliens' plans are and how they fit into the picture. You learn yhat they invaded Earth all those generations ago for the animus technology. You find your allies and fill them in and head back to the present to release them from their cells. So on and so forth. The huge overarching plot is revealed and an all out fight or die scenario plays out. You learn why they needed the animus technology in the first place and the truth about everything. \n\nI haven't thought up everything about this concept but if Ubisoft came out and announced something like this I'd preorder in a heart beat. But until they decide to create something fresh for the franchise I refuse to continue playing these games. What do you guys think? "
5dwkib|A game about trying to be Noah on the ark|Now before I start, I dont mean this as a educational tool or some kid focused game.\n\nI'm talking about YOU (playing as Noah) having to take care, manage and protect a slew of animals and your family on the Ark for 40 days and 40 nights.\n\nA mix of Prison Architect (for the building and management aspect) and 60 Seconds! (day to day dealings, survival and events.) You would be in charge of the microsystem of your Ark and ensuring that it all doesn't go to heck within the first week.\n\nAnimals need to be feed, cleaned and given the option to roam around (or locked in their stables if need be). This will be a balancing act of keeping the animals happy but away from animals that consider them breakfast.\n\nYour family would be your labor force that would need to be managed and given responsibilities on the ship but they too need to be kept safe and happy.\n\nrandom events while you're out at sea can occur daily, survivors from the flood (more hands to work), surviving animals (options to breed and reporduce), drifting resources (wood, cloth, fish, etc) and maybe commands from God as you're floating around.\n\nGod's favor would also be a shifting factor that can effect your survival, as he gives you commands and tasks for the week or day, completing,ignoring them or committing sins could effect how he thinks of your capabilities for the job.\n\nA top down view like Prison Architect would be the best way to manage this as you could go up and down by floors of the ship and have a good idea as to what is going on but a first person perspective could lead to some interesting challenge and silliness.
57286v|VR game idea.|"So, what VR needs to do is identify what it is. What is a VR game? So my idea for a ""game"" is you enter a large lab, hospital or whatever, doesn't matter, and have to interact with NPC's. These NPC's have timed routines based on what day it is, what time etc. I was thinking of the player taking on the role of a detective investigating a murder or something along those lines. Not entirely thought out yet."
54ivqp|Hardcore, story driven puzzle game|"Enter the Labyrinth\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe premise is a man is working at a company when he is ""volunteered"" to participate in a new program.  He learns his wife has already entered the labyrinth and his goal could be to find her.  The player could also choose to just find the quickest exit and forget the wife.  I don't want to spoil the whole ending, but the main concepts of the script are comedy, deception, and mystery.\n\nPlayer choice will be a big factor in progressing the story.  For example, the player may choose negative actions in order to get to his wife, or the player may refuse these actions and follow different paths that may or may not lead to the wife.\n\nVarious characters will guide the player along through the puzzles, providing conversation as well.\n\nDialogue options will appear, such as in Firewatch, to provide dynamic conversations.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player will travel through multiple rooms, varying in number depending on which path the player takes (each room is linked together like a maze).  Each room will have a character- previous subject- who either helps or hinders, or simply talks with, the main character as he completes the puzzles the character provides for him; puzzles that are similar to the personality of the character.\n\nSome ideas of gameplay are in progress such as having access to a dimension of the past which will aid the player in solving he puzzle.  This can range from previous subjects in the room, construction of the room, or the main character's wife completing the puzzle.  However, I worry this mechanic may be more of a gimmick and less of a enjoyable function.\n\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nSimilar to the atmosphere of Bioshock or Firewatch; very in touch with the tone of the game.  In the beginning the puzzle ambiance may be simple or colorful, but later in the game, when the player begins to discover what is going on, the scenes will become more corrupt and dreary.\n\nDisclaimer:  This game is meant to pull the best aspects from Bioshock, Firewatch, Portal, and Stanley's Parable in regards to story and atmosphere.  Puzzle aspects will also be inspired from many classic and critically acclaimed video games.  Of course, this game will have it's own personalized twist that makes the game feel unique and enjoyable, however the aspects of the game are not absolutely original, indeed, I hope you notice a few similarities as you play.\n\nIf you have any criticism or praise, please let me know.  I want to make the game appealing not only to myself but also to my audience, so your feedback means a lot to me."

498ufl|Foe - Survival/Capture-the-Flag/Hunger Games Hybrid (honest criticism needed)|"This is a game that I've been conceptualizing for the past couple months now. I have a small team that is ready to get started on it but first I need to know if it's a game that the public would actually be interested in.\n\n**Concept**\n\n- Two teams of 5 on opposite sides of an ~~elliptical~~ circular island (allows multiple spawn points for each team to achieve a different perspective in every game you play)\n- ~~Both teams are restricted to a smaller area on their side of the island with boundaries~~\n- There will be about five different kinds of islands (sort of like different maps), each island will have its own environment, such as sources of water, temperature and weather (example, snowy islands, tropical islands, barren islands, etc.)\n- You have to survive against hunger, thirst, weather and natural disasters\n- If you die, you will respawn (slower respawns as the game progresses)\n- Mornings are mostly spent **scavenging, crafting and preparing for the night** by completing bonus objectives that reward you with things like a high temperature threshold or slower hunger gain (example, objective to build a campfire or to catch X amount of fish)\n- Every night an event will occur, there are eight total kinds of events but only four will occur per game\n- The **monkeys** will try to steal your crafts\n- The **rats** will try to eat your food\n- The **jaguars** will try to attack you\n- The **boars** will try to destroy your crafts\n- Other four events are still to be decided\n- All these events happen at the same time to both teams and in random order\n- After the event occurs, you are given an objective which is based on the mob that raided you *(example, if a monkey raids you, then your objective is to retrieve your crafts from the jungle)*\n- The first team to complete their objective will win the event\n- If you lose the event, both the previous mob and the new mob will raid you in the next event, but you will only have to complete the objective based on the new mob *(example, monkeys AND jaguars will raid you but you only have to complete the objective for the jaguars)*\n- If you win the event, only the new mob will raid you in the next event *(example, only jaguars)*\n- So, this can ""stack"" and allow your team to make the enemy team possibly get 4 types of mob raids in 1 night, causing a rather rough night for them\n- Events will be given a time limit, the event will occur at sunset and you will have until sunrise to complete the objective (3 minutes)\n- You may go over to the enemy's side of the island to interfere with their event, this would sacrifice your own event due to the time limit but you may also ruin the enemy team's chance at completing the objective on time causing both teams to experience and extra mob raid the next night (perhaps one team more than the other)\n- If you choose to venture on to the enemy's half of the island then all mobs from your team's half will venture to the enemy's half and will attack only your team if they happen to see you, whereas they will not attack the enemy team despite seeing them (so if you are on the enemy's half of the island, you will have the threat of all animals on the island against you whereas the enemy's team will only have to worry about half of the animals, kind of like a home-court advantage)\n- ~~After the four nights (four events), the boundaries will be removed, a flag will be placed somewhere around the center of the island, and it will turn into a capture-the-flag game~~\n- After the four nights, a flag will spawn around the center of the island and it will turn into a capture-the-flag game\n- While going for the flag, you'll have to fight off any mob which you didn't complete the objective for as well as the enemy team\n- You basically spend the first four nights making it harder for the enemy to capture the flag when the time comes because you slowly deteriorate their team and cause a higher threat in the jungle for them\n- Games will last around 45 minutes each\n- I'm also considering some boss mobs on the map which will reward you if you defeat them, please leave some suggestions if you have any\n- There will also be a skill system in which you will gain experience points while completing objectives and each level will award you in a skill point which you may spend in game-length (only last for that particular game) attributes such as faster woodcutting, higher accuracy with a bow, faster fishing, etc.\n\n**Some questions:**\n\n-  **Would you want to play this game?**\n-  **Why or why not?**\n-  **What would YOU add to this game?**\n-  **What would you remove from this game?**\n\nPlease feel free to give any kind of feedback :) Thanks."
2kss8g|My ideas for games.|I love open world Sandbox games. GTA Online is part of the way to what I want. I created a roleplay character in it which was fun but. Heres what I would really love to see in a game. Also I own The Sims 3. GTA San Andreas/4/5. Saints Row all. Sleeping and Watch Dogs. Fallour 3/NV. Skyrim including Hearthfire. Dragon Age O/2. Mass Effect all. And Many More. I dont own a PC but I have heard of Always Sometimes Monsters. \n\n1.Fully customizeable characters. Not just looks. In games like The Cat Lady and Mass Effect you can shape your characters past. In my honest opinion and I may be wrong Cat Lady was slightly more backstory customizable. ME had origin and personality. TCL had Mom Dad Likes Dislikes and more. I want my character to have unique friends and problems based on the backstory I setup. I will take having a generic title like Shepard if I can name a first name which will show up in text documents.\n\n2. Every building is designed. Alot of games have 500 buildings and you can enter 50 of them at best. Imagine being able to wander into any building or apartment and find a unique place. Even if eighty percent is completely irrelevant to the plot.\n\n3. Jobs. Maybe I dont want to play the plot right away. Maybe I also dont want to race/rob/kill to collect money.  Go work a little job to earn scratch.\n\n4.More Stuff. A few games let you customize your house and buy clothes. This is good but throw in some more shops to make it realistic. Also and Newer sandbox games are big offenders on this. Places to eat. In older Saints Row and GTA games you could go grab a bite to eat. Now and days there seems to be no food places even ones with only 4 items on the menu. \n\n5. Being able to have family and interact with them. Hearthfire was the first steps toward what I am looking for.\n\n6. A plot. Sometimes you gotta take a break from the family to go save/destroy the world. Besides how can you help customize the world if you arent in it. \n\n7. call me weird but I like labyrinth like cities. Hengsha in Deus Ex. Kowloon in Shenmue 2. Etc. \n\n8. If you can work horror in with all that more fun for me.
2jz2cb|Over the shoulder third person zombie open world shooter.|You would be close up on the shoulder to prevent corner looking, and you would be able to switch shoulders in order to properly clear a room. (just like the real pros do it) the game would be set in a massive city with singleplayer, pve, and PvP servers.
2j99uj|Skyrim/Fallout like game set in space|This is a game me and some friends have though a lot about but could never make it into something real. It would start like Fallout NV with the concept of amnesia. You're in space and have no idea why. On top of that, you're a wanted criminal. The main story line would be recovering your memory/clearing your name. \nListed are some extra little details we thought would make it really cool.\n\n* A bounty hunter is constantly tailing you from planet to planet, High leveled so fighting them would not be recommended until mid-game.\n* A flying car that acts like a mount from various MMORPGs. Its the vehicle used to travel planets and you can't get past the first planet until you get one.\n\nAny further ideas are much appreciated and I'm so glad to get an opportunity to bring this subreddit to life!\n
