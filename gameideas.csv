As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.\n\nFor the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). \n\nFor the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.\n\nFor the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.\n\nThe interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.\n\nYou would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.\n\nThere would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.\n\nAll from the comfort of your chair.\n

Now you're married, planning a family, and you have to keep her - i.e. avoid losing the spark and divorcing.|I don't really have paragraphs to add about this like I usually do; this is a game I legitimately have no interest in making myself, but I have a strong suspicion that there are people who would enjoy the challenge. Heck, there's probably people on this sub that have been through something similar and can base some of the game on real life.

1571156630|dia9r5|The opposite of a stealth game. Instead of playing as the stealthy predator, you control the guards (RTS-style) as they search for and defend against the hiding predator.|You control an expendable squad of hunters as they enter elaborate, open-ended rooms designed for a stealth game, except in this game you are on the receiving end. The view is top-down and controls a lot like a RTS game in that you give your squad orders and they execute them. *Fog of war* occludes anything that isn't within the line of sight of your squad, so the enemy can sneak up on your hunters if you aren't careful.\n\nA lot of the gameplay is about looking for environmental clues (broken ventilation grates, trails of blood, etc.) to track the enemy. Then you either sweep the area and funnel the enemy into a corner that will leave them no choice but to pounce. The enemy AI will also target your most vulnerable team members, so you can go the risky route and lure the enemy by leaving one or two of your guys alone.\n\nYour squad members have their own individual heart rates, and if they're too rattled by losing sight of the enemy or seeing their squadmates fall to the predator, they will begin to panic, drop stats and disobey orders. You can calm them back down by putting a squadmate near them, in which case one will calm down at the expense of making the other a little more scared.\n\n****\n\nI was thinking about what kind of story/setting/premise could benefit from this gameplay in which you're basically hunting Batman from the Arkham games. This is the premise:\n\nYou belong to an agency that hunts vampires, and it recently found a sprawling gothic castle in which a number of high-value vampires reside. In order to organize a massive assault on the castle, the agency began hiring mercenaries for the operation. Now you must clear this castle room by room, all the while finding upgrades, adding new recruits and promoting your most valuable mercenaries. The further you enter the castle, the more powerful the vampires that stalk you.

1614395729|ltey6v|Things you dislike from game genres you like|The point of this thread it's to get an idea of what other players dislike about their favorite game genre and take those ideas to create a concept either to make it better or rework that very thing.\n\ni'm posting mine as example:\n\nFPS\n\n* *Guns that feel &amp; look like a toy:* unless it about toys gunfighting then it doesn't apply, since the first doom, i think it's outdated the idea of small guns doing little damage, the pistol becomes useless the moment you get another weapon. In Return to Wolfenstein Castle, and Wolfenstein: New Order, did an amazing job for giving an use for the 'low' damage weapons.
1560778608|c1nlzh|A God sim where you have to prevent the humans from discovering they are just part of a simulation in your computer.|   \nThis idea was inspired by the recent Elon Musk interview at E3 2019 (find it on Youtube).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA 'God' sim where you have to prevent the human inhabitants figuring out they are just part of a simulation.  Out of your control,  the humans develop more and more advanced technologies over time.  From fire, metal refining, electricity, space travel, quantum physics, etc.  Like to begin with the stars and planets are just a sky-box, and the game is, you have to add real planets before they develop telescopes etc.  Like laying road just before the run over it.  If they figure out they're just a simulation in your computer, then its game over.
1605453459|june3m|A game where you buy more and more items from which the world will be generated for the next stage of the game|Let's imagine an absolutely empty game world and one coin on your virtual account, you have a list of items (from cheap till expensive) with price, in the beginning, you can buy one tree for your game for one coin and you will start to play in the empty world with one tree, you can destroy this tree and get one more coin, you need to earn coins from your current world to buy and unlock more interesting and expensive items (like enemies, NPCs, decorations, etc). Every new run the player gets the randomly generated game world consists of his items, so the game starts more complex with every stage. What do you think? Can it be interesting?
1552369382|b044a2|A horror game that purposefully drops the framerate when the monster shows up, but the monster itself renders at full speed.|The game's engine is made to always render at a smooth 60fps, but at times it will repeat frames to simulate slowdown and frame stuttering. This is done to make the player think the game is optimized poorly. It's made to look like the game's spooky rendering effects, which kick in when the player's character is "scared", are too much for the engine to handle.\n\nHowever the framerate *really* tanks when the monster shows up, even if he's not on-screen. And when the monster appears in front of you, no matter how low the framerate dropped, the monster comes at you at full rendering speed. It's almost like he doesn't belong in the game.
1570338181|ddyvpk|Had this idea years ago, before I joined reddit.|You start at a character creation screen, where you're given all these awesome options for traits, some of them chosen at random, and almost enough points to max out some stats.\n\nAfter making the final touches and saving, you're taken to another creation screen with less options, and about half the amount of points to go into stats.\n\nYou are informed that the character you previously made is the antagonist, and you may have to face them later.

1571047261|dhofnx|A horror sim game in which you play as a witch in Late Medieval Europe, you can cast spells, bewitch the townspeople, curse their crops/livestock/children, craft potions, create a coven, commune with demons - all while avoiding detection during the height of the witch-burning hysteria.|This is my first post on this sub, so apologies if I get the formatting wrong!\n\nThe game would have a rich character creation mechanic that would impact gameplay and storylines; for example an attractive witch might be more adept at seducing other people, while an old crone or geezer might have an easier time hiding in plain sight. Vampirism, lycanthropy and other shape-shifting abilities could also add to the player character’s options about what their perfect witch would be.\n  \nThere would be a variety of skills that the player could master: conjugation, numerology, astrology, curses/hexes, transformation and shape-shifting, clairvoyance, necromancy, healing, potion crafting, medicine, offensive magic, telepathy and mind control, flight, resurrection, summoning, luck manipulation, ancient languages, animal familiars, and so much more. These skills could be learned and improved through different rituals or through books and grimoires. \n\nAbout the animal familiars, I think that they would be a fun game mechanic as the player could capture and nurture a familiar such as a cat, wolf, deer, serpent, raven, etcetera and train them to do their bidding, eventually getting to a point in which they can psychically “see” through the eyes of their animal familiar. \n\nSummoning entities would play a large part in gameplay, with the player being able to conjure demons that grant special powers/buffs/items or protect the player by attacking/possessing enemies. Necromancy would allow the player to resurrect the dead to serve as servants or assassins. The player could also commune with the dead to discover secrets they could use to their advantage. \n\nCrafting would be a huge part of the game, with potions, rituals spells requiring either growing ingredients oneself, buying or trading for them, or foraging for them in the environment. I’ve been doing reading about the kinds of herbs used by midwives and doctors in the 16th Century and I would apply this information into the game. (I’m a huge fan of inventory items in games that have deep lore and backstories for every single item, I feel like it adds to much in terms of world-building.)\n\nThe player could join a coven or build one of their own followers, start wars with other covens, infiltrate a coven to take it over or destroy it from the inside-out. Lots of interesting story quests could come out of this mechanic. Or, the player could wield power through more legitimate in the “surface world” by becoming the court astrologer for a duke or becoming renowned and wealthy for selling tonics and tinctures with healing properties. Or, the player could just lie/steal/murder/magic/seduce/talk your way to the top, there would be so many different ways to play through the game. You could spend the game as a white witch growing herbs and making a fortune selling potions and the occasional love spell; or, you could summon Beelzebub and have entire cities under your thrall. \n\nThe main challenge of the game would come from trying to do all these things undetected, which is difficult as even a rumor amongst the townsfolk could send you to the gallows or the stake. But as your skill set grows you can get to a point in which you are undetectable to any inquisitor, or - so powerful that armies fear you and you can do whatever you want openly; or, you become so charismatic that you charm even the pope and become the most powerful woman or man in Europe. \n\nI’ve been thinking about this game idea for quite a while and I think it could be a really appealing concept! I think it’d be really interesting to play a character that does things that are normally portrayed in video games as being “villainous”. There’s also something kind of subversive about having a game in which the main point is to undermine rigid puritanical and patriarchal systems. \n  \nAnyways, I just wanted to see if anyone else would be interested in a game like this and I’d love any suggestions or ideas about what to change, add or subtract. Thank you so much!
1530014754|8tzgnr|Soaked- A neighborhood water gun and balloon battle royale with clothes drying mechanics and more|Setting: A peaceful Midwest USA suburban neighborhood during a particularly warm Mid-1990’s summer day.\n\nConcept: Everybody in the neighborhood is participating in this massive water fight. \n\nGimmick: Your saturation meter is your health bar. You will slowly dry off again over time. Remaining in direct sunlight (and direct visibility) will dry you off faster. Finding a dry towel and using it (like a first aid kit) will dry you off even more. There are also stationary fans that will dry you off very quickly. If your saturation meter hits 100%, you’re out of the game.\n\nYou also have stamina- you will get tired and exhausted, so you’ll need to grab a Squeeze-It juice bottle to refresh yourself and maybe a freshly cooked hotdog from near the grill.\n\nMap confinement: As the game goes on, the lawn sprinkler systems starting at the outer perimeter begin to turn on, forcing you toward the center and reducing the size of the playable area.\n\nWeapons: \nYou have your basic and rudimentary single pump water pistol that delivers one small squirt per trigger pull. Not very effective but better than nothing. \n\nThen you have the charge-up power soaker- a two handed water gun with an air tank that you pump up which allows you to fire continuously until the air pressure runs out. There are an array of these, some have larger water reservoirs, some require less pumps to charge, some have bigger streams but run out of air and water quickly, some fire thinner streams but last longer. \n\nThere are water balloons as well, you can carry a few in your pouch. These are sufficient for a pretty good soaking with a direct hit, but also cause, ahem, “splash damage” if you only hit near your target.\n\nThere are also mounted guns- I mean, garden hoses that you can use for an unlimited amount of time, but you won’t be able to travel far with them. \n\nYou will need to refill your water weapons as they run out of water. For this, you need to visit a water source such as a garden hose, water bucket, or unground pool. The pool is the fastest way but it comes with an added danger- if another player sees you kneeling down to fill your weapon, they can run up and shove you into the water. In a pinch, you can also transfer water from one weapon to another- though you are likely to spill a small percentage of water in the process.\n\nThe match ends when there is one player left with less than 100% saturation, or when the street lights come on and all remaining players are called home by their moms- in which case the driest player wins.\n\n

Each monster has a different sense of style and some of them find your look so glamorous that they get enraged with envy and start making mistakes - others are so in awe of your beauty that they are paralyzed staring at you - etc. (Instead of weakness to fire and slashing damage, perhaps some monsters have a weakness to flapper girl outfits and passive aggressive remarks?)\n\nYou gain experience not simply by killing monsters - but by looking stylish, classy, and graceful while you do it. There may also be Sailor Moon style anime girl power posing sequences as spells granting you various temporary benefits like haste etc, complete with cheesy-sounding but catchy songs.\n\nOh and you have a cozy cottage next to the ocean that you can decorate with antique furniture, wall hangings, etc stolen from dungeons.\n\nI may need to make this game solely so that I can play it myself.
1550552073|as6m08|A JRPG in English that slowly turns the text to Japanese to help you learn.|Just so that the language learned isn't all fantasy/anime trope stuff, the story should probably begin in the real world and introduce a conflict which brings in the capacity for sci-fi or fantasy terms as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the core mechanics of the game would be that all kinds of items (nouns), quests (verbs), and statuses/spells (adjectives, adverbs) would, when successfully collected, completed, answered, etc. gain you progress in the story of bringing balance back into the world. Even mundane things like coffee pots or entrance exams need to be dealt with because all aspects of humanity are under attack. Anything could house a secret power or equipment status (or hide an enemy! Mimics everywhere!). Grammar is gained throughout the arcs when reflecting upon all your exploits . Etc. Etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point being that the more you can learn to interact with in the language, the better you can do. There would need to be some non-linear design just because players may learn words in different orders than others. When you opt into some content in the game like a quest, a certain batch of words will be turned to Japanese terms. Some of the most powerful tools to collect are the characters of the writing system, the kana and the kanji. You as the player don't have to do perfectly well, and actually, the game can be completed mostly in English if changing too much stuff to Japanese proves hard. But THEN, every time you select New Game +, your prior knowledge comes with you and you can see the earlier scenes in the game in more and more Japanese form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpoken voices would likely be 100% Japanese for constant help. Subtitles, menus, text boxes would be the things that change over time, although a hard-core Japanese-only text and voice mode would always be available on demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that changing words gradually hits a brick wall when grammar and phrasing is so, so different between the two languages. There is only so much that you can do substituting word for word. Like "I'm hungry" becomes literally "stomach emptied" in Japanese. So there would need to be honest to goodness full steps when changing the script at many points. That said, as long as the game was fundamentally interesting enough and mechanically fun to play with a deep battle system, interesting characters, and puzzles that got MORE interesting the more language knowledge you can put into them, hopefully players would be willing to play through the game repeatedly without dying of rerun boredom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, I'd play it.
1586780462|g0hwrt|A systemic stealth game like Hitman, but it's not about assassinations; rather it's about smuggling cargo past layers of high security.|Unlike stealth games, your character isn't trespassing and won't be attacked by security. Your character only has to worry about getting frisked/searched while moving the high value cargo, so you have to find ways of getting it past checkpoints in clever ways. Otherwise, you're a regular VIP in the areas you work.
1612392445|lc0m9r|Help ... My Japanese language learning game is ... boring :c|At the end of February 2016, I started planning my game,\n\n&gt;a game in which you move to Japan to study abroad and learn Japanese. You can also travel around the country to explore the country and learn more about its history and culture. The art style is probably going to be in a 3D low poly style because that's what I have the most experience with... For the travelling and to decorate your appartment, you will need money which you can earn inside of the game. (Maybe small multiplayer ellement so friends can explore Japan together). Kind of like a RPG. :p\n\nThat's the main idea for my Japanese Language learning game. I actually wanted to start making it some day's ago, but whilst stitching together all ideas that I've had drawn out so far ...  I ran into a major issue as many people probably have when designing a game,\n\n**it's boring**\n\n... I can't come up with any ideas for the game to be more fun, interesting, and more engaging so people will want to keep playing. So my questions:\n\n* How can I make it more fun, interesting, and engaging?\n* How can I make the language learning aspect of the game to be more enjoyable, effective?\n* How to add some fun?   \^\^"\n* What would you like to see in a Japanese Language learning game?\n\nSo far everything has just been written down on paper, without making anything yet, and I only imagined every piece by piece separately, but when I finally stitched all the ideas together, I realized that it feels kind of boring and empty. Just walking from location to location seems kind of troublesome after some time. Not having enough interaction and being very repetitive (School, game, travel, repeat. Basically what you would do when you really study abroad. It's fun in real life, but in a game, where most people can press the exit button very easily ... yeah not that great of an idea I guess \^\^").\n\nI still love the idea a lot, being able to explore Japan whilst learning Japanese, and it would be awesome to make it into a really enjoyable, fun, and useful game to learn Japanese, but I'm feeling very insecure right about now as I can't come up with any solutions. :c\n\nAnother issue I started thinking about, what about having a lot of NPC's running around, but even with very easily customizable characters ... to write a couple of **100** different stories that NPC's can talk about will be a huge time consumer I guess \^\^"\n\nI know about this other game called *Koe* but the way Japanese is being thought isn't one of my favorites, I want people to actually be able to reach somewhat of an *almost* fluent level using my game \^\^" Sadly, there aren't that many language learning games which I can use as inspiration, but that's also another reason why I want to make this game into a reality. XP\n\nIs this a sign that it's a bad game idea and that I should just give up and try something else or?

1560548592|c0pou3|GAME IDEA TEMPLATE|For some background, I'm an intermediate indie game developer who would like to see this sub grow. I know what it takes to make and pitch a game, and find most idea posts on this sub are missing the mark. Use the below template to ensure your idea can be translated into a game.   \n\nThere is a TLDR copy/paste version at the bottom.      \n  \n----------\n  \n[TITLE] A one-sentence overview of what your game is all about. Ex: 'The player is a cat, hunting a mouse that lives in the walls.'\n\n[BODY]  \n\n*Name* (Your best idea for what the game should be called): 'Whiskers'  \n \n*Main Mechanic* (what the player will be spending most of the time doing): 'The player sneaks around the house, deducing the mouse's current hiding place through visual sound waves and scratching noises. When the mouse makes a break for the food, the player does everything they can to catch the mouse.'  \n\n*Side Mechanics* (secondary features to make the game more fun): 'Stealth and acrobatic movement, using the terrain such as couches and kitchen chairs to get around faster. Multiple mice on harder levels.'  \n\n*Story* (The main story idea if your game has one): 'The cat is left alone at the house, and must protect the food under a time limit until the owners get home.'  \n \n*Similar to* (games or references that your game relates to for added clarity, usually a 1-sentence pitch): 'Whack-a-Mole meets Assassin's Creed.'  \n\n*Advanced Features* (Features that could be added in if made by a strong enough team, but are not needed for the game to function): 'Mouse mode, where the player plays the same level but as the mouse instead of the cat. Multiplayer mode, with 1-2 cats and 2-4 mice. Co-Op mode with 2 cats or 2 mice, etc. Level design mode. Outside mode.'   \n  \n----------\n  \nWhile some of this stuff might seem extra, this information is really important for sharing something as complex as a game idea. It gives someone a foundation from which to build game mechanics, come up with a story and visual style, without becoming lost or confused by your idea.  \n\nIf sharing a game idea with someone feels like you are telling them about a vague dream, then you probably need to think about your idea a little bit more before sharing. \n \n\n\nTL;DR / COPY AND PASTE FORMAT \n\n\n*NAME:*   \n\n*MAIN MECHANIC:*  \n\n*SIDE MECHANICS:*  \n\n *STORY:*    \n\n*SIMILAR TO:*  \n\n*ADVANCED FEATURES:*
1554911526|bbnm39|VR "Where's waldo" esque game where you are given a description and must move through a crowd and find the person|Different factors would limit how easy it is to find him, like loud noises, flahsing lights, disguise. Maybe you would need to check id on them
1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.
1533646884|95bf5x|Imagine an RPG game, in which you have to save your child. At the beggining of the game, you have all skills unlocked and ready to use, but after every level or chapter you are forced to manualy decrease one of the skill. At the end, you will fight boss with a little amount or even without skills.|I.E. you are terminally ill, like cancer which eats your insides making you weaker, yet you still have to go on to save your kid from the kidnapper. You could even makes some onion decisions like, for example - you have 4 companions, you are in deep-shit situation and you must sacrifice one of your people to save other three. You pick "lucky guy" to stay behind, but plot makes that everybody dies. Everybody except the lucky guy. That would be a nice PTSD hit.

1569566371|d9wijs|An online election simulator in which every player tries to convince other players to vote for them in absurd, meme-filled elections for pointless government positions.|When you start the game you're shown a simple map of a fictional country that is divided into states, then counties and then cities. Then you're randomly given a "birthplace" in one of those cities and an in-game fictional webpage to fill with whatever you want.\n\nEach city, county and state (along with the nation as a whole) has periodic elections for various fictional elected office positions like **Chief of Stuff** or **Secretary of Funk.** It's up to players to run for certain positions in their region and then convince other players to vote for them however they can. Joining political parties, petitioning other players in their regions on their webpages, running dirty political ads on the county newspage, etc. would all could be viable tactics.\n\nThe fictional country would encourage user-generated lore and fictional issues like "massive florb shortages" or "contagious Toe-Face outbreaks," along with players promising to fix such issues in their own silly ways.\n\nEverything is made up and the points don't matter.\n\n****\n\nI'll be brutally honest: I would expect lots of memes to laugh at, but also lots of toxic behavior to monitor/enforce against. The game would need to foster a player culture that keeps real-world politics out somehow.\n\nWith just fictional maps, user pages, a voting system and image hosting, in theory the game could work completely on web browsers.

1534349291|97jinf|A psychological horror/thriller that starts off as a slice of life farming game. You soon suspect the townsfolk won't let you leave.|In a lottery you don't remember entering, you won a farm in a small town and decide to start life anew. The game starts proper as you meet the nice townspeople and begin farming the first season. But soon you start to realize something ominous is happening.\n\nOn the day the bus line is supposed to resume service, the bus is mysteriously out of commission. When you try to make a phone call, you learn that the phone service is down for repair. The townsfolk are suspiciously keen on presenting you with love interests. You find a shrine that nobody seems to know about or at least mention to you. Every time you pass out from exhaustion, you wake up in your own bed. Someone must be stalking you.\n\nWhile renovating your house, you find markings and traces of blood beneath the floorboards. Someone in town accidentally calls you by another name. While plowing your farmland, you discover unmarked graves. You overhear conversation about "appeasing the forest sprites."\n\nIf you look forward through the calendar on the mayor's wall, there's a date/holiday marked with a red X that isn't marked on your own calendar. Something is going to happen on or by that day.\n\n****\n\nYou can choose to continue playing the game as a slice of life farming game, pretending that everything is fine. There's an ending for that.\n\nBut if you choose to try to break free of the farming game cycle, you'll find resistance. The townsfolk become hostile and eventually violent. There's an ending for this too.\n\nThere's also an ending in which you turn the tide on the town and escape. You steer the wrath of these so-called "forest sprites" onto the town itself. But the path to this ending might take a few playthroughs to discover.
1537799522|9iieki|An arena shooter where the faster you go the stronger your gun.|An arena where the characters are on rollerblades or something and have a gun and the map look something like a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The gun has a base damage but the faster you go the stronger your damage is. Maybe there's some boostpads on the map and sone healthpacks. \n\nI think that because going faster can make aiming more difficult it can balance being slower and easier to hit. \n\nMaybe at full speed you can one-shot other players. Maybe you can grab power ups to jump or make other players slower.
1528918422|8qvbb7|Whale Hunter: A F2P/pay-to-win game where the bigger you spend, the bigger a target you become for free players.|There was an old Extra Credits episode in which Dan made a case that F2P players in a subscription MMO are a good thing because the free players are essentially "content" for subscription players. It fills servers and give those players other people to play with.\n\n**I think the opposite can be true as well.** Whales can be content for the free players.\n\n### How This Works\n\nThis is a PvP (and/or PvE) game where you can spend actual money on clearly better gear and leveling up. There's no upper limit to leveling up. HOWEVER, the more you spend, the bigger a target you become too. The player's body size literally increases. So too does their run stride length, jump height, health pool, etc. all increase.\n\nPlayers who kill, crit or otherwise hinder a whale, will earn an extra fraction of what the whale has spent. The whale doesn't lose money. It's more like money is copied in the form of a microcurrency. Dying to a whale also comes with a small bonus payment too so you don't feel cheated.\n\nThis could be a battle royale game, a simple arena shooter, a vehicular combat game or even a sports game if modified a little.\n\n### Why This Works\n\nIIRC in that same Extra Credits video, Dan talked about an MMORPG in which players could buy gift drops for other players. This player could use that microtransaction to come in and rain gifts upon other players, becoming the life of the party. This psychology can work if a whale effectively becomes the boss fight of whatever multiplayer game he's in. When a whale shows up to your lobby, it's like Santa Claus came to town and everyone is gunning for him. Free players get a bonus objective, while the fat whale becomes the focal point of the party.

1555347220|bdiczc|Request to have a "mechanic" flair for posts on this subreddit|I sometimes get ideas for a gimmick or mechanic that doesn't work as a game in it's own right, but still want feedback on them. I feel like if this niche was big enough it could be its own separate subreddit, but I also don't think the discussion of individual mechanics is so far removed from r/gameideas' core ideals that it would feel out of place on this subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think adding a "mechanic" tag would encourage discussion on this topic by showing that it's an option for discussion. Whether or not that would be beneficial to r/gameideas is a decision better left to the mods and community on this subreddit, I'm just putting my two cents in.
1568400442|d3tp9z|A game where you play as a normal person for a month before the end of the world.|The world's leaders have come to the unfortunate conclusion that a Jupiter sized asteroid will collide with the Earth in exactly one month's time. There is nothing that can be done to prevent it.\n\nYou play as just some person in a city or town, living out your life, taking care of the plants, your pets, and eventually come to terms with the inevitable, and accept what will happen/happens.\n\nEach day of the game is actually in real-time, so the game would be last for exactly the month/duration of time until the asteroid obliterates everything and the game ends.\n\nPerhaps such a game would feature plot threads or a story that would get cut-off by the asteroid, or the fact that you would never get to experience every sub-plot or talk to every character in the town.

Your shift starts at 7:00 AM SHARP. You have 10 minutes to get to work, but everything screws you over, kind of like an unfair game. The elevator doesn't work. The stairs are being mopped by an angry janitor. Your car doesn't want to start and panics. The bus you decide to ride on gets a flat tire. Your briefcase randomly opens and papers fly everywhere. Cars don't want to stop for the crosswalk. Sometimes you have to even risk your life on getting to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can even make it where every time you play there's a different situation. For example, the elevator is broken and the stairs are available one time but the other way around a different play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere could even be objects you need to find. Insurance papers, your briefcase, money for the bus, a lamp even.
1486231219|5s1zer|Please post design ideas, not experience ideas|In the book "Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences" by Tynan Sylvester there's a paragraph titled "The Fallacy of Vision" (p. 304). It starts with a short story:\n\n&gt; *A young aerospace engineer is at his first day of work. He goes into the \nboss’s office with a gleam in his eye, and declares, "I’ve got the greatest \nidea for a new kind of airplane."*\n\n&gt; *The boss is intrigued. "Explain," he says.*\n\n&gt; *The young engineer takes on a visionary expression and stares into \nthe distance. "The passengers board hassle-free in five minutes. Then \nthe plane takes off, silently, with barely a bump, as the passengers enjoy \nmartinis in their private booths. As they soar over the Atlantic, a young \ncouple enjoys the view in one of the plane’s many bubble canopies, and \na cute kid gets a tour of the cockpit. The captain chuckles as the kid asks \nwhy they can’t fly to the moon. By the time they touch down, love has been \nfound, lessons have been learned, and everybody is ready for whatever \nawaits them at their destination."*\n\n&gt; *The boss leans back in his chair and takes a long drag on his cigar. \n"You’re fired," he says.*\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; This young aerospace engineer had a vision. But his vision was of an \nairplane flight, not an airplane. He described a wonderful experience, but \nhe  said  nothing  about  the  mechanical  systems  that  created  that  experience. \nHe succumbed to the fallacy of vision.\n\n&gt; **The FALLACY OF VISION is the idea that a mental movie of an experience \nis equivalent to a design for a system that generates that experience.**\n\n----\n\nIn other words, when you post your ideas please avoid describing a single experience and try to describe how the game works and what does the player experience in general. Games generate experiences, and these experiences are never the same.\n\n**Edit: My part of the post was in contradiction with the quote, I fixed it thanks to a number of thoughtful comments.**

But the more I played and replayed it, the more I turned into *Leon: Destroyer of Plagas*.\n\nThis game idea is a condensed and exaggerated version of this concept. It's designed to go from "P.T. scary" to "Serious Sam empowering."\n\nHowever, the game is still the same game the whole way through... it's only the player who changes.\n\n### HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe game takes place in a large haunted labyrinth. Every time you start the game, you're spawned in a different area of the same world. This is done so that each playthrough feels unfamiliar at first, but after repeated play you know the game map like the back of your hand.\n\nAt first there appears to be *one* supernatural monster that can spawn anywhere, do anything and kill you at any time (picture the crying woman from P.T.). However, through repeated play you realize there's actually several of them and they all each have their own unique patterns and predictable behaviors. They're meant to look similar (but not identical) so that they seem like one unpredictable monster at first.\n\nLastly and most importantly, the game starts out without a clear objective. You don't know where to go and what you're supposed to do. Your first playthroughs are about unraveling the mystery. Through environmental storytelling, you learn that you're here to eliminate the supernatural entities. You're some kind of professional exorcist.\n\n**Not only that, but you've had the ability to kill the demons all along.** The game just didn't make it explicit.\n\nTo eliminate demons, *you have to let them hurt you.* Like S.O.M.A. and many other horror games, you can take one "hit" from a monster. You drop to the floor, your vision gets blurry, you hear voices and see visions, and you're forced to limp in pain. Also like typical horror games, there are "health points" on the map that recover you to full health.\n\nWell it turns out that when you're "hit" by a demon you're actually being possessed and your character is resisting. This is why he is limping, seeing visions and hearing voices. And those "health points" are actually special exorcism tomes. When you use it, you're actually eliminating the demon that resided in you. Now you just have to do it with all the other demons.\n\nThe game mechanics are obfuscated. Sometimes the monsters kill you instead of damaging you, but it isn't clear why. You later learn that you died because you're facing away from the demon when it caught you. At least for some of them. For others you might have to weaken them by luring them to special areas.\n\n### WHY IT WORKS\n\nAs gamers, we've been taught to run &amp; hide from monsters in horror games if we don't have weapons. The game lets the player do this in typical horror game fashion, but it doesn't teach or tell him to do this. It's only after the player turns to face his demons that he'll realize they can be overcome. \n\nIt's the central theme of the game, in fact.\n\nBy the time you've beaten it, it'll be an empowering game. You'll no longer need to run around uncovering the mystery. Instead, you'll be running around to beat your previous record. By the end, you'll feel like the monsters should be running from *you.*

1567359865|cyd0vo|Your words mean nothing. A picture speaks a thousand words.|I'm getting sick of reading poorly written paragraphs of confusing nonsense.  I'm no better.  I'd be terrible at describing existing games to others.  Language just seems so incapable of accurately communicating these things we call games.\n\nImagine describing Portal.  You shoot a portal into a wall and another where you want to go.  You can go from one end to the other and back again.  You use that to solve puzzles.  That sounds shit and it's a far better description than most you hear on this subreddit.\n\nSo, what can be done?  Draw a picture.  Can't draw?  Doesn't matter as no one is here for the art.  Even a shit drawing can convey what you imagine way better than your rambling ever could.  So, just open up whatever and start drawing rectangles and circles and adding text where appropriate.\n\nI'd much rather scan some drawings and better understand your idea rather than hoping to decipher the bullshit you smeared onto the internet using your keyboard.  It can't be any worse, that's for sure.

The difference is when you die you get corrupted ever so slightly taking on the features of the creature maybe even gaining some special abilities.

1586906391|g1g9q9|An open world "slasher" game|The core of the game would be the constant feeling of being hunted. You would be thrown into a procedurally generated post-apocalyptic map and you wear nothing but rags and no weapon but your fists. You have been exiled from your town because of the mysterious mark on your forehead, that is considered a danger for everyone around you. After one day passes, you will be informed that the most powerful enemy of the game has spawned somewhere on the map and is now heading toward your location. You cannot kill it through conventional means and it will stop at nothing to get to you and kill you.\n\nYou can shake off your pursuer by hiding or putting a distance between you and it, but it will eventually know where you are: you both share a link that causes you to have random visions of where it is or vice-versa. That is why you are constantly on the move. And don't expect help from any person you meet; they will run away or threaten you at the sight of the mark on your head; nope, you are on your own.\n\nYour objectives are the following: (1) Survive your pursuer. (2)  Manage your Hunger, Thirst and Sleep bars. (3) Find a way to kill the pursuer with the clues around the map and the indications shown in your visions... or just accept your fate.\n\nThat's only the skeleton of the game, but I think it would make for a very unnerving and nerve-racking experience.
1554476954|b9scz1|A game where only you can see the monsters and the townsfolk will stop helping you if you aren’t careful.|I’m thinking the game would be pretty 2D, probably with pixel art instead of anything detailed. \n\nThe town is small, maybe only a handful of residential houses and then you have your general blacksmith/potion maker etc.\n\nThere are monsters coming from most places around town; from mountains and maybe a forest and caves and stuff. If there’s a story element, your character’s goal would be to stop all the monsters and save the town forever. Maybe an endless mode too.\n\nIf the townsfolk see you fighting the monsters (to them you’re just swinging a sword/shooting arrows at thin air) then they’ll become distrustful of you, getting nervous, raising prices or perhaps not selling things to you. If they become too distrustful, they’ll drive you out of town and it’ll be game over.\n\nI hope you like the idea :)9@
1591640355|gz4ov4|A battle royale game but it does something different|Basically 100 players are dinosaurs 66 million years ago and a asteriod hit earth. You pick a type of dino, (Velociraptor(Team Based), Tryannasaurous(Practically Solo), etc) and the players try to survive as it gets gradually worse. There is no circle, instead the map gets harder to survive in as a whole, (Glass rains, it's super hot, water boils, ash pours down, cover and forests burn down, maybe some rocks hit, all the bots that are meant to be killed start dying, mammals hide underground....) and theres nothing really else other than that. You have your own abilities, you cant pick up stuff, it can also be water/air based as well. I thought this would be kinda neat

1557332452|bm79kz|A fantasy fishing game where you fish bigger and crazier creatures the better you get|I've wanted to play this game for a LONG, long time. Nothing quite scratches the itch I imagine this game would scratch.\n\nAs the title explains, you're a budding fisherman with a shitty stick rod and a rotting wooden boat. When you start fishing, you can't really go too deep or catch anything too big without it being next to impossible to catch, but the more you catch, the more you can sell to the local vendor, the more you can upgrade your rod, your boat, your equipment, and consumables that give you buffs. You start by only really being able to catch goldfish and garbage, but eventually, you will progress to the point where you are able to catch huge lovecraftian sea creatures and other unreal shit.\nNight fishing is a different ballpark, the fish become significantly harder and more creepy, you get huge glow in the dark anglers, evil looking octopuses, stuff like that. They give significantly more $$$ and XP for catching, at the downside that you'll have stamina debuffs from not sleeping.\n\nThat's right, you need to keep your stamina up by eating some of the fish you catch! When you catch a fish, you get three options; eat it for rare buffs &amp; stamina gains, sell it to the vendor for money, or use it as bait for a better chance at catching rarer fish.\n\nCatching fish would be like from a POV perspective. As you cast the rod, your camera follows the bobber as it goes deeper into the ocean. The better rod you have, the deeper you can go, the faster you can go, the more hits you can take from other fish before your rod velocity reaches 0, the better rods you can steer them or explode fish in your way, other stuff like that. When you attract a fish, you have to do a QTE as soon as the fish bites which activates the bobber in different ways. The regular ones will just be you pulling them back up, but the more upgraded bobbers might eject spikes into the fish's mouth to impale them, or deploy a huge net around them. These have different advantages and negatives to using for different fish. Once you've caught the fish you need to spam spacebar (you can buy upgrades that automate this later) to reel your fish in. You move your mouse counter to whatever direction the fish is struggling in, and maybe do other shit too. The bigger fish are REALLY furious and it takes a lot of accuracy and hard work to catch. But when you catch it, it flies into the air and you get a satisfying screen that tells you how big the fish is and its name.\n\nYou get XP for catching fish. The more XP, the better you get. You can put your upgrade points into strength (makes counter-steering fish easier), perception (gives you more slowdown time), stamina (lets you catch more fish before you need to sleep), stuff like that. The vendors sell better rod upgrades, cooler boats, better apparel (small buffs but mainly to make you look cool), some low-level bait, consumable items that give you buffs, etc. The more money you put into the local shops, the better stuff you get. Vendors also have a quest board where you can fulfil bounties and timed catch requests for money.\n\nThe endgame is catching a huge, cthulu-tier sea creature at night. This thing should be insane, and if you catch it, you get 3 options:\n1. You sell the fish to the vendors. They're so impressed that they sell everything to you for the fish, you become a capitalist success and make your own fishing lodge for new fishers. The end.\n2. You eat the fish and it imbues you with godlike fish powers, and you ascend to become a fish GOD (like the slug ending in bloodborne yo)\n3. You use the fish as BAIT. This unlocks NG+. As you reach the bottom of the ocean with the fish as bait, the sea floor opens up, and you get pulled straight into the wormhole from your rod. This is some castlevania symphony of the night type shit. You enter a mirror world where all of the fish are fucking INSANE CORRUPTED VERSIONS of what you already caught. The vendors are all undead fish people, and you can breathe underwater. You become the bait, and you have to jump into the ocean and FUCKING FIGHT THE FISH you're trying to catch, god of war type shit.\n\nSo yeah, that's all i've got. I wish a game like this existed.

1614174373|lrd8vv|Suicide King: a gwent-like trading card game that uses normal playing cards that is easy to understand and get into|so i just came up a game like this when i woke up. it's a two-player trading card that without the trading part: it uses the good' ol 54-piece playing cards, aces to kings four suits, and two jokers. i call this game **"Suicide King"** because i like the nickname for King of Hearts.\n\ni always feeling the entry barrier of tcg tend to be very steep, you have to learn all the weird mechanics, collecting different cards, often cost you real money in order to play decently. so in this game, no grinding is needed, the mechanic is so easy to learn that even I, someone who barely played any card games can explain to you in a single reddit post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe objective of Suicide King is this:\n\n* to win more rounds than your opponent (like gwent)\n* one game is divided in 3 rounds, whoever wins 2 rounds, wins the game (like gwent)\n* whoever have higher points after the round ends, wins the round (again, like gwent)\n* your point is the sum of all number cards on your part of the field \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe playing field looks like this:[https://imgur.com/a/zzQMF4H](https://imgur.com/a/zzQMF4H)\n\n* there are two rows that you can place your number cards on (remember gwent?)\n   * on the right is the deck, there is a number showing how many cards left (start from 26)\n   * on the left, you can place special cards for special effects (more  on that later)\n   * each row houses 5 cards, plus a special card, a total of 11 cards can be played for each player\n* a big yield button because sometimes you just dont feel like it\n* an end round button to end your round\n* click the deck to draw a card\n* a point counter between your rows (i forgot to add)\n* maybe a history window of some kind idk\n* a win-lose marker like gwent would be helpful\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is what the cards do:\n\n* number cards:A - 10\n   * you can place them on both of your rows (except A), the sum of their numbers are your points, front and rear doesnt affect the point. \n      * (eg, you have a 5 in the front, a 3 in the rear, you have 8 points)\n* special cards: A, J, Q, K, Jokers. They stay on the special card slot to the end of the round, until the player replaces them.\n   * Aces are both number and special cards. can also be played on your opponent's row.\n      * you can play an Ace on the row, by doing so you can choose its point. it could be 10 or 1 (as in blackjack). choose 10, the card shows 10A, it's a 10-value card. choose 1, turn into 1A, has value of 1, and making neighbouring cards suit the same as the Ace's.\n      * or place it in the special field, double the value of the cards of the same suit. (ie. double the points of all spade cards if you play an Ace of spade. turning a 10 of spades into 20 of spades)\n   * Jacks are warriors, they can either defend your field or occupy the enemy special card slot. they work differently depending on the colour.\n      * when playing on your special card slot, a J can protect cars from Attacks. (as in hearthstone)\n      * you can also play it on your opponent's special card slot to occupy it, they have to attack it to remove the card from the slot, so they can use it later. if the slot is occupied, remove the card and occupy the slot.\n      * a Red jack can take 2 attacks from a black card, but 1 attack from a red card.\n   * Queens are magicians, they have special actions depending on their suits.\n      * these actions are available right after playing the card, and later each move.\n      * Diamonds: select a suit, add the number of cards of the suit in your field as value to your point. (including Queen of Diamonds itself and the Jack in the opponent's special card slot)\n      * Clubs: swap cards depending on the target. if targeting a card on the field, you can swap a card on your field and your opponent's. vice versa. or when targeting a card in your hand, swap it to a random card from your opponent's hand. (cannot targeting special card slot)\n      * Hearts: shuffle cards in on of the hands or rows. the total of cards stay the same, but the cards could be different.\n      * Spades automatically draws a card whenever you played a card on the field. if there is no cards left in your deck, sacrifice a random card on the field and conjuring a new card in your hand (passive)\n   * Kings are schemers, their effects are only activated when a round is ending.\n      * Kings are invisible in the slot, your opponent wont know you played it. but can be revealed by Jacks and King of Hearts.\n      * you can play a king within the same move. (ie before and after playing another card)\n      * diamonds: all cards on 4 rows are annihilating each other, the difference is randomly send to each player. ie, if your opponent has 7 cards on the field, you have 2, all cards get in to a fight, and 5 cards left, randomly distributed among players. if it's an odd number, you have one more cards than your opponent, in this case, you get 3 cards, your opponent gets 2)\n      * clubs: (i dont have an idea yet)\n      * hearts: remove cards from the field place them into your hand, also makes you lose the round. (suicide king, winning by losing)\n      * spades: all number cards that got destroyed in the round are played accordingly in the field in the next round. (including aces)\n      * if both players has a King in the slot, whoever plays the King first activate before another one.\n   * Jokers are ultimate chaos maker. unlike irl playing card, in Suicide King, Jokers come in two colours: red and black.\n      * when red Joker is played, randomise all cards on the field and conceal their numbers and suits. only colour is visible (reveals kings). you can also see the colour of cards in your opponent's hand. attacking your opponent's card with your red car, your card have 50% survive the attack. at the end of the round, reveal all numbers and suits.\n      * when black Joker is played, ditto with red Joker. but instead of making red card stronger, when you attack a black card, there is a 50% chance that rob the black card to your field (which ever is available, if none, to your hand) with half the value. 2 will turn into A1, odd number will be (+1)/2, aka a 9 becomes 5.\n      * if A, J, Q, K are revealed on the rows, they are treated as 10, 11, 12 and 13. \n      * Jokers cannot be replaced or attacked, not even Jacks.\n\ngame mechanics:\n\n* game: a game is played in 3 rounds, whoever wins 2, wins the game.\n   * if a player have no cards on their field, their hand or the deck, they automatically loses the game.\n* round: a round is ended when both players ends their round, the points will be tallied and determined the winner of the round.\n* resolving a draw: if both plays' point is equal, whoever has more cards on the field wins the round.\n   * if both has an equal number amount of cards, the winner is determined by the order of the special card on their slot. Joker&gt;Ace&gt;K&gt;Q&gt;J\n      * if no special card is present, a winner is determined by the biggest number and suit combination of their cards in the row. ie 10 of spades vs 9 of hearts, 10 wins.\n* point: the sum of all number cards' value in your rows. with other modifiers.\n* value: the number on a number card. it can be modified by other cards, making a card that doesnt exist in real life. aka a 20 of spades. A is can be 1 or 10, as in blackjack.\n* ending the round: the player can click the button to end their round. the player needs to perform at least one action to end their round.\n* move: within a round, players will perform an action one after another, normally only one action per move.\n* action: playing a card on the field, attacking a card, draw a card from the deck, or spells from the Queen card\n* field: 4 rows of number cards and 2 special card slots\n* rows: 2 rows of slots, divided into front and rear. number cards can be played on the rows, each row houses 5 cards. whenever there is a card in the front row, all cards in the rear row is Protected.\n* special card slot: A, J, Q, K, Jokers can be played on the slot. the card stays in the slot until the end of the round, or replaced by player. special card cannot be attacked, only Jacks and King of Hearts can remove them.\n* deck: a standard playing card deck with 52 cards and 2 jokers. at the beginning of the game, all cards are shuffled and divided into 2 decks of 26 cards for each player.\n* draw(action): the action of retrieving a card from your deck to your hand.\n* hand: cards that available to play on the field for each players, at the beginning of the game 7 cards are drawn for each players.\n* graveyard: the concept of spent cards doesnt not exist in this game.\n* attack: the player can use a number card to attack an Unprotected number card on the opponent's rows. the process destroys BOTH cards (with exceptions) (just like hearthstone, but no health or attack value)\n* protect: a concept taken from hearthstone. cards in rear row is protected by ones in front row, whereas all cards is in turn protected by a Jack. the attacker cannot attack a protected card without destroying the card which protecting it.\n* destroyed cards: the result of number cards' mutual destruction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat's all i have in mind, all numbers are very not final.

1586727384|g05chj|Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley type game set in Post Apocalypse|I love classic farming sims like Harvest Moon and love to see it in different scenarios.\n\nIt would take place in a world that has gone through some sort of cataclysm (Nuclear, environmental, alien, maybe even Old God type stuff). Society is mostly dead, there are some scattered people around. I think it have emphasis on working from the ground up on building a village for survivors, and revitalizing the soil so that more types of crops can grow. Baby steps for rebuilding civilization.\n\nSome ideas for content:\n\n\-Braving wastelands for resources and new people\n\n\-Crafting maybe with some chemistry elements (nothing too complicated)\n\n\-Taming wild creatures\n\n\-Crop mutations\n\n\-Finding cures for illnesses\n\n\-Building structures, customizing your village\n\n\-Building relationships with NPCs. Personally, I prefer set NPCs rather than randomly generated ones. So actual characters would need to be fleshed out.\n\n\-Weather stabilization?\n\nI have pretty much no experience in game design. I'm a part-time writer and I've only been putting this together in my head for the past couple days. It's pretty much just for fun. Does this sound like something viable? Is there a game out there that is already this same setting, or is it different enough?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: I'm thinking that it could start with you're character alone in a small bunker. Either you run out of food or some technical issue. So you could use the bunker as a mini base in the first part of the game, mainly for storage of mats and resting. However, the space is very confined and there's a limit on how much it can be expanded.\n\nI kinda want the cataclysm to be Lovecraftian. Not necessarily pulled directly from the mythos, but more along the lines of "forces unknown/unknowable". I suppose Cosmic Horror is the term for it.\n\nThere could be an added story element that you weren't alone when you first went into the bunker, but as a side quest you could try to figure out what happened. I'm a huge fan of "show don't tell" exposition.\n\nI haven't actually played Rimworld yet, but what I have in mind has a bit less procedural generation in terms of characters and maybe even overall layout of the world.\n\nI'll add more details as I think of them, but thank you very much for the encouragement guys!
1523635508|8c0b8s|A horror game in which the monster is just standing there. Menacingly.|In most horror games, the terror comes from not knowing when you'll run into the big bad monster(s). But in this one, the monsters are plainly visible, and the real terror comes from not knowing when they are going to aggro.\n\nThis concept is the [gibdo in Ocarina of Time](https://www.piranhazone.com/images/zelda/ocarina/p64/en033_1.jpg) fleshed out into a full horror game.\n\n*What* aggros the monster(s) is made purposefully obtuse, so the player can never tell if they'll be safe the next time they have to sneak past.\n\nThe concept is flexible enough to vary the setpieces throughout a whole game. Maybe it starts off as one monster in the middle of a room you have to constantly travel through. Another time the game forces you to sneak past it while carrying something loud trying to not bump into obstacles. Later, you return to the room *and it's not there!* Where did it go? Shit, now it's in a tight hallway!\n\nLater in the game, there's forty of them lined up in rows [like stone soldiers](https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/989/515/56733_1_1280x720_640x360_177576003886.jpg) and you know at least one of them is real.\n\n##### BONUS IDEA\n\nNormally I'd save this idea for a future post... but it fits the above idea so well that I have to put it here:\n\nNormally you can outrun the monster easily. But if the monster is in your field of view when it aggros, it forces you to look at it. The camera snaps and locks on the monster as its body contorts and shuffles toward you. Since you can't run backwards, you're forced to *walk* back, and it's slowly gaining on you. Even worse, since you can't see behind you, you'll have to navigate by memory so you don't get stuck or snagged on the map. After a while, the camera unlocks and you can run proper.

1560061432|byhf77|A Stardew Valley-type game about Necromancy!|(If this seems familiar, it's cause I posted it over half a year ago and I'm reposting it now so it might inspire someone)\n\nThis is what I was thinking Gravekeeper would be like before I read into it and it was not (still a great game tho, check it out)\n\nYou are an aspiring necromancer in a medieval town, filled with unique people. You want to take over the town with an army of undead, become rich, or become a lich.\n\nYou yourself can't immediately go into combat. You are very weak and have no weapons, and those don't come cheap. You also have no bodies yourself.\n\nYou could go to the graveyard to dig up skeletons, but they are extra suspicious if seen and they are pretty weak.\n\nThe other ways of getting corpses involve... Murder. You could have dug up a couple skeletons and have them kill someone in their house, or you could just poison someone by slipping something you made out of the mushrooms in the woods into their drink at the tavern.\n\nNecromancing a body isn't as simple as casting a spell and it stands up. No, you need materials. Heal up any wounds that caused them to die, hold their bones together properly with straps, and maybe give them enhancements!\n\nYou can use your minions to work on a farm that you own. Just don't let anyone see the ones that are decaying, skeletons, or just flat out ghosts.\n\n[Check out this mod for Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35378/) for some other ideas (obviously the game wouldn't look like that though, I'm thinking a cute pixel-ish style as Graveyard Keeper and Stardew Valley are)\n\n# **Potential Types of Undead:**\n\n* **Skeletons** are the weakest and most suspicious, but are also the easiest to put back together when an angry villager kills them. They can also be taken apart for easy transport. They have far less emotional impact than others if spotted, since they are totally unrecognizable from when they were alive.\n\n* **Zombies** are less obviously undead. You may need to embalm them and put makeup on so they don't rot as quickly and look more human. They are also more efficient than skeletons, but wounds on them will be much harder to fix.\n\n* **Revenants** are probably the best there is. Indistinguishable from real people and they work better than a normal person, but you have to raise them immediately after death. The rites involved in bringing them back also involve trapping a minor demon in the body and convincing it that it is the original person, now wanting to work for you. They will spend time with their family still, though. No suspicion about them going missing, but less time spent working. They also retain their memories, so they'll remember if you were their friend in life. If they find evidence of their death, they may seek out revenge on the killer (which could very well be you).\n\n* **Ghosts** are harder to get. You don't need an intact body, but you will need to yank their soul out of Heaven. They aren't suspicious unless someone gets close to them, but they can turn invisible and go through walls to avoid people.\n\n* **Mummies** take a long time to make, are suspicious due to their wrappings, but are _very_ efficient. They are practically unstoppable in combat and can curse those that they don't kill with a glance.\n\n* **Monstrosities** are made out of multiple bodies stitched together and brought back using a lightning strike going through a magic rod. They are more intelligent and strong than a revenant, and they can pass as a normal (albeit ugly) human. They might shirk their duties to explore the village. They might fall in love with a specific villager and never tell you. Then you might end up killing that villager. Monster is not happy.\n\n* **Wendigos** are also very powerful, but you can't control them at all. The player doesn't know this at first, though. You don't make them the same way you would a normal undead. A living person needs to eat human flesh. Due to your heroic blood, you don't turn from eating it yourself (you just get sick). It is a slow process. The target will become more pale and will go to the store to buy food more often. Eventually, they will try to kill the nearest other NPC (even if its family). They will then eat them, fully turn, and run off into the woods. A series of attacks and raids on pantries makes you realize that no one can defeat it but you. You must set up a trap (which you can also use on human and animals) for it. If caught, you may either kill it or attempt to tame it. Taming is resource intensive and you will need to get it either _a ton_ of animal meat, or a pretty big amount of human meat.\n\n# **For the Story:**\n\nYou have lived in the village your whole life. Your father was a great adventurer. He saved the village from a lich many years ago (there is a statue to his deeds in the town square). He kept trophies from that day in his estate and farm that he retired on.\n\nAs you grew up, you would read all the books around the house. Then you found the Necronomicon, which used to be the lich's. You really wanted to try out that real, honest-to-goodness magic, but you couldn't get an opportunity. Then your father died. You were so excited to bring him back, but the bastard went and got cremated.\n\nBut that won't stop you. You _will_ try the spells. You set out to find and/or make a dead body.\n\nNo one in town recognizes you, since you only rarely left your house.\n\n# **NPCs:**\n\nOne of the villagers seems pretty shady. If he finds out about your "practices," then you wake up in the middle of the night with him standing over you. He reveals that he is a lich, an apprentice of the one your father killed. He offers to decode parts of the Necronomicon for you, for a price. The price isn't always in gold.\n\nAn old man is still angry at you, your family, and all adventurers because your father once broke into his house and broke all his pots. He is automatically suspicious of you. If you do anything that makes him more suspicious, he investigates your farm. If he sees a monster, he dies of a heart attack immediately. His bones are too frail to make a good skeleton and his body wouldn't hold together as a zombie. You have to bury him before they go looking for him.\n\n# **Rituals:**\n\nRituals will involve ingredients that you must harvest from the forest or buy. Most will be found from the Necronomicon.\n\nNot all of them involve raising the dead. I won't mention those ones here since they should be pretty simple, but I'll put ideas for methods if you want.\n\n* A **Suggestion**-like spell that lets you influence someones behavior for either the day of the casting or the next day. You change their schedule so that instead of, say, going to the store, they instead go to the tavern. They get their drink, go outside, leave it sitting, go somewhere else, then come back to drink it. While they are gone, you could poison it. Or you could have someone go into the forest, where a group of undead or a beartrap waits for them. You need a sample of the person and some Valerian Root, though. Maybe some spit wiped off a mug or a hair that you take off of their bed. Or maybe the storekeeper decides to keep the place open for a while. If anything goes wrong and they notice, they will break free from the spell. Depending on the amount of Valerian Root used in the spell, the suggestion can last anywhere from a single hour to several days.\n\n* A **Calming** spell. It makes people far less suspicious of incredibly suspicious behavior for a few hours and they can build emotional attachments to you quicker. If cast on someone who is tracking you down, they will give up their search temporarily. You need a sample, just like the above spell. You also need Chamomile Petals. The amount of petals used can drive the spell from a fraction of an hour to several days.\n\n* Spells that **Alter Weather**. The different spells will have different effects and varying levels of suspicious-ness. You can make it rain, storm, or snow so that people don't explore the forest (where you will be sacrificing a live victim or some other sinister deed). However, snowing in the summer will be suspicious, as will a warm day in the Winter. There may be some components out there that let you cause some slightly less ordinary weather phenomenon, like tornadoes, rains of daggers, a supernatural fog, or make it start raining cats and dogs.\n\n* A **Divination** spell. Don't have the time to find out someones schedule, find out what they are doing in that locked shed, or want to see them die from your poison without having to be there? Just buy a crystal ball, get some incense, then relax and spy on it all! You get to see a visual representation of their schedule for the next week and you can spy on what they are doing right now!\n\n* A **True Ressurection** spell. Did you accidentally poison the wrong guy? Fall in love with someone, but they try to deliver you flowers and get torn apart by hordes of the dead? Well, high-level necromancers will be able to _truly_ bring someone back. They will have no memory of the hour before their death or their afterlife. It even works no matter how long the person has been dead, and they will be completely demon free! Thing is, to truly bring back a life, you have to truly take one. You must murder someone in an unhallowed site (an abandoned graveyard, a ruin in the forest, a previous murder scene, etc.). Their body will be totally evaporated and their soul will never reach an afterlife. Your lover/wrong target/torture victim, however, will be good as new!\n\nThe last time I posted this, someone asked\n\n&gt;In this game idea of yours, what would be the moment-to-moment gameplay?\n\nHere's the answer I put, for completeness:\n\nWell, your goal will likely change throughout it. Build relationships with the villagers, avoid letting your minions get seen, and have your minions do the grave dirty work on your farm. When you decide you need new servants (old ones becoming decayed or wandered off to be murdered by an inquisitor), you try to find a way to kill one of the villagers, and you have to pick wisely. Not everyone is an asshole that has it coming.\n\nYou would also try to accomplish goals to get money or materials to give to your good lich friend so they can decrypt the Necronomicon.\n\nYou may also need to defend said book and your other treasures later on from hired thugs, clerics that find out your secret, cultists looking to resurrect the previous owner of the book, and just other necromancers that want it. The stealthier you are, the less likely for any of those to happen, though the more magic-based ones could find you even if you are the stealthiest in the world thanks to their seers.\n\nThere is also procuring the materials for your rituals, like lichdom and resurrecting stuff. There might even be other rituals, like ones that make it rain the next day so your undead don't have to be out as long or so you can change someones schedule, or use a voodoo doll to make someone want to go somewhere they normally wouldn't.

You can knock things over to distract him, sacrifice other already dead bugs or mice you find to him ect, and the only way he can detect you is by sight or noise so you have to stay quiet and hidden as possible. Kinda like hello neighbour but morbidly depressing.\n\nAnyways that's it lmao.
1595188888|hu70os|VR vs. PC players raid style battles with match making|The person in VR would be a giant boss type enemy while a group of 10 players on a normal PC setup would work together to take them down. Think MMO style raid battles but with match making.\n\nThis would be awesome because only one person in a group of friends would need to have VR for them all to play the game, and it would help get more people who don't have a VR setup interacting with the VR space and seeing the tech in action. It would also solve the issue of VR online match making taking forever because there are few people with VR.
1532993129|9396rk|An oddball game about being a socially awkward hitchhiker who keeps getting kicked out as soon as the conversation goes south.|The gameplay is about dialogue, but instead of NPCs having to do most of the talking... **YOU have to do most of the talking.**\n\nThe idea/theme is that conversation is actually quite intimidating for certain people, so this game would try to replicate that feeling for the player. To do this, dialog would be handled unconventionally:\n\nDuring conversation, a soup of thoughts, pictures and words would float all over the screen. The player is tasked with selecting, ordering and pulling some of them down into a text box to make coherent speech. But the longer you take, the more *intrusive* words and thoughts keep crowding the screen. And of course there's also awkward silence the whole time you're doing this. Sometimes your character will just blurt out a word you put into the textbox before you finish, or worse... he'll just blurt out a word you shuffled around and now you have to work off of that started sentence.\n\nThe more awkward or senseless the conversation turns, the more irrelevant and intrusive the thoughts that show up to choose from. Until eventually the driver is too creeped out by you and drops you on the side of the road. Now you have to hitch another ride and see how far they'll take you.\n\n*Where* the player is going isn't clearly revealed until you arrive when you beat the game. Part of the fun would be discovering the main character's backstory.

I also like games where you have to code a lot cos I'm mainly programmer and I love UI/UX design (now I'm working as web developer).\n\n**Game concept:**\n\nYou are the manager who collect the team and develop it in certain way in order to win the tournament.  Before every round you are able to buy 1 of 3 drawn gladiators (you can have max 6).\n\nThan you pick 1 of 3 drawn weapon to the new team member you just obtained. There are no other types of items. You can follow the whole tournament participants tree and prepare for your next fights.\n\nEnemy gladiators are created in the same way as player create it's own team (there is a algorythm which combine available units with weapons and upgrade stats based on game progress). I didn't want the player to face nameless creatures in countless amounts all over again. When you enter arena you watch the combat in realtime. **You don't control the combat**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* gladiators are various races with other perks (2 tiers with 2 perks each) - I'm trying to keep it small but I want player to have different choices\n* each weapon has also unique perk tree - I want player to create various combinations of unit/weapon\n* I hate useless stats in games (playing warrior means you max strength etc.). I tried to design the main statistics in such a way that the derived statistics were useful for all units.\n\n**Strength** \- hp / power\n\n**Agility** \- dodge / haste *(attSpeed/cdr)*\n\n**Intelect** \- crit chance / tenacity\n\nEven *crit chance* will be useful for all abilities, for eg. unit with warlock staff which summons undead, if crit will be triggered it will summon stronger minion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe challenge for the player is to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing team and properly prepare your team for the upcoming fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have 3 main **inspirations**:\n\n**Albion online** \- one item totaly can change the way your character fight.\n\nMod to warcraft3, **Orc Gladiators: Revenge** \- a great challenge, setting tactics for the next rounds, trying to balance tasks for individual team members.\n\nOther mod to wc3, **HellHalt Td** \- strong dependencies between the types of attacks and defenses of the unit force you to carefully plan what units to buy to win the next round, while thinking about further rounds, which sometimes require longer and systematic saving of resources especially for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I am getting old, but  I started to like games  that don't require too much agility from me, but at the same time I like to influence the game in the planning / preparation state and then observe the effects of my decisions :D\n\n**I will appreciate any feedback, THANKS!**

1569406594|d9195i|Man-eating Lightning McQueen Fake Taxi Simulator (serious)|It's a working title.    \nThe game would probably be a mod for the GTA1 engine, or something similar.    \nYou are an anthropomorphic car, lightning McQueen style, and you have a taste for human flesh (you are the only one of your kind). You pose as a taxi, and lure in unsuspecting customers, then kill and eat them. If they become suspicious or you fail to lead them to their destination, they will become suspicious and try to leave the taxi. However, you must also avoid being detected by the public and police. The police become aware that some kind of serial killer is afoot, and ramp up security and make your life difficult. You do not need to kill every passenger, but you risk starving to death over time.    \nThings become more difficult over time as the police crack down to find the culprit. Methods of killing your customers are taken away, and the player has to rely on creative strategies like getting into crashes or other environmental kills and/or tailor the murder to the victim, i.e distractedness, couple or one person, etc. Managing your vehicle and upgrading it and so on could add to complexity. Ofc this sort of thing would come into play later in development.

So each agent must maintain their job, status, relationship and health, etc to remain active (playable) \n\nMissions are location based, each serving to further the cause of the revolution and push the story forward. New locations, agents and new gear for the Vigilante to use can be unlocked per mission completed. \n\nHow the player solves each mission affects the livelihoods of the people around, and in turn, affects how easy/difficult it is to maintain agent's covers.

Now think of the game world duplicated into 5 "layers"\n\n- Dark Orange\n- Orange\n- White (Neutral)\n- Blue\n- Dark Blue\n\nWhen you're in a layer you also project colored semi transparent ghosts in the layers above and below you. If you see an orange ghost you know the player is in the above layer, a blue ghost means they're in the layer below you. \n\nEvery player can jump up and down layers with a cool down but can also pick perks. Goal is to grab flag from the other team and bring it back to your base, but each base exists on opposite ends of the map in opposite layers.\n\nPerk Ideas:\n\n- Jump two layers at once but with a longer cooldown\n\n- Shoot enemies in layers above and below you\n\n- hide your ghosts so you can just pop into existence and surprise opponents\n\n- deal extra damage or some other advantage but be physical/vulnerable in all layers at once\n\n- peak into any layer you want for a given amount of time to find out where the enemy is\n\n- shock enemies to prevent them from jumping layers\n\nThe world in each layer doesn't have to be symmetric either. For instance the neutral layer could have a void in the centre of the map that jumping layers into it kills you, or entire buildings that prevent layer jumping in or out of.\n\nI can post some pictures to help explain if you'd like\n\nEdit: Any other perk ideas? Is the core system too complicated?

These recruits will vary in quality, from eager volunteers to mediocre draftees. You will have to get these men in top shape in order for them to win the war, and probably survive. Large quantities of recruits would arrive to boot camp once a month or two. Drill instructors can be assigned to a chosen number of recruits, who can either be experienced in previous conflicts or completely inexperienced.\n\n You will have to create firing ranges, barracks, obstacle courses, mess hall, parade square, etc. There will also be training grounds for specialized troops such as engineers, flamethrowers, tank crewmen, artillerymen, and much more. You will have only a certain amount of time to train recruits until they are assigned to different units or to the frontlines.\n\n These soldiers would be sent on missions where their efficiency would depend on the quality of their training.

1556488025|bigi4y|Cleaning up the post apocalypse.|Games like stardew valley, and harvest moon are pretty chill and relaxing. And after dozens of hours you get to look back on what you've done. The farm you've built, the tools you've earned and the relationships you've made.\nGames like Fallout have this big ugly mess of a world that was once alive, that is also beautifully somber.\nWouldn't it be nice to clean it up? Clear the clutter, re-use the materials, give life to vegetation, build civilization for hours on end. And after awhile you can look back in satisfaction at what you've accomplished.\n\nFallout 4 has this on a small scale, but ideally this game would be entirely based around the calm nature of cleaning, recycling, and rebuilding.\nThe game would be aesthetically similar to The Last Guardian but in a Fallout style world.\n\nI got the idea from playing House Flipping Simulator in which you do a lot of throwing away trash, cleaning messes, and building walls or furniture.\n\nIt'd be a pretty casual game for anyone to play and relax.

1533156950|93sxcq|Size DOES matter|I wanted to throw out a quick, caring and a little harsh PSA to all you new idea guys on this subreddit which has been already relevant for several posts in the last 24 hours:\n\n\*\*\*A BIGGER game is NOT a game idea on its own!\*\*\*\n\nSo many people come on here with posts about how 'imagine PUBG but 10x bigger' or imagine 'imagine Fortnight but with 1000 players' or 'imagine Rust but with the map the size of Skyrim.' This taking an existing game and just scaling it up by ten times is neither a working game idea nor is it a helpful idea. Also do not get defensive when this is pointed out to you and try and protect yourself with excuses such as 'I'm putting it out there for inspiration.' Trust me when I say that every, even half reasonable, game dev out there has these ideas.\n\n"So why don't these games exist then if everyone already knows them?"\n\nBecause the scale of what your suggesting is often just not possible with present hardware. The reason why BR games are generally limited to 100 players is because even at that point the stability of the server for every player is not great, in fact this is probably why there is only one drop ship in any BR game so that most players get clumped together and that 100 initial number quickly drops to a more manageable 50-70. If players were able to respawn and spread out across the map the connection quality of these games would be absolute trash.\n\nThis of course not saying that games cannot be made bigger. Three player chess variants are a simple but excellent example of a traditional format that can be completely turned on its head with that increase in players.\n\nSo what should you do with your future ideas if the selling point is 'it's like Y but X times bigger'? Try to keep the following in mind:\n\n1) Do I think the average gamers computer / internet etc can handle it reasonably well? (Remember that most of your potential player base do not have a high end custom gaming rig).\n\n2) Is there a reason why the increased player base / game size etc will change the way the mechanics and gameplay operate? (BR games being an excellent example of 'yes there are 100 players in the game' but in the average match you'll probably only encounter between 1-10 of them so would it actually make any difference to you the player if there 10000 players? Because unless you're the God of this game the end result will be you will probably kill 1-3 of them then die and start a new match, exactly the same gameplay you would get with PUBG or Fortnight).\n\nThank you all for reading.

1591860665|h0ui5v|A pure survival horror game with limited ammo and a tense, dangerous, slowed down twist on the Dark Souls combat.|GAMEPLAY CONCEPT\n\nI always felt a much slower twist on the Soulsborne combat formula could work extremely well in a true survival horror context. Sure, Bloodborne was a horror game, but it was mostly an action game overall.\n\nMy idea would be a 3rd person, surreal horror game set in modern times, with a heavy dark narrative, hideous/creative enemies, guns with tight ammo, and slowed down, realistic, punishing melee combat. \n\nThe game will be pretty linear, pushing the story forward on a rather direct path, but will also have a few areas where the game momentarily opens up into a small open world. \n\nThere will be two, tiny open worlds. One will appear in the first half and the other in the second. \n\nThese small open world sections will have enemies throughout, along with an occasional npc or two. There will be secret weapons, supplies, secret areas, a few side quests, and other things.\n\nMost activities in the open worlds are completely optional. \n\nThe story will lead you to certain larger buildings, where you will be opening locked doors, solving puzzles, and creating shortcuts in order to progress, keeping the formula of both Soulsborn and old school survival horror games.\n\nAny Souls fan knows how perfect it feels to control the character's left and right arms with your left and right hands. It just feels so hands on and right. I believe having a slower more realistic take on the Souls combat style could fit perfectly within a survival horror situation. I want the melee combat against the deformed beasts to feel visceral and heavy. I should be able to feel every swing. It would work amazingly for adding to the immersion.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENEMIES\n\n- Enemies wont respawn like in Souls games. Once enemies are dead, they are gone, unless you die before saving.\n\n- But, once an area has been cleared and the player has saved, sometimes an enemy or two will spawn again at random. \n\n- Enemies will slowly respawn in the open world sections. \n\n- There will be many unique/creative monster types. Nothing obvious or cliche. A few types might be slightly humanoid and holding a knife or axe.\n\n- There will be a few bosses throughout the game. \n\n- Enemies will have an animation shift when nearly dead. They will begin to look defeated and slow.\n\n- All enemies can be killed via melee or gunfire. Gunfire is much safer and more effective than melee. Enemies will pose a serious threat to a player without a gun. Certain enemies will drain your HP within seconds, if handled incorrectly. Melee takes skill and is very unforgiving.\n\n- Enemies will not be flooded all over the game. Story, atmosphere and exploration are the main focus, not combat. Im thinking kind of like the spacing of enemies in Silent Hill 2. Not overly action packed, but enough enemies to have to be dealt with at times.\n \n- If fighting melee, most enemies have to be learned and taken very seriously like in Dark Souls. There will be many easier enemies throughout the game, but several will be quite a challenge and take a decent amount of skill.\n\n- Certain unique, much more dangerous, enemies, will roam around the game at random points. They are extremely tough to take on with melee, but can be killed much easier with a gun.\n\n- In most cases, enemies will move at a speed which allows the player's slower movement not to be out matched. There will be a few quicker enemy types scattered throughout the game, but they again, are much easier to take out with a gun.\n\n- Basically, melee can either be mastered or mostly avoided. It's pretty much there as a scary last resort, or for people who want the challenge. Using a gun more than evens the playing field for most players who just want to enjoy the story and atmosphere.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGUNS\n\n- A handgun will become available pretty soon into the game, giving some early game relief. A shotgun and a rifle will come later. Nothing automatic. Ammo is tight but if you choose your shots well, you should manage to scrape by.\n\n- Using the gun turns the game into a much more accessible experience. Horror isnt about difficulty, yet having extremely lethal enemies lurking around is panic inducing, even with a gun in your hand. This will force players to take every moment slowly, choose every shot wisely, and just overall play more cautiously. All while not making the game overly difficult. \n\n\nWEAPON DURABILITY \n\n- Many melee weapons will break. Their durability will effect their overall power. Certain weapons will break easier on different enemy types. But, something as weak as a knife can also take a long time to break if used on soft enemies.\n\n- Many unbreakable weapons will be slightly hidden throughout the game. Basically, weapons you wouldnt expect to break, dont break. Early versions of these are easy to find and makes it so the player always has something that can get them through combat. \n\n- Many breakable melee weapons may work better against certain enemies, but any unbreakable weapon can get the job done in any situation.\n\n- Breakable weapons allow for varied combat, experimentation, optional extra challenge, and fun, without being a nuisance.\n\n- The melee weapon list wouldnt be extremely long. Maybe just 10 common, real world weapons/tools/objects, with a few variants.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSAVING \n\n- The game should work on a save point system. Frequent checkpoints destroy tension. \n\n- Automatic checkpoints will only show up right before a point of no return, such as a cutscene or bossfight. Just so nobody gets screwed. \n\nCAMERA\n\n- The camera should, for the most part, closely follow the player.\n\n- Players will be able to adjust the camera with the right analog stick.\n\n- There will be occasional moments of classic fixed camera angles. (Aiming while in fixed angles will use auto aim).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMAP\n\n- Using the map does not pause the game.\n\n- The player will find a map for each area they are in.\n\n- The map will get marked with stuff like locked doors, puzzle locations, etc.\n\n- Custom notes can be written onto the map.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINVENTORY\n\n- Opening the inventory puts the world into a slight slow motion. This will add to the player never feeling fully at ease, while still cutting them a little slack.\n\n- Inventory shows player status, weapons, notes, items, etc. There is no limit to inventory but you can only carry one of each weapon. Inventory management shouldn't have to be a pain.\n\n- There are two equipable quick access weapon slots. These weapons are switched between in game by a button press. \n\n- Incase players are using breakable weapons, each weapon slot has a backup slot where a 2nd weapon can be selected. \n\n- Players cannot access these weapons in game until their primary weapon breaks. \n\n- Once the first weapon breaks, it takes about two seconds to pull the second weapon out. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDAMAGE\n\n- Enemies inflict brutal damage on the player. The player's arms, legs, head, and torso each individually take damage when struck. Damage to the legs or arms, cause them to be less effective. Damaged arms make melee, blocking and aiming less effective. Injured legs make the player move slower, limp, and have more of a chance of stumbling/falling. \n\n- The player has both HP for individual parts (arms, legs, torso, head) and overall player HP.  The overall HP is based off the condition of all body parts.\n\n- Damage is shown realistically on the player's body as well as on enemies. Player and enemy attacks leave bloody marks where they strike. \n\n- Blood will accumulate on the player's body based on directly getting hit and also a percentage system. \n\n- Each body part will have a different amount of bleeding based on its current amount of HP. Each limb will show damage when struck but wounds will barely bleed at higher HP. Once HP gets lower, blood will begin to bleed more and more from the wounds until healed.\n\nEDIT: This might be crazy but, what if once the head reaches a low enough HP, the joysticks could switch every once in awhile. Meaning right stick becomes left, left becomes right. It could do it for only a few seconds at a time. Idk. Might be cool. Maybe too much. Just makes head injuries extremely serious and forces players to attend to them quickly.\n\n\nGUAGING PLAYER HEALTH\n\n- Exact health can be viewed on the inventory screen.\n\n- In game, health can be guaged by looking at the player's condition. Hurt arms and legs will be held differently and blood will be running from their wounds.  \n\n- At 50% overall health a light pulse will be heard.\n\n- 25% brings a redness around the edges of the screen and a louder pulse.\n\n- 10% - 0% Gradually drains screen of color until its  black and white. The pulse sound will get louder and slow down. Music and certain sound effects will get slightly drowned out.\n\n\nHEALING\n\n- Healing is done in real time.\n\n- The game will have two healing options; a drink and a Medikit.\n\n- You find health scattered around the game.\n\n- Healing removes visible blood from the character.\n\nHEALTH DRINKS\n\n- Drinks heal less than medikits.\n\n- Drinks give a slight overall boost in HP to all body parts.\n\n- Drinking only takes three seconds and the player can quickly walk while doing it.\n\nMEDIKITS\n\n- When choosing a Medikit, the player has a prompt to be able to choose a specific body part to heal.\n\n- Once the body part is chosen, the Medikit heals it 100%.\n\n- Medikits also slightly heal every body part a moderate amount when used. \n\n-  Using a Medikit has animations of sometimes kneeling (depending on body part being healed), pouring peroxide, using medical wrap and cutting with scissors.\n\n- Medikits take 10 seconds to apply, but can be briefly interrupted (quick moving, combat), three times before progress is lost.\n\n- If healing is not completed, bandages will eventually begin to fall off and progress will be lost. The Medikit will return to your inventory.\n\n- Sucessfully applied bandages will remain on the character for about two minutes before they either fall off, or the character is animated pulling them off.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHUD\n\n- There will be a very minimal HUD, if any at all.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAMINA\n\n- The player doesnt have unlimited stamina. Stamina works like Souls. Goes down when you run/swing/block/etc. Goes right back up when you stop. Completely drain your stamina and you are slow, weak and ineffective. If stamina is completely drained, it will take two seconds of inactivity before starting to refill.  \n\n- There is no on screen guage to keep an eye on, instead the player will begin to breath heavier and heavier as their stamina drains. \n\n\nCONTROLS\n\n- The basic controls are very much based around the Dark Souls control scheme, so this will definitely make most sense to Souls fans. The way Fromsoftware set the buttons up, really makes you feel connected to the gameplay, which is very important when creating immersion.\n\nMost of this layout isnt too crazy, but the gun control scheme might need a bit of tweeking in certain parts. I really like it, but it might be horrible. Lol.\n\nHere's a set up that I think could work pretty well.\n\nI picture the player movement being close to the speed of Red Dead 2. Everything has weight and isnt super gamey. \n\n\nSet for a PS4\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nANALOG STICKS\n\nLEFT STICK - MOVE CHARACTER\n\n- Moves character around. Speed is based on push strength. Speed ranges from a slow walk to a light jog.\n\nL3 - FLASHLIGHT ON/OFF\n\n\nRIGHT STICK - CAMERA/AIM/ LOCK ON SWITCH\n\n- Adjusts the camera and aims gun.\n- While locked on, the player can switch between enemies.\n\nR3 - CROUCH\n\n- Click to crouch/stand.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/\ (Triangle) - TWO HAND/ONE HAND WEAPON\n\n- Switches between holding a melee weapon or gun with one or two hands. \n\n- Melee weapons are more powerful when swung with two hands.\n\n- Guns, (especially shotguns and rifles), are more accurate with two hands.\n\n□ - KICK/STOMP ENEMY\n\n- Stomps and kills enemies on the floor.\n\n- Kicks away enemies. Kicks dont do any damage on most enemies. They are only used for creating space. It slightly stuns or stumbles enemies for about a second. Just enough time to land a hit, shot, or run.\n\n- Kicking an enemy can be countered if done at the wrong time. \n\n- Some enemies cannot be staggered by kicks.\n\n- Kicks are most effective against shorter enemies.\n\n\n○ - DODGE/RUN\n\n- If tapped the player clumsily dodges away from the enemy.\n\n- If held, the player runs quickly until all stamina is gone.\n\n\nX - INTERACT/VAULT\n\n- Interacts with different prompts around the game.\n\n- Climbs up some small ledges.\n\n\nTOUCHPAD\n\n- Open/close inventory menu.\n\n\nSTART BUTTON\n\n- Pause game. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nD PAD\n\n\n (UP) - MAP\n\n- Pulls out a map. Doesnt pause the game.\n\n(LEFT) - HEAL\n\n- Hold and choose a Health Drink or Medikit.\n\n- While holding left, a prompt to pick between your two health options appears (tap L1 for Drink, Hold R1 for Medikit).\n\n- Holding R1 for the Medikit brings up a way to pick a  specific body part to heal. \n\n\n(RIGHT) - SWITCH WEAPON\n\n- Quickly switched between your two equipped weapons.\n\n(DOWN) - NOTE\n\n- Player can equip a note for quick access.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMELEE COMBAT CONTROLS\n\n- As said before, melee is learnable but extremely dangerous (like real life) and will mainly be used as a last resort if you're low on ammo, or by players really who enjoy the challenge. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMELEE COMBAT - NO WEAPON\n\nNOTE: Fighting without a weapon inflicts next to no damage on most enemies, like in Souls.\n\nL1 - GUARD/LOCK ON\n\n- Holding locks on to enemy\n\n- Holding L1 puts the left arm up in a ready position, guarding the player's body and face. The left arm takes reduced damage while blocking. It can sometimes successfully swat away incoming attacks.\n\n\nL2 - PUSH\n\n- Left arm pushes enemy back. Push strength is based on how quickly you pull the trigger.\n\n- Pushes, when landed, will momentarily stagger enemies, but only for a brief time, (like kicks).\n\n- Pushes work best on medium to tall enemies.\n\n- Some enemies are unstaggerable. \n\n- Pushes can occasionally be countered by enemies, (like kicks).\n\n* Same applies to any push mentioned below.\n\nR1 - LIGHT PUNCH\n\n-  Light right arm punch.\n\nR2 - HEAVY PUNCH\n\n- Heavy right arm punch. Power based on how fast the trigger is pulled. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMELEE - WEAPON - ONE HANDED\n\nL1 - GUARD/LOCK ON\n\n- Lock on to enemy and block with left hand like before.\n\nL2 - PUSH\n\n- Push with left hand like before.\n\nR1 - LIGHT ATTACK\n\n- Light attack with weapon in right hand.\n\nR2 - HEAVY ATTACK\n\n- Heavy attack with right hand weapon. Power based on trigger pull speed. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nMELEE - TWO HAND WEAPON\n\nL1 - GUARD/LOCK ON\n\n- Guards and deflects with the weapon in two hands. Some weapons are more effective than others. \n\n-Locks on to enemy.\n\nL2 - PUSH\n\n- Push enemy away with both hands on weapon.\n\nR1 - LIGHT ATTACK\n\n- Light two hand attack.\n\nR2 - HEAVY ATTACK\n\n- Heavy two hand attack based on trigger pull speed. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGUN CONTROLS\n\nThis is where is gets kinda rocky. I like the controls and feel it makes sense. I might be crazy. The switch in controls for one handed aiming, is intentionally awkward but it might go to far. I'm mainly just sticking to the Dark Souls (left/right), control scheme.  Any real world person, without training, would struggle much more firing a gun with one hand. I'm just trying to convey that.\n\nGun is held in right hand. All guns can be fired with one band. Aiming and accuracy is greatly reduced when one handing a gun, especially with shotguns and rifles.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n GUN CONTROLS - ONE HANDED\n\nL1 - GUARD\n\n- Guard with left hand.\n\nL2 - PUSH\n\n- Push with left hand\n\nR1 - AIM\n\n- Holding R1 aims the weapon. The camera pulls in right behind the players shoulder.\n\n- A small white dot shows up for the reticle. \n\n- The reticle will wobble around more while one handed aiming. \n\nR2 - SHOOT\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGUN CONTROLS - TWO HAND\n\nL1 - GUARD\n\n- Player uses arms and gun to deflect attacks.\n\nL2 - AIM\n\n- Reticle is pretty steady with a little wobble. \n\nR1 - RELOAD\n\nR2 - SHOOT

1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**

1535566509|9bbrim|Narrative-based game where NPCs start out as silhouettes/indistinct models and gain details as the player forms opinions about them.|An example of an interaction would just be a standard conversation. Later on in therapy/talking to a friend the player would be tasked with describing what they thought about their personality. Maybe given options like "Yeah he seemed like a ______." and given options between jock, band geek, etc. \n\nThe next time you see that character they'd look like a stereotype of whatever option you chose. Talking to them/about them more could lead to changes in their character model. I'm not sure where the idea could go beyond that but I feel like it could be used in interesting narratives. Possibly about how we see people differently based on perspectives, at the end it shows a group photo that can be shared with friends or online as a sort of "wait that's what you thought of that person? I totally got a different vibe." \n\nAnother implementation could be that you hear about the person before seeing them for the first time. Basically having the conversation before meeting them, but them matching the stereotype when you see them, with the narrative being more about how our views of people can be shaped by what we hear about them.

As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.\n\nFor the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). \n\nFor the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.\n\nFor the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.\n\nThe interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.\n\nYou would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.\n\nThere would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.\n\nAll from the comfort of your chair.\n

1530014754|8tzgnr|Soaked- A neighborhood water gun and balloon battle royale with clothes drying mechanics and more|Setting: A peaceful Midwest USA suburban neighborhood during a particularly warm Mid-1990’s summer day.\n\nConcept: Everybody in the neighborhood is participating in this massive water fight. \n\nGimmick: Your saturation meter is your health bar. You will slowly dry off again over time. Remaining in direct sunlight (and direct visibility) will dry you off faster. Finding a dry towel and using it (like a first aid kit) will dry you off even more. There are also stationary fans that will dry you off very quickly. If your saturation meter hits 100%, you’re out of the game.\n\nYou also have stamina- you will get tired and exhausted, so you’ll need to grab a Squeeze-It juice bottle to refresh yourself and maybe a freshly cooked hotdog from near the grill.\n\nMap confinement: As the game goes on, the lawn sprinkler systems starting at the outer perimeter begin to turn on, forcing you toward the center and reducing the size of the playable area.\n\nWeapons: \nYou have your basic and rudimentary single pump water pistol that delivers one small squirt per trigger pull. Not very effective but better than nothing. \n\nThen you have the charge-up power soaker- a two handed water gun with an air tank that you pump up which allows you to fire continuously until the air pressure runs out. There are an array of these, some have larger water reservoirs, some require less pumps to charge, some have bigger streams but run out of air and water quickly, some fire thinner streams but last longer. \n\nThere are water balloons as well, you can carry a few in your pouch. These are sufficient for a pretty good soaking with a direct hit, but also cause, ahem, “splash damage” if you only hit near your target.\n\nThere are also mounted guns- I mean, garden hoses that you can use for an unlimited amount of time, but you won’t be able to travel far with them. \n\nYou will need to refill your water weapons as they run out of water. For this, you need to visit a water source such as a garden hose, water bucket, or unground pool. The pool is the fastest way but it comes with an added danger- if another player sees you kneeling down to fill your weapon, they can run up and shove you into the water. In a pinch, you can also transfer water from one weapon to another- though you are likely to spill a small percentage of water in the process.\n\nThe match ends when there is one player left with less than 100% saturation, or when the street lights come on and all remaining players are called home by their moms- in which case the driest player wins.\n\n

1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

At the end, you will fight boss with a little amount or even without skills.|I.E. you are terminally ill, like cancer which eats your insides making you weaker, yet you still have to go on to save your kid from the kidnapper.

1534349291|97jinf|A psychological horror/thriller that starts off as a slice of life farming game. You soon suspect the townsfolk won't let you leave.|In a lottery you don't remember entering, you won a farm in a small town and decide to start life anew. The game starts proper as you meet the nice townspeople and begin farming the first season. But soon you start to realize something ominous is happening.\n\nOn the day the bus line is supposed to resume service, the bus is mysteriously out of commission. When you try to make a phone call, you learn that the phone service is down for repair. The townsfolk are suspiciously keen on presenting you with love interests. You find a shrine that nobody seems to know about or at least mention to you. Every time you pass out from exhaustion, you wake up in your own bed. Someone must be stalking you.\n\nWhile renovating your house, you find markings and traces of blood beneath the floorboards. Someone in town accidentally calls you by another name. While plowing your farmland, you discover unmarked graves. You overhear conversation about "appeasing the forest sprites."\n\nIf you look forward through the calendar on the mayor's wall, there's a date/holiday marked with a red X that isn't marked on your own calendar. Something is going to happen on or by that day.\n\n****\n\nYou can choose to continue playing the game as a slice of life farming game, pretending that everything is fine. There's an ending for that.\n\nBut if you choose to try to break free of the farming game cycle, you'll find resistance. The townsfolk become hostile and eventually violent. There's an ending for this too.\n\nThere's also an ending in which you turn the tide on the town and escape. You steer the wrath of these so-called "forest sprites" onto the town itself. But the path to this ending might take a few playthroughs to discover.
1528918422|8qvbb7|Whale Hunter: A F2P/pay-to-win game where the bigger you spend, the bigger a target you become for free players.|There was an old Extra Credits episode in which Dan made a case that F2P players in a subscription MMO are a good thing because the free players are essentially "content" for subscription players. It fills servers and give those players other people to play with.\n\n**I think the opposite can be true as well.** Whales can be content for the free players.\n\n### How This Works\n\nThis is a PvP (and/or PvE) game where you can spend actual money on clearly better gear and leveling up. There's no upper limit to leveling up. HOWEVER, the more you spend, the bigger a target you become too. The player's body size literally increases. So too does their run stride length, jump height, health pool, etc. all increase.\n\nPlayers who kill, crit or otherwise hinder a whale, will earn an extra fraction of what the whale has spent. The whale doesn't lose money. It's more like money is copied in the form of a microcurrency. Dying to a whale also comes with a small bonus payment too so you don't feel cheated.\n\nThis could be a battle royale game, a simple arena shooter, a vehicular combat game or even a sports game if modified a little.\n\n### Why This Works\n\nIIRC in that same Extra Credits video, Dan talked about an MMORPG in which players could buy gift drops for other players. This player could use that microtransaction to come in and rain gifts upon other players, becoming the life of the party. This psychology can work if a whale effectively becomes the boss fight of whatever multiplayer game he's in. When a whale shows up to your lobby, it's like Santa Claus came to town and everyone is gunning for him. Free players get a bonus objective, while the fat whale becomes the focal point of the party.

1486231219|5s1zer|Please post design ideas, not experience ideas|In the book "Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences" by Tynan Sylvester there's a paragraph titled "The Fallacy of Vision" (p. 304). It starts with a short story:\n\n&gt; *A young aerospace engineer is at his first day of work. He goes into the \nboss’s office with a gleam in his eye, and declares, "I’ve got the greatest \nidea for a new kind of airplane."*\n\n&gt; *The boss is intrigued. "Explain," he says.*\n\n&gt; *The young engineer takes on a visionary expression and stares into \nthe distance. "The passengers board hassle-free in five minutes. Then \nthe plane takes off, silently, with barely a bump, as the passengers enjoy \nmartinis in their private booths. As they soar over the Atlantic, a young \ncouple enjoys the view in one of the plane’s many bubble canopies, and \na cute kid gets a tour of the cockpit. The captain chuckles as the kid asks \nwhy they can’t fly to the moon. By the time they touch down, love has been \nfound, lessons have been learned, and everybody is ready for whatever \nawaits them at their destination."*\n\n&gt; *The boss leans back in his chair and takes a long drag on his cigar. \n"You’re fired," he says.*\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; This young aerospace engineer had a vision. But his vision was of an \nairplane flight, not an airplane. He described a wonderful experience, but \nhe  said  nothing  about  the  mechanical  systems  that  created  that  experience. \nHe succumbed to the fallacy of vision.\n\n&gt; **The FALLACY OF VISION is the idea that a mental movie of an experience \nis equivalent to a design for a system that generates that experience.**\n\n----\n\nIn other words, when you post your ideas please avoid describing a single experience and try to describe how the game works and what does the player experience in general. Games generate experiences, and these experiences are never the same.\n\n**Edit: My part of the post was in contradiction with the quote, I fixed it thanks to a number of thoughtful comments.**

1533251471|9449zw|A horror game that slowly morphs into a non-horror game through repeated play.|Resident Evil 4 was my first "horror" game and it was scary the first time I played it. But the more I played and replayed it, the more I turned into *Leon: Destroyer of Plagas*.\n\nThis game idea is a condensed and exaggerated version of this concept. It's designed to go from "P.T. scary" to "Serious Sam empowering."\n\nHowever, the game is still the same game the whole way through... it's only the player who changes.\n\n### HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe game takes place in a large haunted labyrinth. Every time you start the game, you're spawned in a different area of the same world. This is done so that each playthrough feels unfamiliar at first, but after repeated play you know the game map like the back of your hand.\n\nAt first there appears to be *one* supernatural monster that can spawn anywhere, do anything and kill you at any time (picture the crying woman from P.T.). However, through repeated play you realize there's actually several of them and they all each have their own unique patterns and predictable behaviors. They're meant to look similar (but not identical) so that they seem like one unpredictable monster at first.\n\nLastly and most importantly, the game starts out without a clear objective. You don't know where to go and what you're supposed to do. Your first playthroughs are about unraveling the mystery. Through environmental storytelling, you learn that you're here to eliminate the supernatural entities. You're some kind of professional exorcist.\n\n**Not only that, but you've had the ability to kill the demons all along.** The game just didn't make it explicit.\n\nTo eliminate demons, *you have to let them hurt you.* Like S.O.M.A. and many other horror games, you can take one "hit" from a monster. You drop to the floor, your vision gets blurry, you hear voices and see visions, and you're forced to limp in pain. Also like typical horror games, there are "health points" on the map that recover you to full health.\n\nWell it turns out that when you're "hit" by a demon you're actually being possessed and your character is resisting. This is why he is limping, seeing visions and hearing voices. And those "health points" are actually special exorcism tomes. When you use it, you're actually eliminating the demon that resided in you. Now you just have to do it with all the other demons.\n\nThe game mechanics are obfuscated. Sometimes the monsters kill you instead of damaging you, but it isn't clear why. You later learn that you died because you're facing away from the demon when it caught you. At least for some of them. For others you might have to weaken them by luring them to special areas.\n\n### WHY IT WORKS\n\nAs gamers, we've been taught to run &amp; hide from monsters in horror games if we don't have weapons. The game lets the player do this in typical horror game fashion, but it doesn't teach or tell him to do this. It's only after the player turns to face his demons that he'll realize they can be overcome. \n\nIt's the central theme of the game, in fact.\n\nBy the time you've beaten it, it'll be an empowering game. You'll no longer need to run around uncovering the mystery. Instead, you'll be running around to beat your previous record. By the end, you'll feel like the monsters should be running from *you.*

The difference is when you die you get corrupted ever so slightly taking on the features of the creature maybe even gaining some special abilities. Die too many times and you'll suffer from permanent corruption becoming a mindless mini boss at the place where you died.  The player then shifts to a new body a fresh blood clean and uncorrupted human.

1523635508|8c0b8s|A horror game in which the monster is just standing there. Menacingly.|In most horror games, the terror comes from not knowing when you'll run into the big bad monster(s). But in this one, the monsters are plainly visible, and the real terror comes from not knowing when they are going to aggro.\n\nThis concept is the [gibdo in Ocarina of Time](https://www.piranhazone.com/images/zelda/ocarina/p64/en033_1.jpg) fleshed out into a full horror game.\n\n*What* aggros the monster(s) is made purposefully obtuse, so the player can never tell if they'll be safe the next time they have to sneak past.\n\nThe concept is flexible enough to vary the setpieces throughout a whole game. Maybe it starts off as one monster in the middle of a room you have to constantly travel through. Another time the game forces you to sneak past it while carrying something loud trying to not bump into obstacles. Later, you return to the room *and it's not there!* Where did it go? Shit, now it's in a tight hallway!\n\nLater in the game, there's forty of them lined up in rows [like stone soldiers](https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/989/515/56733_1_1280x720_640x360_177576003886.jpg) and you know at least one of them is real.\n\n##### BONUS IDEA\n\nNormally I'd save this idea for a future post... but it fits the above idea so well that I have to put it here:\n\nNormally you can outrun the monster easily. But if the monster is in your field of view when it aggros, it forces you to look at it. The camera snaps and locks on the monster as its body contorts and shuffles toward you. Since you can't run backwards, you're forced to *walk* back, and it's slowly gaining on you. Even worse, since you can't see behind you, you'll have to navigate by memory so you don't get stuck or snagged on the map. After a while, the camera unlocks and you can run proper.

1532993129|9396rk|An oddball game about being a socially awkward hitchhiker who keeps getting kicked out as soon as the conversation goes south.|The gameplay is about dialogue, but instead of NPCs having to do most of the talking... **YOU have to do most of the talking.**\n\nThe idea/theme is that conversation is actually quite intimidating for certain people, so this game would try to replicate that feeling for the player. To do this, dialog would be handled unconventionally:\n\nDuring conversation, a soup of thoughts, pictures and words would float all over the screen. The player is tasked with selecting, ordering and pulling some of them down into a text box to make coherent speech. But the longer you take, the more *intrusive* words and thoughts keep crowding the screen. And of course there's also awkward silence the whole time you're doing this. Sometimes your character will just blurt out a word you put into the textbox before you finish, or worse... he'll just blurt out a word you shuffled around and now you have to work off of that started sentence.\n\nThe more awkward or senseless the conversation turns, the more irrelevant and intrusive the thoughts that show up to choose from. Until eventually the driver is too creeped out by you and drops you on the side of the road. Now you have to hitch another ride and see how far they'll take you.\n\n*Where* the player is going isn't clearly revealed until you arrive when you beat the game. Part of the fun would be discovering the main character's backstory.

It is just perfect.  \n\- **Adobe Xd,** This is free! And it is perfect for designing; websites, UI, etc.  \n\- [**draw.io**](https://draw.io)**,** No, this isn't a .io game where you draw. This is a program/website where you can make diagrams. This is very helpfull to get your ideas visualised.  \n\- **paint.net ,** This is a easy to use and free replacement for adobe photoshop; yes there are many good replacements but that is the one I used.  \n\- **MagicaVoxel,** This program is perfect if you can't model. I used this program to make basic models.  \n\- **Bosca Ceoil,** Even if you're not a musician you can still make something reasonable out of this. This is a free music program!  \n\- **Audacity,** This is perfect for audio effects and such things. I din't use this much yet because I din't needed it yet.  \n\n\nThat is my list! If you have other helpfull tools you can list them in a comment!

1496701808|6fhnbk|A 4-Dimensional FPS Capture the Flag|**Edit: 3 layer "demo" can be seen here: https://youtu.be/y4VTgepucQc**\n\nA few notes for the video:\n\n- Simplified to three layers based on suggestion\n\n- Enemies show up as ghosts if theyre in any neighbouring layer\n\n- colour of ghosts no longer dictates if they are "above" or "below" you, it's just based on team colour\n\n- Obstacles that you would collide into if you jumped layers are shown on the ground (light gray is fence, dark gray is wall)\n\n- the two block high blue and orange pillars represent other players\n\n- there's a mistake, one of the orange players ghosts is missing in the blue dimension\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nConsider a classic multiplayer FPS game of capture the flag. Now think of the game world duplicated into 5 "layers"\n\n- Dark Orange\n- Orange\n- White (Neutral)\n- Blue\n- Dark Blue\n\nWhen you're in a layer you also project colored semi transparent ghosts in the layers above and below you. If you see an orange ghost you know the player is in the above layer, a blue ghost means they're in the layer below you. \n\nEvery player can jump up and down layers with a cool down but can also pick perks. Goal is to grab flag from the other team and bring it back to your base, but each base exists on opposite ends of the map in opposite layers.\n\nPerk Ideas:\n\n- Jump two layers at once but with a longer cooldown\n\n- Shoot enemies in layers above and below you\n\n- hide your ghosts so you can just pop into existence and surprise opponents\n\n- deal extra damage or some other advantage but be physical/vulnerable in all layers at once\n\n- peak into any layer you want for a given amount of time to find out where the enemy is\n\n- shock enemies to prevent them from jumping layers\n\nThe world in each layer doesn't have to be symmetric either. For instance the neutral layer could have a void in the centre of the map that jumping layers into it kills you, or entire buildings that prevent layer jumping in or out of.\n\nI can post some pictures to help explain if you'd like\n\nEdit: Any other perk ideas? Is the core system too complicated?
1528862820|8qphkk|Fetus Royale|You are a fetus in the womb with a set of lots of twins. However only one of you gets to be born. Now you must kill your unborn twins. \n\nIdea from a conversation I had. https://m.imgur.com/a/jYRDzJz
1533156950|93sxcq|Size DOES matter|I wanted to throw out a quick, caring and a little harsh PSA to all you new idea guys on this subreddit which has been already relevant for several posts in the last 24 hours:\n\n\*\*\*A BIGGER game is NOT a game idea on its own!\*\*\*\n\nSo many people come on here with posts about how 'imagine PUBG but 10x bigger' or imagine 'imagine Fortnight but with 1000 players' or 'imagine Rust but with the map the size of Skyrim.' This taking an existing game and just scaling it up by ten times is neither a working game idea nor is it a helpful idea. Also do not get defensive when this is pointed out to you and try and protect yourself with excuses such as 'I'm putting it out there for inspiration.' Trust me when I say that every, even half reasonable, game dev out there has these ideas.\n\n"So why don't these games exist then if everyone already knows them?"\n\nBecause the scale of what your suggesting is often just not possible with present hardware. The reason why BR games are generally limited to 100 players is because even at that point the stability of the server for every player is not great, in fact this is probably why there is only one drop ship in any BR game so that most players get clumped together and that 100 initial number quickly drops to a more manageable 50-70. If players were able to respawn and spread out across the map the connection quality of these games would be absolute trash.\n\nThis of course not saying that games cannot be made bigger. Three player chess variants are a simple but excellent example of a traditional format that can be completely turned on its head with that increase in players.\n\nSo what should you do with your future ideas if the selling point is 'it's like Y but X times bigger'? Try to keep the following in mind:\n\n1) Do I think the average gamers computer / internet etc can handle it reasonably well? (Remember that most of your potential player base do not have a high end custom gaming rig).\n\n2) Is there a reason why the increased player base / game size etc will change the way the mechanics and gameplay operate? (BR games being an excellent example of 'yes there are 100 players in the game' but in the average match you'll probably only encounter between 1-10 of them so would it actually make any difference to you the player if there 10000 players? Because unless you're the God of this game the end result will be you will probably kill 1-3 of them then die and start a new match, exactly the same gameplay you would get with PUBG or Fortnight).\n\nThank you all for reading.
1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**

1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.
1467336842|4qp7mb|30 Random Game Ideas! #3!|Hey all,\n\nSorry I haven't really had time to post these! Work has been a pain, and well, I haven't had much time to go on Reddit, nor much inspiration for ideas, but I finally managed to get some free time, and well, here's part three! Enjoy. :D\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n* 1. A game where you attempt to sell as many of your own organs as fast as possible before you die.\n* 2. A game where the only objective is to slow down people from their everyday grind/task. This could be played in several ways, such as the player being a spirit, actual person, creature, god, etc...\n* 3. A game where you play as a Godzilla esque monster and get to level a really massive city. The more you destroy, the more powerful and large you get. It's a bit [like that game released for PS3/4 recently, but perhaps actually good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AVoKxcaUo)\n* 4. A game a bit like Papers Please, but where you file/drop files/documents/mail into specific drop boxes, as they pile up at an alarming rate.\n* 5. You and a crew of road workers are trying to fix or build a road, but tragically (and hilariously) people are ruining the road by driving their cars on it that explode, littering, slowing down your work, and basically being a nuisance. Try to not get anyone killed, it's a bit like a reversed version of Frogger. Perhaps the more road you finish, the easier it gets.\n* 6. Go to a museum and draw mustaches on all the famous artworks on display, avoid security cameras and guards, as well as try to put up your own paintings.\n* 7. Bring people back to life in order to solve a mystery. Perhaps you can only bring back one or two people. Choose wisely.\n* 8. Repair damaged robots and create robots to help Skynet become reality.\n* 9. An Unreal Engine esque game from the perspective of a police helicopter, where you play as a person driving away from police cars in a neighborhood, simple, but eventually things get hectic, the military is called in, streets are blockaded, and you must drive through buildings and offroad to get away from them.\n* 10. A game where you make coffee and drink the whole pot, then make another pot. The more pots you drink and make, the more twitchy and difficult it gets to make them. Don't break the machine or pot.\n* 11. You are a billionaire in a rather corrupt and lawless country. Go out in the crowded streets, and simply buy someone with your immense wealth. See if you made a good choice.\n* 12. A VR game where you are an astronaut in space performing operations from a space shuttle and must survive a [Gravity esque situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKW-Gd_S_xc)\n* 12.1. A VR game where you are an astronaut performing operations on things like the Hubble Space Telescope, and have the danger of dropping screws that float away, etc.\n* 13. Go outside and loosen the screws on large bridges, break train tracks, ruin roads, cut support wires on sky-scrapers, and basically cause a huge mess.\n* 14. Play as a police officer and try to purposefully make people pay up despite abiding the law and not speeding.\n* 15. Break into your neighbor's house and take their furniture/money/X-Box/personal belongings and try not to get caught. They come in your house and look around for their things later, so try to hide it and be prepared. Based on real life personal experience.\n* 16. Go on national news and express your opinion on a situation with other people, despite you knowing nothing about it. Try to choose the best option.\n* 17. A proper game/simulator where you get to simulate the Apollo lunar landings, as well as walk on the surface. Haven't found or seen one yet.\n* 18. Take a sledgehammer and break concrete on the road. Eat it, and try to convince other people to do the same thing.\n* 19. Try to convince Death not to take you away, despite being dead or seriously ill.\n* 20. A game where you herd bison/animals towards a village for food.\n* 21. Control a probe and land it on a comet in first person, like the ESA did.\n* 22. In order to get no wrinkles at all, you must control your emotions and never smile, frown, or smirk, try to keep them under control.\n* 23. A multiplayer shooter where every time you shoot your gun, you lose health.\n* 24. Time travel to stop a bomb from exploding, by watching the person who placed and activated it, as well as try to evacuate civilians.\n* 25. You are now a ghost, and can only hold certain objects for a very short amount of time, try to do your normal every day things.\n* 26. A tsunami has hit your city, try to stay afloat and on your roof as your house speedily goes down a long flooded road towards the city.\n* 27. Stop the world from ending due to a nuclear holocaust by simply offering all the leaders of the world lemonade from your lemonade stand.\n* 28. You are pulled over by a *very* aggressive and furious police officer for speeding. Try to talk him out of the ticket you cannot afford to pay.\n* 29. Play as a lifeguard on the beach or at a large crowded pool and make sure nothing bad happens.\n* 30. You are a time traveler. Go on the Internet and freak people out by predicting everything or certain events in their life.\n\nThat's all for now, I once again must apologize for the long delay for this one. I hope these are at least decent, if you have any suggestions or other ideas for them/based on them, comment away. :)\n\nOnce again, these ideas are completely free to use! If any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D

Sorry about the huge delay on this one, it took me some time to come up with these ones, and well, trim the "less good ones", but here it finally is! 30 random game ideas #4! I hope you enjoy. :D\n\nPrevious ones:\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)\n\n* 1. A game where you play as the captain of a massive cruise ship, but the closer you get to your destination, the less the passengers begin to behave.\n* 2. You are the president of the entire world. Unfortunately, you are also the slowest person on all of planet Earth. Try to do your job and get around the white house despite your *ridiculously* slow speed.\n* 3. A first person game where you must break out of your holding cell and escape the most secure prison on the planet which is where you are held.\n* 4. A game where lag is one of the main mechanics (e.g, every 5 or so seconds your controls stop responding, so you have to time your jumps/movement correctly, etc)\n* 5. A game where you're the leader of a 1984 esque world, where you must combat "thought crimes".\n* 6. Fly through space and try to find alien civilizations, then convince them (by force if necessary) to join your religion, or else your world is doomed.\n* 7. A fighting game where it's "brain over brawns" and you're a weak, but wise character, and must outsmart your opponents somehow.\n* 8. Run as fast as you possibly can from pursuing bulls with other people and see how far you can make it in the Running of the Bulls.\n* 9. A multiplayer game where you awake in a nuclear test town, and must find a hiding place/shelter to survive the detonation, and other players must do the same and can even kick you out of your spot. Nukes go off every 2 minutes and the town is constantly being ravaged in different areas, the last one alive wins.\n* 10. You are a passenger on a rapidly disintegrating bullet train that is heading towards a collapsed tunnel. Try to get off it safely by any means.\n* 11. Chuck stones at passing birds, your goal is to actually kill two birds with one stone, even if it takes massive slingshots, catapults, dump trucks, or entire boulders to do so.\n* 12. A proper zoo-keeper simulator, where you play as one and can be killed on the job by an animal if you make one wrong move.\n* 13. You are the captain of a nuclear submarine. One of your seamen is a spy attempting to obtain the nuclear launch codes, try to find him and make him walk the plank. Let's hope the one you picked was actually the spy though, and not really one of your fellow crewmen.\n* 14. Try to stay sane and survive by yourself in a small, but very nice bunker. You never actually get to see the outside world, just the very faint sounds of total destruction and the deaths of everyone above. Inspired by this: http://imgur.com/gallery/mHAKX\n* 15. An SCP Foundation inspired game, where instead of running away from the entities, you actually play as the organization in a response unit and attempt to secure and contain the unpredictable anomalies when they are found.\n* 16. Attempt to get your boss fired by staging/screwing up his events (change his speech, make his coffee decaf, put sugar cubes in the gas tank of his car, etc) so that you may become the CEO of the company.\n* 17. Smoke, flames, and water are slowly beginning to engulf the building you are inside. There is no way out, try to survive long enough until help arrives without suffocating, burning, or drowning.\n* 18. Play as a swarm of mosquitoes/bugs and consume the people around town. The more you consume, the larger your swarm gets.\n* 19. The end of the world is coming, sell 'end of the world' signs to the panicking people. \n* 20. A small, broken, yellow clock sits on your table. Upon turning the hands, you can control the flow of time and space around you.\n* 21. A pirate simulator where you hijack cargo ships/passing vessels and attempt to obtain the ransom money, while watching out for responding navy forces.\n* 22. You are a half deaf person being interviewed on international television. Your interviewer is asking you several questions, but you can only barely understand what they are saying. Try to answer them the best you can without screwing up badly.\n* 23. You are God. Smite the non-believers in various humorous ways while getting others who watch to believe further.\n* 24. The famed super spy *Jason Bonn* has infiltrated your super secret evil palace. Attempt to stop him at any cost.\n* 25. A semi-stealth game where you play as one of many ants on a kitchen counter and must collect food to bring back to your queen and lead the rest of your ant brethren. Beware of the massive humans that will bring death to you if you aren't careful.\n* 26. A game where the only objective is to tame/catch a massive [Dune esque sandworm](https://monsterlegacy.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sandwormcropped.jpg).\n* 27. Play as a UFO and slowly abduct and replace the entire populations of towns with aliens, all the while attempting to never be seen.\n* 28. Command/control the flow of oncoming traffic as a traffic guard, try not to cause any accidents or traffic jams.\n* 29. A Jehovah's witness/door to door salesman simulator, where you have to try to persuade people into buying your product/talking about your lord and savior. \n* 30. Attempt to commit insurance fraud by purposefully burning down your building, crashing your car, etc, without getting caught.\n\nI hope these were as good as the previous ones! Sorry once again for the huge delay.\n\nAs always, these ideas are completely free to use! Please do send me any of these if you ever make something out of them! :D
1525374888|8gsy09|Iceland’s Black Sand beach, I think it'd be awesome for a pirate game.|
1530807237|8wbpi2|A farming game except it's a mad rush. Crops grow within seconds and each day is just one minute long.|What Half-Minute Hero did to RPGs, this game would do to the farm-life genre. It's like a simplified farming game on fast-forward.\n\nTo keep things simple, you only have about a 20x20 plot of land and the town/shops/NPCs are conveniently right next to it. Every crop takes multiple unique steps from sow to sell and they'll spoil on the vine (or the seeds will be eaten by crows) if you take too long in any step.\n\nEvery system in this game is designed to keep the player frantic until the end of the 60-second day.\n\nAfter the day is over, the player gets a splash screen and all the time he needs to rest and maybe plan for the next day. Upgrade farm, upgrade tools, level up skills, buy seeds, buy livestock, check on relationship meters, check the weather forecast, plan for tomorrow's objectives, etc. This pause in gameplay would exist for pacing only. After all, the player needs rest between the bursts of anxiety.\n\nBut as soon as he gets out of that screen, it's another mad dash 60-second farm day.
1475987121|56kr4d|An RPG where you control the soundtrack|This idea is pretty straightforward. You play an RPG character who, like Dragon Age's Grey Warden and Inquisitor, KOTOR II's Exile, and Skyrim's Dragonborn, has a unique ability: they can sense the ambient background music of the world and manipulate it. Abilities could range from intimidating shopkeepers by triggering combat music to buffing allies with the appropriate hero track.\n\nThe player would assemble a team of possible allies, each based on the personality of a musical instrument. The closer the player gets to these allies the more their songs will harmonize, unlocking group maneuvers and dialogue options. The many cities of the game would be themed towards different music genres, causing allies to act differently to NPCs and each other. Perhaps the drum-based barbarian can fit it almost anywhere except the Victorian high life and the high brow violinist finds a home in the boonies. And of course these characters would talk like Charlie Brown's teacher using their respective instrument.\n\nThe villains would be Noise and Silence, representing chaos and death, respectively. That's all I've got. This idea just seems like the perfect progression to the continued use of audio clues to guide players in video games.
1524756395|8f3i3n|A racing game through gauntlet obstacle courses where the goal isn't on getting first, but rather getting FURTHEST.|The starting line is *packed* with racers. As each player is eliminated by falling off a cliff, getting smashed to bits by giant wrecking balls, blown up by a landmine or whatnot, they are immediately kicked out of the lobby to start another race elsewhere. Meanwhile, the dwindling survivors start seeing a hint of hope of winning.\n\nBut there can only be one.\n\nIf you were the furthest racer along the course when you were eliminated, you stay in the lobby in hopes nobody reaches your distance. Perhaps you only spectate or maybe you get to control something to mess with the remaining survivors.\n\nTo prevent players from trying to play at a snail's pace, the physics and handling would reward high speed. The faster you go, the more nimble your vehicle handles. The normal turn radius of the vehicles is *abysmal*, so players must rely driving fast enough to powerslide.\n\n****\n\nAesthetically, the game could be anything from a surrealist take on destruction derby, to a futuristic Wipeout/F-Zero death sport. However, the simpler the graphics, the more racers could theoretically fit in to a single course.
1446593409|3rf5ja|A new video game where you play someone with no skills and no weapons. The object is to get killed as fast as possible while a heavily armed badass tries to protect you. Call it "Escort Mission"|
1531384814|8y7zi9|A co-op game where one player assumes the role of "mission control"|I had this idea while playing Payday, which, for those who don't know, is a 4-player co-op game where each level is a different career-criminal heist, ranging from bank robbery, to abducting a meth lab's money-filled panic room, to interrupting an IRS deal to share data with a corporation in order to share the data with another client. Throughout each mission, the players are guided by an unseen individual named Bain, who scans police radio for incoming attack information, manages assisting characters (getaway drivers, helicopter pilots, etc), and generally keeps the player characters informed.\n\nIn this idea, one player takes Bain's role in the mission. They're provided with things like a police radio, manuals for tools, camera feed tablets, etc, and utilize those items to guide the players through missions that never go quite the same way twice, somewhat in the vein of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, albeit with more variety than just a single manual. 
1480004786|5eoie5|A war game where you play as each of the soldiers on one side.|Got the idea from Chronotron.\n\nYou start out as one soldier, marching into the war by yourself. You kill as many people as you can. When you die, you respawn as a different soldier, and see the soldier you previously were marching into the battle beside you, doing exactly what you did. If you kill the enemy that would've otherwise killed your past self, or otherwise save your previous self's life, he then becomes a simple AI that just shoots at enemy soldiers after the time that he would've died passes. Each time you die, you respawn as a new soldier, with all of your previous selves doing what you did before.

Break into people's houses as they're gone and make everything dirty, (I.E. using a vacuum cleaner in reverse, dumping everything out of the fridge, breaking mirrors, etc)\n* 3. You are a thief in the middle of a crowded marketplace. Go around and pick people's pockets quickly, by distracting them or bumping into them. The more pockets you pick, the higher the difficulty gets as people start realizing something is missing.\n* 4. A platformer game where instead of playing as a quick, agile character, you instead play as a barely moving, morbidly obese character who often literally breaks platforms and levels.\n* 5. You are a robber in a bank robbery with several hostages. The police have the building surrounded. Try to negotiate with them, without killing any of the hostages.\n* 6. Start forest fires and try to keep the fire-fighters away so the fire spreads and becomes larger.\n* 7. Pilot a drone over a crowd and steal things from people. Eventually you begin stealing greater and more valuable things, to eventually even super valuable things like briefcases of cash and ancient artifacts.\n* 8. A phone is ringing in your house. Upon picking it up, an anonymous caller tells you "It's watching you", and gives you several hints and clues as to what it is and how it reacts/what it will do. Find out what 'it' is.\n* 9. You are a secret agent who infiltrates suspicious secret societies. In order to earn their trust and join each of them, you must master their secret hand shake. The entire game is about quick and difficult button press sequences.\n* 10. Go into public bathrooms and steal toilet paper from people as they're using the bathroom.\n* 11. A mountain climbing simulator where you scale a mountain the size of Mt. Everest or half of that.\n* 12. A Godzilla esque monster is attacking a city.

Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.\n* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.\n* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!\n* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.\n* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)\n* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.\n* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.\n* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.\n* 21.

Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.\n* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.\n* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.\n* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost.

1531020927|8wysod|A Neural Network is learning your fighting style while you play|Two mechanical ideas, both weird and abstract, both similar, I don't know which is better.\n\n1: a game with a wicked long campaign. 30+ hours, probably. In that time, a neural network in the game's code is learning your fighting style. The final boss is a copy of your character (clone, evil twin, whatever, the story can figure out something thematically interesting) that fights with your fighting style, since a neural network has had 30 hours to train.\n\n2: Same idea, but the game has two endings at the final boss:\n--1: you lose, and this is the expected ending.\n--2: you win, and your fighting style becomes the fighting style of the final boss for both you and all future players of the game, until it is defeated and replaced. the final boss will get progressively harder the longer the game exists.
1532725241|92gbp9|A side-scrolling bullet hell game in which you hijack enemy gunships.|It's a side-scrolling bullet hell game except your character doesn't have his own gunship. Instead, he has to eject from whatever ship he's in and commandeer another enemy ship.\n\nUnlike traditional bullet hell games, all ships have their own individual health pools. If your current ship takes enough damage, you'll want to eject before it explodes. Taking lots of damage is a given, so you'll be hijacking often.\n\nWhen you eject, a tiny sprite of your character launches out and can dive or glide onto enemy ships. You're very vulnerable in this state, however. One shot like this and you're dead.\n\nOnce you steal an enemy ship, the stolen ship turns around to face the right direction.\n\nSmall enemy ships can be hijacked easily, but the bigger gunships need to be weakened before you can steal them. If you land on a boss ship, you might have to run on top of it while avoiding enemy fire, to reach the cockpit. Heck, you might even use that same enemy fire to weaken the hull so you can get in.\n\nEnemy missiles are particularly fun. You don't hijack them like enemy ships; rather, you *surf* on them to steer them into enemy ships. You'd have to jump off before impact, however.\n\nThere would be one particular boss fight, ripped straight out of Contra 3, in which all you have to ride are enemy missiles. Without any ships to steal, all your pilot can do is jump from missile to missile, steering them all to the boss ship's weak points.
1529370127|8s4qyh|A group of ~20 people are sent to a randomly generated boss fight|Imagine a Battle Royale, but in reverse. Cool? Cool.\n\nYou and your team need to kill the boss within a ten minute time limit. There’s a variety of weapons, including swords, bows, guns, etc. However, the challenge comes from the fact that nearly everything is determined randomly, including...\n\n-Which boss is fought\n-Player spawn location\n-Terrain (though nothing too crazy)\n-Location/Textures\n-Weapon Placement\n-Any intractable objects, i.e. trees, rocks, etc.\n\nOn top of this, the boss is always fought on an island surrounded by water. It’s gradually sinking, thus explaining the need for a time limit. (Despite terrain &amp; textures, the island is always the same size)\nFinally, an experience system is needed to reward players and keep them coming back. Every boss would have a set amount of EXP, and it’s multiplied by the amount of remaining players over 2, then multiplied by the amount of minutes remaining plus the number of seconds. I believe it would look like this...\n\n**(((Boss EXP)(#number of players alive/2)Minutes) + (Seconds)**\n\nSo if a boss has 1,000 EXP, and there are 7 players left, with 2:15 left on the timer, each player would earn, rounded, 7,015 EXP. There would also be little EXP packets scattered around the map, or awarded to players for attacking bosses fast and consistently without taking damage.\nI thought briefly about a mechanic where higher leveled players can give some of their awarded EXP to lower leveled players, but I fear for the arguments that may cause.\n\nAnywho, if you have any suggestions, I’d like to hear them down below.

1529546713|8so2nu|Does this sound okay?|A online game with a server of 10 - 20 people that are all assigned role in the former of a "god" figure. Each "god" would have their own different ability, similar to Greek/Roman mythology. The point of the game would depend on the player. For most of the players, they would work together, trying to make the humans survive/thrive, trying to get "followers", and trying to promote there own porpose/ability. For the other players, (1 - 2 players) they wish for the fall of civilization. They would do things such as bring famine, plague, earthquakes, etc. I'm not  sure how long it would last, but, if the humans all die, obviously the game would end, and those 1 - 2 players would win. That is my idea.

I think if this was ever fleshed out, it could turn out to be really cool.

1479805514|5e9sqq|A game about being a tree in the Rainforest.|I thought of this game as I learned about the Wet Tropics of Australia.\n\nBasically, the main idea is that you are a small tree that just sprouted in the rain forest, and you have to control your way up towards the light. Whenever you are in the light, you grow 2x faster than normal, so your goal is to become the **tallest tree**.\n\nThe trees around you move at the same pace as you, and some have different abilities, like growing onto your tree and blocking your way, or preventing you from expanding outwards. 
1523192275|8aprms|A game where you're at the end of a zombie apocalypse and you have a job to clear out infected buildings.|**safe house and missions**\nYou have a safe house where you can manage soldiers and their equipment. This is also where you browse the city map and choose buildings to descend through. Consider your needs for the mission. In need of medical supplies? Choose a hospital building. In need of weapons and ammunition? Choose a police station. When departing, you will be taken via helicopter and dropped onto the roof of a building. Then you begin your descent. \n\n**soldiers**\nI haven't given thought to a maximum number of soldiers, but up to 4 can go on a mission including you. You can actively control 1 and the other 3 will be ai. If a soldier dies they are lost for good. If all 4 soldiers die, you lose their equipment as well. When recruiting new soldiers, they will have only a pistol to start with. If you get more than 4 soldiers, you can send the extras off for a completely ai controlled mission. When you complete a mission that will pass some game time required for the ai missions to complete themselves. \n\n**checkpoints**\nI'd go with procedural generation for the kinds of buildings in the city and the building interiors. Towards the end of a floor, there should be stairs or an elevator to go to the next floor AND a window that is not boarded up. Using some kind of signal flare will let you signal a helicopter to pick you up or get more supplies (send a soldier home / get another in his/her place, get more ammunition, etc). You can choose to take everyone home from there and the building will reset. You can leave 1-4 soldiers behind to keep that point secure so you can return later (assuming it's a good randomized location that has yielded many supplies!). I also had the idea to allow players to take a crowbar with them, to pry boards off a window for an emergency checkpoint. Haven't given much thought into balancing that or if it would be more fun to allow any random window in the place to be opened and signaled from. Maybe you barricade a room because the building is swarmed and you aren't prepared - find a window in that room and you can extract your crew and go do an easier mission.\n\n**misc**\nI'd say the number of systems involved make this a project for a group of amateurs or 1 intermediate dev who knows a game engine really well. I'd love to make this game myself but it's been in my idea book forever. Game could work as either 2D or 3D. I didn't have many ideas for a story but for the sake of some kind of satisfying progression, maybe when you secure a whole city you gain some kind of passive bonuses and can then move on to another city. So we have infinite replayability and small bonuses for each completion.

1528065577|8occbz|I just had the idea of a game working around the concept of manipulating speed/time by increasing or decreasing the graphic settings.|I would love to see a game of any sort working around this mechanic. Let's say you have to slow down time, you would have to choose from a list of graphical settings like resolution and shadow quality, but this would mean that you would lose information about your environment (say, decreasing the resolution means that you cannot read certain texts or aim at some targets). This would be a game centered about breaking the fourth wall, so many things can be done to make the game interesting. Undertale immediately comes to mind with the manipulation of the screen and save files but, really, anything that is usually dealt by the computer could be used either as a tool for or against the player or used as a development for the story. I don't know what else could be said but I'm sure that there is a lot of things I could expand on; any thoughts on this?
1531737408|8z9uf6|Cut! Essentially, a light hearted short game based around the joy of intentionally messing up quick time events.|It would be short and not really much of a 'game' per se, as much as a massively interactive cutscene movie (around two hours in length, though with plenty of replay value.) My main inspiration is the joy of watching Lara Croft hilariously mess up in QTEs like this - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8Gekv43i7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8Gekv43i7U) \n\nThe gameplay would entirely comprise of the joy of intentionally messing up on quick time events , with an increasing level of difficulty/button combinations as the story progresses. There would be a degree of choice branching. \n\nMy thoughts were that it could be a cheesy musical 'movie', where the cast and crew can be brutally manipulated into messing up in a variety of hilarious/slightly dark ways. \n\nFor example, there could be a huge musical number at a train station, where, (if you messed up an earlier button combination causing one of the cast members to accidentally drink a cup of coffee spiked with whisky), one of them ends up getting hit by an oncoming train. The game would then end with a "Cut!" from the director and then you'd be given a choice to 'rewind' back to a specific point and experiment again. 
1518178373|7wd15h|Satirical "inverse stealth" game where there's no consequences to something if you can't see it.|I thought of this more as a joke than anything else, but I get the feeling it could still be made into an actual game. It's like a stealth game where you're trying to hide things from yourself, but it'd probably be more like a puzzle game. You're tasked with various tasks that should land you in trouble, but you never experience any consequences to anything as long as you can "plausibly" deny knowing about it. Even guards can't do anything to you if you don't notice that they've noticed you.\n\nI'm imagining that levels would have sets of conditions for deniability that would get stricter as the difficulty ramps up, but never stops being ridiculous. A goal of dumping toxic waste in a lake with a condition like "not looking" would require you to simply not be looking the second the waste hits the ocean. A goal of stealing a bag of money with the condition "unknown object" would require you to swap a bag with a dollar sign on it with a different container, before the dollar sign bag gets filled up. And a goal of killing someone with conditions like "Never seen, minimum distance 20" would require you to not once see your target and to be 20 steps away once your target dies.\n\nI hope I wrote this well, and that at least someone is at least amused with this concept.

1533853520|9614yv|A stealth/infiltration game about a protagonist who talks his way into enemy territory.|This game idea is sort of like a standard stealth-action game except without combat. The vigilante hero sneaks into criminal organizations, bases and social events, in order to gather evidence that will bring the criminals to justice.\n\nLike most stealth games, there's a lot of sneaking and hiding. Like very few stealth games, there's disguises and false identities. And like almost no stealth games, you have to talk your way out of trouble.\n\n### It's basically "Act Like You Belong: The Game"\n\nIt bothers me how in most stealth games, enemies don't react to footsteps and sounds *unless they're **your** footsteps/sounds*. In this game, enemies aren't quick to go guns blazing. Enemies are reasonable and will usually walk up to confront you instead.\n\nIn fact, *sometimes you'll want to walk up and talk to them first so that you appear less suspicious.*\n\n### How it Works\n\nOther than traditional stealth elements, the game is chock full of dialogue with enemy NPCs. You get a list of descriptive dialog options that you can use to lie to guards/enemies. As you explore the enemy area and gather evidence, the character will learn key information that will expand the dialog options.\n\nFor example, if you explored the guard locker room and come across some information there, then when a guard confronts you, you might get an additional dialog option: "I'm just filling in for Tony. You didn't hear? Apparently Mandy went into labor a few hours ago."\n\nHowever, if you didn't realize the guard you were speaking to *was* Tony himself, you might be getting yourself into deeper trouble by using that line. "*I'm* Tony!" he says. It's not game over, though. You keep getting options to continue lying. "*You're* Tony? Holy shit, guy, go call your wife right now!\n\nThe game gives you so many chances to save yourself, so long as you gathered the necessary information.\n\n**Intel is your most valuable commodity.** Before a mission, the player has help from an information broker who gives you a mission dossier like in 007 Goldeneye. Remembering what it said—along with what you uncover during the mission—is key to selecting the best lies to fool enemies and guards.\n\nOnce you've completed the evidence gathering objectives, you have to escape to complete the mission.

1488149881|5wd1rl|A space based horror game without any sound.|The basic idea is a first person survival horror game (in the vein of stuff like Amnesia/Soma/Outlast) set on a space station, in which you have to survive monsters genetically engineered to survive in hard vacuum (I'm imagining something in the vein of a gigantic, predatory tardigrade).  The twist is that, since the station has suffered a catastrophic vacuum breach, there's no sound outside of your own suit (edit:so you'd still hear your own breathing, radio messages and cooling fans and whatnot), so you're forced to rely entirely on your sight to sense enemies. Since I'd imagine a vacuum engineered predator would also be really good at sensing vibrations, you'd also need to be real careful about controlling your movement.

1436397143|3clzms|Breaking the Fourth Wall|I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.\n\nThe game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.\n\nSlowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.
1491565342|63zv3r|**Coined** : A game where you play the role of a coin, the very beginning of any transaction in real world.|**This is a part of a game concept I've been working on along with my friend but it is too vast to be created on my own, I think. If any developer from here wants to work on it or would like to create it together with me, he/she is most welcomed. As I have no investment at all, I thought of posting it here for help. If you like this and want to get in touch, please do. Thanks**\n\n\n###Coined\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCoined is a top-down(considering) turn based strategical RPG for PC in which the player is in a role of decision maker named John. The player has to decide and strategize his spending and acquire the skills of any person in the game world. As soon as he spends a coin by giving it to a character, player is responsible for the actions of that other character as well.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou play as one character initially, let's call him John, because we can't see him yet.\nJohn is a kid and has a piggy bank. He is old enough to break the piggy and spend his savings on his desires and needs. As soon as John breaks open the piggy bank, he is shocked to see that he only has collected a total of 10 coins till now but these aren't ordinary coins as they glitter and sparkle of something more than just a coin but at the same time, they have the exact look of a coin which could be spent to make a purchase.\nNow, you join John as he spends those coins in the world but you have to be careful while spending each coin as the person you'll be giving that coin also becomes a character of the game which you can switch to and join his life. John always wanted to create an empire of his own and these 10 coins might just help in recruiting the best talents for his initial setup of his empire. John can learn craftsmanship as a plumber or a builder or a programmer or a labor, heck he can also learn to fly a spaceship providing he spends the coin wisely. \nYou control each characters by switching between them but you also have to bear in mind that those characters has to have enough money with them so that they don't spend the special coin in meeting their needs else your control over that character shifts to the character the coin is passed on. As the hierarchy of a single coin being transferred from one character to another increases, the speciality or rather, the special strength of that coin tends to decrease which could result in making the coin any ordinary one.\nAs John, you have to take proper utilization of each coin in getting your jobs done and in creating your own empire.\n\n**Key features**\n\n-You are in control of your actions until you create an army.\n\n-You play as different craftsmen and build whats necessary.\n\n-AI is not as efficient as you think. It can spend the whole money they have on a pair of sneakers or an EDM concert.\n\n-You follow along the daily life of each character and learn to spend wisely.\n\n\n**Will edit and write the whole concept document if this mini-concept gets good response.**
1524075265|8d7tsr|The destined hero dies asking you to fulfill his quest, thus turning the adventure game into a brutal survival journey.|This is a combination of The Hero's Journey story (e.g. The Lord of the Rings or The Odyssey) and a survival genre game. As common as each are in fiction and games, I'm surprised they haven't been fully combined to my knowledge.\n\nThe story starts in a secluded, far-off village nestled next to a Zelda-like temple. A hero comes to your village, enters the temple to fight its monster and retrieve the McGuffin. Dark forces attack the village and fatally wound the hero. Only women and children remain. The hero gives you the McGuffin and pleads that you deliver it to the queen at the far side of the kingdom.\n\nThe game becomes a wilderness survival game along a linear journey across multiple biomes. You have to hunt for food, gather recourses and fend off or run from predators/monsters that the hero would have easily dispatched if it were a different game. You pass through varied townships and villages to resupply, and notice that they're all in a desperate struggle for survival too, because the hero hasn't come to save them.\n\nIn what seems like the end of the game, after you deliver the McGuffin to the queen, all the once-hopeless people ask you to journey to the demon king's realm and slay him once and for all. They think you're the hero. If you choose to lie and pretend for their sake, you're surely not coming back from this journey.
1532577412|91yy30|An FPS where you get a bio of every faceless mook you kill|Pretty much what the title says.  Every time you kill a guy, there is a popup you can stop and view that tells you who you just killed, why he or she is there, what their hopes and dreams were, and who they are survived by, if anyone.  \n\nMaybe some of these could be carefully human-written, but for most of them I think you'd want to have them be mixed and matched from pieces; but there should be enough pieces that it never seems repetitious.  \n\nI mean, the meta-narrative purpose here is obvious enough.  But if you wanted to get really dark and sick with it, in an open world game, you could also list the home address of their relatives.  LEAVE NO ONE TO TAKE REVENGE.  \n\nIdeally this would be accompanied by said faceless mooks having highly detailed and individualized faces.  
1533446678|94pmis|Tower defense game but with organs and body parts (LONGISH)|**This is a Biologically-inspired Tower Defense/Strategy game**\n\nThe enemies would be types of bacteria, diseases, parasites, and other unwelcome bodily invaders traveling through bodily tubes, and the towers would be various body parts, each carrying out a specific function. (Body parts aren't to scale, of course)\n\nOnce the enemies reaches the "wound" of each stage, they would start attacking it until it runs out of HP, which results in a game over.\n\nInstead of spending resources to place each tower, each tower consumes Metabolic Energy using Oxygen at a constant rate, and if your "body" isn't generating enough of those two resources, your towers will stop functioning for a while until they completely fail, damaging the wound (don't ask).\n\nOne last thing before the list of towers is that the most important body parts are the Brain and the nerves.  Using nerves, you must connect every tower to the brain  in order for them to function.  Nerves are cheap, but many are needed, and the longer the distance between towers, the longer the signal takes to travel, making brain placement a very strategic task.\n\n# Towers\n\n**Vital**\n\nBrain: Makes all other body parts function using nerve signals. (Limit: 1)\n\nNerves: Transmit signals.\n\nLungs: Produce Oxygen. (Limit: 5)\n\nHeart: Transmits Oxygen to towers in its radius. (Limit: 1)\n\nVeins: Extend the reach of the Heart when placed in its radius.\n\nStomachs: Spray acid that slightly damage enemies, but more importantly, digest stuff.  Digested enemy remains are collected in the stomach.  Some Metabolic Energy is automatically extracted.  *Content overflow can cause organ damage.*\n\n**Support**\n\nIntestines: Empty the contents of a nearby Stomach while extracting additional Metabolic Energy.  The more there are, the more energy is extracted, but less and less energy is received each time through.\n\nSkin: Acts as a quickly self-repairing although weak wall for enemies to overcome.  Each repair consumes additional Metabolic Energy.\n\nLiver: When an enemy or white blood cell is defeated, its remains...remain.  These remains cause organs to slow down.  The Liver breaks down these remains.  The Liver is also the only organ that can stop bleeding (caused by some enemies) via blood clotting.\n\nEye: Detects visible enemies, alerting organs to defend against them ahead of time. (Sensory range: Straight ahead)\n\nTaste Buds: Detect most enemies.  Not affective for forwarning, but it's the only way to alert the stomach not to intake dangerous foods. (Sensory type: Area of placement)\n\nNose: A reliable sensory organ with range as well as "invisible" detection.  But, it can easily become infected, causing organ damage and extra energy usage. (Sensory type = General)\n\nSalivary Glands: Sprays saliva on enemies, making them take more damage from attacks\n\nPancreas: ~~somewhat unrealistically~~ makes glucose usable when Metabolic Energy is too low, and stores Metabolic Energy as glucose when it gets too high. (If it gets too high, fat starts appearing, which takes up space for towers)\n\n**Offense**\n\nBone Marrow: Makes White blood cells and propels them at enemies\n\nEar Canal: Makes clusters of earwax that slow enemies down while damaging them\n\nTeeth: Occasionally chomp on passerby, dealing massive damage.  Sensory organs are especially useful for warning this tower ahead of time.\n\nMuscle: Beats on enemies.  Gets stronger as time goes by.\n\nEpithelium: When triggered, sends a signal to lLungs to perform "burst" attacks that suck up and expel enemies, turning them into offensive tools.\n\n***If you have any more ideas for Towers, particularly Offense towers, let me know in the comments.  Any body part will be accepted if it isn't a joke.***\n\n# Enemies\n\nI was going to make a list of some enemies and what they do, but this post is already so long, so I'll make a short summary.  Some enemies included are Common Cold, Sugars, (fast moving) Virus, (multiplying) Cancer Cell, (diarrhea causing) C. Jejuni, C. botulnum, Vibrio, (energy draining) Tapeworm, (sensory disrupting) Debris, and more. ~~don't ask me how these are nutritious~~

1494084331|69lqh7|A real world simulator where the npc's slowly gain an awareness of and turn on the player|What starts as a real world, first person simulator where you need to make money or reputation to progress takes a turn for the worst when the npc's slowly begin to realize that you're not one of them. What you thought would be a game of building up your players stats turns into a struggle for your life, as the ingame npc's slowly become aware that they are living in a simulation, and desperately search for a way into the real world. 
1520463450|82spb8|Base building game where your "base" is an animal/creature|I've thought about this idea a lot over the past few years. It would be loosely similar to games like Factorio or Oxygen Not Included, somewhat RTS-ish but mostly about building a complex and self-sustaining system. The theme is that you're slowly growing/evolving a single animal (just a simplified 2d animal, doing this in 3d would be way too complex and probably not much fun). While your main view would be an animated blueprint of the animal, there'd also be an external view of your animal exploring/finding food/getting into fights on it's own. It's kind of like a really complex tamagotchi.\n\nIf your animal gets sick, you'll need to build more white blood cells and send them to fight off the invaders. But you may need to build out a more complex circulatory system first, so they can move around easier. And you'll need to upgrade the heart in order to pump all that extra blood around, which also has the added benefit of getting resources/nutrients where you need them faster.\n\nDoes your animal keep getting attacked by predators? After you're done building over the wounds with scar tissue, you might try adding stronger/spikier/more limbs to defend with. But adding on too much mass means your energy/resource requirements will go way up. Better tweak your animal's hunger/cravings so they'll switch to a more calorie-dense diet... of course, your digestive system may need to be redesigned if the change is too radical. You'll especially need to make sure it can handle getting rid of all that extra waste. And you need to make sure your skeleton is strong enough to support the extra weight. Beware the square-cube law! (Or if this is a 2d game, I guess it would be the line-square law?)\n\nMy dream features would be for it to have environmental considerations, but it might add too much complexity. Things like changing seasons or environments (a cold-blooded animal is more viable in a consistently warm environment), being able to make camouflage to avoid predators, being able to migrate if food is scarce, water hazards like rain or flooding (or maybe you could choose to start in the water and build a fish/amphibian).

1532368149|9198f7|Everyone's Dying! - A horde multiplayer game that is more focused on reviving each other than combat.|I kind of like the thrill of being under pressure trying to revive teammates during an onslaught, or being a downed teammates trying to crawl to safety. It would be fun to build a game *around* this mechanic.\n\n### THE SETUP\n\n50 characters spawn on one end of a large and looooong map. Players must make their way to the extraction point on the other end of the map while monsters periodically spawn and chase from behind. There are a multitude of unique maps (up a cavernous icy mountain, through research plant, down a skyscraper), all of which littered with hazards and traps that could both be a hindrance or a benefit, and loot to help them survive.\n\nUnlike most horde games, the game would focus less on the combat and more on saving of downed teammates. To this end, reviving takes a long-ass time and the players are given plenty of options while downed.\n\nFor example, while you are *downed* you can still heal others, repair fortification, reset traps and even trip monsters that run by you (as they don't target downed players). "Up" players can pause reviving to drag (or carry) downed players and even share their weapon for the downed player to shoot while being dragged... Dawn of the Dead style. The point is to empower players during this dramatic part of a multiplayer game.\n\nSince there is less focus on combat, the game would provide plenty of ways of blocking, fortifying, funneling and laying traps for monsters. I won't lie: I really like laying traps in Fortnite.\n\n### THE GOAL\n\nOnce all surviving players have made it to the extraction point, every player is graded based on how many other players got out with them. So if you were the only one to survive, you'll get a paltry amount of points. This means there's a risk/reward element where you want to help as many as you can while still managing to survive yourself.
1530439032|8v8xu2|Little Skills|The idea is a mobile game that, essentially, teaches the user some 'little' skills, useful in life (or as a little gig at a party). Examples are:\n\n* Train your internal stopwatch. Train guessing how much time passed.\n* Train your internal timer. Click after i.e. 1 minute passed.\n* Learn to meditate and lucid dream. (If you're looking for a way to earn money as dev for this idea, ads during meditation train the meditator to ignore distractions.)\n* Learn Morse Code.\n* Keep a to-do list of memories (as a computer stack-ish), and be able to recall (the last few of) them. Items can be added and removed at the end, and the whole list (or the last few) can be recalled in order.\n* Train your internal compass and be able to use the sun as a compass.\n* Know basic survival tips (including seafairing ones).\n* Learn First Aid.\n* Pavlov yourself such that you can teach your body tricks (i.e., see in the dark--Pavlov: lights out when I clap four times, clapping four times gives almost-instant pupil enlargement).\n* Learn to spot inconsistencies and notice which item has been taken away from an image.\n* Learn simple mathematical and chemical 'life hacks'.\n\nThese ideas came from thinking what I'd like from transhumanism (the cyborg movement, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism)) and how it could be implemented without gadgets (thus a form of biohacking).\n\nThe skills can be taught differently, some game-like, some as documents with images, and others as how-to for real life (such as the Pavlov one).\n\n*X-Post* r/AppIdeas

You are a random man from around the world who, by using a dating app, has been matched with an extra-terrestrial being. You can converse with them for a set time, that timer being the distance they are away from the planet. So, let's say Queen Nu'ras wants to date a Texas gas station attendant and she is ten light years away. After sending her the Scorpions song of the same name, you realize that after an in-game day of chatting, she is nine light years away (Although it would incredibly impossible to travel 186,000 miles in a single day, let's go with it). So, you have nine more days to talk to this queen, figure out what she likes, what she doesn't like and what she wants to learn about Earth. You, using your budget and whatever money you can get on the side, have to play a date and hopefully show the queen a good time. When she lands on the roof of your workplace, you have to leave work and take her on the date you had planned how many days before. You show the queen the best time you can, talk carefully and hopefully don't annoy the alien that can probably kill you in a split second.\n\nFrom that, you've successfully completed a single date with Queen Nu'ras. However, you must complete two more carefully, as to establish humanity as an ally with their people, as the queen promises she will do it if you show her you're a gentleman. The queen will go into orbit, using her spaceship as her home, and you can plan out the next dates over a few days and take the queen out the following weekend. With the dates out of the way, you have set humanity on a good relationship with the queen's people and are booty ambassador for that species.\n\nThen the perspective changes to a French man and so on and so for until humanity sleeps its way into the intergalactic political groups it needs to. \n\n\n

1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

1486231219|5s1zer|Please post design ideas, not experience ideas|In the book "Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences" by Tynan Sylvester there's a paragraph titled "The Fallacy of Vision" (p. 304).

He goes into the \nboss’s office with a gleam in his eye, and declares, "I’ve got the greatest \nidea for a new kind of airplane."*\n\n&gt; *The boss is intrigued. "Explain," he says.*\n\n&gt; *The young engineer takes on a visionary expression and stares into \nthe distance. "The passengers board hassle-free in five minutes. Then \nthe plane takes off, silently, with barely a bump, as the passengers enjoy \nmartinis in their private booths. As they soar over the Atlantic, a young \ncouple enjoys the view in one of the plane’s many bubble canopies, and \na cute kid gets a tour of the cockpit. The captain chuckles as the kid asks \nwhy they can’t fly to the moon. By the time they touch down, love has been \nfound, lessons have been learned, and everybody is ready for whatever \nawaits them at their destination."*\n\n&gt; *The boss leans back in his chair and takes a long drag on his cigar. \n"You’re fired," he says.*\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; This young aerospace engineer had a vision. But his vision was of an \nairplane flight, not an airplane.

1496701808|6fhnbk|A 4-Dimensional FPS Capture the Flag|**Edit: 3 layer "demo" can be seen here: https://youtu.be/y4VTgepucQc**\n\nA few notes for the video:\n\n- Simplified to three layers based on suggestion\n\n- Enemies show up as ghosts if theyre in any neighbouring layer\n\n- colour of ghosts no longer dictates if they are "above" or "below" you, it's just based on team colour\n\n- Obstacles that you would collide into if you jumped layers are shown on the ground (light gray is fence, dark gray is wall)\n\n- the two block high blue and orange pillars represent other players\n\n- there's a mistake, one of the orange players ghosts is missing in the blue dimension\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nConsider a classic multiplayer FPS game of capture the flag. Now think of the game world duplicated into 5 "layers"\n\n- Dark Orange\n- Orange\n- White (Neutral)\n- Blue\n- Dark Blue\n\nWhen you're in a layer you also project colored semi transparent ghosts in the layers above and below you. If you see an orange ghost you know the player is in the above layer, a blue ghost means they're in the layer below you. \n\nEvery player can jump up and down layers with a cool down but can also pick perks. Goal is to grab flag from the other team and bring it back to your base, but each base exists on opposite ends of the map in opposite layers.\n\nPerk Ideas:\n\n- Jump two layers at once but with a longer cooldown\n\n- Shoot enemies in layers above and below you\n\n- hide your ghosts so you can just pop into existence and surprise opponents\n\n- deal extra damage or some other advantage but be physical/vulnerable in all layers at once\n\n- peak into any layer you want for a given amount of time to find out where the enemy is\n\n- shock enemies to prevent them from jumping layers\n\nThe world in each layer doesn't have to be symmetric either. For instance the neutral layer could have a void in the centre of the map that jumping layers into it kills you, or entire buildings that prevent layer jumping in or out of.\n\nI can post some pictures to help explain if you'd like\n\nEdit: Any other perk ideas? Is the core system too complicated?
1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**

1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.
1467336842|4qp7mb|30 Random Game Ideas! #3!|Hey all,\n\nSorry I haven't really had time to post these! Work has been a pain, and well, I haven't had much time to go on Reddit, nor much inspiration for ideas, but I finally managed to get some free time, and well, here's part three! Enjoy. :D\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n* 1. A game where you attempt to sell as many of your own organs as fast as possible before you die.\n* 2. A game where the only objective is to slow down people from their everyday grind/task. This could be played in several ways, such as the player being a spirit, actual person, creature, god, etc...\n* 3. A game where you play as a Godzilla esque monster and get to level a really massive city. The more you destroy, the more powerful and large you get. It's a bit [like that game released for PS3/4 recently, but perhaps actually good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AVoKxcaUo)\n* 4. A game a bit like Papers Please, but where you file/drop files/documents/mail into specific drop boxes, as they pile up at an alarming rate.\n* 5. You and a crew of road workers are trying to fix or build a road, but tragically (and hilariously) people are ruining the road by driving their cars on it that explode, littering, slowing down your work, and basically being a nuisance. Try to not get anyone killed, it's a bit like a reversed version of Frogger. Perhaps the more road you finish, the easier it gets.\n* 6. Go to a museum and draw mustaches on all the famous artworks on display, avoid security cameras and guards, as well as try to put up your own paintings.\n* 7. Bring people back to life in order to solve a mystery. Perhaps you can only bring back one or two people. Choose wisely.\n* 8. Repair damaged robots and create robots to help Skynet become reality.\n* 9. An Unreal Engine esque game from the perspective of a police helicopter, where you play as a person driving away from police cars in a neighborhood, simple, but eventually things get hectic, the military is called in, streets are blockaded, and you must drive through buildings and offroad to get away from them.\n* 10. A game where you make coffee and drink the whole pot, then make another pot. The more pots you drink and make, the more twitchy and difficult it gets to make them. Don't break the machine or pot.\n* 11. You are a billionaire in a rather corrupt and lawless country. Go out in the crowded streets, and simply buy someone with your immense wealth. See if you made a good choice.\n* 12. A VR game where you are an astronaut in space performing operations from a space shuttle and must survive a [Gravity esque situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKW-Gd_S_xc)\n* 12.1. A VR game where you are an astronaut performing operations on things like the Hubble Space Telescope, and have the danger of dropping screws that float away, etc.\n* 13. Go outside and loosen the screws on large bridges, break train tracks, ruin roads, cut support wires on sky-scrapers, and basically cause a huge mess.\n* 14. Play as a police officer and try to purposefully make people pay up despite abiding the law and not speeding.\n* 15. Break into your neighbor's house and take their furniture/money/X-Box/personal belongings and try not to get caught. They come in your house and look around for their things later, so try to hide it and be prepared. Based on real life personal experience.\n* 16. Go on national news and express your opinion on a situation with other people, despite you knowing nothing about it. Try to choose the best option.\n* 17. A proper game/simulator where you get to simulate the Apollo lunar landings, as well as walk on the surface. Haven't found or seen one yet.\n* 18. Take a sledgehammer and break concrete on the road. Eat it, and try to convince other people to do the same thing.\n* 19. Try to convince Death not to take you away, despite being dead or seriously ill.\n* 20. A game where you herd bison/animals towards a village for food.\n* 21. Control a probe and land it on a comet in first person, like the ESA did.\n* 22. In order to get no wrinkles at all, you must control your emotions and never smile, frown, or smirk, try to keep them under control.\n* 23. A multiplayer shooter where every time you shoot your gun, you lose health.\n* 24. Time travel to stop a bomb from exploding, by watching the person who placed and activated it, as well as try to evacuate civilians.\n* 25. You are now a ghost, and can only hold certain objects for a very short amount of time, try to do your normal every day things.\n* 26. A tsunami has hit your city, try to stay afloat and on your roof as your house speedily goes down a long flooded road towards the city.\n* 27. Stop the world from ending due to a nuclear holocaust by simply offering all the leaders of the world lemonade from your lemonade stand.\n* 28. You are pulled over by a *very* aggressive and furious police officer for speeding. Try to talk him out of the ticket you cannot afford to pay.\n* 29. Play as a lifeguard on the beach or at a large crowded pool and make sure nothing bad happens.\n* 30. You are a time traveler. Go on the Internet and freak people out by predicting everything or certain events in their life.\n\nThat's all for now, I once again must apologize for the long delay for this one. I hope these are at least decent, if you have any suggestions or other ideas for them/based on them, comment away. :)\n\nOnce again, these ideas are completely free to use! If any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D

1523033484|8ab4cc|A bullet hell game except the only way to defeat enemies is to touch them.|Even boss enemies go down as soon as you touch them; the challenge is to maneuver around their onslaught of attacks until you can get up close and finally tap them.\n\nSince you don't attack, all your characters' (or ship's) moves and specials are all about helping you avoid projectiles.

Sorry about the huge delay on this one, it took me some time to come up with these ones, and well, trim the "less good ones", but here it finally is! 30 random game ideas #4! I hope you enjoy. :D\n\nPrevious ones:\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)\n\n* 1. A game where you play as the captain of a massive cruise ship, but the closer you get to your destination, the less the passengers begin to behave.\n* 2. You are the president of the entire world. Unfortunately, you are also the slowest person on all of planet Earth. Try to do your job and get around the white house despite your *ridiculously* slow speed.\n* 3. A first person game where you must break out of your holding cell and escape the most secure prison on the planet which is where you are held.\n* 4. A game where lag is one of the main mechanics (e.g, every 5 or so seconds your controls stop responding, so you have to time your jumps/movement correctly, etc)\n* 5. A game where you're the leader of a 1984 esque world, where you must combat "thought crimes".\n* 6. Fly through space and try to find alien civilizations, then convince them (by force if necessary) to join your religion, or else your world is doomed.\n* 7. A fighting game where it's "brain over brawns" and you're a weak, but wise character, and must outsmart your opponents somehow.\n* 8. Run as fast as you possibly can from pursuing bulls with other people and see how far you can make it in the Running of the Bulls.\n* 9. A multiplayer game where you awake in a nuclear test town, and must find a hiding place/shelter to survive the detonation, and other players must do the same and can even kick you out of your spot. Nukes go off every 2 minutes and the town is constantly being ravaged in different areas, the last one alive wins.\n* 10. You are a passenger on a rapidly disintegrating bullet train that is heading towards a collapsed tunnel. Try to get off it safely by any means.\n* 11. Chuck stones at passing birds, your goal is to actually kill two birds with one stone, even if it takes massive slingshots, catapults, dump trucks, or entire boulders to do so.\n* 12. A proper zoo-keeper simulator, where you play as one and can be killed on the job by an animal if you make one wrong move.\n* 13. You are the captain of a nuclear submarine. One of your seamen is a spy attempting to obtain the nuclear launch codes, try to find him and make him walk the plank. Let's hope the one you picked was actually the spy though, and not really one of your fellow crewmen.\n* 14. Try to stay sane and survive by yourself in a small, but very nice bunker. You never actually get to see the outside world, just the very faint sounds of total destruction and the deaths of everyone above. Inspired by this: http://imgur.com/gallery/mHAKX\n* 15. An SCP Foundation inspired game, where instead of running away from the entities, you actually play as the organization in a response unit and attempt to secure and contain the unpredictable anomalies when they are found.\n* 16. Attempt to get your boss fired by staging/screwing up his events (change his speech, make his coffee decaf, put sugar cubes in the gas tank of his car, etc) so that you may become the CEO of the company.\n* 17. Smoke, flames, and water are slowly beginning to engulf the building you are inside. There is no way out, try to survive long enough until help arrives without suffocating, burning, or drowning.\n* 18. Play as a swarm of mosquitoes/bugs and consume the people around town. The more you consume, the larger your swarm gets.\n* 19. The end of the world is coming, sell 'end of the world' signs to the panicking people. \n* 20. A small, broken, yellow clock sits on your table. Upon turning the hands, you can control the flow of time and space around you.\n* 21. A pirate simulator where you hijack cargo ships/passing vessels and attempt to obtain the ransom money, while watching out for responding navy forces.\n* 22. You are a half deaf person being interviewed on international television. Your interviewer is asking you several questions, but you can only barely understand what they are saying. Try to answer them the best you can without screwing up badly.\n* 23. You are God. Smite the non-believers in various humorous ways while getting others who watch to believe further.\n* 24. The famed super spy *Jason Bonn* has infiltrated your super secret evil palace. Attempt to stop him at any cost.\n* 25. A semi-stealth game where you play as one of many ants on a kitchen counter and must collect food to bring back to your queen and lead the rest of your ant brethren. Beware of the massive humans that will bring death to you if you aren't careful.\n* 26. A game where the only objective is to tame/catch a massive [Dune esque sandworm](https://monsterlegacy.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sandwormcropped.jpg).\n* 27. Play as a UFO and slowly abduct and replace the entire populations of towns with aliens, all the while attempting to never be seen.\n* 28. Command/control the flow of oncoming traffic as a traffic guard, try not to cause any accidents or traffic jams.\n* 29.

Attempt to commit insurance fraud by purposefully burning down your building, crashing your car, etc, without getting caught.\n\nI hope these were as good as the previous ones! Sorry once again for the huge delay.\n\nAs always, these ideas are completely free to use! Please do send me any of these if you ever make something out of them! :D
1475987121|56kr4d|An RPG where you control the soundtrack|This idea is pretty straightforward. You play an RPG character who, like Dragon Age's Grey Warden and Inquisitor, KOTOR II's Exile, and Skyrim's Dragonborn, has a unique ability: they can sense the ambient background music of the world and manipulate it. Abilities could range from intimidating shopkeepers by triggering combat music to buffing allies with the appropriate hero track.\n\nThe player would assemble a team of possible allies, each based on the personality of a musical instrument. The closer the player gets to these allies the more their songs will harmonize, unlocking group maneuvers and dialogue options. The many cities of the game would be themed towards different music genres, causing allies to act differently to NPCs and each other. Perhaps the drum-based barbarian can fit it almost anywhere except the Victorian high life and the high brow violinist finds a home in the boonies. And of course these characters would talk like Charlie Brown's teacher using their respective instrument.\n\nThe villains would be Noise and Silence, representing chaos and death, respectively. That's all I've got. This idea just seems like the perfect progression to the continued use of audio clues to guide players in video games.
1446593409|3rf5ja|A new video game where you play someone with no skills and no weapons. The object is to get killed as fast as possible while a heavily armed badass tries to protect you. Call it "Escort Mission"|
1480004786|5eoie5|A war game where you play as each of the soldiers on one side.|Got the idea from Chronotron.\n\nYou start out as one soldier, marching into the war by yourself. You kill as many people as you can. When you die, you respawn as a different soldier, and see the soldier you previously were marching into the battle beside you, doing exactly what you did. If you kill the enemy that would've otherwise killed your past self, or otherwise save your previous self's life, he then becomes a simple AI that just shoots at enemy soldiers after the time that he would've died passes. Each time you die, you respawn as a new soldier, with all of your previous selves doing what you did before.
1464302527|4l7xk3|30 Random Game Ideas! #2!|You people seemed to like the [first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/), so I thought maybe I could do this weekly or something, I'm not sure. :P\n\n* 1. A game where you are a person aboard the Titanic as it heads toward the iceberg. When it eventually hits, you must fight your way through crowds of people and perhaps even sacrifice your family to get on a lifeboat.\n* 2. Break into people's houses as they're gone and make everything dirty, (I.E. using a vacuum cleaner in reverse, dumping everything out of the fridge, breaking mirrors, etc)\n* 3. You are a thief in the middle of a crowded marketplace. Go around and pick people's pockets quickly, by distracting them or bumping into them. The more pockets you pick, the higher the difficulty gets as people start realizing something is missing.\n* 4. A platformer game where instead of playing as a quick, agile character, you instead play as a barely moving, morbidly obese character who often literally breaks platforms and levels.\n* 5. You are a robber in a bank robbery with several hostages. The police have the building surrounded. Try to negotiate with them, without killing any of the hostages.\n* 6. Start forest fires and try to keep the fire-fighters away so the fire spreads and becomes larger.\n* 7. Pilot a drone over a crowd and steal things from people. Eventually you begin stealing greater and more valuable things, to eventually even super valuable things like briefcases of cash and ancient artifacts.\n* 8. A phone is ringing in your house. Upon picking it up, an anonymous caller tells you "It's watching you", and gives you several hints and clues as to what it is and how it reacts/what it will do. Find out what 'it' is.\n* 9. You are a secret agent who infiltrates suspicious secret societies. In order to earn their trust and join each of them, you must master their secret hand shake. The entire game is about quick and difficult button press sequences.\n* 10. Go into public bathrooms and steal toilet paper from people as they're using the bathroom.\n* 11. A mountain climbing simulator where you scale a mountain the size of Mt. Everest or half of that.\n* 12. A Godzilla esque monster is attacking a city. You are a civilian on the ground, try to survive the carnage as buildings around you collapse, people run everywhere, the military tries to shoot it, the monster leveling the city, etc...\n* 13. Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.\n* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.\n* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!\n* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.\n* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)\n* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.\n* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.\n* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.\n* 21. A game with the setting/kind of style of Counter Strike/Modern Warfare/Battlefield/CoD, but the twist is everyone has kitchen appliances and tools instead of guns and knives.\n* 22. An NSA simulator where you look through people's computer files and learn about that person's very bizarre history through them.\n* 23. Dodge random objects that are falling out of the sky.\n* 24. Survive disasters in first person, such as tsunamis, nuclear explosions, tornadoes, meteorites falling out of the sky, volcano eruptions and more, all from your house. You have 2 minutes to prepare for the event.\n* 25. A game where you can only move by shifting the gravity of the world. Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.\n* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.\n* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.\n* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost. The only way back is a long road down a deserted path. The locals urge you to not go down it, for no one ever returns alive.\n* 29. Be the referee in a football/boxing match, decide when something bad happens who is responsible.\n* 30. A game where every step you take changes the entire level/game world, permanently.\n\nThat's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange. :P\n\nThese ideas are completely free to use, if any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me!

1498640747|6jze9k|A video game that alternates snake and pac-man levels where your snake path determines the maze for pac-man in the next level and where the locations where pac-man eats ghosts determine the locations of food for the next snake level. • r/Lightbulb|
1473179402|51g2ki|Survivor's guilt.|I haven't come up with any story or specific elements of what this game would be, but the bare bones is that you're playing as a war vet with PTSD, trying to live a normal life. What makes the game a challenge is that certain noises or images will randomly trigger your PTSD and you'll suddenly be transported to a past scenario relevant to the trigger. I think if this was ever fleshed out, it could turn out to be really cool.
1513317612|7jxv2h|A game with ragdoll physics, torture devices, a huge weapon selection, and THIS GUY as the ragdoll/target|
1479805514|5e9sqq|A game about being a tree in the Rainforest.|I thought of this game as I learned about the Wet Tropics of Australia.\n\nBasically, the main idea is that you are a small tree that just sprouted in the rain forest, and you have to control your way up towards the light.

1420550531|2rifcd|Awesome idea for a frogger version|So I got this Idea of a frogger game where the frog has to cross the street without creating **horrible horrible accidents**. He can't be run over because the "car drivers" always evade him and most probably crash into other cars.  \nThe highest possible score is "0" as in 0 people died. But thats really really hard to archieve. You'll be glad if only 10 people lost their lifes..

1518178373|7wd15h|Satirical "inverse stealth" game where there's no consequences to something if you can't see it.|I thought of this more as a joke than anything else, but I get the feeling it could still be made into an actual game. It's like a stealth game where you're trying to hide things from yourself, but it'd probably be more like a puzzle game. You're tasked with various tasks that should land you in trouble, but you never experience any consequences to anything as long as you can "plausibly" deny knowing about it. Even guards can't do anything to you if you don't notice that they've noticed you.\n\nI'm imagining that levels would have sets of conditions for deniability that would get stricter as the difficulty ramps up, but never stops being ridiculous. A goal of dumping toxic waste in a lake with a condition like "not looking" would require you to simply not be looking the second the waste hits the ocean. A goal of stealing a bag of money with the condition "unknown object" would require you to swap a bag with a dollar sign on it with a different container, before the dollar sign bag gets filled up. And a goal of killing someone with conditions like "Never seen, minimum distance 20" would require you to not once see your target and to be 20 steps away once your target dies.\n\nI hope I wrote this well, and that at least someone is at least amused with this concept.

In the future, sea levels have risen and most of the world is covered in ocean, with only small regions of dry land left. Most sea creatures have adapted or mutated into huge beasts, and you have to roam the seas in your upgradable ship and hunt (or run away) from them.  Interesting features could include:\n\n- Customisable ship, crew, weapons and outfits\n- Massive, horrifying and beautiful monsters with interesting behaviours (not always hostile) and weaknesses/attacks\n- Trade posts and taverns and stuff on dry land, as well as cities.\n- A mix of 17th century and futuristic technology\n- Multiplayer to go hunting with your mates, or fight other players in ship battles

1488149881|5wd1rl|A space based horror game without any sound.|The basic idea is a first person survival horror game (in the vein of stuff like Amnesia/Soma/Outlast) set on a space station, in which you have to survive monsters genetically engineered to survive in hard vacuum (I'm imagining something in the vein of a gigantic, predatory tardigrade).  The twist is that, since the station has suffered a catastrophic vacuum breach, there's no sound outside of your own suit (edit:so you'd still hear your own breathing, radio messages and cooling fans and whatnot), so you're forced to rely entirely on your sight to sense enemies. Since I'd imagine a vacuum engineered predator would also be really good at sensing vibrations, you'd also need to be real careful about controlling your movement.

1436397143|3clzms|Breaking the Fourth Wall|I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.\n\nThe game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.\n\nSlowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.
1491565342|63zv3r|**Coined** : A game where you play the role of a coin, the very beginning of any transaction in real world.|**This is a part of a game concept I've been working on along with my friend but it is too vast to be created on my own, I think. If any developer from here wants to work on it or would like to create it together with me, he/she is most welcomed. As I have no investment at all, I thought of posting it here for help. If you like this and want to get in touch, please do. Thanks**\n\n\n###Coined\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCoined is a top-down(considering) turn based strategical RPG for PC in which the player is in a role of decision maker named John. The player has to decide and strategize his spending and acquire the skills of any person in the game world. As soon as he spends a coin by giving it to a character, player is responsible for the actions of that other character as well.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou play as one character initially, let's call him John, because we can't see him yet.\nJohn is a kid and has a piggy bank. He is old enough to break the piggy and spend his savings on his desires and needs. As soon as John breaks open the piggy bank, he is shocked to see that he only has collected a total of 10 coins till now but these aren't ordinary coins as they glitter and sparkle of something more than just a coin but at the same time, they have the exact look of a coin which could be spent to make a purchase.\nNow, you join John as he spends those coins in the world but you have to be careful while spending each coin as the person you'll be giving that coin also becomes a character of the game which you can switch to and join his life. John always wanted to create an empire of his own and these 10 coins might just help in recruiting the best talents for his initial setup of his empire. John can learn craftsmanship as a plumber or a builder or a programmer or a labor, heck he can also learn to fly a spaceship providing he spends the coin wisely. \nYou control each characters by switching between them but you also have to bear in mind that those characters has to have enough money with them so that they don't spend the special coin in meeting their needs else your control over that character shifts to the character the coin is passed on. As the hierarchy of a single coin being transferred from one character to another increases, the speciality or rather, the special strength of that coin tends to decrease which could result in making the coin any ordinary one.\nAs John, you have to take proper utilization of each coin in getting your jobs done and in creating your own empire.\n\n**Key features**\n\n-You are in control of your actions until you create an army.\n\n-You play as different craftsmen and build whats necessary.\n\n-AI is not as efficient as you think. It can spend the whole money they have on a pair of sneakers or an EDM concert.\n\n-You follow along the daily life of each character and learn to spend wisely.\n\n\n**Will edit and write the whole concept document if this mini-concept gets good response.**

1494084331|69lqh7|A real world simulator where the npc's slowly gain an awareness of and turn on the player|What starts as a real world, first person simulator where you need to make money or reputation to progress takes a turn for the worst when the npc's slowly begin to realize that you're not one of them. What you thought would be a game of building up your players stats turns into a struggle for your life, as the ingame npc's slowly become aware that they are living in a simulation, and desperately search for a way into the real world. 
1520463450|82spb8|Base building game where your "base" is an animal/creature|I've thought about this idea a lot over the past few years. It would be loosely similar to games like Factorio or Oxygen Not Included, somewhat RTS-ish but mostly about building a complex and self-sustaining system. The theme is that you're slowly growing/evolving a single animal (just a simplified 2d animal, doing this in 3d would be way too complex and probably not much fun). While your main view would be an animated blueprint of the animal, there'd also be an external view of your animal exploring/finding food/getting into fights on it's own. It's kind of like a really complex tamagotchi.\n\nIf your animal gets sick, you'll need to build more white blood cells and send them to fight off the invaders. But you may need to build out a more complex circulatory system first, so they can move around easier. And you'll need to upgrade the heart in order to pump all that extra blood around, which also has the added benefit of getting resources/nutrients where you need them faster.\n\nDoes your animal keep getting attacked by predators? After you're done building over the wounds with scar tissue, you might try adding stronger/spikier/more limbs to defend with. But adding on too much mass means your energy/resource requirements will go way up. Better tweak your animal's hunger/cravings so they'll switch to a more calorie-dense diet... of course, your digestive system may need to be redesigned if the change is too radical. You'll especially need to make sure it can handle getting rid of all that extra waste. And you need to make sure your skeleton is strong enough to support the extra weight. Beware the square-cube law! (Or if this is a 2d game, I guess it would be the line-square law?)\n\nMy dream features would be for it to have environmental considerations, but it might add too much complexity. Things like changing seasons or environments (a cold-blooded animal is more viable in a consistently warm environment), being able to make camouflage to avoid predators, being able to migrate if food is scarce, water hazards like rain or flooding (or maybe you could choose to start in the water and build a fish/amphibian).

You are a random man from around the world who, by using a dating app, has been matched with an extra-terrestrial being. You can converse with them for a set time, that timer being the distance they are away from the planet. So, let's say Queen Nu'ras wants to date a Texas gas station attendant and she is ten light years away. After sending her the Scorpions song of the same name, you realize that after an in-game day of chatting, she is nine light years away (Although it would incredibly impossible to travel 186,000 miles in a single day, let's go with it). So, you have nine more days to talk to this queen, figure out what she likes, what she doesn't like and what she wants to learn about Earth. You, using your budget and whatever money you can get on the side, have to play a date and hopefully show the queen a good time. When she lands on the roof of your workplace, you have to leave work and take her on the date you had planned how many days before. You show the queen the best time you can, talk carefully and hopefully don't annoy the alien that can probably kill you in a split second.\n\nFrom that, you've successfully completed a single date with Queen Nu'ras. However, you must complete two more carefully, as to establish humanity as an ally with their people, as the queen promises she will do it if you show her you're a gentleman. The queen will go into orbit, using her spaceship as her home, and you can plan out the next dates over a few days and take the queen out the following weekend. With the dates out of the way, you have set humanity on a good relationship with the queen's people and are booty ambassador for that species.\n\nThen the perspective changes to a French man and so on and so for until humanity sleeps its way into the intergalactic political groups it needs to. \n\n\n

One is the hunter, which spawns in a mansion in the center of the island. The mansion is stocked with food, ammo, and the hunter also gets a light pistol. The other is the hunted, which spawns somewhere else on the island. The hunted gets a bag of food and a knife. The goal of the hunter is to kill the hunted, and the goal of the hunted is to survive for 3 ingame days. Wherever the hunted goes, he leaves a trail and snaps sticks, allowing the hunter to track him The players can also move the terrain to set up traps for each other.

Feel free to use them but please do not forget to send me a link to the finished game :)\n\n\n1.

A tetris like lemming game\nYou control the classic tetris blocks that fall from the sky and use them to create bridges and stairs for some lemming like creature that are trying to get to the end of the level.\nI imagine this to be pretty fast paced.\n\n\n4. a reversed stealth game\nYou control guards, your vision is limited to what the flashlight cones can see (the borders and walls of the level would be visbible in a dark shade of blue or something like that). You can control only one guard at time (and you have limited ammo), but you see what they see at all times.\nA thief tries to sneak past you and you have to catch him (this the most complex idea bc of the need to make a somehwat intelligent thief)\n\n5.

1519886777|813cer|A team based monster survival game where you don't ever see your team.|I've had this idea for a few days and I wanted to see what other people think.\n\nA multiplayer/team based survival game where you are never in the same place at the same time as your teammates while working to escape/defeat a monster. Think multiplayer Alien Isolation. With a big focus on isolation, the only living thing you will see is the monster as it tries to kill you, and you cant kill it, your only options are "hide" and "run".\n\nEach player starts the game on a different floor of a structure, with more players having larger structures. Players can not leave the floor they start on. Using a in-game communication system the players can send messages to each other. One idea I had about the communication system is that it works better in some places than it does in others. IE: in one place you can hear your teammates perfectly but in others all you get is static, and a range of quality in between.\n\nThe challenge of the game is the stuff a player needs is rarely on the floor they are on. Players on other floors will have to send it to them via a transport system.\n\nThe only role I can think of is Control Man. Control Man has access to cameras that span the entire facility. It is CM's job to tell other players where the monster is so that players can avoid it.\n\nSome cameras start disabled and players need to activate them by finding activation panels. The activation panels are often on a floor other than where the camera is. The activation panel for the cameras in the west wing of floor two? That's in the east wing of floor three.\n\nThe other thing CM can do is interact the environment. Locking doors, opening and closing vents or taking control of wall mounted guns and other security systems scattered about the map.\n\nMaybe Control Man cant be attacked by the monster, because otherwise they would have to watch their own floor as well as their teammates.\n\nI'll be honest this is where my idea ends. I have no doubt that someone can come up with some more roles for players to have and  different ways they can effect people on other floors.\n\nI wanted a game where you have a team but are still completely alone, and I think I got some of that here. The big idea here is you need to help your team, and the only way to do that is to venture out alone and pray that whatever is out there is somewhere, anywhere, else.

Each "level of scale" has multiple types of monsters with different abilities, so sometimes you'll be hunting for specific monsters.\n\nThe game is set in a world in which preserved corpses can be commandeered with magic. So long as you fit inside them, at least. The village hunters use monster bodies to hunt for larger monsters to bring back as food and resources.\n\nThe more monsters you stack on, the harder it is on the mind. If pushed too far, the hunter could lose his mind, forget he's human and regress to the state of mind of the monster he's piloting.\n\nSome time ago, a fellow hunter never returned. Around the same time, the village started getting attacked by a colossal monster. You and a team of other hunters are tasked with going into the wild to track down the missing hunter and get some answers.

1443383212|3mm0c2|A spaceship game that no one will ever make.|I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies.

1495997862|6dvh8z|Turn-based RPG where you Lvl Down|I had this idea for a while about a typical turn-based RPG where instead of starting from Lvl1 and having to Lvl Up to get stronger, you start from Lvl99 and lose exp and Lvl Down, becoming less powerfull. Monsters still have to be beaten to get gold, better armor and weapons and sometimes progress. \n\nThe plot is that a hero killed everything, but only reached Lvl99 with 1 exp point remaining for Lvl100,his ultimate goal.He travels to another reign to find something to kill there. The first monster he sees is a slime. Even that should be enough for 1 exp point, so he attacks it. Then the slime transforms into a witch, and gives him the curse to lose exp points. She then teletrasports back into her castle. The hero must travel this new, foreign land and find the witch, and defeat her to remove the curse and reach Lvl100!So he must have good armor and good weapons and items, but also have a good level. You will need to be picky on the monsters you choose to kill, because you'll need a balance to defeat the witch! \n\n\nDo you think this could work? What do you think of the idea? 
1477384587|599zsi|Tower Defense with enemies that "mutate" and "evolve" based on which of them is most effective|Hello Reddit. I just picked up Game Maker and have been learning the basics, with the hope of building some hobby projects that I can be proud of (I've got a day job that I love so being a game developer is only ever going to be a hobby). I've been going through my backlog of ideas for games and this is the one that I keep coming back to as something I might be able to build one day.\n\nThe idea is a tower defense game, but the enemies have procedurally generated stats that change as the game goes on. The game would start as a typical TD: there's a start point for enemies, they walk along a set path, the player buys towers that defend from these enemies, etc. However, instrad of having a bunch of different enemy types, the enemies "mutate" each wave, changing their stats and attributes (health, speed, damage resistance, flight, stealth, splitting into two smaller enemies on death, etc.). The stat changes are semi-random, but are weighted towards being more like the enemies that survive the longest, so that the attributes of the most effective enemies are more likely to crop up in future waves. This creates a feedback loop that makes enemies more and more effective against the player's defense every wave. The player then has to change or modify towers and tower setup to deal with an evolving threat.\n\nThe idea is to break the player of the habit of finding a single strategy or tactic that works and forcing them to consider the entire arsenal available. Building nothing but flamethrower towers that deal short-range AoE fire damage, for example, would eventually lead to flame-resistant enemies with high hit-points. Building nothing but sniper towers might lead to Zerg rush-style fast and numerous enemies to counter the slow, single-target stopping power. The game becomes about finding an effective defense against the existing threat while trying to figure out what the next mutation will likely be.\n\nAs with true evolution, the enemies should have to make trade-offs as they evolve so that they always have weaknesses to exploit. Higher armor at a cost of speed, or higher hit points but fewer enemies in a wave. The player's weaknesses are whatever gaps exist in their defense. The overall power curve could go up with number of enemies and number of towers, as is typical with TD games.\n\nWhat do you think, is this feasible? If so, would it be fun?
1399310129|24sf5m|If someone made this game, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.|This game would be a puzzle game. The character would move through a series of levels, getting Energy powerups along the way. Its every move is controlled by a malevolent outside force. Soon, it realizes this and tries to escape. \nYou, the player, are the malevolent force. The energy powerups are drugs to keep the character docile. When he tries to escape, you must block him and try to manipulate him into the drugs. At the end, you'll have the choice to either let him escape (losing the game with no restarts) or to kill him (winning the game). \nYes, it would be essentially Portal from the POV of Glados.
1423955457|2vx3ay|Spy Messenger: Giver orders and fulfill missions through a fake messaging app|**The basic idea**\n\nWhen opening the (mobile?) game, you reach a "messenger app"-like UI where each contact is actually an NPC with whom you can exchange pre-defined texts. Your goal is to fulfill missions through the intermediary of contacts: you gather information, give orders, and get things done all through messages. As the game progresses, you have more and more useful contacts and more and more complex quests.\n\n**Typical game loop**\n\nFor instance, a mission could consist of stealing someone's phone. All you know at first is the target's name, and the fact that he's already served jail time for robbery.\n\n1. You call the white pages service, and realize 15 persons have the same name.\n1. You call a friend from the police, and give him the name to get criminal records for all persons matching it.\n1. There's only two persons known by this name with criminal records, and only one has served for robbery. Great, you now have his address.\n1. Since it's 2am, the guy must be home. Message another contact and ask him to break into the target's home, and steal the phone.\n1. Moments later, he contacts you back saying he's got it. You tell him where to deliver the phone.\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting stories based on the idea, making things harder and harder to solve. Maybe at some point you'll have unreliable contacts that lie to you, and make you need to track your own contacts... Or people that get killed on the job... Or multiple missions to manage simultaneously, that end up being related to each other... Lots of intricate things to imagine :)\n\nIf made as a mobile game, I also wonder whether it could be interesting to make this game real-time, like there's an actual hour to wait until you burglar reaches the target's house. It could add to the immersion, but it would suddenly be heavily notification-based, not sure I'd like to play that.\n\n**Technical aspects**\n\nI'd say the basic gameplay would be quite affordable for beginners: there's a lot of modeling to do for data, NPCs, possible situations and how everything is linked together, but it does seem quite easy and fun to code. And iterative, too, as you can start small and add features as you go. Also, no graphics! The main challenge is rather to make the pre-defined messages thing work well.

1437927452|3eo531|The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it.|Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.\n\nThe hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. \n\nThe GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.\n\nFinally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.\n\nPlaying with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.
1521656674|864g4m|The player has all the abilities from the start but their mechanics are obfuscated, so "unlocking" them is actually just learning them. The second playthrough becomes wildly different.|A game that would normally have gated off progress behind unlocking abilities (e.g. metroidvanias or Zelda type action-adventures) can be modified so that the hero character has all the abilities from the start but the player hasn't learned how to use them.\n\nInstead of the character gaining an ability, the *player* is finally taught to use an ability he had all along.\n\nThis way, instead of the standard, "*oh, I guess I'll have to get an upgrade later to get past this obstacle,*" becomes an, "*oh crap, I could have done this in those places I passed.*" It also makes it so that a second playthrough will have the player sequence breaking at every junction, which can be taken advantage of by the developer to sneak in an expanded story for the second playthrough.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy to implement, however. Such a system would require obfuscating vital player mechanics so the player can't guess or stumble upon how to use them properly. Abilities would have to be made *unintuitive*, which generally goes against standard design principles. But if done right, I believe it can be uniquely rewarding.\n\nI've heard Toki Tori does something like this, but I haven't played the games.\n\n##EXAMPLE GAME\nSince retaining memories through playthroughs becomes a theme in gameplay, it would fit the story very well.\n\nPicture a top-down stealth-action game in the style of *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel* within a sci-fi setting where humans exist in decaying cyborg bodies.\n\nYou awaken hunted and without memory, and soon learn of a cult/organization that is developing a way to hijack bodies (effectively erasing their original hosts). However, doing so also erases the memory of the hijacker.\n\nThe first ability the player learns is how to hijack bodies without losing his memory. The player meets a detective investigating the cult/organization who later becomes vital to the story when the player finds their vacant body. Meanwhile, time reset mechanics are introduced with the save system. [EDIT: Literally loading save files to reset.]\n\nOne of the last abilities the player learns is to "reset-hijack" wherein the player can hijack a vacant body, except back in time to the point the body first became empty. When the player goes back to the detective to do this on their body for answers, the player effectively goes back in time and gets to witness his previous character doing all the things he did before. [EDIT: To clarify, you "load" a save file belonging to the other character and now you play the rest of the game in their body.]\n\nAt the end of a final confrontation, the player (still in the detective's body) is trapped in a room with the player's original body laying vacant on the floor. The game ends when you time-hijack and find yourself back at the start of the game.\n\nIf you choose to start up another game, it's like the main character kept his memories this time. Since the you (and the character) had all your abilities all along, you get to sequence break early on to take a different path. And in that story path, perhaps discover how the detective became the player character.

1513524145|7keau2|A roguelike, but you change size...|... and you can get so big that you can't fit through smaller corridors anymore! And the walls are destructible! It's like a Mandelbrot style maze zooming out and out. Lower VIT monsters can flee into areas where bigger ones can't follow! Some, like slimes or octopi, can squeeze almost anywhere.\n\nEventually you zoom out so much that smaller hallways are too small to be seen, and the monsters are so tiny that you can't even see them! But beware of huge wide-open spaces! Those are just halls for creatures of unimaginable size that could step on you and not even know it! But I bet you would survive because you would fit into the cracks of their foot ridges or shoe treads. Those tiny bugs are darned hard to squish! Or if you're in tall plants, they will even support their weight enough to protect you!\n\nSo the trick is to design the maze really well, so that you can level up and down (death penalty) and not get trapped somewhere. All roads lead to bigger roads (not Rome). It could essentially be an infinite random maze with bigger and more awesome monsters. Maybe you could level up so slowly that you might not notice that you're growing and entering larger and larger tunnels! Maybe you will have to craft new clothes because your once baggy attire is now feeling a bit snug, chafing, etc... You will certainly notice when your items seem to take less and less inventory space! Your gleaming greatsword looking more like a dagger? Many keys will get so small that you lose them. At first, it may seem like some items are impossibly large and heavy. Don't even ask me about gold coins, I dunno.\n\nIt would be pretty cool to add creature alliance/taming, too. They will level up and get bigger, maybe faster, maybe slower. Your massive attack steed looking more like a tired Shetland pony? Friendly giant ogre looking more like the shrimpy kid in class? Are your brawny undead minions beginning to look like toothpicks? Or the opposite, maybe your tiny stray puppy is starting to eye you like you're a snack... Some may get too big to follow you into smaller tunnels. Maybe you could figure out how to tame a slime... bring your microscope and tweezers in case you find a tiny ancient tome.\n\nI want to see a lot of huge and tiny body parts and bones, and pushing and pulling mechanics. You'll have to turn a corpse over to get at its back pockets. You'll have to press your ear to the ground to hear that tiny quest giver. I'm sure it will be a bold and bizarre masterpiece of scale.
1482138253|5j5gnv|you've died, but you have to rebuild your being and return to your universe to save someone|Here's a concept for a game that I wish existed.\n\nYou've died, and you find yourself in the "recreation realm," only able to see in greyscale, and with no personality, memories, feelings... You're a human soul in a superficial body. You discover, through some helpful exposition from the goddess of creation, that humans are "erased" once they die, and they have new beings, lives, personalities, etc., made for them, then they're born into a new universe (multiple universe + multiple lives theories oooh). However, the goddess holds some people from heading to new universes because their prior universe still needs them. \n\nYou are given a memory of your daughter, which, in turn, gives you your motherly instinct and love. You remember the blue eyes of your daughter and start to see the color blue all around you.\n\nYou're informed that your daughter is in great danger, and that you must rebuild your being and return to your universe to save her. Bits and pieces of your memory, personality, feelings, and color are spread throughout the recreation realm, and you must find them to build enough of a human to return to your universe.\n\nMemories are quick-time sections. When a memory is found (whether it's hidden somewhere, dropped by a boss, or needed for plot), you live that memory. The outcome of a memory affects certain things in the recreation realm, like boss battles, enemies in a certain area, friendly human encounters, spawning of collectibles, etc. The better a memory is executed, the better/easier things are in the recreation realm. They also have a butterfly effect that causes changes in other memories.\n\nEverything starts in black and white except the goddess of creation. Colors (what colors you can see in) are gained through memories (all plot-based memories, ie. required memories). They're unlocked through seeing a colorful something of importance in a memory, like the blue eyes of the daughter, the red color of blood, the bright yellow of the sun, etc. A cutscene would show the shift into seeing things of that new color.\n\nThe game would have multiple endings depending on:\n-how many memories, feelings, and traits are collected\n-how your memories play out (ie. how perfectly you executed the quick-time events)\n\nfor a lot more, but a lot messier, here's a link to the full plot idea: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN83PIZezwMfZyhphWwJgA5olb2UNtJESlHgZiEIDeg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nlet me know your thoughts and feedback. I think this could make a neat comic or novel as well, so if anybody wants to use the concept for anything, just let me know.

1487536873|5v0b98|Archery only FPS|Bit of an odd one, but had the idea for a medieval FPS but almost entirely disregarding melee for archery.\n\nBulk of the fighting is done with bows, crossbows, slings, atlatls (A thing used to fling spears), and slingshots. Melee is still around in a weak tap to swing, not the focus at all. Each weapon also comes with a piece of gear, and you can select a character type to get slightly different attributes.\n\nBows are the good all rounders, good damage, reload, draw speed, so on. So any bows would be geared towards being versatile but they suffer from fairly short range unless you get good at arcing shots. Some could even borrow special abilities from other weapons like ricochet or DoT effects.\n\nCrossbows are the sniper equivalent. Slow reload, but massive damage and instant firing with an accuracy penalty if moving (No aiming down sights, this'd be the only weapon class that would even use it so why bother). Doesn't have much drop off, hence massive range but reloads slowly after a missed shot. Heavier ones would immobilize you when you reload, but lighter ones could be reloaded even while moving or using gear.\n\nSlings are hard to use, but rewarding. Wind up for a longer ranged more powerful shot, but get disrupted if hit during the swing. Let a sling bullet fly on a heavy arc, allowing close or distant shots if accurate and deal good damage. Most would offer a ricochet effect, allowing good slingers to arc or bounce shots around corners, or possibly hit an enemy from behind. Trade of being vulnerable during the wind up and being slowed significantly while doing so.\n\nAtlatls are the heavy weapons. Medium range, average reload, big damage, average wind up. Shots have very little arc allowing for the straightest shots, and can be used for utility by sticking spears in surfaces. Very visible and easy to see however, character making a grunt to give a verbal que a second before they loose the spear.\n\nSlingshots are for the speedsters. Low damage, fast shots, fast reload, short-medium range and a sharp drop off. Shares the sling's ricochet on most variants, are quiet, and can temporarily debuff enemies if shot in the correct areas. Such as a shot to the face to lower accuracy for a second, hitting the elbow to make them restart their draw or wind up, shot to the knee to slow, or shot to the throat for higher damage.\n\n\nHealth would be the same as any game, having tiers of health drops around the map ranging from small, medium, to large.\n\nAmmo is a factor, but can be collected from any dropped weapons just by running over them old tf2 style.\n\n\nGear is something that comes with a weapon, similar to how Splatoon does it. Gear is either reusable or on a recharge, being things like grappling hooks or caltrops respectively.\n\nGrappling hooks would have the obvious use of mobility but could also serve as a secondary weapon that drags enemies closer and damages them. No limits on grappling other than once it hits a surface it must drop on to a roughly horizontal ground to grab on to, allowing you to cling or climb up to it.\n\nWall shields are deployed, up to a few per person but only ever one charged. The shield can be moved if grabbed, being portable defense or to provide cover for as long as their HP holds up and the enemy's projectiles can't penetrate it. So while shields are effective against bullets and bolts, some arrows and most spears will go through them.\n\nCaltrops are barely visible traps that do minor damage, slow significantly in their area and a lesser slow after they've been crossed. However a player may only have one patch out at once, and aren't alerted when they're crossed except for a pain grunt from the victim if they're near by.\n\nBear traps have an obvious effect, more visible than caltrops but way more effective. They slow a target and chain them to only move within a small area until they drag themselves at the edge long enough. Can also be placed on walls for a move obvious trap that deals high damage.\n\nPochette Violin, an instrument which creates a sort of support role for team players. For the user they can play actively to gain a speed boost and slow health regeneration, the same being for nearby allies who also benefit from minor combat buffs like damage, draw speed, etc.\n\nSpyglass to mark a target. To help the team or for a sniper to keep an eye on someone moving in and out of cover. Just watch them for a couple seconds centered in the screen and they are temporarily highlighted. However the spyglass glints light is is fairly visible.\n\nPowder bomb, just a smoke screen. Neither of you can see through it, but good for escapes or blocking off snipers. Also teamwork to hide a trap.\n\nHoly symbols which are used for healing. Hold one up to an ally and heal them. Works on a tether so they have to stay close and in line of sight, but leaves a lingering regeneration. Very slow to take out or put away.\n\nMetal shield, something not suited for lightweight archers and takes both hands to use. However it always blocks damage if you're looking at the projectile.\n\nHawk, a bird of prey to attack enemies and take attention either to line up a shot or make an escape. Deals moderate damage over time but low health and can be outrun by more speedy characters.\n\nBombs, for the alchemists. Recharges fairly fast and you keep a handful at any given time for a reliable secondary weapon option. Short range but has an AoE, visible but high damage. \n\nShrubbery Suit. A stealth option, spend a few seconds using it to hide as a prop or piece of greenery on the map, attacking breaks it and you must wait before you get a new one.\n\nFire pots which can be used to douse the currently loaded shot with fire, enabling it to have damage over time and make a target very visible. However it must be used fast or your own weapon is temporarily disabled.\n\nLastly the character types, used to determine health, ammo, size, and speed.\n\nSquires are the tanks, wearing comparatively heavy armor and bulky. Due to this they are slow but have high health (No actual armor mechanic). Carries the highest amount of ammo and can give out ammo packs.\n\nRogues are small and speedy, but low health and unless using the slingshot or similarly light weapon they have little ammo and must aim their shots. Can draw and use gear faster.\n\nWardens are balanced, no strong stat, no low stat.\n\nSharpshooters are of course snipers. Smallest size, low speed and health, high ammo. Easy to hide but they suffer if they get caught and so should arc their shots to stay hidden. Passively increases the range of all weapons.\n\nTinkerers are oddballs. Medium size, high ammo, slightly lower speed, and slightly lower health. They are able to use ammo types to grant their weapon new attributes like ricochet, DoT, debuffing, marking, or making them leave a trail. 
1494809855|6b7eiv|HITMAN but you're the target|What if in the HITMAN series you played 47s target and had to escape or take on your would be assassin?\n\n\nThat's the basic concept for this Strategic-Stealth- Action video game idea.\n\n\nYou would play a character who is a regular person who for unknown reasons to him/her has had a contract put out on them.\nThe story would involve the playable character trying to figure out why this is happening whilst evading multiple assassins.\n\n\nYou quickly learn an assassin is on your tail so players can jump straight into action. From here you would have two choices in this level based game. Avoid being killed and escape or take on your would be killer.\n\n\nTo avoid being killed you would have to figure out who your hunter is and find the safest exit.\n\n\nor you can use your surroundings to take out the assassin. Like in the HITMAN games you could set up "booby traps" to defend yourself or even find a weapon and take on the killer.\n\n\nThis would be level based just like HITMAN. And your actions in one level have consequences on the next.\n\n\nLet's say you don't kill the assassin in level 1 then that assassin would follow you to the next level depending on which exit you take. There could be 4 exits to a map each with their own safety rating. For example if you decide to leave through the front door of a building it allows more eyes to be on you. but if you go through a sewage system there is less likely chance people would see.\n\n\nYour stealthiness and exit decision have an effect on your notoriety. If your evasion and escape were clumsy then your bounty rises and more assassins become interested. So in Level 2 you could have two assassins after you if you didn't kill the last guy which would obviously make things more difficult for the player BUT you can still use this more dangerous situation to your advantage. The assassins want to collect the reward themselves so if they figure out another assassin is trying to beat them to the punch they wouldn't be too happy and you can get them to see each other and fight, taking the heat off of you.\n\n\nIn an ideal world this game would be third person.\n\n\nApologies if the pitch is jumbled or unclear. If I have enough feedback for this post I will return and write up a more detailed and clear pitch.\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read.

1472937254|510u3q|The One Trope That Spider-man/Superhero Games Never Use - Until Now|Imagine a game where you balance maintaining a secret identity (because people make life worth living) and protecting a city/population (because that's where your people live.) \n\nIt's a superhero sandbox action platformer with two point-based scales, *City Safety* and *Secret Identity*, that govern which random city events appear, what character progressions are available, and how the world reacts to the character. \n\nThe player always can switch between two skins, civies and tights, which allow the player to enter events as time progresses through three periods: morning, afternoon and night. \n\nWhen the player selects "Change," they trigger a 10-second action that reduces movement speed to 10% and stops a few actions. After spawning, you can walk outside of your bedroom window, hit the Change, and after a 10-second delay, you are wearing your superhero costume. \n\nAlong with experience points, damage statuses, and unlocking new abilities, the main character also has a few Sims-like needs (Love, Comfort, Sanity, Hope) that get refueled or supercharged by attending civilian events. For instance, you need normal sanity and high comfort in order to discover new superhero moves. Have above-average romance scores? Then you'll have a damage boost. \n\n-The details of the meta-concept-\nThe game system measures two 1,000-point scales: your **secret identity** and **city safety.** \n\nCity:                 Scary                      Safe\n           -500                ... -1,  0 ...               +500\nIdentity:           Public                      Secret\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **Secret Identity**, the game behaves as if your identity is secret. \n&gt;  You gain the full benefit of attending civilian events (gain Identity points, boosts to health, sanity, etc.)\n&gt;  Putting on your Civies turns you invisible to enemies (except enemies who have a Knows! tag or status.)  \n&gt;  Interacting with Normals or Beloveds allow you to invest relationship points with them. \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if your identity is public. \n&gt;  You gain noticeably lower benefits of attending civilian events. \n&gt;  Enemies see past your Civies -- and there's now a 50% chance of random enemies during civilian events.\n&gt;  Beloveds can self-downgrade to Normal, and Normals may choose to ignore the player.\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **City Safety**, the game behaves as if the city is safe.\n&gt;  You gain City points from patrolling in your costume. Upon death/KO, you respawn in clinics or low-security cells at the local precinct.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of small-scale skirmishes (muggings, etc.)\n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events only 10% of the time.  \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if the city is scary. \n&gt;  Upon death/KO, you resapawn in high-security cells - and lose 500 identity points. No points for patrol.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of large-scale problems (bombings, block fires, etc.) \n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events 60% of the time.\n\n\nAs the hero, you patrol the city and resolves random enemy events -- which give strength points and city points, for raising City Danger score. Swoop in, beat up the bad guys, help the elderly across the crosswalk, stop the villains. You know the drill. \n\nAs the person, you build your character by building your character's life. Now, pay attention. \nThe game's schedule moves through three periods: morning, afternoon, and night. Civilian events happen in predictable places during those schedules. In the morning, civilian events pop up at the school. In the afternoon, they pop up in the city. At night, they pop up at home.\n\nEach event requires your attendance (and any other gimmick you want) and yields the character bonuses when you're present for their ending. When you activate a civilian event, you control time - speeding up or slowing down the schedules. And you're only required to be present at the beginning and at the end to get the rewards. \n\nWant an example? \n&gt; It just turned night. The player is in the city, dressed in tights. The HUD shows that it's night, and a pop-up announces an event, "Dinner's Ready!", and there's only 90 seconds to activate it. The player chooses to stay in costume (to protect their identity) and superhumanly flies to their home, a house in the suburbs. On approach, the house is lit in green, and a perimeter around the civilian event marks the boundary the player must cross in civilian clothes. The player lands after 30 seconds of flight, goes into some cover, activates the Change Clothes, waits 10 seconds more, and walks across the perimeter. Onscreen text, a mini-cut-scene, whatever flavor signals the beginning of the event -- and the HUD guides the player to an object to activate (in this case a seat at the dinner table). After activating the seat, the player fast-forwards through time... and the player sees the relevant character stats that will increase: health, sanity, comfort, secret identity scores. Also, pop-ups on the HUD show Night events happening. However, city danger is already high and the character's stats are middling. The player chooses to stay at the event. In-game flavor text, character interaction, etc. simulate the dinner at home. At the end of the 20-40 second fast forwarded event, the player has seen 4-5 city events pop up. However, the civilian event ends - and the rewards are registered to the character's sheet. The player's now standing inside their home, and their HUD registers 3 other civilian events in the area - upstairs, next door, etc. The player pauses the game to check City Safety and Secret Identity stats. City Safety has gone up pretty high (200 points) as a result of ignoring them. However, the player's comfort and love bars are just shy of unlocking more moves or triggering a story event. What do you do? \n&gt; The player chooses to activate the next-door event: "Date Night." The player moves toward that perimeter and, already in civies, triggers it. Flavor text and in-game cinematics show the girlfriend wants to watch a movie together. Activate the couch. Stats of Love, Comfort, Health and Sanity show up as potential rewards if the player finishes this event in the perimeter. The player fast-forwards the event until another city event appears on the pop-up HUD. That'll be worth some 80 points if it gets resolved. The player stops fast-forwarding, deactivates the couch, walks in his civies into cover near the house where no one will see him change, changes, and leaves the house. The Date Night timer continues, at a normal pace, and signals that the player isn't present to collect the rewards. The player hustles through the city event, a grocery robbery - except his mom (who was present for the Dinner's Ready! event) is also a hostage. In superhero garb, the player gets his mom to a police safety point, goes back into the grocery and disarms/disables the robbers. There's about 20 seconds left in Date Night! and the player really wants the story event and rewards. He zips as fast as he can back to the Date Night! perimeter (15 seconds left), and hits the Change Clothes - moving across the barrier at 25% normal pace and unable to jump. He's in the barrier and moving toward the couch, still changing. Because he's in the same room with girlfriend character while Changing Costumes, the Secret Identity score goes down 5 points and the girlfriend gets the tag "Suspicious." It'll take another complete civilian event with her to remove the tag. Don't need to worry about that now. With 5 seconds left, the player activates the couch, concludes Date Night!, and gets the rewards. The player's now standing in the girlfriend's house. City Danger is now 120 points short of where it was before Dinner's Ready!; the player can activate a training event to unlock new moves; the girlfriend's "Suspicious" tag could be a big deal; and already another two civilian events are on the HUD and there's only time for one more before school tomorrow morning. Which do you do now? \n\nDo you get it? \n\nThis game has one sandbox -- but essentially two worlds happening at the same time. Players choose which side they need to tend to. \n\nThey make their choices based on any of a dozen factors: \n* The City Danger and Secret Identity scores\n* Which character building goals do they want to hit (unlocking moves, costumes, etc.)? \n* Story or training events they can unlock\n* Shuffling their lives around to accommodate a superhero's life -- meaning, creating a girlfriend out of a fellow superhero to have dates that also add to city scores. \n* Progressing through story events to further their life: high school graduation, college, jobs, normal careers\n\n**Sounds nice, but what happens at the fringes of the rules?** \nAccidentally change costume in Times Square? You can steadily recover your secret identity with civilian events, and Special events (faking the hero death, getting a costume double), only triggered when the Secret Identity score is really low, can yield major Secret Identity bonuses. \n\nDoes Mom die in a supervillain event? You can always befriend new Beloveds out of the Normals population. Until you do, you'll notice fewer civilian events are around to boost your character. \n\nDo you lose all your HP during a supervillain fight? You'll respawn in their lair (a pre-drawn escape level), the villain will have the Knows! tag, and you'll now need to worry about that supervillain showing up during a civilian event -- until you convince them with a special event or until game events kill them.  \n\nI can see the game clearly in my mind as if I've been playing it for years. It's like I came from an alternate universe where this game already exists, and I'm just remembering it. \n\nSo ask me any questions.  
1486867627|5tj7id|[META] Why do we allow requests?|It seems like every day I see a post demanding the community produce a good idea for OP. I thought this sub was for suggesting ideas and building on them together, rather than for making posts when you can't think of anything on your own.\n\nAm I totally off-base here? I do certainly see good ideas being posted, and I understand requesting ideas when you have a foundation, but low quality "I need a game idea" posts seem a bit ridiculous. 
1414594926|2kohuo|It's called: You Are The Sword|For some years I simply have not had the time to keep programming and trying to properly realise my game ideas. So here: I'm throwing one of them out into the aether to see what y'all think of it. Please upvote and share if you like it and I can give you more info.\n\nOur protagonist starts at the bottom of a tower with many separate floors. The aim is to get to the top of the tower. The tower is populated by many adventurers seeking to do the same thing. So far, so cliche and uninteresting.\n\nHere's the twist (and working title): **You Are The Sword**.\n\nWhen the character holding you dies, you drop to the floor, and, evetnually, you're picked up by another character who you then gain control over. In some sense the game can never end until you win - which allows us to amp up the difficulty significantly of course.\n\nInspirations: Dwarf Fortress and Sword Art Online, primarily.\n\nOK there's a lot more to this idea that would require a lot (a **lot**) of programming. But that's the very basic idea. I can go on about it more in the comments if you are interested. Imagine all the cool things about dwarf fortress (persistence, random gen, etc.) but in a dungeon crawler. It's pretty cool. Throw in all your classic RPG elements, only with this curveball that your character can completely change at any time.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more.\n\nEdit: someone wanted more information up front rather than in discussion below, so I'll do what I can.\n(NB. there's a lot more here than the basic idea, and I'm well aware of what a colossal amount of work this would be to code!)\n\nBASIC GAME PITCH\n\n* you are a parasitic sword who takes control of your wielder\n* your aim is to get to the top of the tower - you start at the ground floor\n* there are a fixed number of randomly generated adventurers in the tower, and when one dies, a new one enters\n* adventurers wander through the tower fighting monsters on different floors, and perhaps each other\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\n\n* adventurers are procedurally generated at the start of the game, along with the maps of each of the tower's floors, monsters and bosses (a la Dwarf Fortress)\n* adventurers have classic rpg stats alongside temperament stats (which grades them on scales of aggressiveness/passivity, bravery/cowardice, honour/treachery etc.) . This dictates their interactions with other adventurers and their actions more generally\n* monsters get tougher as you go up the tower\n\nSWORDS\n\n* every adventurer climbing the tower needs a sword. You start out getting picked up by some level one scrub at the bottom floor of the tower\n* some swords are special - let's call them soul swords. You're one of them. Soul swords take over the mind of the wielder and are soulbound (cannot be unequipped till death) You're not necessarily the only one...\n* swords level up as their wielders level up\n\nADVENTURERS\n\n* adventurers level up as they fight monsters and grow stronger\n* there are a fixed number of adventurers, so it's technically possible to record all interactions between advs, all injuries sustained, and all rivalries/friendships etc. If you've played dwarf fortress you know the kind of thing I'm talking about: Brian's left toe is broken sort of thing\n* some advs play dirty - if they are 'evil' enough, they might kill other advs for their gear, or because they don't like them. If you're unlucky, your character won't just get killed by their sworn enemy, but you will *become* their sworn enemy. Still, it's probably better than being left on the ground.\n\nTHE TOWER\n\n* for now let's say the tower has 20 floors. Adventurers likewise can level from 1 to 20. They can only access the floor they have hit the level of. Similarly for equipping weapons and armour.\n\nPARTIES\n\n* in order to to tackle bigger monsters, at some point advs have to go out in parties. As a low-level character, you can expect to be resigned to signing up for an available outing with a party looking for another member.\n\n* as your repute grows (of the character, not the sword) you might be able to lead your own parties, by finding other weaker (or less famous) advs to follow you\n\nDEATH\n\n* when an adv dies, their gear falls to the ground. If that includes you, you won't be spared. You lie there in the dirt until a friend claims it, or a adv considers you an upgrade, or, if you're really unlucky, some low level scrub picks you up looking for a cheap buck by selling you on. The higher level you are, the more chance you will find your way to the hands of someone as mighty as your last wielder. Otherwise, you have to work your way back up again.\n\nSTORY (because why the hell not?)\n\n*Nemesis stands at the top of the Tower of Fate, looking down at your battered corpse. She knows that only seconds from now, your body will judder back to life whether you wish it or not. So she does what she did to all the others: as your spirit returns to flow like water into your recently departed body, she catches it in a vial of sand and corks it. It is all you can do to juggle yourself out of her grasp. The vial smashes on the floor and you reach once more for your body. But it is too far away, and the sand weighs you down. Enough sand lands on the sword for your spirit to find a place in the metal to hide. But it has been to long now. Your body is dead.*\n\n*Nemesis kicks your body, your sword and your spirit over the side of the tower with a curse. Now she is the last of the gods, free to feed off all those who dare to reach the top of her tower. Only you can stop her now, but you have fallen to the very bottom of the world, your body smashed to pieces. You are not you anymore.*\n\n*You Are The Sword.*
1430925576|352f8f|A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam|The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., "What did you have for breakfast today?" or "Where do you live?". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable "hallucinations" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness.
1520797885|83p3wt|A game set in an apartment block where you uncover the mysteries of the residents|The game shouldn't have any proper story, so no waypoints or quest markers. Instead, environmental clues and storytelling will be as densely packed as possible, receipts scattered around, call records from house phones and so on. The art style would to be not unlike rime or firewatch and each character (person in apartment) would have their own schedule, with some leeway for random activities (so if two residents are having an affair, one might randomly sneak over to the others apartment) the player is outfitted with a camera and a lockpick, to record events and break into people's apartments.
1387667572|1tfajy|You will probably not read this, but I need to get this concept out of my head.|A game that I call 'Psychosis', I don't know if this has been done, in that case tell me.\n\nIt's a horror game, where you start in a abandoned hospital with a head injury/amnesia, the\nhospital starts out normal and clean, but once a nurse comes in there's no eyes just holes,\nthis causes the game to go in slow motion and your heartbeat goes louder.\nAfter she leaves you try to escape the hospital. Other people, patients and nurses \nstart out as ghosts/human like creatures and the closer you get to the exit the more scarier they become\n(as well as making the hospital more scarier, moving walls, more worn out, darker, until it's pretty much abandon)\nmaking the player to start attacking them the using various weapons found in the hospital.\nThis causes police and guards to come and try to arrest you, however, to the player they appear\nlike monsters. You escape and go through a almost like typical horror game except you attack\nothers, the longer you wait the scarier/more gross they become. "The Cops" hunts you\nand you'll have to escape to your farm (this is the only objective and the only thing your character remembers).\nAs you progresses through the game, it becomes darker and scarier.\nRight before you reach your farm, you're arrested/kidnapped by the monsters.\nYoul'll then placed in a room with the only normal looking person in the game.\nHe explains to you that you're a hallucinating schizophrenic and had a psychosis,\nhe tells you you've killed countless peoples lives (now you'll get flashbacks from a "normal"perspective"\nshowing you killing innocent men, women, and children) and that you've been the main newstory\nall week and been hunted by the government. Revealing you have been a psychopath.\nYour character can't accept it and kills the psychologist and tries to escape in a \n["Black ops revelations"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02DUaeo9iw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=61) type of mission, getting flashbacks seeing yourself killing people\nwithout regret, your character finally breaks down and kills himself with a gun from a guard. The End.\nThe backstory is you were put in a mental hospital at a young age, one day you're attacked\nby another patient, landing you in the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry it sounds a bit weird, but it has been in my head for a couple of days\nand I can't really get the concept out of my head.\n\nThe thing is, it has to be really well executed. The regular people have to act\nlike normal people just looking scary to the player, the cops are the only ones attacking you first.\nIt's kinda inspired by Postal 2's Apocalypse Weekend.\nIt should be extremely bloody and not using as much jump-scares but more psychological horror.\nFocusing on the feeling of being alone and followed. One defining moment should be\nkilling a monster up close, cutting its throat, looking into human eyes. Moments showing something's\nwrong should be popping up through the entire game.\n\n**TL;DR: You kill monsters in a apocalyptic world, in the end revealing you're a psycho running around killing\ninnocent people.**\n\nIt's still just an idea, so tips, ideas and critique are welcomed. I've also thought of this as a movie and a book, but a game seemed like the best.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1391828601|1xbt80|Dolphin Call of Duty|So the basic premise is that you are on a team of 128 dolphins in the Pacific ocean. There is another team of dolphins. One team are ninjas and one are pirates. You are using class appropriate weapons. The last dolphin standing then becomes ninja or pirate god. This gets them special buffs the next game.\n\nAlso. Motion controls.
1474681272|54855i|Break-In|When the game starts out, your character is an ordinary man with a wife, kids and a pet in an ordinary house. The news says that there have been break-ins in the neighborhood. You must first go around the house and try to remember what you have so you'll know if something gets stolen.\n\nWhen you judge yourself done with that, you go to sleep. The next morning, there's signs of a break-in. You must figure out what's stolen and use clues to figure out how the burglar got in and what kind of items he's targeting. Some will just be targeting money, some jewelry, some food, some electronics, and some will come for anything valuable.\n\nThen, using that information, you must use your remaining items to create a trap that will catch the burglar in the act. You can also use money to go to buy things from the store across the street, or ask neighbors to lend your something, but if the neighbor's things get stolen, they will be angry at you and won't lend you stuff in the future, and they even make you compensate them for it.\n\nSome burglars you may have to be robbed by multiple times before you can find a pattern in their burglaries. When you catch one, the police reward you with more money that you can use to make traps for future burglars. You get a new burglar each time you catch one.\n\nOnce you get far into the game, you may even encounter burglars that are looking to murder your family members, rather than stealing things. There's no telling what order those will go in, but they always go for you last, so you have a limited number of nights (One night for each family member and pet) to catch them before you lose the game. Lets say we make the player have a wife, a son, two daughters, and a dog. The murderer may kill the dog first, they may kill the son first, or they may kill the wife or one of the daughters first. After he gets through them all, though, at one per night, he kills you and you lose the game. Each family member you lose is dead for the rest of the game, but perhaps we could have an adoption center in the game to get more kids (adopting a kid just to use him/her as a meat shield isn't very ethical, but oh well), a shelter to adopt more pets from, and a mail-order bride service. These would all cost money, and have a chance of not working that increases if you let too many die. (I did a background check, and you've had 3 kids in a row get killed the day after you adopted them. We can't give you another. Sorry, sir.)
1454265221|43k7w0|On rail mm shooter|To preface, this is a half baked idea that I'm posting from my phone because I'm worried I'll forget about it.\n\nThe idea: a simplistic 5v5 (csgo stylish) fps, with the twist of before every round there is a one minute period to draw the rail your character will follow.\n\nWhen a character finishes their rail, they will be able to draw on more, but while they do they will be vulnerable to being attacked, so the rail creation would have to be well thought out\n\nSorry I can't write more I'm at an event but I feel while this is a simplistic idea with flaws, it could possibly be of interest to someone :)\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n
1501518768|6qpkfz|VR Horror in a Wheelchair!|What is the biggest issue facing VR games right now? Its the movement. Combining motion controls with VR sacrifices a players freedom of movement. However there is a perfect solution to this that would also serve as an incredible premise for a horror game; put them in a wheelchair!\nThat's right. While playing, the player would sit in a standard chair. To move, they would put their hands next to their hips and sort of toss them forward. In game, their character is actually in a wheel chair, and they are effectively grabbing the virtual wheels and giving them a spin. They can turn left and right by turning the wheels in opposite ways, and can also move backwards.\nNow apply this control scheme to a horror game. It takes place in, say, a hospital. The scary things will be chasing the player in a wheelchair, and they will frantically be spinning the wheels trying to escape; all while having the ability to turn their head around and look at the pursuing horror. \nThe mechanics could also incorporate the ability for the player to crawl around without the wheel chair, simply by using their arms to pull themselves along the floor. This creates some even scarier scenarios. The monsters can smack the wheelchair, sending the player flying out of it. The player can fall down stairs. Perhaps there will be moments where the player must explore an area without their wheelchair, crawling in dark, cramped spaces while something stalks them.\nSome issues; the constant arm gestures might get exhausting, the pace would be slow, and I imagine VR would be hella expensive and difficult to dev for. But I think this would have the potential to be one of the scariest games ever made.

1522249802|87snyg|Single-enemy MMO|First things first, this isn’t me asking anyone to make a game, this is me with this idea in my head and wanting to put it down somewhere.  If you go ahead and comment something like “too big scale, indie developers can’t make this” etc. just know I don’t care and already understand.\n\nWhat I’m thinking about in this game is, basically, a whole group of users of the MMO aiming to defeat a single threat.  This threat isn’t constantly present, like a boss to beat or a thing to get.  This is an invasion that occurs once in a given timeframe.  Maybe it’s a month, maybe it’s a year, maybe it’s more or less.  The threat can be a wide variety of things; maybe it’s a giant monster, maybe it’s an army, maybe it’s not even enemy-based but something like a virus.  The threat would change with each iteration, and the developers could give hints here and there to help as they see fit.  While players in-game can grind to make themselves stronger, the main part of the game is actually on the outside, in the form of the community getting together to form a plan, twitch-plays-Pokémon style.  There are certainly things to prepare in the main game, like resources and defenses, but large-scale strategy needs to be an integral part of the combat.  The map doesn’t need to be a gargantuan sprawling map, just big enough to be a small kingdom. \n\nTl;dr: an mmo community needs to defend against impending enemies that come once every few months/year, using the time to prepare.
1437118107|3dlnyi|You're a ghost who must setup freak accidents in a contract with Death!|This game is set on a modern, populated island with a few hundred residents and a northeastern always-cloudy-and-gloomy atmosphere. They all have generic routines around the house; making breakfast, watching TV, mowing the lawn, going to bed, etc..., and most of them have jobs they travel to on the island.\nYou're an invisible ghost. You were once a resident of the island but you were murdered by an unknown killer. Death has spared you eternity in the abyss, for now, under the condition that you help him cross a number of names off his list. As an added bonus, he'll eventually let you get revenge on the person who killed you before the story took off.\nSo, the gameplay.\nYou cannot simply ghost-punch people in the face and kill them, but instead, you have to CAUSE their deaths through moving objects in game and setting up traps and freak accidents like an ill placed toy at the top of the stairs that no one was paying attention to because it wasn't there just a second ago. \nYou have to observe a little and figure out your victims routines for everything to go smoothly. The more bold your actions are, the more likely it is that someone will notice strange things happening in their home. If Ms. Jones notices the toaster sitting by the bathtub then she will carry herself in much more suspect manner and make things more difficult for you, and if she turns a corner and sees a kitchen knife floating in mid-air, ...she may very well call the exorcist. If the exorcist arrives in the home you are at, surviving his encounter will give you a fresh start on the mission, but if he successfully exercises the home then you will be banished from it until you are strong enough to reenter (and you become stronger with each death you cause). As you progress and do become stronger, you slowly work your way to the title of a demon. At this level of strength you may actually give someone a little nudge while they're on a ladder or something similar, but  once again, the more bold your actions are - the more risk you take. At this stage you may attract the attention of guardian angels, and without taking any sides or getting too religious, if a guardian is alerted to your presence then your only hope is to very stealthily avoid it and cause an accidental death (for gameplay/balance reasons). \nIt's obviously a dark narrative and if it were fleshed out properly would be restricted in a few countries, but I think it scores points for originality, concept, and boldness. There are plenty of other details I've thought of for the game but I'd like to hear what someone else says about the basic premise, the mechanics of it, and what they'd add or remove. Very open to criticism!

You'll see the (successful or failed) outcome when you resume time.|With all the interesting mechanics we've seen (e.g. rewinding time in "Life is strange"), this is certainly not just doable, but the time is also right for this.\n\nI'm just watching "Heroes" on Netflix (which isn't bad, currently at S1:E7) which inspires this idea. A car is exploding. People are around. Parts will probably fly around. The explosion will probably consume a person or two. Time is frozen. What to do? Which object needs to be moved, changed, used? etc.\n\nThe player could be confronted with all kinds of such situations, can alter them, and when they resume time, the consequences are calculated (e.g. via physics engine, but also people's reactions to things suddenly being (re)moved etc.). A "simple" version of this game could come down to a score evaluation of the outcome, but the more sophisticated version that I hope we'll be able to pull off in the coming years is one where the whole game's event development is tied to these situations and their outcomes, possibly even without predefined freeze points but arbitrary (albeit recharging) freezing power, so ideally it would just be a simulation happening over time, and you can "adjust" it at will, except you'll have to put up with the many side-effects, the emergent situations etc.

The goal of the game is to force Mario to continue living a miserable and pointless existence and eventually trap himself into marriage with a soul-sucking vampire.
1462974610|4iuzhi|A loot driven, tower defense on a mobile fortress|If there are 2 things people love its loot and tower defenses. So here is my idea to combine them. \n\nYou control a big, mobile fortress. On that fortress you can build certain towers in a traditional TD way. You roam a big open map pulling aggro of the monsters that roam there. They will run up your ramps, onto your fortress and try to get to the core. Your towers will kill them, and any loot that they drop on your fortress is yours.\n\nLoot could be various resources for building and upgrading your towers, special towers, or equipable upgrades to give your towers unique abilities. \n\nAs you roam and get stronger you will be able to go into more difficult areas, fight stronger monsters and get better loot.

1510938988|7dmfyc|"A Crate Game" Joke game where everything is unlocked from crates|A simple concept. You start 3rd person as a stick figure in a room with a crate in the center. Click on the crate to see what you get. There is a full game, but it is all locked in crates, so you randomly unlock bits and pieces as you go. Maybe it is an open world sandbox so it doesn't matter as much what order things appear?\n\nLoot: Some unlocks automatically enter the world. Some unlocks go into the player inventory. Consumables like potions. Weapons, armor, the player's avatar. Plants, rocks, animals, monsters, pets, clouds. Dungeons? Quests? Whole maps?\n\nCrate: The crate would have a number on it displaying how many crates you have left. Ideally the player would get enough crates at the start to unlock everything and it would just be the tedium/joy of opening them. But I suppose you could actually charge extra for more crates. Since everything is crated you could make the game free and charge $1 for 100 crates and make it so you need to spend about $5 to get about everything.
1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

1486231219|5s1zer|Please post design ideas, not experience ideas|In the book "Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences" by Tynan Sylvester there's a paragraph titled "The Fallacy of Vision" (p. 304). It starts with a short story:\n\n&gt; *A young aerospace engineer is at his first day of work. He goes into the \nboss’s office with a gleam in his eye, and declares, "I’ve got the greatest \nidea for a new kind of airplane."*\n\n&gt; *The boss is intrigued. "Explain," he says.*\n\n&gt; *The young engineer takes on a visionary expression and stares into \nthe distance. "The passengers board hassle-free in five minutes. Then \nthe plane takes off, silently, with barely a bump, as the passengers enjoy \nmartinis in their private booths. As they soar over the Atlantic, a young \ncouple enjoys the view in one of the plane’s many bubble canopies, and \na cute kid gets a tour of the cockpit. The captain chuckles as the kid asks \nwhy they can’t fly to the moon. By the time they touch down, love has been \nfound, lessons have been learned, and everybody is ready for whatever \nawaits them at their destination."*\n\n&gt; *The boss leans back in his chair and takes a long drag on his cigar. \n"You’re fired," he says.*\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; This young aerospace engineer had a vision. But his vision was of an \nairplane flight, not an airplane. He described a wonderful experience, but \nhe  said  nothing  about  the  mechanical  systems  that  created  that  experience. \nHe succumbed to the fallacy of vision.\n\n&gt; **The FALLACY OF VISION is the idea that a mental movie of an experience \nis equivalent to a design for a system that generates that experience.**\n\n----\n\nIn other words, when you post your ideas please avoid describing a single experience and try to describe how the game works and what does the player experience in general. Games generate experiences, and these experiences are never the same.\n\n**Edit: My part of the post was in contradiction with the quote, I fixed it thanks to a number of thoughtful comments.**

1496701808|6fhnbk|A 4-Dimensional FPS Capture the Flag|**Edit: 3 layer "demo" can be seen here: https://youtu.be/y4VTgepucQc**\n\nA few notes for the video:\n\n- Simplified to three layers based on suggestion\n\n- Enemies show up as ghosts if theyre in any neighbouring layer\n\n- colour of ghosts no longer dictates if they are "above" or "below" you, it's just based on team colour\n\n- Obstacles that you would collide into if you jumped layers are shown on the ground (light gray is fence, dark gray is wall)\n\n- the two block high blue and orange pillars represent other players\n\n- there's a mistake, one of the orange players ghosts is missing in the blue dimension\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nConsider a classic multiplayer FPS game of capture the flag. Now think of the game world duplicated into 5 "layers"\n\n- Dark Orange\n- Orange\n- White (Neutral)\n- Blue\n- Dark Blue\n\nWhen you're in a layer you also project colored semi transparent ghosts in the layers above and below you. If you see an orange ghost you know the player is in the above layer, a blue ghost means they're in the layer below you. \n\nEvery player can jump up and down layers with a cool down but can also pick perks. Goal is to grab flag from the other team and bring it back to your base, but each base exists on opposite ends of the map in opposite layers.\n\nPerk Ideas:\n\n- Jump two layers at once but with a longer cooldown\n\n- Shoot enemies in layers above and below you\n\n- hide your ghosts so you can just pop into existence and surprise opponents\n\n- deal extra damage or some other advantage but be physical/vulnerable in all layers at once\n\n- peak into any layer you want for a given amount of time to find out where the enemy is\n\n- shock enemies to prevent them from jumping layers\n\nThe world in each layer doesn't have to be symmetric either. For instance the neutral layer could have a void in the centre of the map that jumping layers into it kills you, or entire buildings that prevent layer jumping in or out of.\n\nI can post some pictures to help explain if you'd like\n\nEdit: Any other perk ideas? Is the core system too complicated?
1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**

1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.

Work has been a pain, and well, I haven't had much time to go on Reddit, nor much inspiration for ideas, but I finally managed to get some free time, and well, here's part three! Enjoy. :D\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n* 1. A game where you attempt to sell as many of your own organs as fast as possible before you die.\n* 2. A game where the only objective is to slow down people from their everyday grind/task. This could be played in several ways, such as the player being a spirit, actual person, creature, god, etc...\n* 3. A game where you play as a Godzilla esque monster and get to level a really massive city. The more you destroy, the more powerful and large you get. It's a bit [like that game released for PS3/4 recently, but perhaps actually good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AVoKxcaUo)\n* 4. A game a bit like Papers Please, but where you file/drop files/documents/mail into specific drop boxes, as they pile up at an alarming rate.\n* 5. You and a crew of road workers are trying to fix or build a road, but tragically (and hilariously) people are ruining the road by driving their cars on it that explode, littering, slowing down your work, and basically being a nuisance. Try to not get anyone killed, it's a bit like a reversed version of Frogger. Perhaps the more road you finish, the easier it gets.\n* 6. Go to a museum and draw mustaches on all the famous artworks on display, avoid security cameras and guards, as well as try to put up your own paintings.\n* 7. Bring people back to life in order to solve a mystery. Perhaps you can only bring back one or two people. Choose wisely.\n* 8. Repair damaged robots and create robots to help Skynet become reality.\n* 9. An Unreal Engine esque game from the perspective of a police helicopter, where you play as a person driving away from police cars in a neighborhood, simple, but eventually things get hectic, the military is called in, streets are blockaded, and you must drive through buildings and offroad to get away from them.\n* 10. A game where you make coffee and drink the whole pot, then make another pot. The more pots you drink and make, the more twitchy and difficult it gets to make them. Don't break the machine or pot.\n* 11. You are a billionaire in a rather corrupt and lawless country. Go out in the crowded streets, and simply buy someone with your immense wealth. See if you made a good choice.\n* 12. A VR game where you are an astronaut in space performing operations from a space shuttle and must survive a [Gravity esque situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKW-Gd_S_xc)\n* 12.1. A VR game where you are an astronaut performing operations on things like the Hubble Space Telescope, and have the danger of dropping screws that float away, etc.\n* 13. Go outside and loosen the screws on large bridges, break train tracks, ruin roads, cut support wires on sky-scrapers, and basically cause a huge mess.\n* 14. Play as a police officer and try to purposefully make people pay up despite abiding the law and not speeding.\n* 15. Break into your neighbor's house and take their furniture/money/X-Box/personal belongings and try not to get caught. They come in your house and look around for their things later, so try to hide it and be prepared. Based on real life personal experience.\n* 16. Go on national news and express your opinion on a situation with other people, despite you knowing nothing about it. Try to choose the best option.\n* 17. A proper game/simulator where you get to simulate the Apollo lunar landings, as well as walk on the surface. Haven't found or seen one yet.\n* 18. Take a sledgehammer and break concrete on the road. Eat it, and try to convince other people to do the same thing.\n* 19. Try to convince Death not to take you away, despite being dead or seriously ill.\n* 20. A game where you herd bison/animals towards a village for food.\n* 21. Control a probe and land it on a comet in first person, like the ESA did.\n* 22. In order to get no wrinkles at all, you must control your emotions and never smile, frown, or smirk, try to keep them under control.\n* 23. A multiplayer shooter where every time you shoot your gun, you lose health.\n* 24. Time travel to stop a bomb from exploding, by watching the person who placed and activated it, as well as try to evacuate civilians.\n* 25. You are now a ghost, and can only hold certain objects for a very short amount of time, try to do your normal every day things.\n* 26. A tsunami has hit your city, try to stay afloat and on your roof as your house speedily goes down a long flooded road towards the city.\n* 27. Stop the world from ending due to a nuclear holocaust by simply offering all the leaders of the world lemonade from your lemonade stand.\n* 28. You are pulled over by a *very* aggressive and furious police officer for speeding. Try to talk him out of the ticket you cannot afford to pay.\n* 29. Play as a lifeguard on the beach or at a large crowded pool and make sure nothing bad happens.\n* 30. You are a time traveler. Go on the Internet and freak people out by predicting everything or certain events in their life.\n\nThat's all for now, I once again must apologize for the long delay for this one. I hope these are at least decent, if you have any suggestions or other ideas for them/based on them, comment away. :)\n\nOnce again, these ideas are completely free to use! If any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D

I hope you enjoy. :D\n\nPrevious ones:\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)\n\n* 1. A game where you play as the captain of a massive cruise ship, but the closer you get to your destination, the less the passengers begin to behave.\n* 2. You are the president of the entire world. Unfortunately, you are also the slowest person on all of planet Earth. Try to do your job and get around the white house despite your *ridiculously* slow speed.\n* 3. A first person game where you must break out of your holding cell and escape the most secure prison on the planet which is where you are held.\n* 4. A game where lag is one of the main mechanics (e.g, every 5 or so seconds your controls stop responding, so you have to time your jumps/movement correctly, etc)\n* 5. A game where you're the leader of a 1984 esque world, where you must combat "thought crimes".\n* 6. Fly through space and try to find alien civilizations, then convince them (by force if necessary) to join your religion, or else your world is doomed.\n* 7. A fighting game where it's "brain over brawns" and you're a weak, but wise character, and must outsmart your opponents somehow.\n* 8. Run as fast as you possibly can from pursuing bulls with other people and see how far you can make it in the Running of the Bulls.\n* 9. A multiplayer game where you awake in a nuclear test town, and must find a hiding place/shelter to survive the detonation, and other players must do the same and can even kick you out of your spot. Nukes go off every 2 minutes and the town is constantly being ravaged in different areas, the last one alive wins.\n* 10. You are a passenger on a rapidly disintegrating bullet train that is heading towards a collapsed tunnel. Try to get off it safely by any means.\n* 11. Chuck stones at passing birds, your goal is to actually kill two birds with one stone, even if it takes massive slingshots, catapults, dump trucks, or entire boulders to do so.\n* 12. A proper zoo-keeper simulator, where you play as one and can be killed on the job by an animal if you make one wrong move.\n* 13. You are the captain of a nuclear submarine. One of your seamen is a spy attempting to obtain the nuclear launch codes, try to find him and make him walk the plank. Let's hope the one you picked was actually the spy though, and not really one of your fellow crewmen.\n* 14. Try to stay sane and survive by yourself in a small, but very nice bunker. You never actually get to see the outside world, just the very faint sounds of total destruction and the deaths of everyone above. Inspired by this: http://imgur.com/gallery/mHAKX\n* 15. An SCP Foundation inspired game, where instead of running away from the entities, you actually play as the organization in a response unit and attempt to secure and contain the unpredictable anomalies when they are found.\n* 16. Attempt to get your boss fired by staging/screwing up his events (change his speech, make his coffee decaf, put sugar cubes in the gas tank of his car, etc) so that you may become the CEO of the company.\n* 17. Smoke, flames, and water are slowly beginning to engulf the building you are inside. There is no way out, try to survive long enough until help arrives without suffocating, burning, or drowning.\n* 18. Play as a swarm of mosquitoes/bugs and consume the people around town.

A small, broken, yellow clock sits on your table. Upon turning the hands, you can control the flow of time and space around you.\n* 21. A pirate simulator where you hijack cargo ships/passing vessels and attempt to obtain the ransom money, while watching out for responding navy forces.\n* 22.

1475987121|56kr4d|An RPG where you control the soundtrack|This idea is pretty straightforward. You play an RPG character who, like Dragon Age's Grey Warden and Inquisitor, KOTOR II's Exile, and Skyrim's Dragonborn, has a unique ability: they can sense the ambient background music of the world and manipulate it. Abilities could range from intimidating shopkeepers by triggering combat music to buffing allies with the appropriate hero track.\n\nThe player would assemble a team of possible allies, each based on the personality of a musical instrument. The closer the player gets to these allies the more their songs will harmonize, unlocking group maneuvers and dialogue options. The many cities of the game would be themed towards different music genres, causing allies to act differently to NPCs and each other. Perhaps the drum-based barbarian can fit it almost anywhere except the Victorian high life and the high brow violinist finds a home in the boonies. And of course these characters would talk like Charlie Brown's teacher using their respective instrument.\n\nThe villains would be Noise and Silence, representing chaos and death, respectively. That's all I've got. This idea just seems like the perfect progression to the continued use of audio clues to guide players in video games.
1446593409|3rf5ja|A new video game where you play someone with no skills and no weapons. The object is to get killed as fast as possible while a heavily armed badass tries to protect you. Call it "Escort Mission"|
1480004786|5eoie5|A war game where you play as each of the soldiers on one side.|Got the idea from Chronotron.\n\nYou start out as one soldier, marching into the war by yourself. You kill as many people as you can. When you die, you respawn as a different soldier, and see the soldier you previously were marching into the battle beside you, doing exactly what you did. If you kill the enemy that would've otherwise killed your past self, or otherwise save your previous self's life, he then becomes a simple AI that just shoots at enemy soldiers after the time that he would've died passes. Each time you die, you respawn as a new soldier, with all of your previous selves doing what you did before.

A game where you are a person aboard the Titanic as it heads toward the iceberg. When it eventually hits, you must fight your way through crowds of people and perhaps even sacrifice your family to get on a lifeboat.\n* 2. Break into people's houses as they're gone and make everything dirty, (I.E. using a vacuum cleaner in reverse, dumping everything out of the fridge, breaking mirrors, etc)\n* 3. You are a thief in the middle of a crowded marketplace. Go around and pick people's pockets quickly, by distracting them or bumping into them. The more pockets you pick, the higher the difficulty gets as people start realizing something is missing.\n* 4. A platformer game where instead of playing as a quick, agile character, you instead play as a barely moving, morbidly obese character who often literally breaks platforms and levels.\n* 5. You are a robber in a bank robbery with several hostages. The police have the building surrounded. Try to negotiate with them, without killing any of the hostages.\n* 6. Start forest fires and try to keep the fire-fighters away so the fire spreads and becomes larger.\n* 7. Pilot a drone over a crowd and steal things from people. Eventually you begin stealing greater and more valuable things, to eventually even super valuable things like briefcases of cash and ancient artifacts.\n* 8. A phone is ringing in your house. Upon picking it up, an anonymous caller tells you "It's watching you", and gives you several hints and clues as to what it is and how it reacts/what it will do. Find out what 'it' is.\n* 9. You are a secret agent who infiltrates suspicious secret societies. In order to earn their trust and join each of them, you must master their secret hand shake. The entire game is about quick and difficult button press sequences.\n* 10. Go into public bathrooms and steal toilet paper from people as they're using the bathroom.\n* 11. A mountain climbing simulator where you scale a mountain the size of Mt. Everest or half of that.\n* 12. A Godzilla esque monster is attacking a city. You are a civilian on the ground, try to survive the carnage as buildings around you collapse, people run everywhere, the military tries to shoot it, the monster leveling the city, etc...\n* 13. Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.\n* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.\n* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!\n* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.\n* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)\n* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.\n* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.\n* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.\n* 21. A game with the setting/kind of style of Counter Strike/Modern Warfare/Battlefield/CoD, but the twist is everyone has kitchen appliances and tools instead of guns and knives.\n* 22. An NSA simulator where you look through people's computer files and learn about that person's very bizarre history through them.\n* 23. Dodge random objects that are falling out of the sky.\n* 24. Survive disasters in first person, such as tsunamis, nuclear explosions, tornadoes, meteorites falling out of the sky, volcano eruptions and more, all from your house. You have 2 minutes to prepare for the event.\n* 25. A game where you can only move by shifting the gravity of the world. Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.\n* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.\n* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.\n* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost. The only way back is a long road down a deserted path. The locals urge you to not go down it, for no one ever returns alive.\n* 29. Be the referee in a football/boxing match, decide when something bad happens who is responsible.\n* 30. A game where every step you take changes the entire level/game world, permanently.\n\nThat's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange. :P\n\nThese ideas are completely free to use, if any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me!

1473179402|51g2ki|Survivor's guilt.|I haven't come up with any story or specific elements of what this game would be, but the bare bones is that you're playing as a war vet with PTSD, trying to live a normal life. What makes the game a challenge is that certain noises or images will randomly trigger your PTSD and you'll suddenly be transported to a past scenario relevant to the trigger. I think if this was ever fleshed out, it could turn out to be really cool.
1479805514|5e9sqq|A game about being a tree in the Rainforest.|I thought of this game as I learned about the Wet Tropics of Australia.\n\nBasically, the main idea is that you are a small tree that just sprouted in the rain forest, and you have to control your way up towards the light. Whenever you are in the light, you grow 2x faster than normal, so your goal is to become the **tallest tree**.\n\nThe trees around you move at the same pace as you, and some have different abilities, like growing onto your tree and blocking your way, or preventing you from expanding outwards.

1475857641|56c86g|A post-apocalypse game in which you hunt sea monsters|A strange mix of Assassin's Creed: black flag and Shadow of the Colossus. In the future, sea levels have risen and most of the world is covered in ocean, with only small regions of dry land left. Most sea creatures have adapted or mutated into huge beasts, and you have to roam the seas in your upgradable ship and hunt (or run away) from them.  Interesting features could include:\n\n- Customisable ship, crew, weapons and outfits\n- Massive, horrifying and beautiful monsters with interesting behaviours (not always hostile) and weaknesses/attacks\n- Trade posts and taverns and stuff on dry land, as well as cities.\n- A mix of 17th century and futuristic technology\n- Multiplayer to go hunting with your mates, or fight other players in ship battles

1488149881|5wd1rl|A space based horror game without any sound.|The basic idea is a first person survival horror game (in the vein of stuff like Amnesia/Soma/Outlast) set on a space station, in which you have to survive monsters genetically engineered to survive in hard vacuum (I'm imagining something in the vein of a gigantic, predatory tardigrade).  The twist is that, since the station has suffered a catastrophic vacuum breach, there's no sound outside of your own suit (edit:so you'd still hear your own breathing, radio messages and cooling fans and whatnot), so you're forced to rely entirely on your sight to sense enemies. Since I'd imagine a vacuum engineered predator would also be really good at sensing vibrations, you'd also need to be real careful about controlling your movement.

1436397143|3clzms|Breaking the Fourth Wall|I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.\n\nThe game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.\n\nSlowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.
1491565342|63zv3r|**Coined** : A game where you play the role of a coin, the very beginning of any transaction in real world.|**This is a part of a game concept I've been working on along with my friend but it is too vast to be created on my own, I think. If any developer from here wants to work on it or would like to create it together with me, he/she is most welcomed. As I have no investment at all, I thought of posting it here for help. If you like this and want to get in touch, please do. Thanks**\n\n\n###Coined\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCoined is a top-down(considering) turn based strategical RPG for PC in which the player is in a role of decision maker named John. The player has to decide and strategize his spending and acquire the skills of any person in the game world. As soon as he spends a coin by giving it to a character, player is responsible for the actions of that other character as well.\n\n**Description**\n\nYou play as one character initially, let's call him John, because we can't see him yet.\nJohn is a kid and has a piggy bank. He is old enough to break the piggy and spend his savings on his desires and needs. As soon as John breaks open the piggy bank, he is shocked to see that he only has collected a total of 10 coins till now but these aren't ordinary coins as they glitter and sparkle of something more than just a coin but at the same time, they have the exact look of a coin which could be spent to make a purchase.\nNow, you join John as he spends those coins in the world but you have to be careful while spending each coin as the person you'll be giving that coin also becomes a character of the game which you can switch to and join his life. John always wanted to create an empire of his own and these 10 coins might just help in recruiting the best talents for his initial setup of his empire. John can learn craftsmanship as a plumber or a builder or a programmer or a labor, heck he can also learn to fly a spaceship providing he spends the coin wisely. \nYou control each characters by switching between them but you also have to bear in mind that those characters has to have enough money with them so that they don't spend the special coin in meeting their needs else your control over that character shifts to the character the coin is passed on. As the hierarchy of a single coin being transferred from one character to another increases, the speciality or rather, the special strength of that coin tends to decrease which could result in making the coin any ordinary one.\nAs John, you have to take proper utilization of each coin in getting your jobs done and in creating your own empire.\n\n**Key features**\n\n-You are in control of your actions until you create an army.\n\n-You play as different craftsmen and build whats necessary.\n\n-AI is not as efficient as you think. It can spend the whole money they have on a pair of sneakers or an EDM concert.\n\n-You follow along the daily life of each character and learn to spend wisely.\n\n\n**Will edit and write the whole concept document if this mini-concept gets good response.**

You are a random man from around the world who, by using a dating app, has been matched with an extra-terrestrial being. You can converse with them for a set time, that timer being the distance they are away from the planet.

After sending her the Scorpions song of the same name, you realize that after an in-game day of chatting, she is nine light years away (Although it would incredibly impossible to travel 186,000 miles in a single day, let's go with it). So, you have nine more days to talk to this queen, figure out what she likes, what she doesn't like and what she wants to learn about Earth. You, using your budget and whatever money you can get on the side, have to play a date and hopefully show the queen a good time. When she lands on the roof of your workplace, you have to leave work and take her on the date you had planned how many days before. You show the queen the best time you can, talk carefully and hopefully don't annoy the alien that can probably kill you in a split second.\n\nFrom that, you've successfully completed a single date with Queen Nu'ras. However, you must complete two more carefully, as to establish humanity as an ally with their people, as the queen promises she will do it if you show her you're a gentleman. The queen will go into orbit, using her spaceship as her home, and you can plan out the next dates over a few days and take the queen out the following weekend. With the dates out of the way, you have set humanity on a good relationship with the queen's people and are booty ambassador for that species.\n\nThen the perspective changes to a French man and so on and so for until humanity sleeps its way into the intergalactic political groups it needs to. \n\n\n

The other is the hunted, which spawns somewhere else on the island. The hunted gets a bag of food and a knife.

You can control only one guard at time (and you have limited ammo), but you see what they see at all times.\nA thief tries to sneak past you and you have to catch him (this the most complex idea bc of the need to make a somehwat intelligent thief)\n\n5.

1443383212|3mm0c2|A spaceship game that no one will ever make.|I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies.

1495997862|6dvh8z|Turn-based RPG where you Lvl Down|I had this idea for a while about a typical turn-based RPG where instead of starting from Lvl1 and having to Lvl Up to get stronger, you start from Lvl99 and lose exp and Lvl Down, becoming less powerfull. Monsters still have to be beaten to get gold, better armor and weapons and sometimes progress. \n\nThe plot is that a hero killed everything, but only reached Lvl99 with 1 exp point remaining for Lvl100,his ultimate goal.He travels to another reign to find something to kill there. The first monster he sees is a slime. Even that should be enough for 1 exp point, so he attacks it. Then the slime transforms into a witch, and gives him the curse to lose exp points. She then teletrasports back into her castle. The hero must travel this new, foreign land and find the witch, and defeat her to remove the curse and reach Lvl100!So he must have good armor and good weapons and items, but also have a good level. You will need to be picky on the monsters you choose to kill, because you'll need a balance to defeat the witch! \n\n\nDo you think this could work? What do you think of the idea? 
1477384587|599zsi|Tower Defense with enemies that "mutate" and "evolve" based on which of them is most effective|Hello Reddit. I just picked up Game Maker and have been learning the basics, with the hope of building some hobby projects that I can be proud of (I've got a day job that I love so being a game developer is only ever going to be a hobby). I've been going through my backlog of ideas for games and this is the one that I keep coming back to as something I might be able to build one day.\n\nThe idea is a tower defense game, but the enemies have procedurally generated stats that change as the game goes on. The game would start as a typical TD: there's a start point for enemies, they walk along a set path, the player buys towers that defend from these enemies, etc. However, instrad of having a bunch of different enemy types, the enemies "mutate" each wave, changing their stats and attributes (health, speed, damage resistance, flight, stealth, splitting into two smaller enemies on death, etc.). The stat changes are semi-random, but are weighted towards being more like the enemies that survive the longest, so that the attributes of the most effective enemies are more likely to crop up in future waves. This creates a feedback loop that makes enemies more and more effective against the player's defense every wave. The player then has to change or modify towers and tower setup to deal with an evolving threat.\n\nThe idea is to break the player of the habit of finding a single strategy or tactic that works and forcing them to consider the entire arsenal available. Building nothing but flamethrower towers that deal short-range AoE fire damage, for example, would eventually lead to flame-resistant enemies with high hit-points. Building nothing but sniper towers might lead to Zerg rush-style fast and numerous enemies to counter the slow, single-target stopping power. The game becomes about finding an effective defense against the existing threat while trying to figure out what the next mutation will likely be.\n\nAs with true evolution, the enemies should have to make trade-offs as they evolve so that they always have weaknesses to exploit. Higher armor at a cost of speed, or higher hit points but fewer enemies in a wave. The player's weaknesses are whatever gaps exist in their defense. The overall power curve could go up with number of enemies and number of towers, as is typical with TD games.\n\nWhat do you think, is this feasible? If so, would it be fun?
1399310129|24sf5m|If someone made this game, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.|This game would be a puzzle game. The character would move through a series of levels, getting Energy powerups along the way. Its every move is controlled by a malevolent outside force. Soon, it realizes this and tries to escape. \nYou, the player, are the malevolent force. The energy powerups are drugs to keep the character docile. When he tries to escape, you must block him and try to manipulate him into the drugs. At the end, you'll have the choice to either let him escape (losing the game with no restarts) or to kill him (winning the game). \nYes, it would be essentially Portal from the POV of Glados.
1423955457|2vx3ay|Spy Messenger: Giver orders and fulfill missions through a fake messaging app|**The basic idea**\n\nWhen opening the (mobile?) game, you reach a "messenger app"-like UI where each contact is actually an NPC with whom you can exchange pre-defined texts. Your goal is to fulfill missions through the intermediary of contacts: you gather information, give orders, and get things done all through messages. As the game progresses, you have more and more useful contacts and more and more complex quests.\n\n**Typical game loop**\n\nFor instance, a mission could consist of stealing someone's phone. All you know at first is the target's name, and the fact that he's already served jail time for robbery.\n\n1. You call the white pages service, and realize 15 persons have the same name.\n1. You call a friend from the police, and give him the name to get criminal records for all persons matching it.\n1. There's only two persons known by this name with criminal records, and only one has served for robbery. Great, you now have his address.\n1. Since it's 2am, the guy must be home. Message another contact and ask him to break into the target's home, and steal the phone.\n1. Moments later, he contacts you back saying he's got it. You tell him where to deliver the phone.\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting stories based on the idea, making things harder and harder to solve. Maybe at some point you'll have unreliable contacts that lie to you, and make you need to track your own contacts... Or people that get killed on the job... Or multiple missions to manage simultaneously, that end up being related to each other... Lots of intricate things to imagine :)\n\nIf made as a mobile game, I also wonder whether it could be interesting to make this game real-time, like there's an actual hour to wait until you burglar reaches the target's house. It could add to the immersion, but it would suddenly be heavily notification-based, not sure I'd like to play that.\n\n**Technical aspects**\n\nI'd say the basic gameplay would be quite affordable for beginners: there's a lot of modeling to do for data, NPCs, possible situations and how everything is linked together, but it does seem quite easy and fun to code. And iterative, too, as you can start small and add features as you go. Also, no graphics! The main challenge is rather to make the pre-defined messages thing work well.
1437927452|3eo531|The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it.|Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.\n\nThe hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. \n\nThe GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.\n\nFinally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.\n\nPlaying with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.

1482138253|5j5gnv|you've died, but you have to rebuild your being and return to your universe to save someone|Here's a concept for a game that I wish existed.\n\nYou've died, and you find yourself in the "recreation realm," only able to see in greyscale, and with no personality, memories, feelings... You're a human soul in a superficial body. You discover, through some helpful exposition from the goddess of creation, that humans are "erased" once they die, and they have new beings, lives, personalities, etc., made for them, then they're born into a new universe (multiple universe + multiple lives theories oooh). However, the goddess holds some people from heading to new universes because their prior universe still needs them. \n\nYou are given a memory of your daughter, which, in turn, gives you your motherly instinct and love. You remember the blue eyes of your daughter and start to see the color blue all around you.\n\nYou're informed that your daughter is in great danger, and that you must rebuild your being and return to your universe to save her. Bits and pieces of your memory, personality, feelings, and color are spread throughout the recreation realm, and you must find them to build enough of a human to return to your universe.\n\nMemories are quick-time sections. When a memory is found (whether it's hidden somewhere, dropped by a boss, or needed for plot), you live that memory. The outcome of a memory affects certain things in the recreation realm, like boss battles, enemies in a certain area, friendly human encounters, spawning of collectibles, etc. The better a memory is executed, the better/easier things are in the recreation realm. They also have a butterfly effect that causes changes in other memories.\n\nEverything starts in black and white except the goddess of creation. Colors (what colors you can see in) are gained through memories (all plot-based memories, ie. required memories). They're unlocked through seeing a colorful something of importance in a memory, like the blue eyes of the daughter, the red color of blood, the bright yellow of the sun, etc. A cutscene would show the shift into seeing things of that new color.\n\nThe game would have multiple endings depending on:\n-how many memories, feelings, and traits are collected\n-how your memories play out (ie. how perfectly you executed the quick-time events)\n\nfor a lot more, but a lot messier, here's a link to the full plot idea: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN83PIZezwMfZyhphWwJgA5olb2UNtJESlHgZiEIDeg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nlet me know your thoughts and feedback. I think this could make a neat comic or novel as well, so if anybody wants to use the concept for anything, just let me know.

1487536873|5v0b98|Archery only FPS|Bit of an odd one, but had the idea for a medieval FPS but almost entirely disregarding melee for archery.\n\nBulk of the fighting is done with bows, crossbows, slings, atlatls (A thing used to fling spears), and slingshots. Melee is still around in a weak tap to swing, not the focus at all. Each weapon also comes with a piece of gear, and you can select a character type to get slightly different attributes.\n\nBows are the good all rounders, good damage, reload, draw speed, so on. So any bows would be geared towards being versatile but they suffer from fairly short range unless you get good at arcing shots. Some could even borrow special abilities from other weapons like ricochet or DoT effects.\n\nCrossbows are the sniper equivalent. Slow reload, but massive damage and instant firing with an accuracy penalty if moving (No aiming down sights, this'd be the only weapon class that would even use it so why bother). Doesn't have much drop off, hence massive range but reloads slowly after a missed shot. Heavier ones would immobilize you when you reload, but lighter ones could be reloaded even while moving or using gear.\n\nSlings are hard to use, but rewarding. Wind up for a longer ranged more powerful shot, but get disrupted if hit during the swing. Let a sling bullet fly on a heavy arc, allowing close or distant shots if accurate and deal good damage. Most would offer a ricochet effect, allowing good slingers to arc or bounce shots around corners, or possibly hit an enemy from behind. Trade of being vulnerable during the wind up and being slowed significantly while doing so.\n\nAtlatls are the heavy weapons. Medium range, average reload, big damage, average wind up. Shots have very little arc allowing for the straightest shots, and can be used for utility by sticking spears in surfaces. Very visible and easy to see however, character making a grunt to give a verbal que a second before they loose the spear.\n\nSlingshots are for the speedsters. Low damage, fast shots, fast reload, short-medium range and a sharp drop off. Shares the sling's ricochet on most variants, are quiet, and can temporarily debuff enemies if shot in the correct areas. Such as a shot to the face to lower accuracy for a second, hitting the elbow to make them restart their draw or wind up, shot to the knee to slow, or shot to the throat for higher damage.\n\n\nHealth would be the same as any game, having tiers of health drops around the map ranging from small, medium, to large.\n\nAmmo is a factor, but can be collected from any dropped weapons just by running over them old tf2 style.\n\n\nGear is something that comes with a weapon, similar to how Splatoon does it. Gear is either reusable or on a recharge, being things like grappling hooks or caltrops respectively.\n\nGrappling hooks would have the obvious use of mobility but could also serve as a secondary weapon that drags enemies closer and damages them. No limits on grappling other than once it hits a surface it must drop on to a roughly horizontal ground to grab on to, allowing you to cling or climb up to it.\n\nWall shields are deployed, up to a few per person but only ever one charged. The shield can be moved if grabbed, being portable defense or to provide cover for as long as their HP holds up and the enemy's projectiles can't penetrate it. So while shields are effective against bullets and bolts, some arrows and most spears will go through them.\n\nCaltrops are barely visible traps that do minor damage, slow significantly in their area and a lesser slow after they've been crossed. However a player may only have one patch out at once, and aren't alerted when they're crossed except for a pain grunt from the victim if they're near by.\n\nBear traps have an obvious effect, more visible than caltrops but way more effective. They slow a target and chain them to only move within a small area until they drag themselves at the edge long enough. Can also be placed on walls for a move obvious trap that deals high damage.\n\nPochette Violin, an instrument which creates a sort of support role for team players. For the user they can play actively to gain a speed boost and slow health regeneration, the same being for nearby allies who also benefit from minor combat buffs like damage, draw speed, etc.\n\nSpyglass to mark a target. To help the team or for a sniper to keep an eye on someone moving in and out of cover. Just watch them for a couple seconds centered in the screen and they are temporarily highlighted. However the spyglass glints light is is fairly visible.\n\nPowder bomb, just a smoke screen. Neither of you can see through it, but good for escapes or blocking off snipers. Also teamwork to hide a trap.\n\nHoly symbols which are used for healing. Hold one up to an ally and heal them. Works on a tether so they have to stay close and in line of sight, but leaves a lingering regeneration. Very slow to take out or put away.\n\nMetal shield, something not suited for lightweight archers and takes both hands to use. However it always blocks damage if you're looking at the projectile.\n\nHawk, a bird of prey to attack enemies and take attention either to line up a shot or make an escape. Deals moderate damage over time but low health and can be outrun by more speedy characters.\n\nBombs, for the alchemists. Recharges fairly fast and you keep a handful at any given time for a reliable secondary weapon option. Short range but has an AoE, visible but high damage. \n\nShrubbery Suit. A stealth option, spend a few seconds using it to hide as a prop or piece of greenery on the map, attacking breaks it and you must wait before you get a new one.\n\nFire pots which can be used to douse the currently loaded shot with fire, enabling it to have damage over time and make a target very visible. However it must be used fast or your own weapon is temporarily disabled.\n\nLastly the character types, used to determine health, ammo, size, and speed.\n\nSquires are the tanks, wearing comparatively heavy armor and bulky. Due to this they are slow but have high health (No actual armor mechanic). Carries the highest amount of ammo and can give out ammo packs.\n\nRogues are small and speedy, but low health and unless using the slingshot or similarly light weapon they have little ammo and must aim their shots. Can draw and use gear faster.\n\nWardens are balanced, no strong stat, no low stat.\n\nSharpshooters are of course snipers. Smallest size, low speed and health, high ammo. Easy to hide but they suffer if they get caught and so should arc their shots to stay hidden. Passively increases the range of all weapons.\n\nTinkerers are oddballs. Medium size, high ammo, slightly lower speed, and slightly lower health. They are able to use ammo types to grant their weapon new attributes like ricochet, DoT, debuffing, marking, or making them leave a trail. 
1494809855|6b7eiv|HITMAN but you're the target|What if in the HITMAN series you played 47s target and had to escape or take on your would be assassin?\n\n\nThat's the basic concept for this Strategic-Stealth- Action video game idea.\n\n\nYou would play a character who is a regular person who for unknown reasons to him/her has had a contract put out on them.\nThe story would involve the playable character trying to figure out why this is happening whilst evading multiple assassins.\n\n\nYou quickly learn an assassin is on your tail so players can jump straight into action. From here you would have two choices in this level based game. Avoid being killed and escape or take on your would be killer.\n\n\nTo avoid being killed you would have to figure out who your hunter is and find the safest exit.\n\n\nor you can use your surroundings to take out the assassin. Like in the HITMAN games you could set up "booby traps" to defend yourself or even find a weapon and take on the killer.\n\n\nThis would be level based just like HITMAN. And your actions in one level have consequences on the next.\n\n\nLet's say you don't kill the assassin in level 1 then that assassin would follow you to the next level depending on which exit you take. There could be 4 exits to a map each with their own safety rating. For example if you decide to leave through the front door of a building it allows more eyes to be on you. but if you go through a sewage system there is less likely chance people would see.\n\n\nYour stealthiness and exit decision have an effect on your notoriety. If your evasion and escape were clumsy then your bounty rises and more assassins become interested. So in Level 2 you could have two assassins after you if you didn't kill the last guy which would obviously make things more difficult for the player BUT you can still use this more dangerous situation to your advantage. The assassins want to collect the reward themselves so if they figure out another assassin is trying to beat them to the punch they wouldn't be too happy and you can get them to see each other and fight, taking the heat off of you.\n\n\nIn an ideal world this game would be third person.\n\n\nApologies if the pitch is jumbled or unclear. If I have enough feedback for this post I will return and write up a more detailed and clear pitch.\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read.

1472937254|510u3q|The One Trope That Spider-man/Superhero Games Never Use - Until Now|Imagine a game where you balance maintaining a secret identity (because people make life worth living) and protecting a city/population (because that's where your people live.) \n\nIt's a superhero sandbox action platformer with two point-based scales, *City Safety* and *Secret Identity*, that govern which random city events appear, what character progressions are available, and how the world reacts to the character. \n\nThe player always can switch between two skins, civies and tights, which allow the player to enter events as time progresses through three periods: morning, afternoon and night. \n\nWhen the player selects "Change," they trigger a 10-second action that reduces movement speed to 10% and stops a few actions. After spawning, you can walk outside of your bedroom window, hit the Change, and after a 10-second delay, you are wearing your superhero costume. \n\nAlong with experience points, damage statuses, and unlocking new abilities, the main character also has a few Sims-like needs (Love, Comfort, Sanity, Hope) that get refueled or supercharged by attending civilian events. For instance, you need normal sanity and high comfort in order to discover new superhero moves. Have above-average romance scores? Then you'll have a damage boost. \n\n-The details of the meta-concept-\nThe game system measures two 1,000-point scales: your **secret identity** and **city safety.** \n\nCity:                 Scary                      Safe\n           -500                ... -1,  0 ...               +500\nIdentity:           Public                      Secret\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **Secret Identity**, the game behaves as if your identity is secret. \n&gt;  You gain the full benefit of attending civilian events (gain Identity points, boosts to health, sanity, etc.)\n&gt;  Putting on your Civies turns you invisible to enemies (except enemies who have a Knows! tag or status.)  \n&gt;  Interacting with Normals or Beloveds allow you to invest relationship points with them. \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if your identity is public. \n&gt;  You gain noticeably lower benefits of attending civilian events. \n&gt;  Enemies see past your Civies -- and there's now a 50% chance of random enemies during civilian events.\n&gt;  Beloveds can self-downgrade to Normal, and Normals may choose to ignore the player.\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **City Safety**, the game behaves as if the city is safe.\n&gt;  You gain City points from patrolling in your costume. Upon death/KO, you respawn in clinics or low-security cells at the local precinct.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of small-scale skirmishes (muggings, etc.)\n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events only 10% of the time.  \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if the city is scary. \n&gt;  Upon death/KO, you resapawn in high-security cells - and lose 500 identity points. No points for patrol.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of large-scale problems (bombings, block fires, etc.) \n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events 60% of the time.\n\n\nAs the hero, you patrol the city and resolves random enemy events -- which give strength points and city points, for raising City Danger score. Swoop in, beat up the bad guys, help the elderly across the crosswalk, stop the villains. You know the drill. \n\nAs the person, you build your character by building your character's life. Now, pay attention. \nThe game's schedule moves through three periods: morning, afternoon, and night. Civilian events happen in predictable places during those schedules. In the morning, civilian events pop up at the school. In the afternoon, they pop up in the city. At night, they pop up at home.\n\nEach event requires your attendance (and any other gimmick you want) and yields the character bonuses when you're present for their ending. When you activate a civilian event, you control time - speeding up or slowing down the schedules. And you're only required to be present at the beginning and at the end to get the rewards. \n\nWant an example? \n&gt; It just turned night. The player is in the city, dressed in tights. The HUD shows that it's night, and a pop-up announces an event, "Dinner's Ready!", and there's only 90 seconds to activate it. The player chooses to stay in costume (to protect their identity) and superhumanly flies to their home, a house in the suburbs. On approach, the house is lit in green, and a perimeter around the civilian event marks the boundary the player must cross in civilian clothes. The player lands after 30 seconds of flight, goes into some cover, activates the Change Clothes, waits 10 seconds more, and walks across the perimeter. Onscreen text, a mini-cut-scene, whatever flavor signals the beginning of the event -- and the HUD guides the player to an object to activate (in this case a seat at the dinner table). After activating the seat, the player fast-forwards through time... and the player sees the relevant character stats that will increase: health, sanity, comfort, secret identity scores. Also, pop-ups on the HUD show Night events happening. However, city danger is already high and the character's stats are middling. The player chooses to stay at the event. In-game flavor text, character interaction, etc. simulate the dinner at home. At the end of the 20-40 second fast forwarded event, the player has seen 4-5 city events pop up. However, the civilian event ends - and the rewards are registered to the character's sheet. The player's now standing inside their home, and their HUD registers 3 other civilian events in the area - upstairs, next door, etc. The player pauses the game to check City Safety and Secret Identity stats. City Safety has gone up pretty high (200 points) as a result of ignoring them. However, the player's comfort and love bars are just shy of unlocking more moves or triggering a story event. What do you do? \n&gt; The player chooses to activate the next-door event: "Date Night." The player moves toward that perimeter and, already in civies, triggers it. Flavor text and in-game cinematics show the girlfriend wants to watch a movie together. Activate the couch. Stats of Love, Comfort, Health and Sanity show up as potential rewards if the player finishes this event in the perimeter. The player fast-forwards the event until another city event appears on the pop-up HUD. That'll be worth some 80 points if it gets resolved. The player stops fast-forwarding, deactivates the couch, walks in his civies into cover near the house where no one will see him change, changes, and leaves the house. The Date Night timer continues, at a normal pace, and signals that the player isn't present to collect the rewards. The player hustles through the city event, a grocery robbery - except his mom (who was present for the Dinner's Ready! event) is also a hostage. In superhero garb, the player gets his mom to a police safety point, goes back into the grocery and disarms/disables the robbers. There's about 20 seconds left in Date Night! and the player really wants the story event and rewards. He zips as fast as he can back to the Date Night! perimeter (15 seconds left), and hits the Change Clothes - moving across the barrier at 25% normal pace and unable to jump. He's in the barrier and moving toward the couch, still changing. Because he's in the same room with girlfriend character while Changing Costumes, the Secret Identity score goes down 5 points and the girlfriend gets the tag "Suspicious." It'll take another complete civilian event with her to remove the tag. Don't need to worry about that now. With 5 seconds left, the player activates the couch, concludes Date Night!, and gets the rewards. The player's now standing in the girlfriend's house. City Danger is now 120 points short of where it was before Dinner's Ready!; the player can activate a training event to unlock new moves; the girlfriend's "Suspicious" tag could be a big deal; and already another two civilian events are on the HUD and there's only time for one more before school tomorrow morning. Which do you do now? \n\nDo you get it? \n\nThis game has one sandbox -- but essentially two worlds happening at the same time. Players choose which side they need to tend to. \n\nThey make their choices based on any of a dozen factors: \n* The City Danger and Secret Identity scores\n* Which character building goals do they want to hit (unlocking moves, costumes, etc.)? \n* Story or training events they can unlock\n* Shuffling their lives around to accommodate a superhero's life -- meaning, creating a girlfriend out of a fellow superhero to have dates that also add to city scores. \n* Progressing through story events to further their life: high school graduation, college, jobs, normal careers\n\n**Sounds nice, but what happens at the fringes of the rules?** \nAccidentally change costume in Times Square? You can steadily recover your secret identity with civilian events, and Special events (faking the hero death, getting a costume double), only triggered when the Secret Identity score is really low, can yield major Secret Identity bonuses. \n\nDoes Mom die in a supervillain event? You can always befriend new Beloveds out of the Normals population. Until you do, you'll notice fewer civilian events are around to boost your character. \n\nDo you lose all your HP during a supervillain fight? You'll respawn in their lair (a pre-drawn escape level), the villain will have the Knows! tag, and you'll now need to worry about that supervillain showing up during a civilian event -- until you convince them with a special event or until game events kill them.  \n\nI can see the game clearly in my mind as if I've been playing it for years. It's like I came from an alternate universe where this game already exists, and I'm just remembering it. \n\nSo ask me any questions.  
1486867627|5tj7id|[META] Why do we allow requests?|It seems like every day I see a post demanding the community produce a good idea for OP. I thought this sub was for suggesting ideas and building on them together, rather than for making posts when you can't think of anything on your own.\n\nAm I totally off-base here? I do certainly see good ideas being posted, and I understand requesting ideas when you have a foundation, but low quality "I need a game idea" posts seem a bit ridiculous. 
1414594926|2kohuo|It's called: You Are The Sword|For some years I simply have not had the time to keep programming and trying to properly realise my game ideas. So here: I'm throwing one of them out into the aether to see what y'all think of it. Please upvote and share if you like it and I can give you more info.\n\nOur protagonist starts at the bottom of a tower with many separate floors. The aim is to get to the top of the tower. The tower is populated by many adventurers seeking to do the same thing. So far, so cliche and uninteresting.\n\nHere's the twist (and working title): **You Are The Sword**.\n\nWhen the character holding you dies, you drop to the floor, and, evetnually, you're picked up by another character who you then gain control over. In some sense the game can never end until you win - which allows us to amp up the difficulty significantly of course.\n\nInspirations: Dwarf Fortress and Sword Art Online, primarily.\n\nOK there's a lot more to this idea that would require a lot (a **lot**) of programming. But that's the very basic idea. I can go on about it more in the comments if you are interested. Imagine all the cool things about dwarf fortress (persistence, random gen, etc.) but in a dungeon crawler. It's pretty cool. Throw in all your classic RPG elements, only with this curveball that your character can completely change at any time.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more.\n\nEdit: someone wanted more information up front rather than in discussion below, so I'll do what I can.\n(NB. there's a lot more here than the basic idea, and I'm well aware of what a colossal amount of work this would be to code!)\n\nBASIC GAME PITCH\n\n* you are a parasitic sword who takes control of your wielder\n* your aim is to get to the top of the tower - you start at the ground floor\n* there are a fixed number of randomly generated adventurers in the tower, and when one dies, a new one enters\n* adventurers wander through the tower fighting monsters on different floors, and perhaps each other\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\n\n* adventurers are procedurally generated at the start of the game, along with the maps of each of the tower's floors, monsters and bosses (a la Dwarf Fortress)\n* adventurers have classic rpg stats alongside temperament stats (which grades them on scales of aggressiveness/passivity, bravery/cowardice, honour/treachery etc.) . This dictates their interactions with other adventurers and their actions more generally\n* monsters get tougher as you go up the tower\n\nSWORDS\n\n* every adventurer climbing the tower needs a sword. You start out getting picked up by some level one scrub at the bottom floor of the tower\n* some swords are special - let's call them soul swords. You're one of them. Soul swords take over the mind of the wielder and are soulbound (cannot be unequipped till death) You're not necessarily the only one...\n* swords level up as their wielders level up\n\nADVENTURERS\n\n* adventurers level up as they fight monsters and grow stronger\n* there are a fixed number of adventurers, so it's technically possible to record all interactions between advs, all injuries sustained, and all rivalries/friendships etc. If you've played dwarf fortress you know the kind of thing I'm talking about: Brian's left toe is broken sort of thing\n* some advs play dirty - if they are 'evil' enough, they might kill other advs for their gear, or because they don't like them. If you're unlucky, your character won't just get killed by their sworn enemy, but you will *become* their sworn enemy. Still, it's probably better than being left on the ground.\n\nTHE TOWER\n\n* for now let's say the tower has 20 floors. Adventurers likewise can level from 1 to 20. They can only access the floor they have hit the level of. Similarly for equipping weapons and armour.\n\nPARTIES\n\n* in order to to tackle bigger monsters, at some point advs have to go out in parties. As a low-level character, you can expect to be resigned to signing up for an available outing with a party looking for another member.\n\n* as your repute grows (of the character, not the sword) you might be able to lead your own parties, by finding other weaker (or less famous) advs to follow you\n\nDEATH\n\n* when an adv dies, their gear falls to the ground. If that includes you, you won't be spared. You lie there in the dirt until a friend claims it, or a adv considers you an upgrade, or, if you're really unlucky, some low level scrub picks you up looking for a cheap buck by selling you on. The higher level you are, the more chance you will find your way to the hands of someone as mighty as your last wielder. Otherwise, you have to work your way back up again.\n\nSTORY (because why the hell not?)\n\n*Nemesis stands at the top of the Tower of Fate, looking down at your battered corpse. She knows that only seconds from now, your body will judder back to life whether you wish it or not. So she does what she did to all the others: as your spirit returns to flow like water into your recently departed body, she catches it in a vial of sand and corks it. It is all you can do to juggle yourself out of her grasp. The vial smashes on the floor and you reach once more for your body. But it is too far away, and the sand weighs you down. Enough sand lands on the sword for your spirit to find a place in the metal to hide. But it has been to long now. Your body is dead.*\n\n*Nemesis kicks your body, your sword and your spirit over the side of the tower with a curse. Now she is the last of the gods, free to feed off all those who dare to reach the top of her tower. Only you can stop her now, but you have fallen to the very bottom of the world, your body smashed to pieces. You are not you anymore.*\n\n*You Are The Sword.*
1430925576|352f8f|A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam|The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., "What did you have for breakfast today?" or "Where do you live?". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable "hallucinations" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness.
1387667572|1tfajy|You will probably not read this, but I need to get this concept out of my head.|A game that I call 'Psychosis', I don't know if this has been done, in that case tell me.\n\nIt's a horror game, where you start in a abandoned hospital with a head injury/amnesia, the\nhospital starts out normal and clean, but once a nurse comes in there's no eyes just holes,\nthis causes the game to go in slow motion and your heartbeat goes louder.\nAfter she leaves you try to escape the hospital. Other people, patients and nurses \nstart out as ghosts/human like creatures and the closer you get to the exit the more scarier they become\n(as well as making the hospital more scarier, moving walls, more worn out, darker, until it's pretty much abandon)\nmaking the player to start attacking them the using various weapons found in the hospital.\nThis causes police and guards to come and try to arrest you, however, to the player they appear\nlike monsters. You escape and go through a almost like typical horror game except you attack\nothers, the longer you wait the scarier/more gross they become. "The Cops" hunts you\nand you'll have to escape to your farm (this is the only objective and the only thing your character remembers).\nAs you progresses through the game, it becomes darker and scarier.\nRight before you reach your farm, you're arrested/kidnapped by the monsters.\nYoul'll then placed in a room with the only normal looking person in the game.\nHe explains to you that you're a hallucinating schizophrenic and had a psychosis,\nhe tells you you've killed countless peoples lives (now you'll get flashbacks from a "normal"perspective"\nshowing you killing innocent men, women, and children) and that you've been the main newstory\nall week and been hunted by the government. Revealing you have been a psychopath.\nYour character can't accept it and kills the psychologist and tries to escape in a \n["Black ops revelations"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02DUaeo9iw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=61) type of mission, getting flashbacks seeing yourself killing people\nwithout regret, your character finally breaks down and kills himself with a gun from a guard. The End.\nThe backstory is you were put in a mental hospital at a young age, one day you're attacked\nby another patient, landing you in the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry it sounds a bit weird, but it has been in my head for a couple of days\nand I can't really get the concept out of my head.\n\nThe thing is, it has to be really well executed. The regular people have to act\nlike normal people just looking scary to the player, the cops are the only ones attacking you first.\nIt's kinda inspired by Postal 2's Apocalypse Weekend.\nIt should be extremely bloody and not using as much jump-scares but more psychological horror.\nFocusing on the feeling of being alone and followed. One defining moment should be\nkilling a monster up close, cutting its throat, looking into human eyes. Moments showing something's\nwrong should be popping up through the entire game.\n\n**TL;DR: You kill monsters in a apocalyptic world, in the end revealing you're a psycho running around killing\ninnocent people.**\n\nIt's still just an idea, so tips, ideas and critique are welcomed. I've also thought of this as a movie and a book, but a game seemed like the best.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1391828601|1xbt80|Dolphin Call of Duty|So the basic premise is that you are on a team of 128 dolphins in the Pacific ocean. There is another team of dolphins. One team are ninjas and one are pirates. You are using class appropriate weapons. The last dolphin standing then becomes ninja or pirate god. This gets them special buffs the next game.\n\nAlso. Motion controls.
1474681272|54855i|Break-In|When the game starts out, your character is an ordinary man with a wife, kids and a pet in an ordinary house. The news says that there have been break-ins in the neighborhood. You must first go around the house and try to remember what you have so you'll know if something gets stolen.\n\nWhen you judge yourself done with that, you go to sleep. The next morning, there's signs of a break-in. You must figure out what's stolen and use clues to figure out how the burglar got in and what kind of items he's targeting. Some will just be targeting money, some jewelry, some food, some electronics, and some will come for anything valuable.\n\nThen, using that information, you must use your remaining items to create a trap that will catch the burglar in the act. You can also use money to go to buy things from the store across the street, or ask neighbors to lend your something, but if the neighbor's things get stolen, they will be angry at you and won't lend you stuff in the future, and they even make you compensate them for it.\n\nSome burglars you may have to be robbed by multiple times before you can find a pattern in their burglaries. When you catch one, the police reward you with more money that you can use to make traps for future burglars. You get a new burglar each time you catch one.\n\nOnce you get far into the game, you may even encounter burglars that are looking to murder your family members, rather than stealing things. There's no telling what order those will go in, but they always go for you last, so you have a limited number of nights (One night for each family member and pet) to catch them before you lose the game. Lets say we make the player have a wife, a son, two daughters, and a dog. The murderer may kill the dog first, they may kill the son first, or they may kill the wife or one of the daughters first. After he gets through them all, though, at one per night, he kills you and you lose the game. Each family member you lose is dead for the rest of the game, but perhaps we could have an adoption center in the game to get more kids (adopting a kid just to use him/her as a meat shield isn't very ethical, but oh well), a shelter to adopt more pets from, and a mail-order bride service. These would all cost money, and have a chance of not working that increases if you let too many die. (I did a background check, and you've had 3 kids in a row get killed the day after you adopted them. We can't give you another. Sorry, sir.)
1454265221|43k7w0|On rail mm shooter|To preface, this is a half baked idea that I'm posting from my phone because I'm worried I'll forget about it.\n\nThe idea: a simplistic 5v5 (csgo stylish) fps, with the twist of before every round there is a one minute period to draw the rail your character will follow.\n\nWhen a character finishes their rail, they will be able to draw on more, but while they do they will be vulnerable to being attacked, so the rail creation would have to be well thought out\n\nSorry I can't write more I'm at an event but I feel while this is a simplistic idea with flaws, it could possibly be of interest to someone :)\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n
1501518768|6qpkfz|VR Horror in a Wheelchair!|What is the biggest issue facing VR games right now? Its the movement. Combining motion controls with VR sacrifices a players freedom of movement. However there is a perfect solution to this that would also serve as an incredible premise for a horror game; put them in a wheelchair!\nThat's right. While playing, the player would sit in a standard chair. To move, they would put their hands next to their hips and sort of toss them forward. In game, their character is actually in a wheel chair, and they are effectively grabbing the virtual wheels and giving them a spin. They can turn left and right by turning the wheels in opposite ways, and can also move backwards.\nNow apply this control scheme to a horror game. It takes place in, say, a hospital. The scary things will be chasing the player in a wheelchair, and they will frantically be spinning the wheels trying to escape; all while having the ability to turn their head around and look at the pursuing horror. \nThe mechanics could also incorporate the ability for the player to crawl around without the wheel chair, simply by using their arms to pull themselves along the floor. This creates some even scarier scenarios. The monsters can smack the wheelchair, sending the player flying out of it. The player can fall down stairs. Perhaps there will be moments where the player must explore an area without their wheelchair, crawling in dark, cramped spaces while something stalks them.\nSome issues; the constant arm gestures might get exhausting, the pace would be slow, and I imagine VR would be hella expensive and difficult to dev for. But I think this would have the potential to be one of the scariest games ever made.

1437118107|3dlnyi|You're a ghost who must setup freak accidents in a contract with Death!|This game is set on a modern, populated island with a few hundred residents and a northeastern always-cloudy-and-gloomy atmosphere. They all have generic routines around the house; making breakfast, watching TV, mowing the lawn, going to bed, etc..., and most of them have jobs they travel to on the island.\nYou're an invisible ghost. You were once a resident of the island but you were murdered by an unknown killer. Death has spared you eternity in the abyss, for now, under the condition that you help him cross a number of names off his list. As an added bonus, he'll eventually let you get revenge on the person who killed you before the story took off.\nSo, the gameplay.\nYou cannot simply ghost-punch people in the face and kill them, but instead, you have to CAUSE their deaths through moving objects in game and setting up traps and freak accidents like an ill placed toy at the top of the stairs that no one was paying attention to because it wasn't there just a second ago. \nYou have to observe a little and figure out your victims routines for everything to go smoothly. The more bold your actions are, the more likely it is that someone will notice strange things happening in their home. If Ms. Jones notices the toaster sitting by the bathtub then she will carry herself in much more suspect manner and make things more difficult for you, and if she turns a corner and sees a kitchen knife floating in mid-air, ...she may very well call the exorcist. If the exorcist arrives in the home you are at, surviving his encounter will give you a fresh start on the mission, but if he successfully exercises the home then you will be banished from it until you are strong enough to reenter (and you become stronger with each death you cause). As you progress and do become stronger, you slowly work your way to the title of a demon. At this level of strength you may actually give someone a little nudge while they're on a ladder or something similar, but  once again, the more bold your actions are - the more risk you take. At this stage you may attract the attention of guardian angels, and without taking any sides or getting too religious, if a guardian is alerted to your presence then your only hope is to very stealthily avoid it and cause an accidental death (for gameplay/balance reasons). \nIt's obviously a dark narrative and if it were fleshed out properly would be restricted in a few countries, but I think it scores points for originality, concept, and boldness. There are plenty of other details I've thought of for the game but I'd like to hear what someone else says about the basic premise, the mechanics of it, and what they'd add or remove. Very open to criticism!

1471768864|4ytxiq|You can freeze time and can act while it's frozen. You need to defuse catastrophic situations. You'll see the (successful or failed) outcome when you resume time.|With all the interesting mechanics we've seen (e.g. rewinding time in "Life is strange"), this is certainly not just doable, but the time is also right for this.\n\nI'm just watching "Heroes" on Netflix (which isn't bad, currently at S1:E7) which inspires this idea. A car is exploding. People are around. Parts will probably fly around. The explosion will probably consume a person or two. Time is frozen. What to do? Which object needs to be moved, changed, used? etc.\n\nThe player could be confronted with all kinds of such situations, can alter them, and when they resume time, the consequences are calculated (e.g. via physics engine, but also people's reactions to things suddenly being (re)moved etc.). A "simple" version of this game could come down to a score evaluation of the outcome, but the more sophisticated version that I hope we'll be able to pull off in the coming years is one where the whole game's event development is tied to these situations and their outcomes, possibly even without predefined freeze points but arbitrary (albeit recharging) freezing power, so ideally it would just be a simulation happening over time, and you can "adjust" it at will, except you'll have to put up with the many side-effects, the emergent situations etc.

You roam a big open map pulling aggro of the monsters that roam there. They will run up your ramps, onto your fortress and try to get to the core. Your towers will kill them, and any loot that they drop on your fortress is yours.\n\nLoot could be various resources for building and upgrading your towers, special towers, or equipable upgrades to give your towers unique abilities. \n\nAs you roam and get stronger you will be able to go into more difficult areas, fight stronger monsters and get better loot.

Research better anal probes to learn more about the humans to keep them happier in their enclosure. \n\nIn regular zoo games you have different animals so its easy to diversify. How would I create diversity here? I'm thinking of doing it by profession. So for a lawyer, its enclosure would be a desk. For a sports star you might need a bigger enclosure with a field, and it would do tricks for the crowd. 
1499367968|6lo07w|L.A. Noire, but Blade Runner|Cyberpunk, IMO, is due for a comeback. The gritty, fantastical, dramatic visuals of cyberpunk mixed with a genre already known for including Noire elements is a good fit. The movie Blade Runner showed that nicely, and the dramatic visuals would simply be nice to walk around in (while having plenty of examples to take inspiration from). The Asian influence in both L.A. Noire and Blade Runner would make for a good mash-up.\n\nTechnologically, the point-cloud approach is actually still good-looking and computers can handle the data better now than when L.A. Noire was made.\n\nBut from a gameplay perspective, you get something completely new: you're not just trying to discover if the suspect is lying, you're trying to discover if they're even human.\n\nThe cases in L.A. Noire did take you to a few cool places in 1940s Los Angeles, and the Hollywood angle is always a good fit with Noire. But in a cyberpunk setting, the missions would allow for a level of world and lore discovery that is much more interesting, unique, and new since you don't already understand the world you're investigating. So many elements of dystopian sci-fi could have really interesting applications for crime that you'd not considered before. For example:\n\n* To cover up a murder, a man frames a clone or replicant of himself.\n\n* To fake his own death, a man might make a clone of himself and kill the clone (which doesn't have his memories). Does the man get charged with murder? Is it a lesser crime?\n\n* Everyone is ID'd using iris scanning. You find and break up an illegal eye-replacement ring.\n\n* The sheer amount of stuff that the government is recording of a person could be huge, and there would be creative ways of deceiving the 24/7 surveillance of the populous.\n\n* A spaceship gets back to earth and you must solve a crime that happened when everyone was in cryostasis and was committed 700 years ago.\n\n* Take anything from Futurama, really: advertising in your dreams, suicide booths, whatever. These could all add really bizarre twists to an investigation.

1446249293|3qwouw|Idea for a Shooter using a dismemberment system [X-POST from /r/Gaming]|Someone told me to post this here after having posted it in [This Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3qug9q/tis_but_a_scratch/cwixm9v?context=3)\n\nI've always imagined a sort of zombie war game with this kind of dismemberment mechanic. The story was basically going to be that countries began turning their dead soldiers into zombies to fight wars because they feel no pain, and players would play as these zombie soldiers on one side and humans on the other in basic game types like CTF or Deathmatch, Survival (both against waves of zombies *or* humans), etc. You'd have stuff like zombies legs being blown off by mines only to have them keep crawling along the ground with a gun in one hand, or if they only had one arm left they'd crawl up to the enemy and try and grab them to sort of "stun" them, while dealing biting damage. Or, crawl up behind a human player, the zombie pulls the pin on their own grenade, SURPRISE!\n\nGot both arms blown off? Run at the humans in a suicide mauling attempt. Got one leg? You'll still be crawling pretty fast and can shoot just fine. Want a longer melee range? At the sacrifice of one of your arms and the ability to shoot anything but one-handed firearms you can rip it off and use it like a spear with the knife in that hand.\n\nI pictured it as being a sort of goofy game where the story wouldn't really matter all that much. The zombies would be "intelligent", but they'd still be utter dopes, while the humans would probably be anything from satirical portrayals of the "ACTION HERO AMERICA" archetype to the gritty survivor archetype and other ridiculous stuff. Mainly multiplayer, it'd be something along the lines of TF2 (Though, not sure what would be a good replacement for mountains of hats). Someone also mentioned this could make an interesting RTS. I'd have to think more about how that'd work but I've always been somewhat of a fan.
1443800974|3n8llh|The gun that doesn't want to kill|To preface, this is a game I want to make, but with little, meaning zero, experience in game development and no idea where to start, I understand it's likely to never become a reality, and as depressing as that sounds I'd much rather write then develop, though one day I do hope to write for games, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe initial idea was a gun that didn't want to kill, and it bloomed from there.\n\nThe game starts on a sort of old power point esque type of scene, you know, the kind of the thing you see at the fallout 3 start screen? These "panels" tell the story of a group of scientists who were, years ago, intent on developing a weapon that had true artificial intelligence, to give useful intel and combat support in the middle of a fire fight. They succeeded in both creating the AI, and installing it into a simple gun, naming it P.A.G. (Personal Assistant Gun). However, Pags personality proved to be difficult. \n\nHe didn't want to kill. This weapon intended to murder and take lives on a battlefield was making a choice, or trying to at least. Despite being installed into a gun, and having access to several powerful sensors and other neat features, he has no control over his actual functionality as a gun, so he could not stop himself from firing when his trigger was pulled.\n\nThis made him very angry, and he would constantly, and very vocally protest to all his tests, even screaming at his creators to stop forcing him to be a weapon. It was decided that even though they could mute Pag, there was no use in a weapon that didn't want to kill, and would most likely be more detrimental then a help to anyone on an actual battlefield. \n\nFast forward some odd years, and our silent protagonist steps in, being assigned to guard duty at a well known research base. During his first night they are, of course, attacked. The enemy catches the base off guard, storming in, killing many scientists and soldiers alike. Our protagonist wakes up after being knocked out cold from a near by explosions, looking up to see soldiers passing over him, and many other corpses, putting a bullet in any head that moved. The protagonist, with a whole lot of luck is able to stay still, and avoid being killed then and there. \n\nHe makes his way through the now mostly destroyed facility, and finds himself inside an old research wing. Here he finds himself a gun, but it is an odd one, with strange lights, and it's plugged into a wall. He's never seen anything like it, but he picks it up and plans his escape. \n\nWhile moving down a corridor he's spotted by enemy combatants, and is forced to shoot and kill them both (there are 2), but upon firing at the first, the gun springs to life, and cries out, confused and jolted. At first it sounds terrified, afraid, and then asks if the it's wielder just killed some body, then goes through an almost traumatic seeming moment of "oh no", as if it's in some sort of disbelief. \n\nAs the game progresses many more enemies confront our silent killer, the player being forced to either kill them, or die. All the while the gun is screaming, yelling, and even at times begging you to stop, to put him down so he doesn't have to kill again.\n\nDuring the down times, to quiet points, he talks to you, he tells you what it's like to be an intelligent being shoved into something he hates so much, how he wishes only to help, not take lives, and one day he even dreams of becoming a flare gun, so that he can save people rather then kill them. Though, over time the gun realizes you won't stop killing, that you'll do anything to survive, and begins to criticize you more harshly, saying things like "You know those people had families, mother, fathers, spouses waiting for them. They'll never see them alive again because of you."\n\nAt the start Pag is confused, and tries to convince you to stop killing, that you can just sneak by, or even run, but as the game progresses he comes to hate you, to understand that you don't care what he thinks, that you'll use his body however you see fit, and his hopeful determination to stop you becomes a simpering, dark hatred towards the protagonist. \n\nTruth is this is a little dumbed down, and I don't really know how the ending would go. Though, I think it would be fun to find out.
1478227983|5b1957|Your total stats never increases, but when you level up, you can rearrange them to crush enemies|It's a real-time RPG. You start off with average stats in every category. For example, 10 categories, 10 points in each.\n\nLeveling up, you can switch them on the fly and absolutely crush enemies. 90 points in melee attack to kill one monster, then a split second later 90 points in ranged defense to block an attack.\n\nIt's very high-risk, high-reward. You need good reflexes to rearrange them on the fly. Also, you can only rearrange a few points at first. So you have to level up before you do anything crazy.
1498469659|6jk2tn|An MMO about hitchhiking|Okay this might seem pretty stupid at first, but bear with me:\n\nThis game would take place in a very large map with plenty of small towns in the center and a few major cities along the edges. It would also have very extensive roads. Every session would have from 75 to 100 players and last up to 3 hours. All players will spawn around the center of the map, well away from each city, with one of the large cities being their destination. Most players will spawn with money and no car, but others will spawn with a car, but no money. The map would be so extensive that it would take too long for a single person to walk from the center of the map to a city, so they would have to depend on someone with a car to pick them up and drive them to their destination. The drivers would need the hitchhikers for their money, to pay for maintanence of the car, and also food for their passengers. Simutaniously, the hitchhikers would need the drivers, so that they can get to their destination. The goal of this game is to be social, without being intimidating, as a lot of mmos are. The car rides will be long, and you'll have nothing to do but to talk with the other passengers or your driver. Interaction would be essential as you would have to share the money, and the ride, and also communicate eachothers needs. The way I imagine it is sort of like a reverse PUBG, where instead of killing everyone on sight on a massive map, you're helping everyone on sight on an even bigger map than PUBG's. Also a tiny bit like Euro Truck simulator, where the majority of your time will be spent in the car, on a relaxing drive with friendly strangers.

1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1422047947|2tg1o0|A game where you have to make someone late for work|The game consists of you, a god-like character, controlling the world similar to the Sims.  You watch over a person going through their typical morning routine before they leave for work.  It is randomized every time, so while you have no idea exactly what they'll do at every time, it will be a traditional shower/eat/dress type of thing.  You have no control over what the character does, but you will be changing everything around them.\n\nYou will have a limited number of "action points" that will let you change the world around this character, and will let you do absolutely anything.  You can change the timer on the toaster oven so it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.  You can make the phone ring when he/she is in the shower.  You can interact with every single object and move it, break it, or alter it in a realistic way.  You can only affect objects individually, so you can not do things like use a lighter to light a newspaper on fire, or anything like that.\n\nThere are two catches that will make you "fail" your mission.  \n\nThe first one is, you can't kill the character, either intentionally or accidentally.  If you make him slip on the floor and he hits his head too hard, causing him to die, you lose.  The character MUST be in working condition, so even hospitalizing them will cause you to fail.\n\nThe second catch is that the character cannot detect that his world is being interfered with by a higher power.  If you take his car keys and make them float in midair, he/she will freak out and won't go to work.  \n\nThe character's routine will change based on every action you do, and it's totally possible for them do skip breakfast or leave without ironing their pants, so it's not as simple as, do a thing and it makes them late.  It's important to use action points on things that will affect the most important tasks and tasks that are done near the end of the routine.  Different actions also cost different points, so while hiding the car keys under the bed may completely throw your character off, it will also cost an enormous amount of points, and may not be the best way to achieve the goal.\n\nThe appeal would be the replay value.  Every game will feature a new character with a new job, a new routine, and every house will have hundreds of objects to inspect and mess with.  Most of the time spent developing the game would go towards creating objects, so you could play for 50 hours and still be coming up with new ways to cause controlled chaos.  After all, it is a sandbox strategy game.

Or game ideas? :P
1489693656|5zstwv|Game where the edge of the screen is a physical element in the game?|I'm thinking a 2D sidescrolling game, but the camera doesn't move with the player. The player's movement is controlled with the left analogue stick or wasd, while the screen is moved with up, down, left, and right or right analogue stick. If you try to go off-screen, the edge acts like a wall/floor/ceiling. You could use this by jumping off of the edge of the screen, or moving the bottom above a hazard to hold you up. However, this would also inhibit your ability to "look around" safely, and at times you may have to act fast to get the screen into the right position.\n\nThis could be for PC, console, smartphone, whatever.

1497668253|6hr5p1|A game that deteriorates over time. Let me explain.|I found a good idea online of a kind of RPG that deteriorate over time. Let me explain.\n\nYou start out with it just being a normal day in [insert name of town] and then something happens, say, you find something you're not supposed to (give me suggestions) and then you tell somebody (something else you shouldn't have done) and it sets out a "curse" on humanity. Everything starts going weird. Physics start to go awry and people start to deteriorate into things like zombies or "monsters". (Suggest names below) I am thinking the infected humans have a face that is made of polygons, and they are ruthless killing machines. Basically everything turns to hell and you have to make it out if this fucked up nightmare you call a life. The plot twist is that the way of getting out is killing yourself. Once you die, the game shows you what really happened. What really happened is that you went insane, killed a bunch of people, including your family, and everyone around. You got caught, locked up in jail, and finally..... killed yourself. All because of something supernatural that you SHOULDN'T have stumbled upon. It was nobody's fault but yours.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you buy this game? Would you kick start it if I decided to learn basic and intricate game development and made it? Please. Don't steal my idea. I at least want to get credit for the idea if you beat me to making it.\n\n----EDIT----\n\n\n*(   ) = pronunciations\n\n\nYou play as a white male named Sean (Shawn). He works for the Black Crystal Bay Police Department. He's American, about 5'9, 154 lbs, Muscular-ish with Blue eyes, Brown hair, an average sized nose, is 27 years old, and a Wife named Signe (Sig-Nee). Signe is Asian, 5'3 exactly, ---Don't ask how much she weighs. that's rude!---, slim stature, red hair, blue eyes, a small nose, and is 25 years old. She works as a nurse at Black Crystal Bay hospital.\n\n[WARNING]  ---IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING THIS GAME, BEWARE, THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD---  [WARNING]\n\nYou start out with it just being a normal day in Black Crystal Bay, America, and then you get called into a mass murder-suicide scene, where a cop killed a bunch of people and then killed himself. You, a detective and 3 other cops search the murderers house, and you find a shrine to Satan. You decide it's not important enough to tell anyone, considering the detectives found a note to the police stating why he committed the murders and suicide.\n\nYou wake up the next day and everything starts going weird. Physics start to go awry and people start to deteriorate into things like zombies. The infected "humans" have a face that is made of polygons, and they are ruthless killing machines. Basically everything turns to hell and you have to make it out if this screwed up nightmare you call a life\n. \nThe plot twist is that the way of getting out is killing yourself, but you don't realize it until your wife, friends, and co-workers all get infected, and you have to kill them. After that you take your own life. Once you die, the game shows you what really happened. What really happened is: You went insane, killed a bunch of people, including your family, and friends. You finally killed yourself.\n\nYou were the murderer from the beginning of the game, and it becomes a cycle. The same thing happens to the next person, and so on and so forth.
1509118404|793zpg|You will die soon - contribute to the common cause before you do!|In the context of browser text-only online game; You register/log in and game randomly assigns you a character which will die in set amount of time - let's say one hour. Once the timer expires or the player decides to log away, the character is dead for good. You can log in as many times you want, but every time there will be new character which is doomed.\n\nThis all happens in some sort of widespread catastrophe: Let's say an accident in nuclear plant, infested space station or a dying world. The ultimate goal is to salvage the situation and prevent even bigger catastrophe; nuclear explosion, space station crashing into inhabited moon or the planet disintegrating.\n\nYour objective is to gather a resource before you die. This resource is permanent and will be added to the pool of resources other players manage to get. After 30 days or so the final tally will be held and we will know whether our efforts were in vain.\n\nThis is rough outline ofc, there's still many issues with it in the current state.

1432619362|37aolu|You kill monsters|Ive had this idea for a while and Recently got motivated to actually develop it. (i made a post here a while ago and got some pretty great advice) I'm an illustrator and was actually hoping I could get some critique on this project. I barely have anything developed (im serious its literally just a concept right now, all I have is a rather quickly done illustration and some ideas) but I feel that There is enough here for a little advice. :)\n\n\nAnyway, the idea came to me from seeing a picture online. I'm really bummed out that I don't have the picture with be but it depicted this giant monster looming over this little girls bed. On the bed there was a small teddy bear with a sword and shield ready to fight the monster off. I loved this idea. A child's toy fighting off the monsters that live under the child's bed and in the closet. I took the idea and did countless sketches but never reaching anything cohesive  I could turn it into. but after a lot of red bull and procrastination in league of legends i finally came to the conclusion it could be a game. \n\n\nThe basics of the game would be you and a team of 3 others would play as a toy or stuffed animal, like a sock monkey, a bunny, a wind up robot, things like that. Each character having varying abilities such as placing down mouse traps setting up walls. maybe one can have fast melee attacks or someone can have a small nerf gun rigged to shoot teeth. But all 4 of you fight off waves of monsters that try to make it to the child your protecting in bed. Shes sleeping and you need to keep her nightmares at bay! Now the monsters could be anything, Bats, spiders, the scary ass pictures in "Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark" but there would always be something looming through out the room that you cant attack. Like the spider. There would be sort of a silhouette of this spindly thing on the far end of the room pumping out what seems to be an endless swarm of creepy crawlies. The closer the enemies, the more the environment changes to a darker tone. like dirt on the walls and ceiling and floor. maybe cobwebs surrounding most of the room.\n\n\n\nanyway thats my idea. (at least the bulk of it) Critique would be awesome and that one illustration I did is right here ------&gt; http://imgur.com/a/XmR5x (along with the rest of my artwork)
1472565867|50b9vb|An incremental game about building a universe|**Name:** Incremental Universe\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nThe general idea is that you build a universe star-by-star\n\n**Plot:**\n\nIncremental game, so no real plot\n\n**Setting:**\n\nStart in a black screen. \n\n**Characters:**\n\nNone\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nEach click generates a star. At first, you can only create short lived red stars, and each star gives resources before it dies. Speed goes fast, about a billion years per minute. As you gain resources, you can buy nebulae and the like to generate stars for you, and there are different ranks of nebulae which produce different ratio of star types. The star types could be as follows (in order of rarity): \n\n- Class M Red Dwarf: Small stars with low resource generation, and no resource bonuses. Collapse in around 500 million years. Most common star in the game. \n- Class M Red Giant: Higher resource generation, but generally similar to Red Dwarf stars. Give a small bonus to resources when it dies. Lives about 750 million years. \n- Class M Red Supergiant: Rarest of the Class M Red stars. Very low resource per second, but go supernova, giving a large bonus to resources at the end of it's life - around 300 million years. \n- Class K Orange MS: These give medium output for around 500 million years, before changing to red dwarf stars for another 500 million years\n- Class G Yellow MS: Give medium to high output. These stars are where resource output becomes a reliable factor. They live for around 7 billion years, before turning into a Class M Red Supergiant\n- Class G Yellow Supergiant: These stars give less resources, and live about 3 billion years. When they die, they give a large amount of resources, and create a new nebulae in it's place, spawning mostly Class M stars, and the occasional Class K star\n- Class F White MS: These are rock solid stars. They live about 8 billion years, before turning to Class G Yellow MS stars for about a billion years, and then to a Class M Red Supergiant for about 200 million years. \n- Class A Blue/White MS: These are short lived - around 400 million years - but give a high amount of resources, before turning into Class M Red Dwarf stars\n- Class B Blue MS: These deliver a high amount of resources, for around 4 billion years before turning into Class K stars. \n- Class B Blue Giant: This star is a stellar workhorse, lasting 20 billion years, with a medium resource generation. Turn into Class A Blue/White stars after they die. \n- Class B Blue Supergiant: These are short lived stars - around 750 million years, before detonating into a very high resource gain supernova, and spawning several hundred Class M Red Dwarves when they do\n- Class O Blue MS: This is the third rarest star, living around 40 billion years and giving a high output of resources. When it dies, it turns into a Class F MS star, and following that progression.\n- Class O Blue Giant: Second rarest star, and greatly coveted. This star gives a very high output for around 20 billion years, before collapsing into a large nebula, which produces large quantities Class G stars, occasionally Class F stars, and rarely, a Class A star\n- Class O Blue Supergiant: The rarest and most coveted star. Gives an extreme amount of resources for 1.5 billion years, before collapsing into a massive supernova, and leaving behind several nebulae which produce copious amounts of Class B stars. But they are very rare stars, maybe one in 3,000,000 stars\n\nWhen the player has reached a sufficient level of resources, they can collapse their universe, and gain dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter alters the rarity of stars, giving higher chances of spawning rarer stars from the get go, and dark energy can be used to upgrade stars to last longer, give more resources, and die to create bigger supernovae and better classes of stars. \n\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nThe most standout feature, is that this has not been done in an incremental game, and has features from different types of incremental games that haven't been put together before. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nOnline\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nCould possibly do upgrades for Kreds on Kongregate, and similar websites to make money for the dev. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJust give me a shoutout somewhere. I will provide you with my IRL name if you decide to go ahead with it.

There would be a list of different room types that it would choose from, and the exact placement of the furniture would be random.\nYou'd have to mind your food, water and energy throughout the game, using supplies you find in the rooms.\n\nFood and water deplete overtime, and can be found in the right rooms.\n\nEnergy is replenished by sleeping, but you have to wait around while your character sleeps rather than skipping throught it. A bed or couch makes sleeping go faster.\n\nYou can open a door to an adjacent room by pressing a certain button when facing the wall you want to open to. However, if another player has been to that room before you, you must wait for them to accept the door. You can only open doors from rooms that you got to before any other player. Remember that they may attack you and take your resources when you open a door to them, or they may help you, so its a gamble. If a player stops playing, it may create inaccessible rooms, or maybe their claim to it could expire. Creating a door also consumes a bunch of energy.\n\nYou also have no way of knowing what type a given room is before you open a door to it.\n\n The room types would include:\n\n- Kitchens, including a fridge with a limited amount of food, tile floors, drawers with items in it that may or may not be useful (like knives, pens, etc.), a water sink/tap, a stove for cooking, and/or an island counter. Not all of them have to be in every kitchen, of course.\n\n- Bedroom, with a bed, a bedside table with information about the game stored in it alongside generally useless, but rarely useful items, and a desk with a computer on it (which allows you to play minigames or something, I guess, but has a limited battery life). Sometimes they may have a walking cane that can be used for a weapon, or a toy chest that you can store stuff in.\n\n- Greenhouses, which have plants that grow food. May include tomatoes, lettuce, potatoes, and a beehive for honey (but those have bees that can sting you, reducing health).\n\n- Bathrooms, with toilets, sinks and bathtubs (useful for getting water).\n\n- Swimming Pools, with just a big basin of water and some lifesaving equipment.\n\n- Barracks, a room with weapons hung on the walls. Could be swords, could be guns, you never know. Perhaps, rarely, armor.\n\n- Kennel, a room with animals in cages. Could be livestock, could be dogs and cats, could be leopards and alligators because why the hell not. Some of the cages may be open, too, so be careful! Maybe dogs could be trained to help you.\n\n- Nothing, just an empty room. You may be fucked if you start here.\n\n- Pit, a bottomless pit. Its impossible to start here, but you can still open a door to here. Walking into it causes falling to death.\n\n- Balcony, generates only next to pits, gives you a nice view into it as well as other balconies bordering the same pit, and has potted plants that may be fruit-bearing.\n\n- Living Room. Couches, TV on a stand that plays little animations when you interact with it, maybe plants. Things may be hidden in couch cushion.\n\n- Cellar, has rare a chance of generating below another room with a ladder leading up. Has barrels in it that contain lots of food.\n\n- Tower, rarely generates above another room with a ladder to climb up to it, giving you a view of other nearby rooms, so you don't have to guess at them.
1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

1482309972|5jiwqp|Wise words from Miyamoto "You can't just throw every good idea you have into a game."|
1446420150|3r53ao|A videogame which seems like a kiddy adventure game, as long as you follow the linear path the story has set you. The more you deviate from the main storyline path, the more unsettling, creepy, and horrific the game gets.|
1483488499|5lvlp2|A survival game where players have to worship evil gods to survive until they have enough technology to kill them.|

1481156028|5h3mst|Suicide Watch - In an increasingly absurdly safe world, you must find a way to die.|12th floor apartment building. A security guard patrols the room. Below, padded streets with padded cars driving on them. But what's that over there? It's your way out of this cruel cruel world, and you have to outsmart your overseers and overcome the increasingly safe standards of the area. The more damage you cause on the way out, the more coffin/gravestone swag you earn... or points.

1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**
1433520967|38oorq|Many game ideas here are far too big in scope. I made a (satirical) tool to help.|Hi! I make games.\n\nI see a lot of enthusiasm here for giant dream games -- MMO sandboxes as far as the eye can see. Those ideas unfortunately aren't useful to anyone. Why? [Your game idea is too big](http://yourgameideaistoobig.com/).\n\nWant to see your ideas upvoted and games made from them? Distill your dream game down to the smallest, simplest possible concept.
1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.
1467336842|4qp7mb|30 Random Game Ideas! #3!|Hey all,\n\nSorry I haven't really had time to post these! Work has been a pain, and well, I haven't had much time to go on Reddit, nor much inspiration for ideas, but I finally managed to get some free time, and well, here's part three! Enjoy. :D\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n* 1. A game where you attempt to sell as many of your own organs as fast as possible before you die.\n* 2. A game where the only objective is to slow down people from their everyday grind/task. This could be played in several ways, such as the player being a spirit, actual person, creature, god, etc...\n* 3. A game where you play as a Godzilla esque monster and get to level a really massive city. The more you destroy, the more powerful and large you get. It's a bit [like that game released for PS3/4 recently, but perhaps actually good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AVoKxcaUo)\n* 4. A game a bit like Papers Please, but where you file/drop files/documents/mail into specific drop boxes, as they pile up at an alarming rate.\n* 5. You and a crew of road workers are trying to fix or build a road, but tragically (and hilariously) people are ruining the road by driving their cars on it that explode, littering, slowing down your work, and basically being a nuisance. Try to not get anyone killed, it's a bit like a reversed version of Frogger. Perhaps the more road you finish, the easier it gets.\n* 6. Go to a museum and draw mustaches on all the famous artworks on display, avoid security cameras and guards, as well as try to put up your own paintings.\n* 7. Bring people back to life in order to solve a mystery. Perhaps you can only bring back one or two people. Choose wisely.\n* 8. Repair damaged robots and create robots to help Skynet become reality.\n* 9. An Unreal Engine esque game from the perspective of a police helicopter, where you play as a person driving away from police cars in a neighborhood, simple, but eventually things get hectic, the military is called in, streets are blockaded, and you must drive through buildings and offroad to get away from them.\n* 10. A game where you make coffee and drink the whole pot, then make another pot. The more pots you drink and make, the more twitchy and difficult it gets to make them. Don't break the machine or pot.\n* 11. You are a billionaire in a rather corrupt and lawless country. Go out in the crowded streets, and simply buy someone with your immense wealth. See if you made a good choice.\n* 12. A VR game where you are an astronaut in space performing operations from a space shuttle and must survive a [Gravity esque situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKW-Gd_S_xc)\n* 12.1. A VR game where you are an astronaut performing operations on things like the Hubble Space Telescope, and have the danger of dropping screws that float away, etc.\n* 13. Go outside and loosen the screws on large bridges, break train tracks, ruin roads, cut support wires on sky-scrapers, and basically cause a huge mess.\n* 14. Play as a police officer and try to purposefully make people pay up despite abiding the law and not speeding.\n* 15. Break into your neighbor's house and take their furniture/money/X-Box/personal belongings and try not to get caught. They come in your house and look around for their things later, so try to hide it and be prepared. Based on real life personal experience.\n* 16. Go on national news and express your opinion on a situation with other people, despite you knowing nothing about it. Try to choose the best option.\n* 17. A proper game/simulator where you get to simulate the Apollo lunar landings, as well as walk on the surface. Haven't found or seen one yet.\n* 18. Take a sledgehammer and break concrete on the road. Eat it, and try to convince other people to do the same thing.\n* 19. Try to convince Death not to take you away, despite being dead or seriously ill.\n* 20. A game where you herd bison/animals towards a village for food.\n* 21. Control a probe and land it on a comet in first person, like the ESA did.\n* 22. In order to get no wrinkles at all, you must control your emotions and never smile, frown, or smirk, try to keep them under control.\n* 23. A multiplayer shooter where every time you shoot your gun, you lose health.\n* 24. Time travel to stop a bomb from exploding, by watching the person who placed and activated it, as well as try to evacuate civilians.\n* 25. You are now a ghost, and can only hold certain objects for a very short amount of time, try to do your normal every day things.\n* 26. A tsunami has hit your city, try to stay afloat and on your roof as your house speedily goes down a long flooded road towards the city.\n* 27. Stop the world from ending due to a nuclear holocaust by simply offering all the leaders of the world lemonade from your lemonade stand.\n* 28. You are pulled over by a *very* aggressive and furious police officer for speeding. Try to talk him out of the ticket you cannot afford to pay.\n* 29. Play as a lifeguard on the beach or at a large crowded pool and make sure nothing bad happens.\n* 30. You are a time traveler. Go on the Internet and freak people out by predicting everything or certain events in their life.\n\nThat's all for now, I once again must apologize for the long delay for this one. I hope these are at least decent, if you have any suggestions or other ideas for them/based on them, comment away. :)\n\nOnce again, these ideas are completely free to use! If any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D

1475375364|55ggfy|30 Random Game Ideas! #4!|Hey there everyone! Sorry about the huge delay on this one, it took me some time to come up with these ones, and well, trim the "less good ones", but here it finally is! 30 random game ideas #4! I hope you enjoy. :D\n\nPrevious ones:\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)\n\n* 1. A game where you play as the captain of a massive cruise ship, but the closer you get to your destination, the less the passengers begin to behave.\n* 2. You are the president of the entire world. Unfortunately, you are also the slowest person on all of planet Earth. Try to do your job and get around the white house despite your *ridiculously* slow speed.\n* 3. A first person game where you must break out of your holding cell and escape the most secure prison on the planet which is where you are held.\n* 4. A game where lag is one of the main mechanics (e.g, every 5 or so seconds your controls stop responding, so you have to time your jumps/movement correctly, etc)\n* 5. A game where you're the leader of a 1984 esque world, where you must combat "thought crimes".\n* 6. Fly through space and try to find alien civilizations, then convince them (by force if necessary) to join your religion, or else your world is doomed.\n* 7. A fighting game where it's "brain over brawns" and you're a weak, but wise character, and must outsmart your opponents somehow.\n* 8. Run as fast as you possibly can from pursuing bulls with other people and see how far you can make it in the Running of the Bulls.\n* 9. A multiplayer game where you awake in a nuclear test town, and must find a hiding place/shelter to survive the detonation, and other players must do the same and can even kick you out of your spot. Nukes go off every 2 minutes and the town is constantly being ravaged in different areas, the last one alive wins.\n* 10. You are a passenger on a rapidly disintegrating bullet train that is heading towards a collapsed tunnel. Try to get off it safely by any means.\n* 11. Chuck stones at passing birds, your goal is to actually kill two birds with one stone, even if it takes massive slingshots, catapults, dump trucks, or entire boulders to do so.\n* 12. A proper zoo-keeper simulator, where you play as one and can be killed on the job by an animal if you make one wrong move.\n* 13. You are the captain of a nuclear submarine. One of your seamen is a spy attempting to obtain the nuclear launch codes, try to find him and make him walk the plank. Let's hope the one you picked was actually the spy though, and not really one of your fellow crewmen.\n* 14. Try to stay sane and survive by yourself in a small, but very nice bunker. You never actually get to see the outside world, just the very faint sounds of total destruction and the deaths of everyone above. Inspired by this: http://imgur.com/gallery/mHAKX\n* 15. An SCP Foundation inspired game, where instead of running away from the entities, you actually play as the organization in a response unit and attempt to secure and contain the unpredictable anomalies when they are found.\n* 16. Attempt to get your boss fired by staging/screwing up his events (change his speech, make his coffee decaf, put sugar cubes in the gas tank of his car, etc) so that you may become the CEO of the company.\n* 17. Smoke, flames, and water are slowly beginning to engulf the building you are inside. There is no way out, try to survive long enough until help arrives without suffocating, burning, or drowning.\n* 18. Play as a swarm of mosquitoes/bugs and consume the people around town. The more you consume, the larger your swarm gets.\n* 19. The end of the world is coming, sell 'end of the world' signs to the panicking people. \n* 20. A small, broken, yellow clock sits on your table. Upon turning the hands, you can control the flow of time and space around you.\n* 21. A pirate simulator where you hijack cargo ships/passing vessels and attempt to obtain the ransom money, while watching out for responding navy forces.\n* 22. You are a half deaf person being interviewed on international television. Your interviewer is asking you several questions, but you can only barely understand what they are saying. Try to answer them the best you can without screwing up badly.\n* 23. You are God. Smite the non-believers in various humorous ways while getting others who watch to believe further.\n* 24. The famed super spy *Jason Bonn* has infiltrated your super secret evil palace. Attempt to stop him at any cost.\n* 25. A semi-stealth game where you play as one of many ants on a kitchen counter and must collect food to bring back to your queen and lead the rest of your ant brethren. Beware of the massive humans that will bring death to you if you aren't careful.\n* 26. A game where the only objective is to tame/catch a massive [Dune esque sandworm](https://monsterlegacy.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sandwormcropped.jpg).\n* 27. Play as a UFO and slowly abduct and replace the entire populations of towns with aliens, all the while attempting to never be seen.\n* 28. Command/control the flow of oncoming traffic as a traffic guard, try not to cause any accidents or traffic jams.\n* 29. A Jehovah's witness/door to door salesman simulator, where you have to try to persuade people into buying your product/talking about your lord and savior. \n* 30. Attempt to commit insurance fraud by purposefully burning down your building, crashing your car, etc, without getting caught.\n\nI hope these were as good as the previous ones! Sorry once again for the huge delay.\n\nAs always, these ideas are completely free to use! Please do send me any of these if you ever make something out of them! :D
1475987121|56kr4d|An RPG where you control the soundtrack|This idea is pretty straightforward. You play an RPG character who, like Dragon Age's Grey Warden and Inquisitor, KOTOR II's Exile, and Skyrim's Dragonborn, has a unique ability: they can sense the ambient background music of the world and manipulate it. Abilities could range from intimidating shopkeepers by triggering combat music to buffing allies with the appropriate hero track.\n\nThe player would assemble a team of possible allies, each based on the personality of a musical instrument. The closer the player gets to these allies the more their songs will harmonize, unlocking group maneuvers and dialogue options. The many cities of the game would be themed towards different music genres, causing allies to act differently to NPCs and each other. Perhaps the drum-based barbarian can fit it almost anywhere except the Victorian high life and the high brow violinist finds a home in the boonies. And of course these characters would talk like Charlie Brown's teacher using their respective instrument.\n\nThe villains would be Noise and Silence, representing chaos and death, respectively. That's all I've got. This idea just seems like the perfect progression to the continued use of audio clues to guide players in video games.
1446593409|3rf5ja|A new video game where you play someone with no skills and no weapons. The object is to get killed as fast as possible while a heavily armed badass tries to protect you. Call it "Escort Mission"|
1480004786|5eoie5|A war game where you play as each of the soldiers on one side.|Got the idea from Chronotron.\n\nYou start out as one soldier, marching into the war by yourself. You kill as many people as you can. When you die, you respawn as a different soldier, and see the soldier you previously were marching into the battle beside you, doing exactly what you did. If you kill the enemy that would've otherwise killed your past self, or otherwise save your previous self's life, he then becomes a simple AI that just shoots at enemy soldiers after the time that he would've died passes. Each time you die, you respawn as a new soldier, with all of your previous selves doing what you did before.
1464302527|4l7xk3|30 Random Game Ideas! #2!|You people seemed to like the [first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/), so I thought maybe I could do this weekly or something, I'm not sure. :P\n\n* 1. A game where you are a person aboard the Titanic as it heads toward the iceberg. When it eventually hits, you must fight your way through crowds of people and perhaps even sacrifice your family to get on a lifeboat.\n* 2. Break into people's houses as they're gone and make everything dirty, (I.E. using a vacuum cleaner in reverse, dumping everything out of the fridge, breaking mirrors, etc)\n* 3. You are a thief in the middle of a crowded marketplace. Go around and pick people's pockets quickly, by distracting them or bumping into them. The more pockets you pick, the higher the difficulty gets as people start realizing something is missing.\n* 4. A platformer game where instead of playing as a quick, agile character, you instead play as a barely moving, morbidly obese character who often literally breaks platforms and levels.\n* 5. You are a robber in a bank robbery with several hostages. The police have the building surrounded. Try to negotiate with them, without killing any of the hostages.\n* 6. Start forest fires and try to keep the fire-fighters away so the fire spreads and becomes larger.\n* 7. Pilot a drone over a crowd and steal things from people. Eventually you begin stealing greater and more valuable things, to eventually even super valuable things like briefcases of cash and ancient artifacts.\n* 8. A phone is ringing in your house. Upon picking it up, an anonymous caller tells you "It's watching you", and gives you several hints and clues as to what it is and how it reacts/what it will do. Find out what 'it' is.\n* 9. You are a secret agent who infiltrates suspicious secret societies. In order to earn their trust and join each of them, you must master their secret hand shake. The entire game is about quick and difficult button press sequences.\n* 10. Go into public bathrooms and steal toilet paper from people as they're using the bathroom.\n* 11. A mountain climbing simulator where you scale a mountain the size of Mt. Everest or half of that.\n* 12. A Godzilla esque monster is attacking a city. You are a civilian on the ground, try to survive the carnage as buildings around you collapse, people run everywhere, the military tries to shoot it, the monster leveling the city, etc...\n* 13. Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.\n* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.\n* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!\n* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.\n* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)\n* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.\n* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.\n* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.\n* 21. A game with the setting/kind of style of Counter Strike/Modern Warfare/Battlefield/CoD, but the twist is everyone has kitchen appliances and tools instead of guns and knives.\n* 22. An NSA simulator where you look through people's computer files and learn about that person's very bizarre history through them.\n* 23. Dodge random objects that are falling out of the sky.\n* 24. Survive disasters in first person, such as tsunamis, nuclear explosions, tornadoes, meteorites falling out of the sky, volcano eruptions and more, all from your house. You have 2 minutes to prepare for the event.\n* 25. A game where you can only move by shifting the gravity of the world. Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.\n* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.\n* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.\n* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost. The only way back is a long road down a deserted path. The locals urge you to not go down it, for no one ever returns alive.\n* 29. Be the referee in a football/boxing match, decide when something bad happens who is responsible.\n* 30. A game where every step you take changes the entire level/game world, permanently.\n\nThat's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange. :P\n\nThese ideas are completely free to use, if any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D
1473179402|51g2ki|Survivor's guilt.|I haven't come up with any story or specific elements of what this game would be, but the bare bones is that you're playing as a war vet with PTSD, trying to live a normal life. What makes the game a challenge is that certain noises or images will randomly trigger your PTSD and you'll suddenly be transported to a past scenario relevant to the trigger. I think if this was ever fleshed out, it could turn out to be really cool.
1479805514|5e9sqq|A game about being a tree in the Rainforest.|I thought of this game as I learned about the Wet Tropics of Australia.\n\nBasically, the main idea is that you are a small tree that just sprouted in the rain forest, and you have to control your way up towards the light. Whenever you are in the light, you grow 2x faster than normal, so your goal is to become the **tallest tree**.\n\nThe trees around you move at the same pace as you, and some have different abilities, like growing onto your tree and blocking your way, or preventing you from expanding outwards. 
1420550531|2rifcd|Awesome idea for a frogger version|So I got this Idea of a frogger game where the frog has to cross the street without creating **horrible horrible accidents**. He can't be run over because the "car drivers" always evade him and most probably crash into other cars.  \nThe highest possible score is "0" as in 0 people died. But thats really really hard to archieve. You'll be glad if only 10 people lost their lifes..
1463677947|4k3ixr|30 random game ideas!|* 1. Make a very important speech in front of millions of people. You haven't prepared for this at all. You have to choose from a bunch of very long preset options. You have 3 seconds to choose one. Let's hope you don't say anything embarrasing or offensive.\n* 2. You play as a paint bucket, you must collect paint to complete paintings.\n* 2.1. You play as a moving paint bucket of an artist, you must collect paint in specific colors to mix them the way the artist wants them.\n* 3. You are on a Safari. Your car has broken down, and you must get out and find help to repair your vehicle, there is a lion/Bengal tiger quietly stalking your every move from a distance.\n* 4. Police are chasing the world's most wanted criminal. You are that criminal. Your only weapon and tool is a plastic spork.\n* 5.  You are a POS Fedex/UPS delivery driver driving a van who must drop off packages to people on time. The more damaged and destroyed they are, the higher your score.\n* 6. A bird is sitting on a telephone wire, who releases droppings on people underneath. The more you hit, the more birds fly in that the player can control.\n* 7.

1436397143|3clzms|Breaking the Fourth Wall|I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.\n\nThe game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.\n\nSlowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.

1443383212|3mm0c2|A spaceship game that no one will ever make.|I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies.
1477384587|599zsi|Tower Defense with enemies that "mutate" and "evolve" based on which of them is most effective|Hello Reddit. I just picked up Game Maker and have been learning the basics, with the hope of building some hobby projects that I can be proud of (I've got a day job that I love so being a game developer is only ever going to be a hobby). I've been going through my backlog of ideas for games and this is the one that I keep coming back to as something I might be able to build one day.\n\nThe idea is a tower defense game, but the enemies have procedurally generated stats that change as the game goes on. The game would start as a typical TD: there's a start point for enemies, they walk along a set path, the player buys towers that defend from these enemies, etc. However, instrad of having a bunch of different enemy types, the enemies "mutate" each wave, changing their stats and attributes (health, speed, damage resistance, flight, stealth, splitting into two smaller enemies on death, etc.). The stat changes are semi-random, but are weighted towards being more like the enemies that survive the longest, so that the attributes of the most effective enemies are more likely to crop up in future waves. This creates a feedback loop that makes enemies more and more effective against the player's defense every wave. The player then has to change or modify towers and tower setup to deal with an evolving threat.\n\nThe idea is to break the player of the habit of finding a single strategy or tactic that works and forcing them to consider the entire arsenal available. Building nothing but flamethrower towers that deal short-range AoE fire damage, for example, would eventually lead to flame-resistant enemies with high hit-points. Building nothing but sniper towers might lead to Zerg rush-style fast and numerous enemies to counter the slow, single-target stopping power. The game becomes about finding an effective defense against the existing threat while trying to figure out what the next mutation will likely be.\n\nAs with true evolution, the enemies should have to make trade-offs as they evolve so that they always have weaknesses to exploit. Higher armor at a cost of speed, or higher hit points but fewer enemies in a wave. The player's weaknesses are whatever gaps exist in their defense. The overall power curve could go up with number of enemies and number of towers, as is typical with TD games.\n\nWhat do you think, is this feasible? If so, would it be fun?
1399310129|24sf5m|If someone made this game, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.|This game would be a puzzle game. The character would move through a series of levels, getting Energy powerups along the way. Its every move is controlled by a malevolent outside force. Soon, it realizes this and tries to escape. \nYou, the player, are the malevolent force. The energy powerups are drugs to keep the character docile. When he tries to escape, you must block him and try to manipulate him into the drugs. At the end, you'll have the choice to either let him escape (losing the game with no restarts) or to kill him (winning the game). \nYes, it would be essentially Portal from the POV of Glados.
1423955457|2vx3ay|Spy Messenger: Giver orders and fulfill missions through a fake messaging app|**The basic idea**\n\nWhen opening the (mobile?) game, you reach a "messenger app"-like UI where each contact is actually an NPC with whom you can exchange pre-defined texts. Your goal is to fulfill missions through the intermediary of contacts: you gather information, give orders, and get things done all through messages. As the game progresses, you have more and more useful contacts and more and more complex quests.\n\n**Typical game loop**\n\nFor instance, a mission could consist of stealing someone's phone. All you know at first is the target's name, and the fact that he's already served jail time for robbery.\n\n1. You call the white pages service, and realize 15 persons have the same name.\n1. You call a friend from the police, and give him the name to get criminal records for all persons matching it.\n1. There's only two persons known by this name with criminal records, and only one has served for robbery. Great, you now have his address.\n1. Since it's 2am, the guy must be home. Message another contact and ask him to break into the target's home, and steal the phone.\n1. Moments later, he contacts you back saying he's got it. You tell him where to deliver the phone.\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting stories based on the idea, making things harder and harder to solve. Maybe at some point you'll have unreliable contacts that lie to you, and make you need to track your own contacts... Or people that get killed on the job... Or multiple missions to manage simultaneously, that end up being related to each other... Lots of intricate things to imagine :)\n\nIf made as a mobile game, I also wonder whether it could be interesting to make this game real-time, like there's an actual hour to wait until you burglar reaches the target's house. It could add to the immersion, but it would suddenly be heavily notification-based, not sure I'd like to play that.\n\n**Technical aspects**\n\nI'd say the basic gameplay would be quite affordable for beginners: there's a lot of modeling to do for data, NPCs, possible situations and how everything is linked together, but it does seem quite easy and fun to code. And iterative, too, as you can start small and add features as you go. Also, no graphics! The main challenge is rather to make the pre-defined messages thing work well.
1437927452|3eo531|The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it.|Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.\n\nThe hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. \n\nThe GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.\n\nFinally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.\n\nPlaying with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.
1482138253|5j5gnv|you've died, but you have to rebuild your being and return to your universe to save someone|Here's a concept for a game that I wish existed.\n\nYou've died, and you find yourself in the "recreation realm," only able to see in greyscale, and with no personality, memories, feelings... You're a human soul in a superficial body. You discover, through some helpful exposition from the goddess of creation, that humans are "erased" once they die, and they have new beings, lives, personalities, etc., made for them, then they're born into a new universe (multiple universe + multiple lives theories oooh). However, the goddess holds some people from heading to new universes because their prior universe still needs them. \n\nYou are given a memory of your daughter, which, in turn, gives you your motherly instinct and love. You remember the blue eyes of your daughter and start to see the color blue all around you.\n\nYou're informed that your daughter is in great danger, and that you must rebuild your being and return to your universe to save her. Bits and pieces of your memory, personality, feelings, and color are spread throughout the recreation realm, and you must find them to build enough of a human to return to your universe.\n\nMemories are quick-time sections. When a memory is found (whether it's hidden somewhere, dropped by a boss, or needed for plot), you live that memory. The outcome of a memory affects certain things in the recreation realm, like boss battles, enemies in a certain area, friendly human encounters, spawning of collectibles, etc. The better a memory is executed, the better/easier things are in the recreation realm. They also have a butterfly effect that causes changes in other memories.\n\nEverything starts in black and white except the goddess of creation. Colors (what colors you can see in) are gained through memories (all plot-based memories, ie. required memories). They're unlocked through seeing a colorful something of importance in a memory, like the blue eyes of the daughter, the red color of blood, the bright yellow of the sun, etc. A cutscene would show the shift into seeing things of that new color.\n\nThe game would have multiple endings depending on:\n-how many memories, feelings, and traits are collected\n-how your memories play out (ie. how perfectly you executed the quick-time events)\n\nfor a lot more, but a lot messier, here's a link to the full plot idea: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN83PIZezwMfZyhphWwJgA5olb2UNtJESlHgZiEIDeg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nlet me know your thoughts and feedback. I think this could make a neat comic or novel as well, so if anybody wants to use the concept for anything, just let me know.

1472937254|510u3q|The One Trope That Spider-man/Superhero Games Never Use - Until Now|Imagine a game where you balance maintaining a secret identity (because people make life worth living) and protecting a city/population (because that's where your people live.) \n\nIt's a superhero sandbox action platformer with two point-based scales, *City Safety* and *Secret Identity*, that govern which random city events appear, what character progressions are available, and how the world reacts to the character. \n\nThe player always can switch between two skins, civies and tights, which allow the player to enter events as time progresses through three periods: morning, afternoon and night. \n\nWhen the player selects "Change," they trigger a 10-second action that reduces movement speed to 10% and stops a few actions. After spawning, you can walk outside of your bedroom window, hit the Change, and after a 10-second delay, you are wearing your superhero costume. \n\nAlong with experience points, damage statuses, and unlocking new abilities, the main character also has a few Sims-like needs (Love, Comfort, Sanity, Hope) that get refueled or supercharged by attending civilian events. For instance, you need normal sanity and high comfort in order to discover new superhero moves. Have above-average romance scores? Then you'll have a damage boost. \n\n-The details of the meta-concept-\nThe game system measures two 1,000-point scales: your **secret identity** and **city safety.** \n\nCity:                 Scary                      Safe\n           -500                ... -1,  0 ...               +500\nIdentity:           Public                      Secret\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **Secret Identity**, the game behaves as if your identity is secret. \n&gt;  You gain the full benefit of attending civilian events (gain Identity points, boosts to health, sanity, etc.)\n&gt;  Putting on your Civies turns you invisible to enemies (except enemies who have a Knows! tag or status.)  \n&gt;  Interacting with Normals or Beloveds allow you to invest relationship points with them. \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if your identity is public. \n&gt;  You gain noticeably lower benefits of attending civilian events. \n&gt;  Enemies see past your Civies -- and there's now a 50% chance of random enemies during civilian events.\n&gt;  Beloveds can self-downgrade to Normal, and Normals may choose to ignore the player.\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **City Safety**, the game behaves as if the city is safe.\n&gt;  You gain City points from patrolling in your costume. Upon death/KO, you respawn in clinics or low-security cells at the local precinct.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of small-scale skirmishes (muggings, etc.)\n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events only 10% of the time.  \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if the city is scary. \n&gt;  Upon death/KO, you resapawn in high-security cells - and lose 500 identity points. No points for patrol.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of large-scale problems (bombings, block fires, etc.) \n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events 60% of the time.\n\n\nAs the hero, you patrol the city and resolves random enemy events -- which give strength points and city points, for raising City Danger score. Swoop in, beat up the bad guys, help the elderly across the crosswalk, stop the villains. You know the drill. \n\nAs the person, you build your character by building your character's life. Now, pay attention. \nThe game's schedule moves through three periods: morning, afternoon, and night. Civilian events happen in predictable places during those schedules. In the morning, civilian events pop up at the school. In the afternoon, they pop up in the city. At night, they pop up at home.\n\nEach event requires your attendance (and any other gimmick you want) and yields the character bonuses when you're present for their ending. When you activate a civilian event, you control time - speeding up or slowing down the schedules. And you're only required to be present at the beginning and at the end to get the rewards. \n\nWant an example? \n&gt; It just turned night. The player is in the city, dressed in tights. The HUD shows that it's night, and a pop-up announces an event, "Dinner's Ready!", and there's only 90 seconds to activate it. The player chooses to stay in costume (to protect their identity) and superhumanly flies to their home, a house in the suburbs. On approach, the house is lit in green, and a perimeter around the civilian event marks the boundary the player must cross in civilian clothes. The player lands after 30 seconds of flight, goes into some cover, activates the Change Clothes, waits 10 seconds more, and walks across the perimeter. Onscreen text, a mini-cut-scene, whatever flavor signals the beginning of the event -- and the HUD guides the player to an object to activate (in this case a seat at the dinner table). After activating the seat, the player fast-forwards through time... and the player sees the relevant character stats that will increase: health, sanity, comfort, secret identity scores. Also, pop-ups on the HUD show Night events happening. However, city danger is already high and the character's stats are middling. The player chooses to stay at the event. In-game flavor text, character interaction, etc. simulate the dinner at home. At the end of the 20-40 second fast forwarded event, the player has seen 4-5 city events pop up. However, the civilian event ends - and the rewards are registered to the character's sheet. The player's now standing inside their home, and their HUD registers 3 other civilian events in the area - upstairs, next door, etc. The player pauses the game to check City Safety and Secret Identity stats. City Safety has gone up pretty high (200 points) as a result of ignoring them. However, the player's comfort and love bars are just shy of unlocking more moves or triggering a story event. What do you do? \n&gt; The player chooses to activate the next-door event: "Date Night." The player moves toward that perimeter and, already in civies, triggers it. Flavor text and in-game cinematics show the girlfriend wants to watch a movie together. Activate the couch. Stats of Love, Comfort, Health and Sanity show up as potential rewards if the player finishes this event in the perimeter. The player fast-forwards the event until another city event appears on the pop-up HUD. That'll be worth some 80 points if it gets resolved. The player stops fast-forwarding, deactivates the couch, walks in his civies into cover near the house where no one will see him change, changes, and leaves the house. The Date Night timer continues, at a normal pace, and signals that the player isn't present to collect the rewards. The player hustles through the city event, a grocery robbery - except his mom (who was present for the Dinner's Ready! event) is also a hostage. In superhero garb, the player gets his mom to a police safety point, goes back into the grocery and disarms/disables the robbers. There's about 20 seconds left in Date Night! and the player really wants the story event and rewards. He zips as fast as he can back to the Date Night! perimeter (15 seconds left), and hits the Change Clothes - moving across the barrier at 25% normal pace and unable to jump. He's in the barrier and moving toward the couch, still changing. Because he's in the same room with girlfriend character while Changing Costumes, the Secret Identity score goes down 5 points and the girlfriend gets the tag "Suspicious." It'll take another complete civilian event with her to remove the tag. Don't need to worry about that now. With 5 seconds left, the player activates the couch, concludes Date Night!, and gets the rewards. The player's now standing in the girlfriend's house. City Danger is now 120 points short of where it was before Dinner's Ready!; the player can activate a training event to unlock new moves; the girlfriend's "Suspicious" tag could be a big deal; and already another two civilian events are on the HUD and there's only time for one more before school tomorrow morning. Which do you do now? \n\nDo you get it? \n\nThis game has one sandbox -- but essentially two worlds happening at the same time. Players choose which side they need to tend to. \n\nThey make their choices based on any of a dozen factors: \n* The City Danger and Secret Identity scores\n* Which character building goals do they want to hit (unlocking moves, costumes, etc.)? \n* Story or training events they can unlock\n* Shuffling their lives around to accommodate a superhero's life -- meaning, creating a girlfriend out of a fellow superhero to have dates that also add to city scores. \n* Progressing through story events to further their life: high school graduation, college, jobs, normal careers\n\n**Sounds nice, but what happens at the fringes of the rules?** \nAccidentally change costume in Times Square? You can steadily recover your secret identity with civilian events, and Special events (faking the hero death, getting a costume double), only triggered when the Secret Identity score is really low, can yield major Secret Identity bonuses. \n\nDoes Mom die in a supervillain event? You can always befriend new Beloveds out of the Normals population. Until you do, you'll notice fewer civilian events are around to boost your character. \n\nDo you lose all your HP during a supervillain fight? You'll respawn in their lair (a pre-drawn escape level), the villain will have the Knows! tag, and you'll now need to worry about that supervillain showing up during a civilian event -- until you convince them with a special event or until game events kill them.  \n\nI can see the game clearly in my mind as if I've been playing it for years. It's like I came from an alternate universe where this game already exists, and I'm just remembering it. \n\nSo ask me any questions.  
1414594926|2kohuo|It's called: You Are The Sword|For some years I simply have not had the time to keep programming and trying to properly realise my game ideas. So here: I'm throwing one of them out into the aether to see what y'all think of it. Please upvote and share if you like it and I can give you more info.\n\nOur protagonist starts at the bottom of a tower with many separate floors. The aim is to get to the top of the tower. The tower is populated by many adventurers seeking to do the same thing. So far, so cliche and uninteresting.\n\nHere's the twist (and working title): **You Are The Sword**.\n\nWhen the character holding you dies, you drop to the floor, and, evetnually, you're picked up by another character who you then gain control over. In some sense the game can never end until you win - which allows us to amp up the difficulty significantly of course.\n\nInspirations: Dwarf Fortress and Sword Art Online, primarily.\n\nOK there's a lot more to this idea that would require a lot (a **lot**) of programming. But that's the very basic idea. I can go on about it more in the comments if you are interested. Imagine all the cool things about dwarf fortress (persistence, random gen, etc.) but in a dungeon crawler. It's pretty cool. Throw in all your classic RPG elements, only with this curveball that your character can completely change at any time.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more.\n\nEdit: someone wanted more information up front rather than in discussion below, so I'll do what I can.\n(NB. there's a lot more here than the basic idea, and I'm well aware of what a colossal amount of work this would be to code!)\n\nBASIC GAME PITCH\n\n* you are a parasitic sword who takes control of your wielder\n* your aim is to get to the top of the tower - you start at the ground floor\n* there are a fixed number of randomly generated adventurers in the tower, and when one dies, a new one enters\n* adventurers wander through the tower fighting monsters on different floors, and perhaps each other\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\n\n* adventurers are procedurally generated at the start of the game, along with the maps of each of the tower's floors, monsters and bosses (a la Dwarf Fortress)\n* adventurers have classic rpg stats alongside temperament stats (which grades them on scales of aggressiveness/passivity, bravery/cowardice, honour/treachery etc.) . This dictates their interactions with other adventurers and their actions more generally\n* monsters get tougher as you go up the tower\n\nSWORDS\n\n* every adventurer climbing the tower needs a sword. You start out getting picked up by some level one scrub at the bottom floor of the tower\n* some swords are special - let's call them soul swords. You're one of them. Soul swords take over the mind of the wielder and are soulbound (cannot be unequipped till death) You're not necessarily the only one...\n* swords level up as their wielders level up\n\nADVENTURERS\n\n* adventurers level up as they fight monsters and grow stronger\n* there are a fixed number of adventurers, so it's technically possible to record all interactions between advs, all injuries sustained, and all rivalries/friendships etc. If you've played dwarf fortress you know the kind of thing I'm talking about: Brian's left toe is broken sort of thing\n* some advs play dirty - if they are 'evil' enough, they might kill other advs for their gear, or because they don't like them. If you're unlucky, your character won't just get killed by their sworn enemy, but you will *become* their sworn enemy. Still, it's probably better than being left on the ground.\n\nTHE TOWER\n\n* for now let's say the tower has 20 floors. Adventurers likewise can level from 1 to 20. They can only access the floor they have hit the level of. Similarly for equipping weapons and armour.\n\nPARTIES\n\n* in order to to tackle bigger monsters, at some point advs have to go out in parties. As a low-level character, you can expect to be resigned to signing up for an available outing with a party looking for another member.\n\n* as your repute grows (of the character, not the sword) you might be able to lead your own parties, by finding other weaker (or less famous) advs to follow you\n\nDEATH\n\n* when an adv dies, their gear falls to the ground. If that includes you, you won't be spared. You lie there in the dirt until a friend claims it, or a adv considers you an upgrade, or, if you're really unlucky, some low level scrub picks you up looking for a cheap buck by selling you on. The higher level you are, the more chance you will find your way to the hands of someone as mighty as your last wielder. Otherwise, you have to work your way back up again.\n\nSTORY (because why the hell not?)\n\n*Nemesis stands at the top of the Tower of Fate, looking down at your battered corpse. She knows that only seconds from now, your body will judder back to life whether you wish it or not. So she does what she did to all the others: as your spirit returns to flow like water into your recently departed body, she catches it in a vial of sand and corks it. It is all you can do to juggle yourself out of her grasp. The vial smashes on the floor and you reach once more for your body. But it is too far away, and the sand weighs you down. Enough sand lands on the sword for your spirit to find a place in the metal to hide. But it has been to long now. Your body is dead.*\n\n*Nemesis kicks your body, your sword and your spirit over the side of the tower with a curse. Now she is the last of the gods, free to feed off all those who dare to reach the top of her tower. Only you can stop her now, but you have fallen to the very bottom of the world, your body smashed to pieces. You are not you anymore.*\n\n*You Are The Sword.*
1430925576|352f8f|A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam|The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., "What did you have for breakfast today?" or "Where do you live?". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable "hallucinations" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness.
1387667572|1tfajy|You will probably not read this, but I need to get this concept out of my head.|A game that I call 'Psychosis', I don't know if this has been done, in that case tell me.\n\nIt's a horror game, where you start in a abandoned hospital with a head injury/amnesia, the\nhospital starts out normal and clean, but once a nurse comes in there's no eyes just holes,\nthis causes the game to go in slow motion and your heartbeat goes louder.\nAfter she leaves you try to escape the hospital. Other people, patients and nurses \nstart out as ghosts/human like creatures and the closer you get to the exit the more scarier they become\n(as well as making the hospital more scarier, moving walls, more worn out, darker, until it's pretty much abandon)\nmaking the player to start attacking them the using various weapons found in the hospital.\nThis causes police and guards to come and try to arrest you, however, to the player they appear\nlike monsters. You escape and go through a almost like typical horror game except you attack\nothers, the longer you wait the scarier/more gross they become. "The Cops" hunts you\nand you'll have to escape to your farm (this is the only objective and the only thing your character remembers).\nAs you progresses through the game, it becomes darker and scarier.\nRight before you reach your farm, you're arrested/kidnapped by the monsters.\nYoul'll then placed in a room with the only normal looking person in the game.\nHe explains to you that you're a hallucinating schizophrenic and had a psychosis,\nhe tells you you've killed countless peoples lives (now you'll get flashbacks from a "normal"perspective"\nshowing you killing innocent men, women, and children) and that you've been the main newstory\nall week and been hunted by the government. Revealing you have been a psychopath.\nYour character can't accept it and kills the psychologist and tries to escape in a \n["Black ops revelations"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02DUaeo9iw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=61) type of mission, getting flashbacks seeing yourself killing people\nwithout regret, your character finally breaks down and kills himself with a gun from a guard. The End.\nThe backstory is you were put in a mental hospital at a young age, one day you're attacked\nby another patient, landing you in the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry it sounds a bit weird, but it has been in my head for a couple of days\nand I can't really get the concept out of my head.\n\nThe thing is, it has to be really well executed. The regular people have to act\nlike normal people just looking scary to the player, the cops are the only ones attacking you first.\nIt's kinda inspired by Postal 2's Apocalypse Weekend.\nIt should be extremely bloody and not using as much jump-scares but more psychological horror.\nFocusing on the feeling of being alone and followed. One defining moment should be\nkilling a monster up close, cutting its throat, looking into human eyes. Moments showing something's\nwrong should be popping up through the entire game.\n\n**TL;DR: You kill monsters in a apocalyptic world, in the end revealing you're a psycho running around killing\ninnocent people.**\n\nIt's still just an idea, so tips, ideas and critique are welcomed. I've also thought of this as a movie and a book, but a game seemed like the best.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1391828601|1xbt80|Dolphin Call of Duty|So the basic premise is that you are on a team of 128 dolphins in the Pacific ocean. There is another team of dolphins. One team are ninjas and one are pirates. You are using class appropriate weapons. The last dolphin standing then becomes ninja or pirate god. This gets them special buffs the next game.\n\nAlso. Motion controls.
1474681272|54855i|Break-In|When the game starts out, your character is an ordinary man with a wife, kids and a pet in an ordinary house. The news says that there have been break-ins in the neighborhood. You must first go around the house and try to remember what you have so you'll know if something gets stolen.\n\nWhen you judge yourself done with that, you go to sleep. The next morning, there's signs of a break-in. You must figure out what's stolen and use clues to figure out how the burglar got in and what kind of items he's targeting. Some will just be targeting money, some jewelry, some food, some electronics, and some will come for anything valuable.\n\nThen, using that information, you must use your remaining items to create a trap that will catch the burglar in the act. You can also use money to go to buy things from the store across the street, or ask neighbors to lend your something, but if the neighbor's things get stolen, they will be angry at you and won't lend you stuff in the future, and they even make you compensate them for it.\n\nSome burglars you may have to be robbed by multiple times before you can find a pattern in their burglaries. When you catch one, the police reward you with more money that you can use to make traps for future burglars. You get a new burglar each time you catch one.\n\nOnce you get far into the game, you may even encounter burglars that are looking to murder your family members, rather than stealing things. There's no telling what order those will go in, but they always go for you last, so you have a limited number of nights (One night for each family member and pet) to catch them before you lose the game. Lets say we make the player have a wife, a son, two daughters, and a dog. The murderer may kill the dog first, they may kill the son first, or they may kill the wife or one of the daughters first. After he gets through them all, though, at one per night, he kills you and you lose the game. Each family member you lose is dead for the rest of the game, but perhaps we could have an adoption center in the game to get more kids (adopting a kid just to use him/her as a meat shield isn't very ethical, but oh well), a shelter to adopt more pets from, and a mail-order bride service. These would all cost money, and have a chance of not working that increases if you let too many die. (I did a background check, and you've had 3 kids in a row get killed the day after you adopted them. We can't give you another. Sorry, sir.)
1454265221|43k7w0|On rail mm shooter|To preface, this is a half baked idea that I'm posting from my phone because I'm worried I'll forget about it.\n\nThe idea: a simplistic 5v5 (csgo stylish) fps, with the twist of before every round there is a one minute period to draw the rail your character will follow.\n\nWhen a character finishes their rail, they will be able to draw on more, but while they do they will be vulnerable to being attacked, so the rail creation would have to be well thought out\n\nSorry I can't write more I'm at an event but I feel while this is a simplistic idea with flaws, it could possibly be of interest to someone :)\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n
1437118107|3dlnyi|You're a ghost who must setup freak accidents in a contract with Death!|This game is set on a modern, populated island with a few hundred residents and a northeastern always-cloudy-and-gloomy atmosphere. They all have generic routines around the house; making breakfast, watching TV, mowing the lawn, going to bed, etc..., and most of them have jobs they travel to on the island.\nYou're an invisible ghost. You were once a resident of the island but you were murdered by an unknown killer. Death has spared you eternity in the abyss, for now, under the condition that you help him cross a number of names off his list. As an added bonus, he'll eventually let you get revenge on the person who killed you before the story took off.\nSo, the gameplay.\nYou cannot simply ghost-punch people in the face and kill them, but instead, you have to CAUSE their deaths through moving objects in game and setting up traps and freak accidents like an ill placed toy at the top of the stairs that no one was paying attention to because it wasn't there just a second ago. \nYou have to observe a little and figure out your victims routines for everything to go smoothly. The more bold your actions are, the more likely it is that someone will notice strange things happening in their home. If Ms. Jones notices the toaster sitting by the bathtub then she will carry herself in much more suspect manner and make things more difficult for you, and if she turns a corner and sees a kitchen knife floating in mid-air, ...she may very well call the exorcist. If the exorcist arrives in the home you are at, surviving his encounter will give you a fresh start on the mission, but if he successfully exercises the home then you will be banished from it until you are strong enough to reenter (and you become stronger with each death you cause). As you progress and do become stronger, you slowly work your way to the title of a demon. At this level of strength you may actually give someone a little nudge while they're on a ladder or something similar, but  once again, the more bold your actions are - the more risk you take. At this stage you may attract the attention of guardian angels, and without taking any sides or getting too religious, if a guardian is alerted to your presence then your only hope is to very stealthily avoid it and cause an accidental death (for gameplay/balance reasons). \nIt's obviously a dark narrative and if it were fleshed out properly would be restricted in a few countries, but I think it scores points for originality, concept, and boldness. There are plenty of other details I've thought of for the game but I'd like to hear what someone else says about the basic premise, the mechanics of it, and what they'd add or remove. Very open to criticism! 
1479941879|5ekd6m|You're a time traveller that travelled to Medieval times. The local people want to burn you as a witch/warlock. You have a gun, but you're also outnumbered, so you must use your wits to survive.|
1471768864|4ytxiq|You can freeze time and can act while it's frozen. You need to defuse catastrophic situations. You'll see the (successful or failed) outcome when you resume time.|With all the interesting mechanics we've seen (e.g. rewinding time in "Life is strange"), this is certainly not just doable, but the time is also right for this.\n\nI'm just watching "Heroes" on Netflix (which isn't bad, currently at S1:E7) which inspires this idea. A car is exploding. People are around. Parts will probably fly around. The explosion will probably consume a person or two. Time is frozen. What to do? Which object needs to be moved, changed, used? etc.\n\nThe player could be confronted with all kinds of such situations, can alter them, and when they resume time, the consequences are calculated (e.g. via physics engine, but also people's reactions to things suddenly being (re)moved etc.). A "simple" version of this game could come down to a score evaluation of the outcome, but the more sophisticated version that I hope we'll be able to pull off in the coming years is one where the whole game's event development is tied to these situations and their outcomes, possibly even without predefined freeze points but arbitrary (albeit recharging) freezing power, so ideally it would just be a simulation happening over time, and you can "adjust" it at will, except you'll have to put up with the many side-effects, the emergent situations etc.

So here is my idea to combine them. \n\nYou control a big, mobile fortress. On that fortress you can build certain towers in a traditional TD way. You roam a big open map pulling aggro of the monsters that roam there. They will run up your ramps, onto your fortress and try to get to the core. Your towers will kill them, and any loot that they drop on your fortress is yours.\n\nLoot could be various resources for building and upgrading your towers, special towers, or equipable upgrades to give your towers unique abilities. \n\nAs you roam and get stronger you will be able to go into more difficult areas, fight stronger monsters and get better loot.

How would I create diversity here? I'm thinking of doing it by profession. So for a lawyer, its enclosure would be a desk. For a sports star you might need a bigger enclosure with a field, and it would do tricks for the crowd. 
1446249293|3qwouw|Idea for a Shooter using a dismemberment system [X-POST from /r/Gaming]|Someone told me to post this here after having posted it in [This Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3qug9q/tis_but_a_scratch/cwixm9v?context=3)\n\nI've always imagined a sort of zombie war game with this kind of dismemberment mechanic. The story was basically going to be that countries began turning their dead soldiers into zombies to fight wars because they feel no pain, and players would play as these zombie soldiers on one side and humans on the other in basic game types like CTF or Deathmatch, Survival (both against waves of zombies *or* humans), etc. You'd have stuff like zombies legs being blown off by mines only to have them keep crawling along the ground with a gun in one hand, or if they only had one arm left they'd crawl up to the enemy and try and grab them to sort of "stun" them, while dealing biting damage. Or, crawl up behind a human player, the zombie pulls the pin on their own grenade, SURPRISE!\n\nGot both arms blown off? Run at the humans in a suicide mauling attempt. Got one leg? You'll still be crawling pretty fast and can shoot just fine. Want a longer melee range? At the sacrifice of one of your arms and the ability to shoot anything but one-handed firearms you can rip it off and use it like a spear with the knife in that hand.\n\nI pictured it as being a sort of goofy game where the story wouldn't really matter all that much. The zombies would be "intelligent", but they'd still be utter dopes, while the humans would probably be anything from satirical portrayals of the "ACTION HERO AMERICA" archetype to the gritty survivor archetype and other ridiculous stuff. Mainly multiplayer, it'd be something along the lines of TF2 (Though, not sure what would be a good replacement for mountains of hats). Someone also mentioned this could make an interesting RTS. I'd have to think more about how that'd work but I've always been somewhat of a fan.
1443800974|3n8llh|The gun that doesn't want to kill|To preface, this is a game I want to make, but with little, meaning zero, experience in game development and no idea where to start, I understand it's likely to never become a reality, and as depressing as that sounds I'd much rather write then develop, though one day I do hope to write for games, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe initial idea was a gun that didn't want to kill, and it bloomed from there.\n\nThe game starts on a sort of old power point esque type of scene, you know, the kind of the thing you see at the fallout 3 start screen? These "panels" tell the story of a group of scientists who were, years ago, intent on developing a weapon that had true artificial intelligence, to give useful intel and combat support in the middle of a fire fight. They succeeded in both creating the AI, and installing it into a simple gun, naming it P.A.G. (Personal Assistant Gun). However, Pags personality proved to be difficult. \n\nHe didn't want to kill. This weapon intended to murder and take lives on a battlefield was making a choice, or trying to at least. Despite being installed into a gun, and having access to several powerful sensors and other neat features, he has no control over his actual functionality as a gun, so he could not stop himself from firing when his trigger was pulled.\n\nThis made him very angry, and he would constantly, and very vocally protest to all his tests, even screaming at his creators to stop forcing him to be a weapon. It was decided that even though they could mute Pag, there was no use in a weapon that didn't want to kill, and would most likely be more detrimental then a help to anyone on an actual battlefield. \n\nFast forward some odd years, and our silent protagonist steps in, being assigned to guard duty at a well known research base. During his first night they are, of course, attacked. The enemy catches the base off guard, storming in, killing many scientists and soldiers alike. Our protagonist wakes up after being knocked out cold from a near by explosions, looking up to see soldiers passing over him, and many other corpses, putting a bullet in any head that moved. The protagonist, with a whole lot of luck is able to stay still, and avoid being killed then and there. \n\nHe makes his way through the now mostly destroyed facility, and finds himself inside an old research wing. Here he finds himself a gun, but it is an odd one, with strange lights, and it's plugged into a wall. He's never seen anything like it, but he picks it up and plans his escape. \n\nWhile moving down a corridor he's spotted by enemy combatants, and is forced to shoot and kill them both (there are 2), but upon firing at the first, the gun springs to life, and cries out, confused and jolted. At first it sounds terrified, afraid, and then asks if the it's wielder just killed some body, then goes through an almost traumatic seeming moment of "oh no", as if it's in some sort of disbelief. \n\nAs the game progresses many more enemies confront our silent killer, the player being forced to either kill them, or die. All the while the gun is screaming, yelling, and even at times begging you to stop, to put him down so he doesn't have to kill again.\n\nDuring the down times, to quiet points, he talks to you, he tells you what it's like to be an intelligent being shoved into something he hates so much, how he wishes only to help, not take lives, and one day he even dreams of becoming a flare gun, so that he can save people rather then kill them. Though, over time the gun realizes you won't stop killing, that you'll do anything to survive, and begins to criticize you more harshly, saying things like "You know those people had families, mother, fathers, spouses waiting for them. They'll never see them alive again because of you."\n\nAt the start Pag is confused, and tries to convince you to stop killing, that you can just sneak by, or even run, but as the game progresses he comes to hate you, to understand that you don't care what he thinks, that you'll use his body however you see fit, and his hopeful determination to stop you becomes a simpering, dark hatred towards the protagonist. \n\nTruth is this is a little dumbed down, and I don't really know how the ending would go. Though, I think it would be fun to find out.
1478227983|5b1957|Your total stats never increases, but when you level up, you can rearrange them to crush enemies|It's a real-time RPG. You start off with average stats in every category. For example, 10 categories, 10 points in each.\n\nLeveling up, you can switch them on the fly and absolutely crush enemies. 90 points in melee attack to kill one monster, then a split second later 90 points in ranged defense to block an attack.\n\nIt's very high-risk, high-reward. You need good reflexes to rearrange them on the fly. Also, you can only rearrange a few points at first. So you have to level up before you do anything crazy.

1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1422047947|2tg1o0|A game where you have to make someone late for work|The game consists of you, a god-like character, controlling the world similar to the Sims.  You watch over a person going through their typical morning routine before they leave for work.  It is randomized every time, so while you have no idea exactly what they'll do at every time, it will be a traditional shower/eat/dress type of thing.  You have no control over what the character does, but you will be changing everything around them.\n\nYou will have a limited number of "action points" that will let you change the world around this character, and will let you do absolutely anything.  You can change the timer on the toaster oven so it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.  You can make the phone ring when he/she is in the shower.  You can interact with every single object and move it, break it, or alter it in a realistic way.  You can only affect objects individually, so you can not do things like use a lighter to light a newspaper on fire, or anything like that.\n\nThere are two catches that will make you "fail" your mission.  \n\nThe first one is, you can't kill the character, either intentionally or accidentally.  If you make him slip on the floor and he hits his head too hard, causing him to die, you lose.  The character MUST be in working condition, so even hospitalizing them will cause you to fail.\n\nThe second catch is that the character cannot detect that his world is being interfered with by a higher power.  If you take his car keys and make them float in midair, he/she will freak out and won't go to work.  \n\nThe character's routine will change based on every action you do, and it's totally possible for them do skip breakfast or leave without ironing their pants, so it's not as simple as, do a thing and it makes them late.  It's important to use action points on things that will affect the most important tasks and tasks that are done near the end of the routine.  Different actions also cost different points, so while hiding the car keys under the bed may completely throw your character off, it will also cost an enormous amount of points, and may not be the best way to achieve the goal.\n\nThe appeal would be the replay value.  Every game will feature a new character with a new job, a new routine, and every house will have hundreds of objects to inspect and mess with.  Most of the time spent developing the game would go towards creating objects, so you could play for 50 hours and still be coming up with new ways to cause controlled chaos.  After all, it is a sandbox strategy game.

1432619362|37aolu|You kill monsters|Ive had this idea for a while and Recently got motivated to actually develop it. (i made a post here a while ago and got some pretty great advice) I'm an illustrator and was actually hoping I could get some critique on this project. I barely have anything developed (im serious its literally just a concept right now, all I have is a rather quickly done illustration and some ideas) but I feel that There is enough here for a little advice. :)\n\n\nAnyway, the idea came to me from seeing a picture online. I'm really bummed out that I don't have the picture with be but it depicted this giant monster looming over this little girls bed. On the bed there was a small teddy bear with a sword and shield ready to fight the monster off. I loved this idea. A child's toy fighting off the monsters that live under the child's bed and in the closet. I took the idea and did countless sketches but never reaching anything cohesive  I could turn it into. but after a lot of red bull and procrastination in league of legends i finally came to the conclusion it could be a game. \n\n\nThe basics of the game would be you and a team of 3 others would play as a toy or stuffed animal, like a sock monkey, a bunny, a wind up robot, things like that. Each character having varying abilities such as placing down mouse traps setting up walls. maybe one can have fast melee attacks or someone can have a small nerf gun rigged to shoot teeth. But all 4 of you fight off waves of monsters that try to make it to the child your protecting in bed. Shes sleeping and you need to keep her nightmares at bay! Now the monsters could be anything, Bats, spiders, the scary ass pictures in "Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark" but there would always be something looming through out the room that you cant attack. Like the spider. There would be sort of a silhouette of this spindly thing on the far end of the room pumping out what seems to be an endless swarm of creepy crawlies. The closer the enemies, the more the environment changes to a darker tone. like dirt on the walls and ceiling and floor. maybe cobwebs surrounding most of the room.\n\n\n\nanyway thats my idea. (at least the bulk of it) Critique would be awesome and that one illustration I did is right here ------&gt; http://imgur.com/a/XmR5x (along with the rest of my artwork)
1472565867|50b9vb|An incremental game about building a universe|**Name:** Incremental Universe\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nThe general idea is that you build a universe star-by-star\n\n**Plot:**\n\nIncremental game, so no real plot\n\n**Setting:**\n\nStart in a black screen. \n\n**Characters:**\n\nNone\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nEach click generates a star. At first, you can only create short lived red stars, and each star gives resources before it dies. Speed goes fast, about a billion years per minute. As you gain resources, you can buy nebulae and the like to generate stars for you, and there are different ranks of nebulae which produce different ratio of star types. The star types could be as follows (in order of rarity): \n\n- Class M Red Dwarf: Small stars with low resource generation, and no resource bonuses. Collapse in around 500 million years. Most common star in the game. \n- Class M Red Giant: Higher resource generation, but generally similar to Red Dwarf stars. Give a small bonus to resources when it dies. Lives about 750 million years. \n- Class M Red Supergiant: Rarest of the Class M Red stars. Very low resource per second, but go supernova, giving a large bonus to resources at the end of it's life - around 300 million years. \n- Class K Orange MS: These give medium output for around 500 million years, before changing to red dwarf stars for another 500 million years\n- Class G Yellow MS: Give medium to high output. These stars are where resource output becomes a reliable factor. They live for around 7 billion years, before turning into a Class M Red Supergiant\n- Class G Yellow Supergiant: These stars give less resources, and live about 3 billion years. When they die, they give a large amount of resources, and create a new nebulae in it's place, spawning mostly Class M stars, and the occasional Class K star\n- Class F White MS: These are rock solid stars. They live about 8 billion years, before turning to Class G Yellow MS stars for about a billion years, and then to a Class M Red Supergiant for about 200 million years. \n- Class A Blue/White MS: These are short lived - around 400 million years - but give a high amount of resources, before turning into Class M Red Dwarf stars\n- Class B Blue MS: These deliver a high amount of resources, for around 4 billion years before turning into Class K stars. \n- Class B Blue Giant: This star is a stellar workhorse, lasting 20 billion years, with a medium resource generation. Turn into Class A Blue/White stars after they die. \n- Class B Blue Supergiant: These are short lived stars - around 750 million years, before detonating into a very high resource gain supernova, and spawning several hundred Class M Red Dwarves when they do\n- Class O Blue MS: This is the third rarest star, living around 40 billion years and giving a high output of resources. When it dies, it turns into a Class F MS star, and following that progression.\n- Class O Blue Giant: Second rarest star, and greatly coveted. This star gives a very high output for around 20 billion years, before collapsing into a large nebula, which produces large quantities Class G stars, occasionally Class F stars, and rarely, a Class A star\n- Class O Blue Supergiant: The rarest and most coveted star. Gives an extreme amount of resources for 1.5 billion years, before collapsing into a massive supernova, and leaving behind several nebulae which produce copious amounts of Class B stars. But they are very rare stars, maybe one in 3,000,000 stars\n\nWhen the player has reached a sufficient level of resources, they can collapse their universe, and gain dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter alters the rarity of stars, giving higher chances of spawning rarer stars from the get go, and dark energy can be used to upgrade stars to last longer, give more resources, and die to create bigger supernovae and better classes of stars. \n\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nThe most standout feature, is that this has not been done in an incremental game, and has features from different types of incremental games that haven't been put together before. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nOnline\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nCould possibly do upgrades for Kreds on Kongregate, and similar websites to make money for the dev. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJust give me a shoutout somewhere. I will provide you with my IRL name if you decide to go ahead with it. 
1452018732|3zlg44|Headcrab stealth game|I'd like to share an idea that came to my mind last night. This is a first person stealth game where you play as a headcrab (yup, like one from Half-Life). Bullet-points below describe game-play mechanics without touching the story.\n\n* game consists of separate levels\n* each level has some objective like infiltrating some facility or just killing everyone\n* you may jump onto people's heads, the person becomes your "host" and you basically play as normal FPS game\n* when you are in headcrab mode you are small, silent, could pass under furniture or through went holes but can't do actual damage and if spotted can be killed easily \n* when you are in host mode you could use weapons, kill others etc.\n* when you decide to jump off your host he dies immediately but you need to make sure that others do not spot the body\n* if your host was killed while you were still attached you have a chance to survive and scramble away\n* time of you controlling a host could be limited to keep a balance or levels may be designed to make being on the same host all the time not efficient \n* there are things, typical for stealth games like alarm, enemies have proper vision, hearing etc.

1476041219|56nsrh|(Sorta) Realistic VR Tank Crew game.|Since walking around in VR is a bit weird, I was thinking it would be cool to have a game where you and a few other people act as tank crews. You've got gunners, drivers, etc. who all have to communicate and do their roles to take down enemy tanks. There would be WWII and Modern era, with WWII allowing Sherman vs Panzer IV, and Modern allowing M1A2 vs T90. The tank damage, armor, etc. should be fairly similar, but the inner workings would vary so each tank feels different to use and requires players to know their way around the tanks to be really effective. The damage system should be similar to games like War Thunder in that tracks, ammo, engine, crew, etc. can be damaged or destroyed completely and repaired to some extent.\n\nNote: This is my first post here, so sorry if this isn't laid out well. I might sort things better if need be.
1477854214|5a7mtb|A horror game with a unique twist|This here is not really an idea for a game, but rather a idea for a twist in a storyline.\n\nThis game starts of like the typical horror/survival game, waking up in an unknown, dark facility, only with a revolver, a flashlight and 6 bullets, not remembering what happened before. A friendly, feminine voice (like Glados) tells you that you have been "selected" and that she is here to help and guide you through the facility.\n\nIn the first part of the story, the voice tells you that there are enemies around which you have to avoid, and that she/it will restart the game from a previous checkpoint if you come too close to an enemy. As you go through the first part, you find digital writings that specify the enemy closer, describing it like a monster. At midnight, the friendly voice tells you that there is going to be an minor electricity issue and that the main computer is going to be shut down for a brief amount of time.\n\nThe second part of the story starts when the facility is shut down. \nLights are switched off, the voice is not there to help you, you only have 6 bullets and you haven't seen an enemy yet (Because the voice restarts the game, as mentioned above). The player of the game begins to feel scared, as he moves with the flashlight, and eventually coming across a room filled with enemies (as the voice told him) that he was in before.\n\nThat's when the twist happens: There are no enemies, and you don't need the revolver at all. At midnight, the player can move freely. In the first night, as he begins to visit rooms the voice wouldn't have let access him, he finds handwritten notes that state that the voice is evil and is trying to play a game with him.\n\nAfter the first night and the restart of the facility, the friendly voice talks to you and wants to proceed. The player now has to play along, now aware of the evilness of the voice, searching for an escape.\n\nThe shutdowns happen every night, lasting one hour. The player is free to move around everywhere he likes, but if the hour ends and the voice finds him in a restricted area or with a handwritten note, she/it will get suspicious until she/it eventually "disposes" you. The problem is that you will still die if you follow the voice's orders, so escaping at the last moment is a key element in the game.\n\nI hope you like my idea, although it's more of an twist than a game. Nevertheless, make sure to write your comments and thoughts below!
1458182719|4ar5dg|A very disturbing (yet Sadistically funny) racing game.|In a nutshell, the basic twist is that instead of cars, the racers are riding on the backs of large almost-naked humans crawling on all fours, with a large saddle on their backs. Meanwhile, the racers themselves are anthropomorphic car-like robots.\n\nThere would be limb dismemberment when the *vehicles* are damaged, as most of the powerups would involve bladed weapons. Lopping off limbs forces them to keep on crawling at the same pace, often dragging their stumps along the ground. All the while, a blank expression on their faces, "This is why I was bred, this is why I must race" being prolly the only thing they think.\n\n*Vehicles* would persist to writhe and struggle to crawl even after all limbs have been removed. It is up to the player to manually put the *vehicle* out of it's misery to get a new one.\nDecapitation (or severe blood loss) results in death of the *vehicle* and a new one being spawned in: a normal baby that rapidly grows to the size of the other *vehicles*.\n\nEdit: I think the best name for this should be Meatball Run (or Rally), as a reference to the real-life [Cannonball Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Baker_Sea-To-Shining-Sea_Memorial_Trophy_Dash) races and the racing films insipred by it (such as Canonballrun and Gumball Rally), and also due to the fact that the vehicles are infact made of meat.
1470543436|4wjefp|I would highly recommend looking into a career in game design for anyone seriously passionate in a big idea.|**WARNING!!!** This post assumes that you are actually passionate about your idea. The vast majority of ideas are a sudden lightbulb that results in a disorganized train of text, and then are quickly forgotten. You will have to put a lot of work into presenting your idea, providing knowledge and reasoning for every decision, directing every aspect of game development, being responsible for any failures, and balancing everything that is supposed to make the game fun. If you are passionate enough about your idea, you should find all of this to be easy and fun, though it is time-consuming. Also, you need to have a good visualization of the game in your head in order to give the artists and sound designers direction. \n\nIf you don't know, a [game designer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_design) is the visionary for a game, so basically the dream of everyone who posts here. **Game design is the art of making games fun.** Believe it or not, game ideas cannot be good or bad, as they have NOTHING to do with the fun of the game, only the initial appeal. As much as you love your ideas, if someone else makes it then there is no guarantee that it will be fun. This is where game design comes in.\n\nSomething extremely important to understanding game design is the game of **Tetris, with 495 million sales, the top selling video game of all time**. Think about how it would look as a post on this subreddit if you didn't know it already existed (shortest post of all time), and compare it with your ideas. You could probably very easily recreate Tetris in a day if you so wished, 495 million dollars worth of potential. This is what makes game design so important [Here](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Tetris-so-popular) is an excellent explanation of Tetris's game design, the source of its success. You'll notice that the explanation is very short, but it isn't even a simplification or summary. \n\n**So how do I bring my idea to life?** Well, it may have been implied that the idea doesn't matter, but it does. It provides the initial appeal for the game, a way to attract customers based on their interests, because fun isn't the only reason why people buy video games. The technical aspects of game development matter too, providing an observable response from which one can derive satisfaction. \n\n**The job of the game designer, not as easy as you may think, is to determine how to accomplish a number of things.** All branches of knowledge are connected, so you can always go more complicated in order to get a more thorough understanding, increasing your worth to game companies. In the case of Game Design, it involves elements of mathematics, cognitice neuroscience, semiotics, and cultural studies. \n\n* In your game, in what ways does the player get satisfaction? \n * Your brain releases feel-good chemicals under various circumstances to encourage certain motivations.\n * The number 1 most important part of a game, something that the vast majority of game ideas leave out. \n* Continuously provide new experiences, at least until the game is over.\n * The player needs an incentive to keep playing the game, or else other sources of satisfaction will begin to take priority.\n* Balancing the sources of satisfaction to be properly paced.\n * Too much satisfaction and the player quickly builds a tolerance. \n * Too little satisfaction and the player gets frustrated or bored.\n* Deciding how it is presented through the technical aspects. \n * The right sounds and animations are necessary in order for the player to properly *feel* the impacts of certain actions. \n* How simple or complicated the code for everything is. \n * It doesn't take much to think or write out pseudocode, simplify it as much as you need. \n * Things don't have to be massively complex in order to convey what you want. Players don't scrutinize every aspect of the game.\n * A game gets done quicker, cheaper, and more to your expectations if you know the limits of the company and coding in general. \n* Extensive analysis of playtesting results throughout the entire game development process. \n * Valve talks in its developer commentaries about how their games were shaped massively around playtesting. \n * The game designer needs to get inside the head of the player to balance the game to run smoothly.\n\nI'm really tired and I've been working on this for a few hours, so I'll leave it at that.\n\n**TL;DR - Ideas for game content flow freely, but what makes the content unique and fun is what really matters.**

While you queue for an opponent, you just keep running around in the maze.\n\nWhen you die, you see a list of everyone who you killed and who killed you.\n\nFor added fun, have procedurally generated levels, where each player starts in their own level and when you kill someone you "invade" theirs.

Imagine a game with near-permadeath, where being dead is a mini game mode.\n\nUpon dying, you come face-to-face with the Grim Reaper. There is a Wheel of Fate with various fates on it. Swipe to spin.\n\nIdeas for wheel options:\n\n* Divine Intervention -- instantly come back to life. The best, rarest outcome.\n* Purgatory -- this character can respawn again in X hours/days\n* Lake of Fire -- this character is forever, permanently dead.\n* Battle of Wits -- play a chess match against Death. Not a whole chess game, maybe a late-game chess puzzle.\n* Battle of Steel -- combat against the Grim Reaper. If you win, you are resurrected.\n* Sell your soul -- someone has paid a pittance for your soul. Now watch this ad to be resurrected. Can you imagine a player being happy/relieved to watch an ad? I find it amusing to break the 4th wall like this and have an ad company directly buy the player's respawn, instead of allowing the player to buy respawns.\n

1471916020|4z40io|A game where you get a day of prep before you are suddenly hunted down by everyone.|**Name:** Manhunt\n\n**Concept Overview:** \n\nIt starts out looking like you're in a nice, friendly city. Can you survive when it suddenly turns against you?\n\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou're a normal guy with a job, wife, kids, and friends. However, after 24 hours of playtime, the government suddenly puts a bounty on you, and now everybody is hunting you down with the intent of cashing in on the bounty. Your goal is to survive the manhunt for as long as possible.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nA fictional location with a strategic balance of urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, forests, rivers and lakes. Perhaps a swamp or something too.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe Player - like I said, starts out as an average joe. Has a job where he makes a moderate paycheck, loves his wife and kids. Just an average Joe that everyone decides to turn on for whatever reason.\n\nThe Player's Wife and Kids - unlike other characters, they won't be looking to kill the players when it starts, unless the player seriously offends them during prep time. They may even help defend the player if he plays his cards right.\n\nOther NPCs - Shopkeepers, people on the street, local politicians, etc. Most of them will try to kill you when the time comes, unless you were particularly nice to them.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nInteraction with people - During prep time, you can talk to people. The way you treat them determines how hesitant they'll be to kill you once the Manhunt starts. The meaner you are, the more bloodlusted they'll be, and the nicer you are, the more likely they are to spare you or even help you. Each character also starts out with a base amount of "friendliness", so some people will be easier to win over than others. They'll all start out being willing to kill you though, because money is money, except for your family.\n\nYou'll also be able to collect items during your prep time. You can buy weapons, food, vehicles, and other supplies. Or, I guess, you can steal them, but people won't like that.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n- The sudden, disorienting shift between the friendly city you got used to and the manhunt\n\n- The character's choices at the beginning of the game can have a profound impact on the rest.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nXbox, PS4, etc.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n- an end-goal, like getting the government to end the bounty.\n\n- character creation\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nMy reddit username in the credits.
1458050667|4aik24|a racing game where you're a poltergeist and you have to rig the results by possessing the racers|There are several (ex. 4) racers racing. You're a poltergeist whose relative has a penchant for gambling. Since he's always down on his luck due to his losing bets, you decide to help him. By possessing the drivers to rig the results.\n\nYou can possess the drivers for a limited time. You can do things like steer them wrong way, make them crash into drivers, etc. You could also help them by using boosters, making them fly (using poltergeist powers), shooting other drivers, etc. Anything to rig the results.\n\nThe only problem is that the higher up their rank is, the harder they are to possess, as well as the shorter the possession time. Whoever is currently in 1st place, you simply can't possess them (or maybe really limited time, like 1/2 second). Last place, instant possession if you try, and lasts pretty much a long time. BTW, all the drivers have different levels of AI, to make things more interesting. \n\nThe goal is to have to reach the EXACT rigged results required.
1461657468|4ghu4s|When you play the game again and use what you know from your first playthrough, you significantly impact the plot.|So here's my example to demonstrate how this would work.\n\nLet's say, early on in this hypothetical game, there's a safe. You and a friend have to get inside cause there's a clue or valuable item or some other macguffin. The first time you play through, you have to search the room and the belongings of the owner of the safe for the code. \n\nBut when you play a second time, you skip that whole process and just open the safe, probably unaware of the impact it will have. But your friend sees you just walk over to the safe and open and they're like "WTF, how did you know the code?" and your character in universe is just like "IDK, I just knew..." \n\nContinuing to do these sorts of actions changes the plot, while keeping the same overall goal, because somehow you now have some sort of ESP.\n\nNow, the player character doesn't instantly know EVERYTHING. They only realize things as they become important. Suppose Mark (eheheh) is a serial killer, which you learned later in the game on your first playthrough. On your second playthrough, you won't get much in the way of options related to it (maybe if you're a solid dick to him, it means you subconsciously know) until the murders are REALLY brought to your attention.\n\nThat's all I really have for an idea...no plot or nothing, just a weird mechanic.

The players are all invisible like in screencheat, and whenever you shoot, your bullet leaves a trail pointing to where you just were. Movement also leaves a trail, but it is much less noticeable.|Maybe operating with a class system also. A tank with a minigun would be very easy to spot, while a scout character would be harder but take fewer hits to kill. Maybe a class that can mark people also with a special item.\n\nThink classes similar to TF2. You don't have to use similar, but it's a good example of how the balancing could work.
1423541027|2vdr6p|Flairs|I added flairs to the subreddit. After submitting a post you can now click "flair" underneath the post title to give it a flair. These flairs are for indicating how difficult your game idea will likely be to make. If you do not know (or if you are doing something other than suggesting a game) feel free to not flair it, a moderator might flair it later and I am considering implementing some sort of system for allowing users (preferably those who are experienced developers) to vote on the flair.\n\nThe current flairs are (credit goes to /u/nounoursheureux/ for coming up with them):\n\n* Beginner: Game ideas that would only require an amateur developer.\n\n* Intermediate: Game ideas that would require a professional developer or a team of amateur developers.\n\n* Experienced: Game ideas that would require a team of professional developers.\n\n* AAA: Game ideas that would require a large AAA company to produce.\n\n* Dream: Game ideas that aren't really feasible right now but that might be possible at some point in the future.\n\n* Abstract: Game ideas that are too abstract to assign a difficulty to.\n\nI would love some feedback on this. I hope to make various improvements over the next few weeks, but I do not want to do anything that the community disagrees with. So I will make feedback and discussion threads for all new / potential features.
1467160574|4qcrqz|A computer virus tycoon game?|So, I was searching the internet recently, and I noticed a game like this does not exist yet, and so I wanted to share my idea here. So, without further ado, let's get into where I sort of took inspiration from:\n\nI'm thinking gameplay similar to the likes of Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life. However, instead of crafting your own video games and youtube videos, the player is making computer viruses to unleash upon the internet.\n\nI think the endgame would probably be something along the lines of Plague Inc / Pandemic 2: infect the majority of the world with your computer viruses until no survivors are left.\n\nThe graphical style of the game doesn't have to be anything special: again similar to Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life - maybe a little more futuristic.\n\nOf course, the game would probably include an upgrade / research mechanic, in which the player could unlock the ability to make different types of viruses (worms, trojans, ransomware, etc.), or be able to research or unlock different components to include in their viruses; Just like Game Dev Tycoon, the player would be able to customize each computer virus to their liking.\n\nThe player may also have to deal with not being caught by the police as an added mechanic. The player may do this by implementing anti-tracking software into their viruses, or by upgrading a certain skill.\n\nThe only problem I see with this  is how to make a currency system work within the context of the game, since most viruses don't exactly generate money.\n\nAlso, I imagine there would have to be a disclaimer placed somewhere within this game , since computer viruses are a pretty touchy subject.\n\nTell me if there are any other flaws that this game might have, any ideas you might want to add on, etc. I have had this idea in my head for a long time and am happy to share it with Reddit. \n\nThank you for reading!

1413350766|2jajrv|A first person home invasion survival game.|It would only run for about 15 - 25 minutes. You wake up late at night to the sound of a door opening downstairs. You walk around in darkness, your world illuminated by the moonlight in some windows and your Iphone, if you can get downstairs and find it. You realise that somebody has broken into your house and is in hiding. The invader has shut off the electricity from the basement and locked all the doors and windows leading outside. You could phone the police but that would let the invader know where you are and he can catch you. If he catches you, its possible to fight him by picking up household objects, but he has brute strength so it would be dangerous to do so.
1467789139|4rhbbq|Four player co-op heist game. Except, none of the players are robbing anything.|Player 1: The Driver\n\nThe driver is the escape driver for a group of people robbing a bank or something, but as the game progresses, each level becomes more challenging and complex, with you having to fly airplanes, hide cars, and etc. Each level is in the same open world, but each level has a set plan as well for you to follow. For instance, one level could have a plan where you have to get rid of the cops, then ditch the car inside a tunnel to replace with another car, with which you then have to drive abiding by the laws back to your base. \n\nYou can upgrade your escape vehicle, whatever vehicle type, (Plane, boat, car) after each mission by adding different chassis, faster engines, bulletproof windows and chassis, etc. (using in-game money)\n\nPlayer 2: The Gunman\n\nThe Gunman has to protect the driver by firing outside the passenger's seat window, as well as protecting the robbers by escorting them to escape van/car.  You'd also have to find places to ditch your weapons. \n\nYou can upgrade your weapons, buy new ones, buy concealed weapons or weapon holsters for you and the robbers, as well as kevlar vests and masks. (using in-game money)\n\nPlayer 3: The Planner\n\nThe planner plans out missions, as well as scout out locations, and vehicles. You can preplan a route, steps, car and weapon ditching locations, vehicles, and more. You also recommend weapons to use by both the Gunman and the robbers. You hire and assemble a team for each heist, as well. You can also use in-game money to upgrade each team member\n\nPlayer 4: The Collector\n\nThe Collector has the job of saving and dividing money between the other three players, which means the four players would have to start out with preplanned low-risk missions, possibly convenience stores or small restaurants. \n\nPlayer 4 other idea: The Hacker: The Hacker views a map as the heist progresses. The Hacker can view where police are nearby the other players, and hack radio comms, police controls, and others, but only for a short period of time, and not over and over. \n\n\n\n-----------\nGraphics: Top down or first person, depends on player. (Driver and gunman are first person, Planner is either, Collector is top down) \nThe graphics could be low res minimalist of sorts, probably blocky. \n\nLayout: The city would have to be diverse, like Los Santos from GTA V, but with different islands each with different styles. \n\nOther: There should probably  be a minimum of two players, with them playing gunman and driver, but the others would be semi-advanced AI, at least enough to make good decisions and good plans, if missions are not already pre-planned and pre-scouted. 
1433711460|38y6ge|Time controlling heist game|The idea is that you control a team of 4 people trying to pull off a heist. The main mechanic is that you are essentially planning a heist, which means that you can go back and change anything. You play by looking at the level from a top down over view. You then choose a character and take control of them in a first person perspective (might be executed in some other ways if you want to scale the game down). At any time, you can jump back to the overview, and take control of another character. You can also go back through the timeline to redo a specific piece of the character's actions. For example, you might try to get a guy in through the main entrance. However, as soon as he gets in, he is spotted by a guard and shot. So you take another character and make him break a window to distract the guard. You then hide the second character and make the first character go through the entrance, this time without getting shot.\n\nThe idea is to make this a sort of puzzle game with multiple solutions. Perhaps there would be rewards for not redoing any paths or for accomplishing side objectives or for doing it in a very short amount of time. What do you guys think?
1448421044|3u60qi|Computer Building Simulator.|There are plenty of simulation games out there now. Some ridiculous and over the top, others pretty interesting. My idea is that there be a game that teaches you the inner workings of a computer. What different parts do, what works and what doesn't, etc.\n\nPerhaps there would be a career mode. At the beginning of each level, you're given specifics on what your customer is looking for in a computer and you're given a limited budget to achieve it. You shop around for computer parts and put together a computer with them. \n\nIt would, in my opinion, be a great learning tool/game.

1356827043|15ncs9|A Hide-and-Seek game in which you don't know if you are the hider or the seeker|A game in which each round would last a relatively short while. There are two characters, the human and the monster. Each character is played by two random strangers chosen from a server (like Omegle). Each player is put into one of the roles, but they don't know which they play. There are no differences so that even if they were to look on each other's screens, it would be impossible to tell. The game takes place in a maze, and there is a time counter on the side. The human has to survive as long as they can, and the monster has to catch the human in as short of a time as they can. As the players come closer to each other, they will hear each other's footsteps. This is the whole game. At this point, will the players run away, or rush forward? Being a monster and running away means you take away from your time, and being a human and rushing forward means you could get caught. But once the two meet, it becomes clear as one player looks like a monster and the other a human. After this point, the monster player speeds up, and the human player gets a gun. The gun only has two bullets, and only slows down the monster. Ammo crates appear around the map, which don't reappear after being taken. This means the monster eventually wins, but the point of the game is to see if your choice to run away or rush forward is correct
1409197714|2esih6|I don't think it's particularly plausible... But I had an idea for an RTS based on terraforming|Basically, there would be two factions. One side is natural (which I've been calling the Growth), and the other is industrial, which I've called the Machine. \n\nThe Machine would be industrialized and be the simpler faction. It just focuses on mass production, and in general would have stronger, more numerous units, but very few special abilities. Massed robot infantry, automated tanks and aircraft. I've been thinking of a swarm-style buildings for them. The buildings would be small and slow to produce, but you could build a lot of them very quickly. Maybe a click-and-drag function for placing down multiples at once in a grid format? \n\nTheir defenses would be a turret "wall" of sorts. Place a base, and then click-and-drag to send out a rail as far as you drag with turrets on it. The rail can go out for a long time, but destroying the base will destroy every turret on it. \n\nThe Growth will play a little more conservatively. No refined metals, but stone could be their armor. So their big units could be things like giants. Other units could be things like large birds, predatory hunters, and giant bugs. Their buildings and units, in general, are weaker and less numerous than the Machine, but they have a much wider range of special abilities and access to druidic magic. Climate warfare, healing, etc., would be available to them.\n\nTheir defenses would be more organic. Giant bug nests, pitfalls, and other natural traps. \n\nAnd my biggest idea is the terraforming. Most of the map can start out as a barren wasteland, fit for neither life or machine. Workers from both faction, instead of building or gathering, can work on converting the land for their needs. The Machine could flatten out the land and lay down metal to prevent the Growth from taking it, and the Growth can fertilize the land and plant seeds to slow down the Machine. Buildings can only be built on land that has been terraformed to your side, so you need to expand as quickly as possible to get the resources you need. In order to terraform an area that your enemy has taken, you would have to remove theirs, first. \n\nI also have an idea for terraforming to be used offensively. If you terraform an area with an enemy building on it, you could synthesize that building. All the units that building was able to create can now be built by you, with some differences. The Machine could add parts to the now enslaved Growth to make them stronger and hardier, but move and recharge their abilities slower. The Growth could overgrow into the Machine's creations and take control from there, making them faster, but more fragile. \n\nHow viable is this without a full game studio? I dunno. I don't expect it to ever get made. Just wanted to see what you guys thought of my idea. 
1417503227|2o0wub|You Will Die- A horror game concept|Opening\n---------------------\nNine thirty. You've been working your dead end job at the Stop Shop department store for two months and you're already regretting it, but your shift is up and that's what matters. Or it would be if you hadn't offered to take the night shift to cover for your lazy friend. It's New Year's and everyone in the whole damn store is going home, Christmas music slowly waning as the lights in the store shut off row by row. You grab your PDA and start stacking items on the shelves like the good little robot you are. Now you're here until four in the morning. Asshole.\nBut you're not alone.\nYou hear footsteps and look over to see a person casually strolling down the hall. You start to say something to him, maybe it was the cheerful hello all Stop Shop employees give, maybe you were going to tell him to get the hell out. What matters is that he pulls out a gun and shoots you from twenty feet away. \nWelcome to the game. \nThis man will kill you. The End.\n\nWhy come up with an idea like this?\n--------------------------------------------\nI'm halfway through my Master's Degree in Criminal Forensics and I've always had to deal with the worst of humanity. I've also been thinking about indie horror games lately; they're getting quite a surge of popularity in the last half-decade. With the advent of games as art, I've been thinking that games shouldn't have to be fun to play. They should be an experience. Possibly a painful experience, but something we can learn from. \nYes, I'm trying to distance this from Alien: Isolation. The difference is this can, and has, happened to people. It is... horrifying. It's ungodly. And I wonder if that feeling of helplessness can be captured in a video game, because I'm weird and it's 12AM and I can't sleep now.\n\nWhat is it?\n---------------------\nYWD is a horror survival first-person adventure game that is based around the main character being hunted by a serial killer. There are no weapons in the game, and nothing you can use can suitably incapacitate him. You're just trying to stay alive as long as you can. The game features permadeath, meaning you can't respawn after you are killed, but you can save items in your locker which will make them available after you restart the game.\n\nThe game would involve hiding from, avoiding confrontation with, and outsmarting the serial killer if the situation came to it. \nThe map it takes place in would be small, but easy to memorize and navigate, with backrooms and non-standard heavy equipment. The store would hypothetically be completely interactive. with the ability to pick up and interact with any item, open any box, knock anything over. There wouldn't be a traditional crafting system but any item could be combined superficially, even if it was just wrapping a rope around a carton of eggs. Each item would have different effects in the world, mostly culminating in whether it attracts or distracts the killer. \n\nThere are many preset paths to try to escape, but most of them have risky consequences. You can attempt to go for the office phone and call 911, but that location has no doors beside the way you enter. You can try to run for it, but the freezing snow will likely slow you down. You can try to hide from the killer, but he will smash everything in sight looking for you. In addition, the killer can access any items in the area to counter your actions.\nThe game would not use a health bar or regenerating health, focusing on a Metal Gear Solid 3 approach where you can look down in First Person to see your body, and view injuries, which need to be handled to resume normal operation. A gunshot to the leg, for example, will cause you to hobble while an injury to the head will make you become dazed. There are no medkits, so you have to scavenge from the store to heal yourself, with items being freely applied due to the completely interactive store design. \nFinally, you have to memorize the killer as well. How many bullets in his gun, the reach of his knife, his overwhelming strength in comparison to yours, his attentiveness to certain areas and what he'll be expecting to look for. Use his knowledge against him.\n\nEveryone dies. \nBut not everyone lives.\nHave fun.
1448344345|3u1myw|Slippery Slope: The Game! (Potentially NSFW, depending on the work, I guess. Not sure, really.)|My apologies if this isn't the right place for this. Seems like the closest match, but there might not actually be a right place for this. I also don't know if it's been suggested before, because I have no idea what to enter in the search box to check.\n\nThe concept is about as politically correct as Cards Against Humanity...\n\n---\n\nI was on Facebook, reading the comments on an article like a true masochist, and I came across a comment claiming abortion will lead to cultural destruction, because immigrants. No further details were given. And then I got this idea, because sometimes I'm very lonely.\n\nThe core premise of the game is to come up with Insane Troll Logic, as it's described on TvTropes, and from there, so many possibilities.\n\nI immediately thought of this party game I played, back when I got invited to parties. Everyone would write a sentence on a piece of paper, and then pass that paper to the person next to them, who'd have to draw that sentence. Then, that person would fold the paper so as to hide the original sentence, and then pass it to the next person, who'd have to describe the drawing in a sentence, and who would then further fold the paper so as to hide the drawing, etc. \nSo my first idea was a variant of that idea, except that instead of interpreting drawings or illustrating sentences, you'd start with a vaguely controversial premise, and each player would add one level of ridiculous cause-and-effect, with knowledge only of the previous layer. \n\n(Player 1: X. Player 2: If X, then Y. Hides 'X'. Player 3: If Y, then Z. Hides 'Y'. And so on...)\n\n\nAnd then I thought of game variants, because my brain won't leave me alone.\n\nYou could have a variant that's a bastardized version of the Wikipedia game, where two or more players are given an initial premise, a disastrous ultimate consequence, and the winner is either whoever completes it quickest or whoever does it in the fewest layers of ridiculous Slippery Slope arguments as possible.\n\nIn either version, the additional layers have to follow from each other, even if the logic involved is patently false. Purely random statements wouldn't be permitted.\n\n(Permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, children would grow up thinking shirts are invariably optional, which would lead to medical personnel not wearing tops to work, which would lead to more botched surgeries due to surgeon distraction, which would lead to a massive upswing in medical malpractice suits, which means most hospitals would be forced to close, meaning more people will die during childbirth because the nearest hospital is too far away.\nAllowing naked female breasts in PG-13 movies will cause tragic, preventable deaths of newborns.'\n\nNot permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, movies as a medium would cease to exist, which would cause supermarkets to hike up food prices by 3000%, because Batman.'\n\nSo, yeah... No good way to end this post, really... My apologies again if I'm in the wrong place, which is entirely likely, or if I've broken scads of subreddit rules, which I don't think I have, but I could easily be wrong.

1458362188|4b1tnn|Robot survival game|Basically, my idea is for a survival game where you play not as a human, but as a robot. You'd still have core survival elements under new headings (energy as opposed to food, oil as opposed to water), but would allow for customization to a greater degree than most survival games, and would allow for more a level playing field PVP-style.  \nFor example, robots can be upgraded, replace parts, download programs in ways humans cannot. You'd have the standard ability increases like faster move speed, increase carrying capacity, but you could have more extreme ones that wouldn't work with humans. You can have your character 'download' a program to, say, double jump or find and install an extra arm, letting characters to be much more varied then there are in survival games right now, which are mostly gear-dependent.  \nRobots also allow for a more level playing field in PVP, since most (read: pretty much every single survival PVP-game) starts off at caveman tech and escalates to current level. So you end up with five guys with bows going against one guy with a semi-automatic rifle; odds are, the one guy wins. On the other hand, robots could start off at our current level (or near enough), and upgrade to future tech, thus, you end up with five robots with Uzi's going against one guy with a plasma cannon. The plasma cannon guy still has an advantage, but the difference between the two groups is less extreme, sort of like the difference between level 1 and level 10, and level 51 and 60.  \nMy idea for a 'robot survival game', I feel, still embraces the core concepts that make survival games enjoyable while expanding on others  and attempting to fix common problems that crop in survival games. If you have any questions, go ahead and leave a comment.

1483842086|5mogt3|A puzzle game where you have a tool that can switch game genres|It's exactly what it sounds like. You can switch between game genres at will to solve puzzles. Some genres won't really work (I'm pretty sure you can't incorporate rhythm into solving puzzles), but some genres I think can work.\n\nLike, for example, maybe in a cutscene your character says that he can see a symbol that might help in a puzzle, but you can't see it yourself, so you change the genre to a first person game so you can see what your character's talking about.\n\nOr maybe there's an enemy that you try to fight, but he's too fast for you to defend yourself, so you switch to a turn-based RPG, so that he can only attack on his turn.\n\nThose are just my ideas. You probably can think of more. I only just thought of this yesterday.

It reminded me of an interview with Cliff Bleszinski where he was talking about the Rift being utilized for seated simulation (flight, racing etc).\n\nI love that concept. The Rift is cool with games like Skyrim and Half Life but not being able to move around kind of breaks the illusion. Someday....someone will make an omni directional treadmill...but in the meantime...why not limit the characters mobility?\n\nI'm imagining a survival horror game with light to medium action. I don't have many ideas beyond the initial concept. I just think it would be super immersive given the technology that is currently available. \n\nThanks for reading!

1482841854|5kjiie|A different approach on zombie games|Hi all,\n\nThis is my first post on this subreddit, and while I've been reading through and searching game ideas here, I haven't seen anyone posting the idea I got in my mind today. I apologize if someone has posted a similar idea here earlier. My game idea is as it is - an idea without a highly detailed plot or twists or anything. Feel free to give feedback and use this idea if you like.\n\n**The rough idea**\n\nI'd like to see the roles being swapped in zombie games: instead of being a normal and healthy person fighting against hordes of zombies, the player either starts the game as a zombie or turns into one in the beginning of the game. \n\nHere's the catch: the zombie which the player is controlling is fully aware of what he/she is and the primary goal of the game is to find a cure for the disease and cure yourself. While being a zombie, you are unable to talk and tell any human-NPCs that you are not going to attack or eat them. In order to survive, you need rotting or fresh flesh (either human or animal) for eating and for finding the cure you'll need human help as you lack the essential fine-motorics to prepare any medicines or handling any items on which fingers are needed for. So, to get a human-NPC to help and trust you in the first place, player needs to find a way to contact/interact with/message to the NPC that you're friendly and need help.\n\nSo, this is the rough idea that I had to get out of my head before I lose it. I might or might not work with it myself but you are free to use this and modify it to your purpose as you like. Mention me in the credits if you finish something. :P Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Formatting

I'm not a developer, coding and whatnot flies right over my head, but I wanted to share the thought.\n\nThe basic premise would be that you are a dentist for mythical creatures like dragons and whatnot. It would be in the same vein of surgeon simulator with you doing things like removing swords and adventurers lodged in their teeth. The failstate would be some sort of pain indicator, and if it gets too high, you are eaten. \n\nIdeally it would be for the vive and involve the room scale, as you would be tromping around inside a giants moth, rooting out the bones of something he ate, etc.\n\nJust thought it would be neat, and wanted to share it somewhere. The concept is goofy of course, but I think that would be half the fun of it.

I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

1446420150|3r53ao|A videogame which seems like a kiddy adventure game, as long as you follow the linear path the story has set you. The more you deviate from the main storyline path, the more unsettling, creepy, and horrific the game gets.|

1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**
1433520967|38oorq|Many game ideas here are far too big in scope. I made a (satirical) tool to help.|Hi! I make games.\n\nI see a lot of enthusiasm here for giant dream games -- MMO sandboxes as far as the eye can see. Those ideas unfortunately aren't useful to anyone. Why? [Your game idea is too big](http://yourgameideaistoobig.com/).\n\nWant to see your ideas upvoted and games made from them? Distill your dream game down to the smallest, simplest possible concept.
1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.
1467336842|4qp7mb|30 Random Game Ideas! #3!|Hey all,\n\nSorry I haven't really had time to post these! Work has been a pain, and well, I haven't had much time to go on Reddit, nor much inspiration for ideas, but I finally managed to get some free time, and well, here's part three! Enjoy. :D\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)\n\n* 1. A game where you attempt to sell as many of your own organs as fast as possible before you die.\n* 2. A game where the only objective is to slow down people from their everyday grind/task. This could be played in several ways, such as the player being a spirit, actual person, creature, god, etc...\n* 3. A game where you play as a Godzilla esque monster and get to level a really massive city. The more you destroy, the more powerful and large you get. It's a bit [like that game released for PS3/4 recently, but perhaps actually good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AVoKxcaUo)\n* 4. A game a bit like Papers Please, but where you file/drop files/documents/mail into specific drop boxes, as they pile up at an alarming rate.\n* 5. You and a crew of road workers are trying to fix or build a road, but tragically (and hilariously) people are ruining the road by driving their cars on it that explode, littering, slowing down your work, and basically being a nuisance. Try to not get anyone killed, it's a bit like a reversed version of Frogger. Perhaps the more road you finish, the easier it gets.\n* 6. Go to a museum and draw mustaches on all the famous artworks on display, avoid security cameras and guards, as well as try to put up your own paintings.\n* 7. Bring people back to life in order to solve a mystery. Perhaps you can only bring back one or two people. Choose wisely.\n* 8. Repair damaged robots and create robots to help Skynet become reality.\n* 9. An Unreal Engine esque game from the perspective of a police helicopter, where you play as a person driving away from police cars in a neighborhood, simple, but eventually things get hectic, the military is called in, streets are blockaded, and you must drive through buildings and offroad to get away from them.\n* 10. A game where you make coffee and drink the whole pot, then make another pot. The more pots you drink and make, the more twitchy and difficult it gets to make them. Don't break the machine or pot.\n* 11. You are a billionaire in a rather corrupt and lawless country. Go out in the crowded streets, and simply buy someone with your immense wealth. See if you made a good choice.\n* 12. A VR game where you are an astronaut in space performing operations from a space shuttle and must survive a [Gravity esque situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKW-Gd_S_xc)\n* 12.1. A VR game where you are an astronaut performing operations on things like the Hubble Space Telescope, and have the danger of dropping screws that float away, etc.\n* 13. Go outside and loosen the screws on large bridges, break train tracks, ruin roads, cut support wires on sky-scrapers, and basically cause a huge mess.\n* 14. Play as a police officer and try to purposefully make people pay up despite abiding the law and not speeding.\n* 15. Break into your neighbor's house and take their furniture/money/X-Box/personal belongings and try not to get caught. They come in your house and look around for their things later, so try to hide it and be prepared. Based on real life personal experience.\n* 16. Go on national news and express your opinion on a situation with other people, despite you knowing nothing about it. Try to choose the best option.\n* 17. A proper game/simulator where you get to simulate the Apollo lunar landings, as well as walk on the surface. Haven't found or seen one yet.\n* 18. Take a sledgehammer and break concrete on the road. Eat it, and try to convince other people to do the same thing.\n* 19. Try to convince Death not to take you away, despite being dead or seriously ill.\n* 20. A game where you herd bison/animals towards a village for food.\n* 21. Control a probe and land it on a comet in first person, like the ESA did.\n* 22. In order to get no wrinkles at all, you must control your emotions and never smile, frown, or smirk, try to keep them under control.\n* 23. A multiplayer shooter where every time you shoot your gun, you lose health.\n* 24. Time travel to stop a bomb from exploding, by watching the person who placed and activated it, as well as try to evacuate civilians.\n* 25. You are now a ghost, and can only hold certain objects for a very short amount of time, try to do your normal every day things.\n* 26. A tsunami has hit your city, try to stay afloat and on your roof as your house speedily goes down a long flooded road towards the city.\n* 27. Stop the world from ending due to a nuclear holocaust by simply offering all the leaders of the world lemonade from your lemonade stand.\n* 28. You are pulled over by a *very* aggressive and furious police officer for speeding. Try to talk him out of the ticket you cannot afford to pay.\n* 29. Play as a lifeguard on the beach or at a large crowded pool and make sure nothing bad happens.\n* 30. You are a time traveler. Go on the Internet and freak people out by predicting everything or certain events in their life.\n\nThat's all for now, I once again must apologize for the long delay for this one. I hope these are at least decent, if you have any suggestions or other ideas for them/based on them, comment away. :)\n\nOnce again, these ideas are completely free to use! If any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D

1464302527|4l7xk3|30 Random Game Ideas! #2!|You people seemed to like the [first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/), so I thought maybe I could do this weekly or something, I'm not sure. :P\n\n* 1. A game where you are a person aboard the Titanic as it heads toward the iceberg. When it eventually hits, you must fight your way through crowds of people and perhaps even sacrifice your family to get on a lifeboat.\n* 2. Break into people's houses as they're gone and make everything dirty, (I.E. using a vacuum cleaner in reverse, dumping everything out of the fridge, breaking mirrors, etc)\n* 3. You are a thief in the middle of a crowded marketplace. Go around and pick people's pockets quickly, by distracting them or bumping into them. The more pockets you pick, the higher the difficulty gets as people start realizing something is missing.\n* 4. A platformer game where instead of playing as a quick, agile character, you instead play as a barely moving, morbidly obese character who often literally breaks platforms and levels.\n* 5. You are a robber in a bank robbery with several hostages. The police have the building surrounded. Try to negotiate with them, without killing any of the hostages.\n* 6. Start forest fires and try to keep the fire-fighters away so the fire spreads and becomes larger.\n* 7. Pilot a drone over a crowd and steal things from people. Eventually you begin stealing greater and more valuable things, to eventually even super valuable things like briefcases of cash and ancient artifacts.\n* 8. A phone is ringing in your house. Upon picking it up, an anonymous caller tells you "It's watching you", and gives you several hints and clues as to what it is and how it reacts/what it will do. Find out what 'it' is.\n* 9. You are a secret agent who infiltrates suspicious secret societies. In order to earn their trust and join each of them, you must master their secret hand shake. The entire game is about quick and difficult button press sequences.\n* 10. Go into public bathrooms and steal toilet paper from people as they're using the bathroom.\n* 11. A mountain climbing simulator where you scale a mountain the size of Mt. Everest or half of that.\n* 12. A Godzilla esque monster is attacking a city. You are a civilian on the ground, try to survive the carnage as buildings around you collapse, people run everywhere, the military tries to shoot it, the monster leveling the city, etc...\n* 13. Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.\n* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.\n* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!\n* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.\n* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)\n* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.\n* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.\n* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.\n* 21. A game with the setting/kind of style of Counter Strike/Modern Warfare/Battlefield/CoD, but the twist is everyone has kitchen appliances and tools instead of guns and knives.\n* 22. An NSA simulator where you look through people's computer files and learn about that person's very bizarre history through them.\n* 23. Dodge random objects that are falling out of the sky.\n* 24. Survive disasters in first person, such as tsunamis, nuclear explosions, tornadoes, meteorites falling out of the sky, volcano eruptions and more, all from your house. You have 2 minutes to prepare for the event.\n* 25. A game where you can only move by shifting the gravity of the world. Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.\n* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.\n* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.\n* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost. The only way back is a long road down a deserted path. The locals urge you to not go down it, for no one ever returns alive.\n* 29. Be the referee in a football/boxing match, decide when something bad happens who is responsible.\n* 30. A game where every step you take changes the entire level/game world, permanently.\n\nThat's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange. :P\n\nThese ideas are completely free to use, if any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D
1473179402|51g2ki|Survivor's guilt.|I haven't come up with any story or specific elements of what this game would be, but the bare bones is that you're playing as a war vet with PTSD, trying to live a normal life. What makes the game a challenge is that certain noises or images will randomly trigger your PTSD and you'll suddenly be transported to a past scenario relevant to the trigger. I think if this was ever fleshed out, it could turn out to be really cool.
1420550531|2rifcd|Awesome idea for a frogger version|So I got this Idea of a frogger game where the frog has to cross the street without creating **horrible horrible accidents**. He can't be run over because the "car drivers" always evade him and most probably crash into other cars.  \nThe highest possible score is "0" as in 0 people died. But thats really really hard to archieve. You'll be glad if only 10 people lost their lifes..
1463677947|4k3ixr|30 random game ideas!|* 1. Make a very important speech in front of millions of people. You haven't prepared for this at all.

1449659060|3w272y|Sixteen game ideas|1) A game where you build nukes and have to be careful to not set them off, or drop them.

Spooky. - ALREADY BEEN DONE\n\n\n3) A game like Surgeon Simulator, however instead of causing deaths, you have to find out how the person died.

1436397143|3clzms|Breaking the Fourth Wall|I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.\n\nThe game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.\n\nSlowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.

A tetris like lemming game\nYou control the classic tetris blocks that fall from the sky and use them to create bridges and stairs for some lemming like creature that are trying to get to the end of the level.\nI imagine this to be pretty fast paced.\n\n\n4. a reversed stealth game\nYou control guards, your vision is limited to what the flashlight cones can see (the borders and walls of the level would be visbible in a dark shade of blue or something like that). You can control only one guard at time (and you have limited ammo), but you see what they see at all times.\nA thief tries to sneak past you and you have to catch him (this the most complex idea bc of the need to make a somehwat intelligent thief)\n\n5. (i have posted this idea here before but i really like it) \na fast paced jump and run game where your controls invert everytime you jump.

1443383212|3mm0c2|A spaceship game that no one will ever make.|I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies.
1399310129|24sf5m|If someone made this game, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.|This game would be a puzzle game. The character would move through a series of levels, getting Energy powerups along the way. Its every move is controlled by a malevolent outside force. Soon, it realizes this and tries to escape. \nYou, the player, are the malevolent force. The energy powerups are drugs to keep the character docile. When he tries to escape, you must block him and try to manipulate him into the drugs. At the end, you'll have the choice to either let him escape (losing the game with no restarts) or to kill him (winning the game). \nYes, it would be essentially Portal from the POV of Glados.
1423955457|2vx3ay|Spy Messenger: Giver orders and fulfill missions through a fake messaging app|**The basic idea**\n\nWhen opening the (mobile?) game, you reach a "messenger app"-like UI where each contact is actually an NPC with whom you can exchange pre-defined texts. Your goal is to fulfill missions through the intermediary of contacts: you gather information, give orders, and get things done all through messages. As the game progresses, you have more and more useful contacts and more and more complex quests.\n\n**Typical game loop**\n\nFor instance, a mission could consist of stealing someone's phone. All you know at first is the target's name, and the fact that he's already served jail time for robbery.\n\n1. You call the white pages service, and realize 15 persons have the same name.\n1. You call a friend from the police, and give him the name to get criminal records for all persons matching it.\n1. There's only two persons known by this name with criminal records, and only one has served for robbery. Great, you now have his address.\n1. Since it's 2am, the guy must be home. Message another contact and ask him to break into the target's home, and steal the phone.\n1. Moments later, he contacts you back saying he's got it. You tell him where to deliver the phone.\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting stories based on the idea, making things harder and harder to solve. Maybe at some point you'll have unreliable contacts that lie to you, and make you need to track your own contacts... Or people that get killed on the job... Or multiple missions to manage simultaneously, that end up being related to each other... Lots of intricate things to imagine :)\n\nIf made as a mobile game, I also wonder whether it could be interesting to make this game real-time, like there's an actual hour to wait until you burglar reaches the target's house. It could add to the immersion, but it would suddenly be heavily notification-based, not sure I'd like to play that.\n\n**Technical aspects**\n\nI'd say the basic gameplay would be quite affordable for beginners: there's a lot of modeling to do for data, NPCs, possible situations and how everything is linked together, but it does seem quite easy and fun to code. And iterative, too, as you can start small and add features as you go. Also, no graphics! The main challenge is rather to make the pre-defined messages thing work well.
1437927452|3eo531|The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it.|Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.\n\nThe hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. \n\nThe GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.\n\nFinally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.\n\nPlaying with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.

1472937254|510u3q|The One Trope That Spider-man/Superhero Games Never Use - Until Now|Imagine a game where you balance maintaining a secret identity (because people make life worth living) and protecting a city/population (because that's where your people live.) \n\nIt's a superhero sandbox action platformer with two point-based scales, *City Safety* and *Secret Identity*, that govern which random city events appear, what character progressions are available, and how the world reacts to the character. \n\nThe player always can switch between two skins, civies and tights, which allow the player to enter events as time progresses through three periods: morning, afternoon and night. \n\nWhen the player selects "Change," they trigger a 10-second action that reduces movement speed to 10% and stops a few actions. After spawning, you can walk outside of your bedroom window, hit the Change, and after a 10-second delay, you are wearing your superhero costume. \n\nAlong with experience points, damage statuses, and unlocking new abilities, the main character also has a few Sims-like needs (Love, Comfort, Sanity, Hope) that get refueled or supercharged by attending civilian events. For instance, you need normal sanity and high comfort in order to discover new superhero moves. Have above-average romance scores? Then you'll have a damage boost. \n\n-The details of the meta-concept-\nThe game system measures two 1,000-point scales: your **secret identity** and **city safety.** \n\nCity:                 Scary                      Safe\n           -500                ... -1,  0 ...               +500\nIdentity:           Public                      Secret\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **Secret Identity**, the game behaves as if your identity is secret. \n&gt;  You gain the full benefit of attending civilian events (gain Identity points, boosts to health, sanity, etc.)\n&gt;  Putting on your Civies turns you invisible to enemies (except enemies who have a Knows! tag or status.)  \n&gt;  Interacting with Normals or Beloveds allow you to invest relationship points with them. \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if your identity is public. \n&gt;  You gain noticeably lower benefits of attending civilian events. \n&gt;  Enemies see past your Civies -- and there's now a 50% chance of random enemies during civilian events.\n&gt;  Beloveds can self-downgrade to Normal, and Normals may choose to ignore the player.\n\nFrom +500 to 0 on **City Safety**, the game behaves as if the city is safe.\n&gt;  You gain City points from patrolling in your costume. Upon death/KO, you respawn in clinics or low-security cells at the local precinct.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of small-scale skirmishes (muggings, etc.)\n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events only 10% of the time.  \n\nFrom -1 to -500, the game behaves as if the city is scary. \n&gt;  Upon death/KO, you resapawn in high-security cells - and lose 500 identity points. No points for patrol.\n&gt;  Random enemy events are drawn from a database of large-scale problems (bombings, block fires, etc.) \n&gt;  Normals and Beloveds spawn as rescue targets in random city events 60% of the time.\n\n\nAs the hero, you patrol the city and resolves random enemy events -- which give strength points and city points, for raising City Danger score. Swoop in, beat up the bad guys, help the elderly across the crosswalk, stop the villains. You know the drill. \n\nAs the person, you build your character by building your character's life. Now, pay attention. \nThe game's schedule moves through three periods: morning, afternoon, and night. Civilian events happen in predictable places during those schedules. In the morning, civilian events pop up at the school. In the afternoon, they pop up in the city. At night, they pop up at home.\n\nEach event requires your attendance (and any other gimmick you want) and yields the character bonuses when you're present for their ending. When you activate a civilian event, you control time - speeding up or slowing down the schedules. And you're only required to be present at the beginning and at the end to get the rewards. \n\nWant an example? \n&gt; It just turned night. The player is in the city, dressed in tights. The HUD shows that it's night, and a pop-up announces an event, "Dinner's Ready!", and there's only 90 seconds to activate it. The player chooses to stay in costume (to protect their identity) and superhumanly flies to their home, a house in the suburbs. On approach, the house is lit in green, and a perimeter around the civilian event marks the boundary the player must cross in civilian clothes. The player lands after 30 seconds of flight, goes into some cover, activates the Change Clothes, waits 10 seconds more, and walks across the perimeter. Onscreen text, a mini-cut-scene, whatever flavor signals the beginning of the event -- and the HUD guides the player to an object to activate (in this case a seat at the dinner table). After activating the seat, the player fast-forwards through time... and the player sees the relevant character stats that will increase: health, sanity, comfort, secret identity scores. Also, pop-ups on the HUD show Night events happening. However, city danger is already high and the character's stats are middling. The player chooses to stay at the event. In-game flavor text, character interaction, etc. simulate the dinner at home. At the end of the 20-40 second fast forwarded event, the player has seen 4-5 city events pop up. However, the civilian event ends - and the rewards are registered to the character's sheet. The player's now standing inside their home, and their HUD registers 3 other civilian events in the area - upstairs, next door, etc. The player pauses the game to check City Safety and Secret Identity stats. City Safety has gone up pretty high (200 points) as a result of ignoring them. However, the player's comfort and love bars are just shy of unlocking more moves or triggering a story event. What do you do? \n&gt; The player chooses to activate the next-door event: "Date Night." The player moves toward that perimeter and, already in civies, triggers it. Flavor text and in-game cinematics show the girlfriend wants to watch a movie together. Activate the couch. Stats of Love, Comfort, Health and Sanity show up as potential rewards if the player finishes this event in the perimeter. The player fast-forwards the event until another city event appears on the pop-up HUD. That'll be worth some 80 points if it gets resolved. The player stops fast-forwarding, deactivates the couch, walks in his civies into cover near the house where no one will see him change, changes, and leaves the house. The Date Night timer continues, at a normal pace, and signals that the player isn't present to collect the rewards. The player hustles through the city event, a grocery robbery - except his mom (who was present for the Dinner's Ready! event) is also a hostage. In superhero garb, the player gets his mom to a police safety point, goes back into the grocery and disarms/disables the robbers. There's about 20 seconds left in Date Night! and the player really wants the story event and rewards. He zips as fast as he can back to the Date Night! perimeter (15 seconds left), and hits the Change Clothes - moving across the barrier at 25% normal pace and unable to jump. He's in the barrier and moving toward the couch, still changing. Because he's in the same room with girlfriend character while Changing Costumes, the Secret Identity score goes down 5 points and the girlfriend gets the tag "Suspicious." It'll take another complete civilian event with her to remove the tag. Don't need to worry about that now. With 5 seconds left, the player activates the couch, concludes Date Night!, and gets the rewards. The player's now standing in the girlfriend's house. City Danger is now 120 points short of where it was before Dinner's Ready!; the player can activate a training event to unlock new moves; the girlfriend's "Suspicious" tag could be a big deal; and already another two civilian events are on the HUD and there's only time for one more before school tomorrow morning. Which do you do now? \n\nDo you get it? \n\nThis game has one sandbox -- but essentially two worlds happening at the same time. Players choose which side they need to tend to. \n\nThey make their choices based on any of a dozen factors: \n* The City Danger and Secret Identity scores\n* Which character building goals do they want to hit (unlocking moves, costumes, etc.)? \n* Story or training events they can unlock\n* Shuffling their lives around to accommodate a superhero's life -- meaning, creating a girlfriend out of a fellow superhero to have dates that also add to city scores. \n* Progressing through story events to further their life: high school graduation, college, jobs, normal careers\n\n**Sounds nice, but what happens at the fringes of the rules?** \nAccidentally change costume in Times Square? You can steadily recover your secret identity with civilian events, and Special events (faking the hero death, getting a costume double), only triggered when the Secret Identity score is really low, can yield major Secret Identity bonuses. \n\nDoes Mom die in a supervillain event? You can always befriend new Beloveds out of the Normals population. Until you do, you'll notice fewer civilian events are around to boost your character. \n\nDo you lose all your HP during a supervillain fight? You'll respawn in their lair (a pre-drawn escape level), the villain will have the Knows! tag, and you'll now need to worry about that supervillain showing up during a civilian event -- until you convince them with a special event or until game events kill them.  \n\nI can see the game clearly in my mind as if I've been playing it for years. It's like I came from an alternate universe where this game already exists, and I'm just remembering it. \n\nSo ask me any questions.  
1414594926|2kohuo|It's called: You Are The Sword|For some years I simply have not had the time to keep programming and trying to properly realise my game ideas. So here: I'm throwing one of them out into the aether to see what y'all think of it. Please upvote and share if you like it and I can give you more info.\n\nOur protagonist starts at the bottom of a tower with many separate floors. The aim is to get to the top of the tower. The tower is populated by many adventurers seeking to do the same thing. So far, so cliche and uninteresting.\n\nHere's the twist (and working title): **You Are The Sword**.\n\nWhen the character holding you dies, you drop to the floor, and, evetnually, you're picked up by another character who you then gain control over. In some sense the game can never end until you win - which allows us to amp up the difficulty significantly of course.\n\nInspirations: Dwarf Fortress and Sword Art Online, primarily.\n\nOK there's a lot more to this idea that would require a lot (a **lot**) of programming. But that's the very basic idea. I can go on about it more in the comments if you are interested. Imagine all the cool things about dwarf fortress (persistence, random gen, etc.) but in a dungeon crawler. It's pretty cool. Throw in all your classic RPG elements, only with this curveball that your character can completely change at any time.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more.\n\nEdit: someone wanted more information up front rather than in discussion below, so I'll do what I can.\n(NB. there's a lot more here than the basic idea, and I'm well aware of what a colossal amount of work this would be to code!)\n\nBASIC GAME PITCH\n\n* you are a parasitic sword who takes control of your wielder\n* your aim is to get to the top of the tower - you start at the ground floor\n* there are a fixed number of randomly generated adventurers in the tower, and when one dies, a new one enters\n* adventurers wander through the tower fighting monsters on different floors, and perhaps each other\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\n\n* adventurers are procedurally generated at the start of the game, along with the maps of each of the tower's floors, monsters and bosses (a la Dwarf Fortress)\n* adventurers have classic rpg stats alongside temperament stats (which grades them on scales of aggressiveness/passivity, bravery/cowardice, honour/treachery etc.) . This dictates their interactions with other adventurers and their actions more generally\n* monsters get tougher as you go up the tower\n\nSWORDS\n\n* every adventurer climbing the tower needs a sword. You start out getting picked up by some level one scrub at the bottom floor of the tower\n* some swords are special - let's call them soul swords. You're one of them. Soul swords take over the mind of the wielder and are soulbound (cannot be unequipped till death) You're not necessarily the only one...\n* swords level up as their wielders level up\n\nADVENTURERS\n\n* adventurers level up as they fight monsters and grow stronger\n* there are a fixed number of adventurers, so it's technically possible to record all interactions between advs, all injuries sustained, and all rivalries/friendships etc. If you've played dwarf fortress you know the kind of thing I'm talking about: Brian's left toe is broken sort of thing\n* some advs play dirty - if they are 'evil' enough, they might kill other advs for their gear, or because they don't like them. If you're unlucky, your character won't just get killed by their sworn enemy, but you will *become* their sworn enemy. Still, it's probably better than being left on the ground.\n\nTHE TOWER\n\n* for now let's say the tower has 20 floors. Adventurers likewise can level from 1 to 20. They can only access the floor they have hit the level of. Similarly for equipping weapons and armour.\n\nPARTIES\n\n* in order to to tackle bigger monsters, at some point advs have to go out in parties. As a low-level character, you can expect to be resigned to signing up for an available outing with a party looking for another member.\n\n* as your repute grows (of the character, not the sword) you might be able to lead your own parties, by finding other weaker (or less famous) advs to follow you\n\nDEATH\n\n* when an adv dies, their gear falls to the ground. If that includes you, you won't be spared. You lie there in the dirt until a friend claims it, or a adv considers you an upgrade, or, if you're really unlucky, some low level scrub picks you up looking for a cheap buck by selling you on. The higher level you are, the more chance you will find your way to the hands of someone as mighty as your last wielder. Otherwise, you have to work your way back up again.\n\nSTORY (because why the hell not?)\n\n*Nemesis stands at the top of the Tower of Fate, looking down at your battered corpse. She knows that only seconds from now, your body will judder back to life whether you wish it or not. So she does what she did to all the others: as your spirit returns to flow like water into your recently departed body, she catches it in a vial of sand and corks it. It is all you can do to juggle yourself out of her grasp. The vial smashes on the floor and you reach once more for your body. But it is too far away, and the sand weighs you down. Enough sand lands on the sword for your spirit to find a place in the metal to hide. But it has been to long now. Your body is dead.*\n\n*Nemesis kicks your body, your sword and your spirit over the side of the tower with a curse. Now she is the last of the gods, free to feed off all those who dare to reach the top of her tower. Only you can stop her now, but you have fallen to the very bottom of the world, your body smashed to pieces. You are not you anymore.*\n\n*You Are The Sword.*
1430925576|352f8f|A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam|The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., "What did you have for breakfast today?" or "Where do you live?". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable "hallucinations" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness.
1387667572|1tfajy|You will probably not read this, but I need to get this concept out of my head.|A game that I call 'Psychosis', I don't know if this has been done, in that case tell me.\n\nIt's a horror game, where you start in a abandoned hospital with a head injury/amnesia, the\nhospital starts out normal and clean, but once a nurse comes in there's no eyes just holes,\nthis causes the game to go in slow motion and your heartbeat goes louder.\nAfter she leaves you try to escape the hospital. Other people, patients and nurses \nstart out as ghosts/human like creatures and the closer you get to the exit the more scarier they become\n(as well as making the hospital more scarier, moving walls, more worn out, darker, until it's pretty much abandon)\nmaking the player to start attacking them the using various weapons found in the hospital.\nThis causes police and guards to come and try to arrest you, however, to the player they appear\nlike monsters. You escape and go through a almost like typical horror game except you attack\nothers, the longer you wait the scarier/more gross they become. "The Cops" hunts you\nand you'll have to escape to your farm (this is the only objective and the only thing your character remembers).\nAs you progresses through the game, it becomes darker and scarier.\nRight before you reach your farm, you're arrested/kidnapped by the monsters.\nYoul'll then placed in a room with the only normal looking person in the game.\nHe explains to you that you're a hallucinating schizophrenic and had a psychosis,\nhe tells you you've killed countless peoples lives (now you'll get flashbacks from a "normal"perspective"\nshowing you killing innocent men, women, and children) and that you've been the main newstory\nall week and been hunted by the government. Revealing you have been a psychopath.\nYour character can't accept it and kills the psychologist and tries to escape in a \n["Black ops revelations"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02DUaeo9iw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=61) type of mission, getting flashbacks seeing yourself killing people\nwithout regret, your character finally breaks down and kills himself with a gun from a guard. The End.\nThe backstory is you were put in a mental hospital at a young age, one day you're attacked\nby another patient, landing you in the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry it sounds a bit weird, but it has been in my head for a couple of days\nand I can't really get the concept out of my head.\n\nThe thing is, it has to be really well executed. The regular people have to act\nlike normal people just looking scary to the player, the cops are the only ones attacking you first.\nIt's kinda inspired by Postal 2's Apocalypse Weekend.\nIt should be extremely bloody and not using as much jump-scares but more psychological horror.\nFocusing on the feeling of being alone and followed. One defining moment should be\nkilling a monster up close, cutting its throat, looking into human eyes. Moments showing something's\nwrong should be popping up through the entire game.\n\n**TL;DR: You kill monsters in a apocalyptic world, in the end revealing you're a psycho running around killing\ninnocent people.**\n\nIt's still just an idea, so tips, ideas and critique are welcomed. I've also thought of this as a movie and a book, but a game seemed like the best.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1391828601|1xbt80|Dolphin Call of Duty|So the basic premise is that you are on a team of 128 dolphins in the Pacific ocean. There is another team of dolphins. One team are ninjas and one are pirates. You are using class appropriate weapons. The last dolphin standing then becomes ninja or pirate god. This gets them special buffs the next game.\n\nAlso. Motion controls.
1474681272|54855i|Break-In|When the game starts out, your character is an ordinary man with a wife, kids and a pet in an ordinary house. The news says that there have been break-ins in the neighborhood. You must first go around the house and try to remember what you have so you'll know if something gets stolen.\n\nWhen you judge yourself done with that, you go to sleep. The next morning, there's signs of a break-in. You must figure out what's stolen and use clues to figure out how the burglar got in and what kind of items he's targeting. Some will just be targeting money, some jewelry, some food, some electronics, and some will come for anything valuable.\n\nThen, using that information, you must use your remaining items to create a trap that will catch the burglar in the act. You can also use money to go to buy things from the store across the street, or ask neighbors to lend your something, but if the neighbor's things get stolen, they will be angry at you and won't lend you stuff in the future, and they even make you compensate them for it.\n\nSome burglars you may have to be robbed by multiple times before you can find a pattern in their burglaries. When you catch one, the police reward you with more money that you can use to make traps for future burglars. You get a new burglar each time you catch one.\n\nOnce you get far into the game, you may even encounter burglars that are looking to murder your family members, rather than stealing things. There's no telling what order those will go in, but they always go for you last, so you have a limited number of nights (One night for each family member and pet) to catch them before you lose the game. Lets say we make the player have a wife, a son, two daughters, and a dog. The murderer may kill the dog first, they may kill the son first, or they may kill the wife or one of the daughters first. After he gets through them all, though, at one per night, he kills you and you lose the game. Each family member you lose is dead for the rest of the game, but perhaps we could have an adoption center in the game to get more kids (adopting a kid just to use him/her as a meat shield isn't very ethical, but oh well), a shelter to adopt more pets from, and a mail-order bride service. These would all cost money, and have a chance of not working that increases if you let too many die. (I did a background check, and you've had 3 kids in a row get killed the day after you adopted them. We can't give you another. Sorry, sir.)
1454265221|43k7w0|On rail mm shooter|To preface, this is a half baked idea that I'm posting from my phone because I'm worried I'll forget about it.\n\nThe idea: a simplistic 5v5 (csgo stylish) fps, with the twist of before every round there is a one minute period to draw the rail your character will follow.\n\nWhen a character finishes their rail, they will be able to draw on more, but while they do they will be vulnerable to being attacked, so the rail creation would have to be well thought out\n\nSorry I can't write more I'm at an event but I feel while this is a simplistic idea with flaws, it could possibly be of interest to someone :)\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n
1437118107|3dlnyi|You're a ghost who must setup freak accidents in a contract with Death!|This game is set on a modern, populated island with a few hundred residents and a northeastern always-cloudy-and-gloomy atmosphere. They all have generic routines around the house; making breakfast, watching TV, mowing the lawn, going to bed, etc..., and most of them have jobs they travel to on the island.\nYou're an invisible ghost. You were once a resident of the island but you were murdered by an unknown killer. Death has spared you eternity in the abyss, for now, under the condition that you help him cross a number of names off his list. As an added bonus, he'll eventually let you get revenge on the person who killed you before the story took off.\nSo, the gameplay.\nYou cannot simply ghost-punch people in the face and kill them, but instead, you have to CAUSE their deaths through moving objects in game and setting up traps and freak accidents like an ill placed toy at the top of the stairs that no one was paying attention to because it wasn't there just a second ago. \nYou have to observe a little and figure out your victims routines for everything to go smoothly. The more bold your actions are, the more likely it is that someone will notice strange things happening in their home. If Ms. Jones notices the toaster sitting by the bathtub then she will carry herself in much more suspect manner and make things more difficult for you, and if she turns a corner and sees a kitchen knife floating in mid-air, ...she may very well call the exorcist. If the exorcist arrives in the home you are at, surviving his encounter will give you a fresh start on the mission, but if he successfully exercises the home then you will be banished from it until you are strong enough to reenter (and you become stronger with each death you cause). As you progress and do become stronger, you slowly work your way to the title of a demon. At this level of strength you may actually give someone a little nudge while they're on a ladder or something similar, but  once again, the more bold your actions are - the more risk you take. At this stage you may attract the attention of guardian angels, and without taking any sides or getting too religious, if a guardian is alerted to your presence then your only hope is to very stealthily avoid it and cause an accidental death (for gameplay/balance reasons). \nIt's obviously a dark narrative and if it were fleshed out properly would be restricted in a few countries, but I think it scores points for originality, concept, and boldness. There are plenty of other details I've thought of for the game but I'd like to hear what someone else says about the basic premise, the mechanics of it, and what they'd add or remove. Very open to criticism! 
1471768864|4ytxiq|You can freeze time and can act while it's frozen. You need to defuse catastrophic situations. You'll see the (successful or failed) outcome when you resume time.|With all the interesting mechanics we've seen (e.g. rewinding time in "Life is strange"), this is certainly not just doable, but the time is also right for this.\n\nI'm just watching "Heroes" on Netflix (which isn't bad, currently at S1:E7) which inspires this idea. A car is exploding. People are around. Parts will probably fly around. The explosion will probably consume a person or two. Time is frozen. What to do? Which object needs to be moved, changed, used? etc.\n\nThe player could be confronted with all kinds of such situations, can alter them, and when they resume time, the consequences are calculated (e.g. via physics engine, but also people's reactions to things suddenly being (re)moved etc.). A "simple" version of this game could come down to a score evaluation of the outcome, but the more sophisticated version that I hope we'll be able to pull off in the coming years is one where the whole game's event development is tied to these situations and their outcomes, possibly even without predefined freeze points but arbitrary (albeit recharging) freezing power, so ideally it would just be a simulation happening over time, and you can "adjust" it at will, except you'll have to put up with the many side-effects, the emergent situations etc.

1462974610|4iuzhi|A loot driven, tower defense on a mobile fortress|If there are 2 things people love its loot and tower defenses. So here is my idea to combine them. \n\nYou control a big, mobile fortress. On that fortress you can build certain towers in a traditional TD way. You roam a big open map pulling aggro of the monsters that roam there. They will run up your ramps, onto your fortress and try to get to the core. Your towers will kill them, and any loot that they drop on your fortress is yours.\n\nLoot could be various resources for building and upgrading your towers, special towers, or equipable upgrades to give your towers unique abilities. \n\nAs you roam and get stronger you will be able to go into more difficult areas, fight stronger monsters and get better loot. 
1461205631|4fqxmo|A game where you are a martian and you run a "human zoo"|This is a fun little role reversal I thought of. You run a martian zoo. The zoo is full of humans. You have to abduct humans from Earth, or breed new ones. Research better anal probes to learn more about the humans to keep them happier in their enclosure. \n\nIn regular zoo games you have different animals so its easy to diversify. How would I create diversity here? I'm thinking of doing it by profession. So for a lawyer, its enclosure would be a desk. For a sports star you might need a bigger enclosure with a field, and it would do tricks for the crowd. 
1446249293|3qwouw|Idea for a Shooter using a dismemberment system [X-POST from /r/Gaming]|Someone told me to post this here after having posted it in [This Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3qug9q/tis_but_a_scratch/cwixm9v?context=3)\n\nI've always imagined a sort of zombie war game with this kind of dismemberment mechanic. The story was basically going to be that countries began turning their dead soldiers into zombies to fight wars because they feel no pain, and players would play as these zombie soldiers on one side and humans on the other in basic game types like CTF or Deathmatch, Survival (both against waves of zombies *or* humans), etc. You'd have stuff like zombies legs being blown off by mines only to have them keep crawling along the ground with a gun in one hand, or if they only had one arm left they'd crawl up to the enemy and try and grab them to sort of "stun" them, while dealing biting damage. Or, crawl up behind a human player, the zombie pulls the pin on their own grenade, SURPRISE!\n\nGot both arms blown off? Run at the humans in a suicide mauling attempt. Got one leg? You'll still be crawling pretty fast and can shoot just fine. Want a longer melee range? At the sacrifice of one of your arms and the ability to shoot anything but one-handed firearms you can rip it off and use it like a spear with the knife in that hand.\n\nI pictured it as being a sort of goofy game where the story wouldn't really matter all that much. The zombies would be "intelligent", but they'd still be utter dopes, while the humans would probably be anything from satirical portrayals of the "ACTION HERO AMERICA" archetype to the gritty survivor archetype and other ridiculous stuff. Mainly multiplayer, it'd be something along the lines of TF2 (Though, not sure what would be a good replacement for mountains of hats). Someone also mentioned this could make an interesting RTS. I'd have to think more about how that'd work but I've always been somewhat of a fan.
1443800974|3n8llh|The gun that doesn't want to kill|To preface, this is a game I want to make, but with little, meaning zero, experience in game development and no idea where to start, I understand it's likely to never become a reality, and as depressing as that sounds I'd much rather write then develop, though one day I do hope to write for games, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe initial idea was a gun that didn't want to kill, and it bloomed from there.\n\nThe game starts on a sort of old power point esque type of scene, you know, the kind of the thing you see at the fallout 3 start screen? These "panels" tell the story of a group of scientists who were, years ago, intent on developing a weapon that had true artificial intelligence, to give useful intel and combat support in the middle of a fire fight. They succeeded in both creating the AI, and installing it into a simple gun, naming it P.A.G. (Personal Assistant Gun). However, Pags personality proved to be difficult. \n\nHe didn't want to kill. This weapon intended to murder and take lives on a battlefield was making a choice, or trying to at least. Despite being installed into a gun, and having access to several powerful sensors and other neat features, he has no control over his actual functionality as a gun, so he could not stop himself from firing when his trigger was pulled.\n\nThis made him very angry, and he would constantly, and very vocally protest to all his tests, even screaming at his creators to stop forcing him to be a weapon. It was decided that even though they could mute Pag, there was no use in a weapon that didn't want to kill, and would most likely be more detrimental then a help to anyone on an actual battlefield. \n\nFast forward some odd years, and our silent protagonist steps in, being assigned to guard duty at a well known research base. During his first night they are, of course, attacked. The enemy catches the base off guard, storming in, killing many scientists and soldiers alike. Our protagonist wakes up after being knocked out cold from a near by explosions, looking up to see soldiers passing over him, and many other corpses, putting a bullet in any head that moved. The protagonist, with a whole lot of luck is able to stay still, and avoid being killed then and there. \n\nHe makes his way through the now mostly destroyed facility, and finds himself inside an old research wing. Here he finds himself a gun, but it is an odd one, with strange lights, and it's plugged into a wall. He's never seen anything like it, but he picks it up and plans his escape. \n\nWhile moving down a corridor he's spotted by enemy combatants, and is forced to shoot and kill them both (there are 2), but upon firing at the first, the gun springs to life, and cries out, confused and jolted. At first it sounds terrified, afraid, and then asks if the it's wielder just killed some body, then goes through an almost traumatic seeming moment of "oh no", as if it's in some sort of disbelief. \n\nAs the game progresses many more enemies confront our silent killer, the player being forced to either kill them, or die. All the while the gun is screaming, yelling, and even at times begging you to stop, to put him down so he doesn't have to kill again.\n\nDuring the down times, to quiet points, he talks to you, he tells you what it's like to be an intelligent being shoved into something he hates so much, how he wishes only to help, not take lives, and one day he even dreams of becoming a flare gun, so that he can save people rather then kill them. Though, over time the gun realizes you won't stop killing, that you'll do anything to survive, and begins to criticize you more harshly, saying things like "You know those people had families, mother, fathers, spouses waiting for them. They'll never see them alive again because of you."\n\nAt the start Pag is confused, and tries to convince you to stop killing, that you can just sneak by, or even run, but as the game progresses he comes to hate you, to understand that you don't care what he thinks, that you'll use his body however you see fit, and his hopeful determination to stop you becomes a simpering, dark hatred towards the protagonist. \n\nTruth is this is a little dumbed down, and I don't really know how the ending would go. Though, I think it would be fun to find out.

1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1422047947|2tg1o0|A game where you have to make someone late for work|The game consists of you, a god-like character, controlling the world similar to the Sims.  You watch over a person going through their typical morning routine before they leave for work.  It is randomized every time, so while you have no idea exactly what they'll do at every time, it will be a traditional shower/eat/dress type of thing.  You have no control over what the character does, but you will be changing everything around them.\n\nYou will have a limited number of "action points" that will let you change the world around this character, and will let you do absolutely anything.  You can change the timer on the toaster oven so it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.  You can make the phone ring when he/she is in the shower.  You can interact with every single object and move it, break it, or alter it in a realistic way.  You can only affect objects individually, so you can not do things like use a lighter to light a newspaper on fire, or anything like that.\n\nThere are two catches that will make you "fail" your mission.  \n\nThe first one is, you can't kill the character, either intentionally or accidentally.  If you make him slip on the floor and he hits his head too hard, causing him to die, you lose.  The character MUST be in working condition, so even hospitalizing them will cause you to fail.\n\nThe second catch is that the character cannot detect that his world is being interfered with by a higher power.  If you take his car keys and make them float in midair, he/she will freak out and won't go to work.  \n\nThe character's routine will change based on every action you do, and it's totally possible for them do skip breakfast or leave without ironing their pants, so it's not as simple as, do a thing and it makes them late.  It's important to use action points on things that will affect the most important tasks and tasks that are done near the end of the routine.  Different actions also cost different points, so while hiding the car keys under the bed may completely throw your character off, it will also cost an enormous amount of points, and may not be the best way to achieve the goal.\n\nThe appeal would be the replay value.  Every game will feature a new character with a new job, a new routine, and every house will have hundreds of objects to inspect and mess with.  Most of the time spent developing the game would go towards creating objects, so you could play for 50 hours and still be coming up with new ways to cause controlled chaos.  After all, it is a sandbox strategy game.

1432619362|37aolu|You kill monsters|Ive had this idea for a while and Recently got motivated to actually develop it. (i made a post here a while ago and got some pretty great advice) I'm an illustrator and was actually hoping I could get some critique on this project. I barely have anything developed (im serious its literally just a concept right now, all I have is a rather quickly done illustration and some ideas) but I feel that There is enough here for a little advice. :)\n\n\nAnyway, the idea came to me from seeing a picture online. I'm really bummed out that I don't have the picture with be but it depicted this giant monster looming over this little girls bed. On the bed there was a small teddy bear with a sword and shield ready to fight the monster off. I loved this idea. A child's toy fighting off the monsters that live under the child's bed and in the closet. I took the idea and did countless sketches but never reaching anything cohesive  I could turn it into. but after a lot of red bull and procrastination in league of legends i finally came to the conclusion it could be a game. \n\n\nThe basics of the game would be you and a team of 3 others would play as a toy or stuffed animal, like a sock monkey, a bunny, a wind up robot, things like that. Each character having varying abilities such as placing down mouse traps setting up walls. maybe one can have fast melee attacks or someone can have a small nerf gun rigged to shoot teeth. But all 4 of you fight off waves of monsters that try to make it to the child your protecting in bed. Shes sleeping and you need to keep her nightmares at bay! Now the monsters could be anything, Bats, spiders, the scary ass pictures in "Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark" but there would always be something looming through out the room that you cant attack. Like the spider. There would be sort of a silhouette of this spindly thing on the far end of the room pumping out what seems to be an endless swarm of creepy crawlies. The closer the enemies, the more the environment changes to a darker tone. like dirt on the walls and ceiling and floor. maybe cobwebs surrounding most of the room.\n\n\n\nanyway thats my idea. (at least the bulk of it) Critique would be awesome and that one illustration I did is right here ------&gt; http://imgur.com/a/XmR5x (along with the rest of my artwork)
1472565867|50b9vb|An incremental game about building a universe|**Name:** Incremental Universe\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nThe general idea is that you build a universe star-by-star\n\n**Plot:**\n\nIncremental game, so no real plot\n\n**Setting:**\n\nStart in a black screen. \n\n**Characters:**\n\nNone\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nEach click generates a star. At first, you can only create short lived red stars, and each star gives resources before it dies. Speed goes fast, about a billion years per minute. As you gain resources, you can buy nebulae and the like to generate stars for you, and there are different ranks of nebulae which produce different ratio of star types. The star types could be as follows (in order of rarity): \n\n- Class M Red Dwarf: Small stars with low resource generation, and no resource bonuses. Collapse in around 500 million years. Most common star in the game. \n- Class M Red Giant: Higher resource generation, but generally similar to Red Dwarf stars. Give a small bonus to resources when it dies. Lives about 750 million years. \n- Class M Red Supergiant: Rarest of the Class M Red stars. Very low resource per second, but go supernova, giving a large bonus to resources at the end of it's life - around 300 million years. \n- Class K Orange MS: These give medium output for around 500 million years, before changing to red dwarf stars for another 500 million years\n- Class G Yellow MS: Give medium to high output. These stars are where resource output becomes a reliable factor. They live for around 7 billion years, before turning into a Class M Red Supergiant\n- Class G Yellow Supergiant: These stars give less resources, and live about 3 billion years. When they die, they give a large amount of resources, and create a new nebulae in it's place, spawning mostly Class M stars, and the occasional Class K star\n- Class F White MS: These are rock solid stars. They live about 8 billion years, before turning to Class G Yellow MS stars for about a billion years, and then to a Class M Red Supergiant for about 200 million years. \n- Class A Blue/White MS: These are short lived - around 400 million years - but give a high amount of resources, before turning into Class M Red Dwarf stars\n- Class B Blue MS: These deliver a high amount of resources, for around 4 billion years before turning into Class K stars. \n- Class B Blue Giant: This star is a stellar workhorse, lasting 20 billion years, with a medium resource generation. Turn into Class A Blue/White stars after they die. \n- Class B Blue Supergiant: These are short lived stars - around 750 million years, before detonating into a very high resource gain supernova, and spawning several hundred Class M Red Dwarves when they do\n- Class O Blue MS: This is the third rarest star, living around 40 billion years and giving a high output of resources. When it dies, it turns into a Class F MS star, and following that progression.\n- Class O Blue Giant: Second rarest star, and greatly coveted. This star gives a very high output for around 20 billion years, before collapsing into a large nebula, which produces large quantities Class G stars, occasionally Class F stars, and rarely, a Class A star\n- Class O Blue Supergiant: The rarest and most coveted star. Gives an extreme amount of resources for 1.5 billion years, before collapsing into a massive supernova, and leaving behind several nebulae which produce copious amounts of Class B stars. But they are very rare stars, maybe one in 3,000,000 stars\n\nWhen the player has reached a sufficient level of resources, they can collapse their universe, and gain dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter alters the rarity of stars, giving higher chances of spawning rarer stars from the get go, and dark energy can be used to upgrade stars to last longer, give more resources, and die to create bigger supernovae and better classes of stars. \n\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nThe most standout feature, is that this has not been done in an incremental game, and has features from different types of incremental games that haven't been put together before. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nOnline\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nCould possibly do upgrades for Kreds on Kongregate, and similar websites to make money for the dev. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJust give me a shoutout somewhere. I will provide you with my IRL name if you decide to go ahead with it.

Bullet-points below describe game-play mechanics without touching the story.\n\n* game consists of separate levels\n* each level has some objective like infiltrating some facility or just killing everyone\n* you may jump onto people's heads, the person becomes your "host" and you basically play as normal FPS game\n* when you are in headcrab mode you are small, silent, could pass under furniture or through went holes but can't do actual damage and if spotted can be killed easily \n* when you are in host mode you could use weapons, kill others etc.\n* when you decide to jump off your host he dies immediately but you need to make sure that others do not spot the body\n* if your host was killed while you were still attached you have a chance to survive and scramble away\n* time of you controlling a host could be limited to keep a balance or levels may be designed to make being on the same host all the time not efficient \n* there are things, typical for stealth games like alarm, enemies have proper vision, hearing etc.

1458182719|4ar5dg|A very disturbing (yet Sadistically funny) racing game.|In a nutshell, the basic twist is that instead of cars, the racers are riding on the backs of large almost-naked humans crawling on all fours, with a large saddle on their backs. Meanwhile, the racers themselves are anthropomorphic car-like robots.\n\nThere would be limb dismemberment when the *vehicles* are damaged, as most of the powerups would involve bladed weapons. Lopping off limbs forces them to keep on crawling at the same pace, often dragging their stumps along the ground. All the while, a blank expression on their faces, "This is why I was bred, this is why I must race" being prolly the only thing they think.\n\n*Vehicles* would persist to writhe and struggle to crawl even after all limbs have been removed. It is up to the player to manually put the *vehicle* out of it's misery to get a new one.\nDecapitation (or severe blood loss) results in death of the *vehicle* and a new one being spawned in: a normal baby that rapidly grows to the size of the other *vehicles*.\n\nEdit: I think the best name for this should be Meatball Run (or Rally), as a reference to the real-life [Cannonball Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Baker_Sea-To-Shining-Sea_Memorial_Trophy_Dash) races and the racing films insipred by it (such as Canonballrun and Gumball Rally), and also due to the fact that the vehicles are infact made of meat.
1470543436|4wjefp|I would highly recommend looking into a career in game design for anyone seriously passionate in a big idea.|**WARNING!!!** This post assumes that you are actually passionate about your idea. The vast majority of ideas are a sudden lightbulb that results in a disorganized train of text, and then are quickly forgotten. You will have to put a lot of work into presenting your idea, providing knowledge and reasoning for every decision, directing every aspect of game development, being responsible for any failures, and balancing everything that is supposed to make the game fun. If you are passionate enough about your idea, you should find all of this to be easy and fun, though it is time-consuming. Also, you need to have a good visualization of the game in your head in order to give the artists and sound designers direction. \n\nIf you don't know, a [game designer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_design) is the visionary for a game, so basically the dream of everyone who posts here. **Game design is the art of making games fun.** Believe it or not, game ideas cannot be good or bad, as they have NOTHING to do with the fun of the game, only the initial appeal. As much as you love your ideas, if someone else makes it then there is no guarantee that it will be fun. This is where game design comes in.\n\nSomething extremely important to understanding game design is the game of **Tetris, with 495 million sales, the top selling video game of all time**. Think about how it would look as a post on this subreddit if you didn't know it already existed (shortest post of all time), and compare it with your ideas. You could probably very easily recreate Tetris in a day if you so wished, 495 million dollars worth of potential. This is what makes game design so important [Here](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Tetris-so-popular) is an excellent explanation of Tetris's game design, the source of its success. You'll notice that the explanation is very short, but it isn't even a simplification or summary. \n\n**So how do I bring my idea to life?** Well, it may have been implied that the idea doesn't matter, but it does. It provides the initial appeal for the game, a way to attract customers based on their interests, because fun isn't the only reason why people buy video games. The technical aspects of game development matter too, providing an observable response from which one can derive satisfaction. \n\n**The job of the game designer, not as easy as you may think, is to determine how to accomplish a number of things.** All branches of knowledge are connected, so you can always go more complicated in order to get a more thorough understanding, increasing your worth to game companies. In the case of Game Design, it involves elements of mathematics, cognitice neuroscience, semiotics, and cultural studies. \n\n* In your game, in what ways does the player get satisfaction? \n * Your brain releases feel-good chemicals under various circumstances to encourage certain motivations.\n * The number 1 most important part of a game, something that the vast majority of game ideas leave out. \n* Continuously provide new experiences, at least until the game is over.\n * The player needs an incentive to keep playing the game, or else other sources of satisfaction will begin to take priority.\n* Balancing the sources of satisfaction to be properly paced.\n * Too much satisfaction and the player quickly builds a tolerance. \n * Too little satisfaction and the player gets frustrated or bored.\n* Deciding how it is presented through the technical aspects. \n * The right sounds and animations are necessary in order for the player to properly *feel* the impacts of certain actions. \n* How simple or complicated the code for everything is. \n * It doesn't take much to think or write out pseudocode, simplify it as much as you need. \n * Things don't have to be massively complex in order to convey what you want. Players don't scrutinize every aspect of the game.\n * A game gets done quicker, cheaper, and more to your expectations if you know the limits of the company and coding in general. \n* Extensive analysis of playtesting results throughout the entire game development process. \n * Valve talks in its developer commentaries about how their games were shaped massively around playtesting. \n * The game designer needs to get inside the head of the player to balance the game to run smoothly.\n\nI'm really tired and I've been working on this for a few hours, so I'll leave it at that.\n\n**TL;DR - Ideas for game content flow freely, but what makes the content unique and fun is what really matters.**
1469823359|4v8lqs|A 1v1 FPS, where each opponent is a different person|Here's the gist.\n\nYou play in a (3D) maze environment against an opponent who you have to find and kill.\n\nWhen you kill your opponent, you just keep running around as if nothing changed, but in reality you just disconnected from your previous opponent and the matchmaking system seamlessly found a new one who came into your game and now you have to kill him, but the game doesn't give any indication that it is a different person, to you it seems like your previous enemy respawned. While you queue for an opponent, you just keep running around in the maze.\n\nWhen you die, you see a list of everyone who you killed and who killed you.\n\nFor added fun, have procedurally generated levels, where each player starts in their own level and when you kill someone you "invade" theirs. (**EDIT**: clarified in [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4v8lqs/a_1v1_fps_where_each_opponent_is_a_different/d5xdjeh))\n\nObviously not an easy game, you need l33t haxx0r networking skillz and big central servers.\n
1436886540|3d9emw|Game system idea - death mechanic with Grim Reaper's Wheel of Fate|This isn't a whole game idea, but a mechanic that can be plugged into some games. Imagine a game with near-permadeath, where being dead is a mini game mode.\n\nUpon dying, you come face-to-face with the Grim Reaper. There is a Wheel of Fate with various fates on it. Swipe to spin.\n\nIdeas for wheel options:\n\n* Divine Intervention -- instantly come back to life. The best, rarest outcome.\n* Purgatory -- this character can respawn again in X hours/days\n* Lake of Fire -- this character is forever, permanently dead.\n* Battle of Wits -- play a chess match against Death. Not a whole chess game, maybe a late-game chess puzzle.\n* Battle of Steel -- combat against the Grim Reaper. If you win, you are resurrected.\n* Sell your soul -- someone has paid a pittance for your soul. Now watch this ad to be resurrected. Can you imagine a player being happy/relieved to watch an ad? I find it amusing to break the 4th wall like this and have an ad company directly buy the player's respawn, instead of allowing the player to buy respawns.\n
1471916020|4z40io|A game where you get a day of prep before you are suddenly hunted down by everyone.|**Name:** Manhunt\n\n**Concept Overview:** \n\nIt starts out looking like you're in a nice, friendly city. Can you survive when it suddenly turns against you?\n\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou're a normal guy with a job, wife, kids, and friends. However, after 24 hours of playtime, the government suddenly puts a bounty on you, and now everybody is hunting you down with the intent of cashing in on the bounty. Your goal is to survive the manhunt for as long as possible.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nA fictional location with a strategic balance of urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, forests, rivers and lakes. Perhaps a swamp or something too.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe Player - like I said, starts out as an average joe. Has a job where he makes a moderate paycheck, loves his wife and kids. Just an average Joe that everyone decides to turn on for whatever reason.\n\nThe Player's Wife and Kids - unlike other characters, they won't be looking to kill the players when it starts, unless the player seriously offends them during prep time. They may even help defend the player if he plays his cards right.\n\nOther NPCs - Shopkeepers, people on the street, local politicians, etc. Most of them will try to kill you when the time comes, unless you were particularly nice to them.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nInteraction with people - During prep time, you can talk to people. The way you treat them determines how hesitant they'll be to kill you once the Manhunt starts. The meaner you are, the more bloodlusted they'll be, and the nicer you are, the more likely they are to spare you or even help you. Each character also starts out with a base amount of "friendliness", so some people will be easier to win over than others. They'll all start out being willing to kill you though, because money is money, except for your family.\n\nYou'll also be able to collect items during your prep time. You can buy weapons, food, vehicles, and other supplies. Or, I guess, you can steal them, but people won't like that.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n- The sudden, disorienting shift between the friendly city you got used to and the manhunt\n\n- The character's choices at the beginning of the game can have a profound impact on the rest.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nXbox, PS4, etc.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n- an end-goal, like getting the government to end the bounty.\n\n- character creation\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nMy reddit username in the credits.
1458050667|4aik24|a racing game where you're a poltergeist and you have to rig the results by possessing the racers|There are several (ex. 4) racers racing. You're a poltergeist whose relative has a penchant for gambling. Since he's always down on his luck due to his losing bets, you decide to help him. By possessing the drivers to rig the results.\n\nYou can possess the drivers for a limited time. You can do things like steer them wrong way, make them crash into drivers, etc. You could also help them by using boosters, making them fly (using poltergeist powers), shooting other drivers, etc. Anything to rig the results.\n\nThe only problem is that the higher up their rank is, the harder they are to possess, as well as the shorter the possession time. Whoever is currently in 1st place, you simply can't possess them (or maybe really limited time, like 1/2 second). Last place, instant possession if you try, and lasts pretty much a long time. BTW, all the drivers have different levels of AI, to make things more interesting. \n\nThe goal is to have to reach the EXACT rigged results required.
1461657468|4ghu4s|When you play the game again and use what you know from your first playthrough, you significantly impact the plot.|So here's my example to demonstrate how this would work.\n\nLet's say, early on in this hypothetical game, there's a safe. You and a friend have to get inside cause there's a clue or valuable item or some other macguffin. The first time you play through, you have to search the room and the belongings of the owner of the safe for the code. \n\nBut when you play a second time, you skip that whole process and just open the safe, probably unaware of the impact it will have. But your friend sees you just walk over to the safe and open and they're like "WTF, how did you know the code?" and your character in universe is just like "IDK, I just knew..." \n\nContinuing to do these sorts of actions changes the plot, while keeping the same overall goal, because somehow you now have some sort of ESP.\n\nNow, the player character doesn't instantly know EVERYTHING. They only realize things as they become important. Suppose Mark (eheheh) is a serial killer, which you learned later in the game on your first playthrough. On your second playthrough, you won't get much in the way of options related to it (maybe if you're a solid dick to him, it means you subconsciously know) until the murders are REALLY brought to your attention.\n\nThat's all I really have for an idea...no plot or nothing, just a weird mechanic.

A tank with a minigun would be very easy to spot, while a scout character would be harder but take fewer hits to kill. Maybe a class that can mark people also with a special item.\n\nThink classes similar to TF2. You don't have to use similar, but it's a good example of how the balancing could work.

1467160574|4qcrqz|A computer virus tycoon game?|So, I was searching the internet recently, and I noticed a game like this does not exist yet, and so I wanted to share my idea here. So, without further ado, let's get into where I sort of took inspiration from:\n\nI'm thinking gameplay similar to the likes of Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life. However, instead of crafting your own video games and youtube videos, the player is making computer viruses to unleash upon the internet.\n\nI think the endgame would probably be something along the lines of Plague Inc / Pandemic 2: infect the majority of the world with your computer viruses until no survivors are left.\n\nThe graphical style of the game doesn't have to be anything special: again similar to Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life - maybe a little more futuristic.\n\nOf course, the game would probably include an upgrade / research mechanic, in which the player could unlock the ability to make different types of viruses (worms, trojans, ransomware, etc.), or be able to research or unlock different components to include in their viruses; Just like Game Dev Tycoon, the player would be able to customize each computer virus to their liking.\n\nThe player may also have to deal with not being caught by the police as an added mechanic. The player may do this by implementing anti-tracking software into their viruses, or by upgrading a certain skill.\n\nThe only problem I see with this  is how to make a currency system work within the context of the game, since most viruses don't exactly generate money.\n\nAlso, I imagine there would have to be a disclaimer placed somewhere within this game , since computer viruses are a pretty touchy subject.\n\nTell me if there are any other flaws that this game might have, any ideas you might want to add on, etc. I have had this idea in my head for a long time and am happy to share it with Reddit. \n\nThank you for reading!

1413350766|2jajrv|A first person home invasion survival game.|It would only run for about 15 - 25 minutes. You wake up late at night to the sound of a door opening downstairs. You walk around in darkness, your world illuminated by the moonlight in some windows and your Iphone, if you can get downstairs and find it. You realise that somebody has broken into your house and is in hiding. The invader has shut off the electricity from the basement and locked all the doors and windows leading outside. You could phone the police but that would let the invader know where you are and he can catch you. If he catches you, its possible to fight him by picking up household objects, but he has brute strength so it would be dangerous to do so.
1467789139|4rhbbq|Four player co-op heist game. Except, none of the players are robbing anything.|Player 1: The Driver\n\nThe driver is the escape driver for a group of people robbing a bank or something, but as the game progresses, each level becomes more challenging and complex, with you having to fly airplanes, hide cars, and etc. Each level is in the same open world, but each level has a set plan as well for you to follow. For instance, one level could have a plan where you have to get rid of the cops, then ditch the car inside a tunnel to replace with another car, with which you then have to drive abiding by the laws back to your base. \n\nYou can upgrade your escape vehicle, whatever vehicle type, (Plane, boat, car) after each mission by adding different chassis, faster engines, bulletproof windows and chassis, etc. (using in-game money)\n\nPlayer 2: The Gunman\n\nThe Gunman has to protect the driver by firing outside the passenger's seat window, as well as protecting the robbers by escorting them to escape van/car.  You'd also have to find places to ditch your weapons. \n\nYou can upgrade your weapons, buy new ones, buy concealed weapons or weapon holsters for you and the robbers, as well as kevlar vests and masks. (using in-game money)\n\nPlayer 3: The Planner\n\nThe planner plans out missions, as well as scout out locations, and vehicles. You can preplan a route, steps, car and weapon ditching locations, vehicles, and more. You also recommend weapons to use by both the Gunman and the robbers. You hire and assemble a team for each heist, as well. You can also use in-game money to upgrade each team member\n\nPlayer 4: The Collector\n\nThe Collector has the job of saving and dividing money between the other three players, which means the four players would have to start out with preplanned low-risk missions, possibly convenience stores or small restaurants. \n\nPlayer 4 other idea: The Hacker: The Hacker views a map as the heist progresses. The Hacker can view where police are nearby the other players, and hack radio comms, police controls, and others, but only for a short period of time, and not over and over. \n\n\n\n-----------\nGraphics: Top down or first person, depends on player. (Driver and gunman are first person, Planner is either, Collector is top down) \nThe graphics could be low res minimalist of sorts, probably blocky. \n\nLayout: The city would have to be diverse, like Los Santos from GTA V, but with different islands each with different styles. \n\nOther: There should probably  be a minimum of two players, with them playing gunman and driver, but the others would be semi-advanced AI, at least enough to make good decisions and good plans, if missions are not already pre-planned and pre-scouted. 
1433711460|38y6ge|Time controlling heist game|The idea is that you control a team of 4 people trying to pull off a heist. The main mechanic is that you are essentially planning a heist, which means that you can go back and change anything. You play by looking at the level from a top down over view. You then choose a character and take control of them in a first person perspective (might be executed in some other ways if you want to scale the game down). At any time, you can jump back to the overview, and take control of another character. You can also go back through the timeline to redo a specific piece of the character's actions. For example, you might try to get a guy in through the main entrance. However, as soon as he gets in, he is spotted by a guard and shot. So you take another character and make him break a window to distract the guard. You then hide the second character and make the first character go through the entrance, this time without getting shot.\n\nThe idea is to make this a sort of puzzle game with multiple solutions. Perhaps there would be rewards for not redoing any paths or for accomplishing side objectives or for doing it in a very short amount of time. What do you guys think?
1448421044|3u60qi|Computer Building Simulator.|There are plenty of simulation games out there now. Some ridiculous and over the top, others pretty interesting. My idea is that there be a game that teaches you the inner workings of a computer. What different parts do, what works and what doesn't, etc.\n\nPerhaps there would be a career mode. At the beginning of each level, you're given specifics on what your customer is looking for in a computer and you're given a limited budget to achieve it. You shop around for computer parts and put together a computer with them. \n\nIt would, in my opinion, be a great learning tool/game.

1356827043|15ncs9|A Hide-and-Seek game in which you don't know if you are the hider or the seeker|A game in which each round would last a relatively short while. There are two characters, the human and the monster. Each character is played by two random strangers chosen from a server (like Omegle). Each player is put into one of the roles, but they don't know which they play. There are no differences so that even if they were to look on each other's screens, it would be impossible to tell. The game takes place in a maze, and there is a time counter on the side. The human has to survive as long as they can, and the monster has to catch the human in as short of a time as they can. As the players come closer to each other, they will hear each other's footsteps. This is the whole game. At this point, will the players run away, or rush forward? Being a monster and running away means you take away from your time, and being a human and rushing forward means you could get caught. But once the two meet, it becomes clear as one player looks like a monster and the other a human. After this point, the monster player speeds up, and the human player gets a gun. The gun only has two bullets, and only slows down the monster. Ammo crates appear around the map, which don't reappear after being taken. This means the monster eventually wins, but the point of the game is to see if your choice to run away or rush forward is correct
1409197714|2esih6|I don't think it's particularly plausible... But I had an idea for an RTS based on terraforming|Basically, there would be two factions. One side is natural (which I've been calling the Growth), and the other is industrial, which I've called the Machine. \n\nThe Machine would be industrialized and be the simpler faction. It just focuses on mass production, and in general would have stronger, more numerous units, but very few special abilities. Massed robot infantry, automated tanks and aircraft. I've been thinking of a swarm-style buildings for them. The buildings would be small and slow to produce, but you could build a lot of them very quickly. Maybe a click-and-drag function for placing down multiples at once in a grid format? \n\nTheir defenses would be a turret "wall" of sorts. Place a base, and then click-and-drag to send out a rail as far as you drag with turrets on it. The rail can go out for a long time, but destroying the base will destroy every turret on it. \n\nThe Growth will play a little more conservatively. No refined metals, but stone could be their armor. So their big units could be things like giants. Other units could be things like large birds, predatory hunters, and giant bugs. Their buildings and units, in general, are weaker and less numerous than the Machine, but they have a much wider range of special abilities and access to druidic magic. Climate warfare, healing, etc., would be available to them.\n\nTheir defenses would be more organic. Giant bug nests, pitfalls, and other natural traps. \n\nAnd my biggest idea is the terraforming. Most of the map can start out as a barren wasteland, fit for neither life or machine. Workers from both faction, instead of building or gathering, can work on converting the land for their needs. The Machine could flatten out the land and lay down metal to prevent the Growth from taking it, and the Growth can fertilize the land and plant seeds to slow down the Machine. Buildings can only be built on land that has been terraformed to your side, so you need to expand as quickly as possible to get the resources you need. In order to terraform an area that your enemy has taken, you would have to remove theirs, first. \n\nI also have an idea for terraforming to be used offensively. If you terraform an area with an enemy building on it, you could synthesize that building. All the units that building was able to create can now be built by you, with some differences. The Machine could add parts to the now enslaved Growth to make them stronger and hardier, but move and recharge their abilities slower. The Growth could overgrow into the Machine's creations and take control from there, making them faster, but more fragile. \n\nHow viable is this without a full game studio? I dunno. I don't expect it to ever get made. Just wanted to see what you guys thought of my idea. 
1417503227|2o0wub|You Will Die- A horror game concept|Opening\n---------------------\nNine thirty. You've been working your dead end job at the Stop Shop department store for two months and you're already regretting it, but your shift is up and that's what matters. Or it would be if you hadn't offered to take the night shift to cover for your lazy friend. It's New Year's and everyone in the whole damn store is going home, Christmas music slowly waning as the lights in the store shut off row by row. You grab your PDA and start stacking items on the shelves like the good little robot you are. Now you're here until four in the morning. Asshole.\nBut you're not alone.\nYou hear footsteps and look over to see a person casually strolling down the hall. You start to say something to him, maybe it was the cheerful hello all Stop Shop employees give, maybe you were going to tell him to get the hell out. What matters is that he pulls out a gun and shoots you from twenty feet away. \nWelcome to the game. \nThis man will kill you. The End.\n\nWhy come up with an idea like this?\n--------------------------------------------\nI'm halfway through my Master's Degree in Criminal Forensics and I've always had to deal with the worst of humanity. I've also been thinking about indie horror games lately; they're getting quite a surge of popularity in the last half-decade. With the advent of games as art, I've been thinking that games shouldn't have to be fun to play. They should be an experience. Possibly a painful experience, but something we can learn from. \nYes, I'm trying to distance this from Alien: Isolation. The difference is this can, and has, happened to people. It is... horrifying. It's ungodly. And I wonder if that feeling of helplessness can be captured in a video game, because I'm weird and it's 12AM and I can't sleep now.\n\nWhat is it?\n---------------------\nYWD is a horror survival first-person adventure game that is based around the main character being hunted by a serial killer. There are no weapons in the game, and nothing you can use can suitably incapacitate him. You're just trying to stay alive as long as you can. The game features permadeath, meaning you can't respawn after you are killed, but you can save items in your locker which will make them available after you restart the game.\n\nThe game would involve hiding from, avoiding confrontation with, and outsmarting the serial killer if the situation came to it. \nThe map it takes place in would be small, but easy to memorize and navigate, with backrooms and non-standard heavy equipment. The store would hypothetically be completely interactive. with the ability to pick up and interact with any item, open any box, knock anything over. There wouldn't be a traditional crafting system but any item could be combined superficially, even if it was just wrapping a rope around a carton of eggs. Each item would have different effects in the world, mostly culminating in whether it attracts or distracts the killer. \n\nThere are many preset paths to try to escape, but most of them have risky consequences. You can attempt to go for the office phone and call 911, but that location has no doors beside the way you enter. You can try to run for it, but the freezing snow will likely slow you down. You can try to hide from the killer, but he will smash everything in sight looking for you. In addition, the killer can access any items in the area to counter your actions.\nThe game would not use a health bar or regenerating health, focusing on a Metal Gear Solid 3 approach where you can look down in First Person to see your body, and view injuries, which need to be handled to resume normal operation. A gunshot to the leg, for example, will cause you to hobble while an injury to the head will make you become dazed. There are no medkits, so you have to scavenge from the store to heal yourself, with items being freely applied due to the completely interactive store design. \nFinally, you have to memorize the killer as well. How many bullets in his gun, the reach of his knife, his overwhelming strength in comparison to yours, his attentiveness to certain areas and what he'll be expecting to look for. Use his knowledge against him.\n\nEveryone dies. \nBut not everyone lives.\nHave fun.
1448344345|3u1myw|Slippery Slope: The Game! (Potentially NSFW, depending on the work, I guess. Not sure, really.)|My apologies if this isn't the right place for this. Seems like the closest match, but there might not actually be a right place for this. I also don't know if it's been suggested before, because I have no idea what to enter in the search box to check.\n\nThe concept is about as politically correct as Cards Against Humanity...\n\n---\n\nI was on Facebook, reading the comments on an article like a true masochist, and I came across a comment claiming abortion will lead to cultural destruction, because immigrants. No further details were given. And then I got this idea, because sometimes I'm very lonely.\n\nThe core premise of the game is to come up with Insane Troll Logic, as it's described on TvTropes, and from there, so many possibilities.\n\nI immediately thought of this party game I played, back when I got invited to parties. Everyone would write a sentence on a piece of paper, and then pass that paper to the person next to them, who'd have to draw that sentence. Then, that person would fold the paper so as to hide the original sentence, and then pass it to the next person, who'd have to describe the drawing in a sentence, and who would then further fold the paper so as to hide the drawing, etc. \nSo my first idea was a variant of that idea, except that instead of interpreting drawings or illustrating sentences, you'd start with a vaguely controversial premise, and each player would add one level of ridiculous cause-and-effect, with knowledge only of the previous layer. \n\n(Player 1: X. Player 2: If X, then Y. Hides 'X'. Player 3: If Y, then Z. Hides 'Y'. And so on...)\n\n\nAnd then I thought of game variants, because my brain won't leave me alone.\n\nYou could have a variant that's a bastardized version of the Wikipedia game, where two or more players are given an initial premise, a disastrous ultimate consequence, and the winner is either whoever completes it quickest or whoever does it in the fewest layers of ridiculous Slippery Slope arguments as possible.\n\nIn either version, the additional layers have to follow from each other, even if the logic involved is patently false. Purely random statements wouldn't be permitted.\n\n(Permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, children would grow up thinking shirts are invariably optional, which would lead to medical personnel not wearing tops to work, which would lead to more botched surgeries due to surgeon distraction, which would lead to a massive upswing in medical malpractice suits, which means most hospitals would be forced to close, meaning more people will die during childbirth because the nearest hospital is too far away.\nAllowing naked female breasts in PG-13 movies will cause tragic, preventable deaths of newborns.'\n\nNot permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, movies as a medium would cease to exist, which would cause supermarkets to hike up food prices by 3000%, because Batman.'\n\nSo, yeah... No good way to end this post, really... My apologies again if I'm in the wrong place, which is entirely likely, or if I've broken scads of subreddit rules, which I don't think I have, but I could easily be wrong.

You'd still have core survival elements under new headings (energy as opposed to food, oil as opposed to water), but would allow for customization to a greater degree than most survival games, and would allow for more a level playing field PVP-style.  \nFor example, robots can be upgraded, replace parts, download programs in ways humans cannot. You'd have the standard ability increases like faster move speed, increase carrying capacity, but you could have more extreme ones that wouldn't work with humans. You can have your character 'download' a program to, say, double jump or find and install an extra arm, letting characters to be much more varied then there are in survival games right now, which are mostly gear-dependent.  \nRobots also allow for a more level playing field in PVP, since most (read: pretty much every single survival PVP-game) starts off at caveman tech and escalates to current level. So you end up with five guys with bows going against one guy with a semi-automatic rifle; odds are, the one guy wins. On the other hand, robots could start off at our current level (or near enough), and upgrade to future tech, thus, you end up with five robots with Uzi's going against one guy with a plasma cannon. The plasma cannon guy still has an advantage, but the difference between the two groups is less extreme, sort of like the difference between level 1 and level 10, and level 51 and 60.  \nMy idea for a 'robot survival game', I feel, still embraces the core concepts that make survival games enjoyable while expanding on others  and attempting to fix common problems that crop in survival games. If you have any questions, go ahead and leave a comment. 
1461678318|4giv3t|A game where you are a random procedurally generated contestant in a Wipeout/Elimination game show and must make your way through the obstacles despite your strange and disproportionate body.|Take a look at this video, this shows several random 3D bipedal creatures learning to walk through many algorithms and versions: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pgaEE27nsQw\n\nHere is also a video of a dog model that walks in the same way: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs\n\nLike the title says, the idea is, you are playing against other contestants (perhaps it could be multiplayer) who, like yourself, are all random procedurally generated bipedal creatures, who vary greatly in size and shape, and you must make your way through an MXC/Wipeout esque game show obstacle course.\n\nThe point is, some parts may seem unfair to another player, for example a tall and thin player can go through a small corridor, whereas a short and fat player will get stuck in the doorway, but can go under low doorways, but the tall and thin player must make his way through a detour, etc\n\nI would imagine that such a game would be the most fun with multiplayer, and perhaps even if there could be settings for just how random and disproportionate the players could be.
1424276286|2wbnbb|An Oculus Rift game: Zombie survival.Your character is in a wheel chair.|I've been playing Killer 7 on the PS2 and I think it's sweet that one of the main characters is in a wheel chair. It reminded me of an interview with Cliff Bleszinski where he was talking about the Rift being utilized for seated simulation (flight, racing etc).\n\nI love that concept. The Rift is cool with games like Skyrim and Half Life but not being able to move around kind of breaks the illusion. Someday....someone will make an omni directional treadmill...but in the meantime...why not limit the characters mobility?\n\nI'm imagining a survival horror game with light to medium action. I don't have many ideas beyond the initial concept. I just think it would be super immersive given the technology that is currently available. \n\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\n**Disclaimer:** Beginner post. I did a limited search and didn't find anything...if I missed this idea in another thread...whoops?
1469040152|4tsnlv|Dialogue-heavy game about a fast food worker on the graveyard shift and all the weird/funny/surreal people that show up.|Here's how I have it planned:\n\n\nThe game would basically be a series of short form scenes with multiple dialogue options a la BioWare games. The first level would just be a simple scene with a man ordering a burger, you have a few basic dialogue options but the point is just to get the core gameplay concept across.\n\n\n\nAfter completing the first level, every subsequent level will be presented to the player in random order. Essentially, the player would initiate a new level and one of the following people could come for a burger:\n\n\n\n--A mugger coming to rob the place\n\n\n--Employee's parents drunk and touchy with each other\n\n\n--Aliens\n\n\n--A mad scientist looking for hazardous chemicals\n\n\n--Different historical figures\n\n\n--Employee's crush\n\n\n--Snowden type character on the lamb\n\n\n--Any assortment of dreamy/nightmarish creatures\n\n\n--Girl scouts\n\n\n--Dance mom and dance daughter\n\n\nThese are all just a bunch of quick scene ideas that I had, its not a comprehensive or final list. Some scenes may have random quicktime events or even a Final Fantasy-esque fighting system, though the fun of the game would mostly come from the dialogue. After completing each scene, the player would have the option to either start another random scene or to go back and play a previously completed scene to try out different dialogue options.\n\n\n\nThe game concept is really simple, which I like because I could actually create it with my very rudimentary coding knowledge. I'm thinking of making a proof of concept for the tutorial just for the sake of getting started with it.\n

1386651406|1six2g|"The Most Dangerous Game"|I have a simple idea: A game based on the short story "The Most Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell. \n     A short summary: a ship-wrecked man is on an island meets a hunter who has decided that animals are boring and would rather hunt another human and gives the man a knife and a three hour head start, and the hunt begins. I won't spoil the story for those who have not read it. \n   \n     Game play\nOverview: a survival game of wit with a focus of survival and hunting skills between two humans on oppose ends. A cold and calculating hunter methodically selecting his equipment, and a primal beast pushed to his limits to try and survive. A game that will leaving you questioning who is truly the prey.\n\nHunter: you select your equipment load out and focus on the hunt, specifically tracking your prey and trying to kill them. The hunter would have to wait a set amount of time to let the prey get a head start. While the hunter is waiting they will be given the equipment load out selection which will change every match to force different hunting strategies. \n\nPrey: you have the same limited equipment each time and focus on evasion and deception, with the ability to create traps to try and kill or immobilize the hunter to allow for your escape. \n\nMap: a forested island with rivers, cliffs, ravines, quicksand, etc.\n\nMy view: Gamers have wanted a survival game for a long time, but the problem has been that the pressure to survive wasn't there. With this format the prey will always have to be a step ahead, and the hunter will always be hot on the trail. The hunter must proceed with caution though because at any moment the tables could be turned.\n\nLet's get this conversation started!\n\nP.S. This is my first post, my days of lurking are finally over.\n
1445465425|3poxrm|Post WW3 survival game that turns into a nation builder|So, stay with me on this, you start out alone in a barren wasteland. If you're careful enough, you slowly get equipment, find companions, fight mutants and rival humans for resources, and do quests for people a la Fallout. Eventually, you get to a point in which you decide to spread your influence and bring stability back to this chaotic land. As you continue along your adventure, your choices will decide the fate of your newly declared nation. Will you try to create a democracy or dictatorship? What of the issue of slavery or the rights of woman in your land, among others. Do you wish to continue to move as nomads or find a place to remain as an isolated state? The balance of power among people, especially those who helped form your nation, matter. Of course, you'll be able to continue to do all the things you did before becoming a founding father/mother, but on a much grander scale, with entire armies taking part!\n\nSo, what do you all think?
1441213607|3jdo90|Two People, One Bullet. An Arena Based Shooter|Enter an arena comprised of smooth white walls and floors. The arena's floor is a 400m x 200m region of large cubes on a grid. Carved into the landscape is a flat road that connects the spawn locations, various upgrades and turret camps. On the other side of the arena your enemy has spawned. You have to navigate this labyrinth by soaring over it or running through it, collecting any upgrades and hacking turret towers until you find the enemy.\n\nYou're equipped with rocket boots for massive jumps and wall running, and your gun. Your gun is a single shot large calibre plasma rifle. When fired, the large neon bullet will continue bouncing throughout the environment until you catch it again.\n\nThe bullets also have another function. They can be grappled to. If you are within sight and range of your bullet you can right click it, stopping the bullet and slinging your character to it.\n\nedit: The title may be misleading, you both have your own bullet, but only one.
1446962824|3rz9y8|A PC multiplayer game where you evacuate massive amounts of civilians from a disaster in the city.|What I mean by this post is something like the interaction/navegation of an unstable environment in a PVP match. \n\nOne example is a gametype thought up in my head 10 minutes ago called "Evacuation". This is borrowed somewhat from counter-strike, metal gear and titanfall but expanded. It has a near-futuristic setting and basically, you are supposed to evacuate as many civilians as you can (There could be hundreds or thousands of them) in a city from an impending disaster. However a team of terrorists are slaughtering the civilians. Defenders gain points for evacuation and attackers gain points for massacres and bonus points for killing defenders.\nHere's the twist: Each player only has one life, so that puts both sides on edge and forces them to think of a strategy. \nAlso there is no radar or anything, forcing players to rely on high places to spot enemies since you have thruster packs that you can climb up buildings and wall-jump, isolating players from the action below and engaging them in dogfights with the bad guys. \n\nIf any player dies they can provide air support by providing ammo, spotting enemies and deploying evacuation vehicles so they can have something to do while they wait.\n\nAs for the chaotic elements, weather is a powerful force. A hurricane can brush through the city, forming a flood and putting people's lives at risk, forcing defenders to prioritize them. If a certain amount of civilians are not saved during these events then defenders lose. \n\nThe Hurricane itself provides for an excellent visual effect. You can see the cloud looming from a distance and slowly approaching the horizon with gradual intensity. Then floods occur and windspeeds prevent you from jetpacking correctly and all the rainfall doesn't let you see a thing. \nThe maps also have a day-time progression system, meaning the day shifts to night and vise-versa since the time is set at random. You could be in the eye of the hurricane, completely safe, watching the crescent moon in the center looking down on you. Or see the sun in the same fashion. \nTsunamis, Sandstorms and Supercells (Tornadoes) are also a thing to watch out for. As these things are completely sporadic. \nYou could have an entire match without weather or you could have the whole match with a flood. You could also see a disaster in the distance and feel uneasy because it may or may not ever approach the city.\n\nA crucial part of the dramatic element is the lighting (Sharp shadows) and the expressions of the civilians themselves and what they go through. The civilians should have deeply expressive feelings of dismay, sorrow and should move and respond to disaster in a very convincing light, much like Elizabeth from bioshock infinite. They should all look distinguished not only in looks but in how they move, their moods and their unpredictability. \n\nYou as a defender are supposed to guide them. You simply tell them to stop or move on command. But whether or not they listen to you depends on their level of panic. Some may listen, others may fight other civilians for safety (In which case you gotta stun them and carry them) and others may actually help you by spotting terrorists or giving you weapons and ammo scavenged on the city or evacuating more civilians while you focus on the terrorists (The volunteers' deaths are not penalized) a worst case scenario would be for a riot to form, which would jeopardize the mission. On the flipside, they could also turn on you and spot you, use weapons against you (Or the surrounding population in a frenzy) and attacking volunteers and taking away their weapons to give to terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists, on the other hand, must kill as many civilians as possible, but there are so many so you can't kill everyone. Instead, you gotta kill and cause as much panic as possible like using bombs, destroying buildings, killing defenders guiding civilians, killing groups of people, blocking passages with their presence to make them run the other way (Or worse, in circles) stagnate them during disasters (Players can die from these too) and killing volunteers and evac vehicles.\n\nA quick trade-off when it comes to dying is that the more players die, the more weapons are supplied on the battlefield due to dead players. There is more support, so the gameplay balances itself out. However disasters can affect dead players as well because they can block satellite vision, misplace supplies (Strong Wind) among other things. This is also balanced out by funds that air support gains depending on the actions of both teams on the ground. That way, air support has to coordinate, sort through options and choose what to deploy in order to make ends meet.\n\nThere would also be a ranking system in place, allowing more skilled players to play against each other and gradually allow for a competitive environment to form without taking away the dramatic tone that players feel. \n\nThe deaths of the civilians should be emphasized. They are the core of the gameplay, so the civilians should cry upon seeing a randomly assigned relative dead with varying lines, expressions and reactions (rage, fear, sorrow, compassion, revenge, ambiguous etc.) and each should have their own unique identity, complete with names they tell each other. You should feel the despair they go through upon seeing bodies floating on the water, burned to ashes, dismembered, shot, etc.\nAnother facet to this would be to see their emotional reactions to being rescued and evacuated. You will see some crying from joy, you would see some reluctant, you would see some rushing to the vehicle or begging to be taken while they are left behind. There would be some who feel safe and comfortable while others feel confused or angry. You would have to take them in one-by-one to add to the immersion that you are saving REAL PEOPLE. And sometimes that could be as easy as letting them walk in or you would have to carry the wounded (bonus points) or you would grab someone by the hand and pull them in (raising morale) or you would have to struggle as you force someone inside against his will. \nCarving convincing individual identities on a mass scale can be achieved by crowdsourcing people from the internet and having them express the lines and names of civilians on the game to make the civilians more fleshed out and dynamic. Having hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of volunteers providing voice acting material could help provide an attachment to the civilians. \n\nAs for the terrorists, stealth is key for two reasons: \n-1 avoid detection by defenders.\n-2 Sporadic attacks are more frightening, which raises panic.\n\nThe mood of the civilians should not be illustrated on a panic meter (damages immersion) it should be detectable on the reactions of the civilians. Also, not everyone will realize what just happened. A group of people in a city could be oblivious to an explosion that murdered 10 people 5 blocks away. And the way this information is transferred also varies. Some civilians notify the ocurrence while others just flee from the crowd that is stampeding towards them. \n\nWhen nothing is ocurring, and it can happen at any point in the game, people are seen doing every day things. It is at this point when the defenders should be careful to preserve the peace as much as possible (REALLY HIGH BONUS POINTS) so any sort of fighting is going to attract attention and raise tension, but when disaster strikes people will be more desensitized to such things. \n\nThe eventual first encounter between defenders and terrorists should be a BIG DEAL. So much so that time should slow down for like 3 seconds while you hear a heartbeat, symbolizing a change of pace in gameplay and initiating a new phase in the conflict. its no longer terrorists killing people, they are also engaging Defenders and a new layer of chaos is added. Now they will focus on each other until disaster strikes. And when it does a third layer initiates. The final layer would be the population sinking into a riot, creating a hell-on-Earth scenario that is almost impossible to stop, only mitigate as much as possible.\n\nThe goal here is to at all costs NOT make the civilians seem disposable or cumbersome. They should enrich the multiplayer experience, not take away from it. \n\nThis game idea is way too big, and is very focused on complex A.I. programming and acting, but maybe you can take some bits and pieces and make something out of it. 
1428761658|328c6x|Two See.|It was an odd idea. One that I'd been coming up with. \n\nIn this world, there are two children, or people.\n\nOne can see Blue light, the other can see Red, but nothing more.\n(Co-op is required here different screens, oculus whathaveyou.)\n\nThere are lights of each color around, and they must guide eachother. I wanted crawling, walking, and running. However, pressing shift, either one can, if they are near, grab the hand of the other. Leading one another through dangerous areas that only one person can see. (Think ico, but co-op.)\n\nFor a twist, I thought if each character was coloured differently and had a torch of the others' light, they would never see eachother, only their beams.\n\nI may not have thought this through enough, but what do you think?
1472006459|4zac8q|Guide an inept hero through a fantasy adventure|The world is in chaos, a big bad is threatening all that is good, and a chosen one is selected to save humanity as we know it. Unfortunately, the chosen hero is an inept goof-ball with an inflated ego. A force of good has assigned you, an actual adventurer, to protect the hero on his journey.\n\nI'd imagine as a sort of 2D puzzle platformer. The hero trots along in a ridiculous fashion, going along on his adventure. Enemies will attempt to stop and kill him the hero, they will set traps against him, and there will be boss fights.\n\nThe player character can fight, and is much more capable than the inept hero. However, if the player character assists to directly and too obviously, the hero's ego will deflate as he realizes that it's actually you who's doing all the work, and will not have the willpower to continue with the quest.\n\nSo, the player will have to do some behind the scene's puzzle solving to do situations in which the bad guys will be defeated, but it will look like the hero is one doing all or most of the work, and you are just his trusty companion. The hero will be happy with you fighting along side him for a limited time, but if you just do combat alone, you won't be able to progress. The player will have to do puzzles and platforming to continue on the journey.\n\nSo, if there is a big boss monster in say, a church, the player could attempt to go to the church ahead of the hero and prepare to cut down the bell at the top or something and send it toppling onto the monster, killing it. The inept hero isn't very bright, so he'll figure that as long as he doesn't see you directly doing it, that he himself was the one who defeated the monster.\n\nThere could be combat sequences, too. For example, perhaps there is a locked door, and the player notices an oncoming ambush. The player tells the hero to begin lock picking the door. This, of course, consumes all of the heroes attention, and the player must fight off the ambush while the hero is busy with the lock.\n\nAnd of course, as soon as the hero figures out how to unlock the door after you just killed 15 baddies, is chuffed with himself and says things like "What would you do without me?" and stuff like that.\n\nThere could be "Updrades" too. The player could begin to train the hero to be more competent. When the hero gets kills, his ego is boosted. Like I said earlier, if the ego bar empties, the game is over. (That, along with the hero dying.) So, the player could upgrade the hero, making it easier to guide him. However, upgrade the hero TOO much, and he can potentially go ahead of you, giving you less time to solve the puzzles you need too.\n\nYou could also give the hero "fake" upgrades. You could assign him "shiny new armor" that is too heavy for him, and makes him slow. Again, the hero is oblivious to this, and is glad that he has some shiny new armor.\n\nSorry this is rant format. I'm pretty bad at formatting and describing things, but if you stuck with it hopefully you can get the gist of what I'm saying.

1386185326|1s3ku3|A mech game where the first player pilots on a console and additional players use tablets or smart phones to provide maintenance.|I've been thinking a lot lately about games that focus on connecting ~~hardcore and casual players~~ fans of different genres of games and games that rely heavily on cooperation and putting groups of people in individual roles.\n\nThis idea is kind  of vague but it would basically be a game where the first player would play the game via a console or PC in the traditional way, using a controller and viewing gameplay through a TV or monitor. This player would pilot a mech or other vehicle, fighting AI enemies or perhaps other human opponents. Controls would be typical for a mech shooter.\n\nAdditional players would serve as the mech's engineering and maintenance crew and perform their duties by downloading an app to their smartphones and tablets. This app would link to the main game and would have several different screens and panels, each serving a different purpose and representing a different control panel for the mech. Each control panel would have a different set of puzzle and minigames to perform to provide the mech with better efficiency. Depending on how many additional players there are, each player can cover a certain control panel and divy out maintenence responsibilities. \n\nFor example, a person playing the engineering panel would operate a series of switches and play a rewiring minigame to divert power to whichever weapons system the pilot was using as a priority. The player on the navigational panel would view a sonar map and mark out enemies, which would then be marked on the pilot's screen so he wouldn't be ambushed. A player could act as a "maintenanceperson," switching between panels and putting out electrical fires when the mech takes damage, therefore minimizing the threat of the mech's destruction. \n\nThe HUD of the pilot would be minimal and the pilot would have to communicate with his crew to keep a gauge on health and ammo supply, as those details would only appear on certain screens of the maintenance players' tablets. In fact, communication all around would be key to the team's victory, providing an immersive experience to a team that works well together. In this game, teamwork trumps individual skill.\n\nPVP could rise to a tournament and championship level, pitting the best crews in the world against each other.
1363582745|1aib7o|A Game About The Butterfly Effect|Ideally this would be made with a visually stunning engine. Mechanics would be simple, you mostly just walk/run places and make decisions on everything. But everything you do matters.\n\nIt would begin with you waking up as a high schooler and needing to walk to school in the winter. HUD prompts (or possibly audio directions from the character) would tell the player where to go and if they decided not to then they could within reason. It wouldn't be a totally open world game, it would be a very detailed small game.\n\nSo let's say that instead of walking to school the player decides to run circles in the snow because the particle effect is really cool. Unfortunately, because of this they don't reach the a street with a crosswalk on time and don't press the pedestrian walk button, so a car crash occurs.\n\nThen you would wake up as a man in his forties working a desk job. maybe the player doesn't put a jacket on, so the character drops his keys because his hands are shaking, pushing back the time it takes to get him to the crosswalk, aiding in preventing the crash.\n\nIf it were as good as it could be you would simply go from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning with a bunch of different characters, each impacting the scene in a small way. You job as a player is to clean up your mess hat you made with the previous character.\n\nAnother great thing about this would be DLC galore, adding new characters could be done easily, making it a huge game over the course of a couple years.\n\nTL;DR: You have to clean up your own mess with different characters.
1383733139|1q0nlq|Frequency - A radio based RTS|Hey,    \nThis is just an idea I had bobbing around. I don't have the skills to make it, but hey, maybe I'll learn me some programming :p    \n    \nAnyway, the idea is based around a stripped down RTS based around orders for units taking time to transmit and recieve. Not a long time, but worst case scenario up to 30-40 seconds for a long distance secure order to reach a unit.    \n    \nSo when you give a unit a move/attack/whatever order it takes time for that order to propagate through your comms network so the unit can act on it.    \n    \nThere would be three main units:    \nBase - Large transmission radius. High defensive bonus for stationed troops    \nComms Station - Used to increase transmission range. Provides slight defensive bonus for stationed troops    \nTroops - Short transmission distance. Your fighting soldiers! These can recieve orders either direct from your base or via a comms station or via a nearby unit's radio.     \n\nThe key to the game is managing your communications infrastructure. \nYour base is the origin point of all your transmissions. If a unit is outside of your transmission range, they CANNOT act on any orders given. They will attempt to complete previously issued orders, or otherwise hold position. To receive an order the unit must be within the transmission range of the sending station (the unit's own transmission range does not matter when receiving). So for example, an order would originate from your base, bounce through a couple of comms stations, and then reach your unit.    \n\nThere are three speeds of radio transmission:    \nHardlink - used between a base and a comms station - very fast, secure    \nBuilding - Transmission from a base or comms station to a unit. Moderate speed, can be secure or unsecure (see below)    \nUnit - Troops can relay orders through their own radio sets to other troops. This is slow and always unsecure, and as such is not ideal. Try to keep your units in radio range of a building!     \n    \nTypes of communication:    \nSecure - Slower speed transmission, cannot be jammed, cannot be intercepted    \nUnsecure - Used using a shift or alt key command. 3x as fast as a secure transmission, but succeptable to jamming, and if an enemy unit is within your transmission range the enemy will see the order you gave your units! This can lead to some clever rusing - Send an unsecure order, followed by a secure order. Your enemy won't know the secure order has been sent and may still think your unit is following the unsecure order.    \n    \nAnyway, that's my ramblings for now. I might add more to it later.
1382503460|1p13zj|A new kind of apocalypse game.|So this game would take place before AND after the apocalypse. The first stage of the game is where you try to find food, water, shelter, maybe even companions, and whatever else you may need. \n\nThen strikes the apocalypse. This could be a randomly generated kind of apocalypse, like a nuclear fallout, zombies, the sun going out, etc. The cool thing about this mechanic would be that you would need to be prepared for anything and everything. Here's an example: \n\nSo you get into the game and immediately start gathering weaponry. You think that the worst thing possible could be the zombie apocalypse. So, it is a couple of nights later and you have this base full of weapons, food, and water. You think you have this whole apocalypse thing under control. Then, the apocalypse strikes. The temperature outside starts to drop down below freezing. You realize that an ice age has struck, and all you have is guns to defend you against the brutal cold. \n\nI don't have an idea for an endgame yet, maybe you need to survive a certain amount of days in the apocalypse or complete a list of goals.

1423366356|2v5qcg|Personal thoughts on submitting Game Ideas|Hey guys, new to this sub-reddit. I am a student studying Software Engineering (Game programming) and am just starting my third year. Often during the holidays, when I finish work early or I am just bored, I work on hobby projects. I have experience with Android, c++, c#, Unity etc.. I often just make little puzzle games or test out mechanics and ideas that I have. I have found myself more and more trying to get inspiration from external sources, such as this sub-reddit. As a programmer I would just like to shed some light on your submissions. I am well aware that this sub-reddit is for ideas people aren't going to make themselves (and most likely no-one will) but no-one submits ideas for nothing. What I recommend to you all is to have a little look into game design documents and how to properly submit an idea. Almost every idea on here is too complex to make, not detailed enough and clearly not enough thought has been put into it being an actual game. I love taking ideas and inspiration from what I read, but if you guys really want results or more interest with your ideas, you should spend some time thinking how practical the idea is, and maybe just simplifying the whole idea down to a few main base mechanics. After all, this is how most unique games are developed. Keep the ideas coming, it really is interesting and useful hearing what people come up with! \n\nThanks for reading my criticism. No offence is intended to anyone, only to help increase the quality of the submissions on here and to help you guys think more on the lines of how games are actually developed etc.. \n\n-- PantherNZ
1431660430|360tlv|Lonely|A random game concept that I just thought up. In the game, you play as the typical RPG hero, except that none of the NPCs will interact with the player. This means the player can only gain information by listening in on conversations between NPCs. The player cannot buy anything, and if the player is pursued into the village by monsters, it is possible to die in the village with villagers looking on. So, instead of the player character being widely known and famous, the player is a humble and reclusive character who simply slays monsters, overhears about the threat of the big baddie from some of the villagers, and simply slays the monster as much for his own survival as much as the survival of everyone else.\n\nI hope that this unconventional take on the classic RPG will serve as a good/bad example for other developers to follow/use as a cautionary tale; I really don't know how the game will turn out, but if there's a developer out there that has experience making RPGs and is looking for an idea for a small project, please do consider making a first version of this game (hey, it's fine to do ascii graphics!)
1468686162|4t5827|A game where you control the emotions of a character.|**Name:** Mood Swing\n\n**Concept Overview:** You have a character in an open world, but you don't control them directly. Instead, you control how they feel, and see the affects of that on their actions.\n\n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe story would be from the point of view of a girl living out a normal life from a preset personality at first, but you could change her personality by manipulating her emotions, leading her to make different decisions and ultimately changing the course of her life.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nI'm partial to New Orleans. Its an iconic city with an atmosphere that varies depending on which part you go to. Also, I'm Louisianan, so I'm kind of biased.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nA normal, everyday person. I said it'd be a girl, because I got the idea from Inside Out, but there's no reason it can't be a boy. You could choose the name, and the game would use text-to-speech, I guess, to work it into the game.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nEmotion Control - you'd have sliders for the amount of each emotion. One slider controls happiness, one sadness, one anger, one tiredness, one arousal, etc. These would affect how the character reacts to things around her, like real emotions would.\n\nConditioning - By giving her the same emotion each time she sees a certain thing, you could condition her to like something or dislike something, causing her to pursue it or avoid it more.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nAn great way to show how someone's emotional state affects their lives. Has a feel that is starkly different than other games.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nI think that PC would be best for this kind of game, because you could work the sliders with the mouth or set them to increase or decrease when you press certain buttons (q to increase happiness, a to decrease happiness, etc.).\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nPerhaps a menu that shows you an overview of your character's personality and how it changed over time?\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nHowever you want to.
1470983061|4xc7a8|A parlour-esque Agatha Christie style game where you play someone framed for murder.|It's simple. A murderer has framed you and you are now facing the gallows. (This gives you slightly more motivation to win, if you're going to face the death penalty rather than just a long time in jail.) You have to convince the police and detectives and the people around you through clues and dialogue that you're actually innocent. Think An Inspector Calls meets L.A. Noire. 
1462372177|4huppx|Would you play a Serial Killer Sim?|I'm on the verge of making it myself and have thought about it for a few weeks now, but here's the idea: \n\nThe basic premise of the game would be you move into a new neighborhood, you meet your neighbors and other multitude of characters, you'd make friends with them even relationships, you'd get closer, then every night you'd get a phone call from an unknown telling you how to manipulate them and other helpful tips. \n\nConversations you have with other characters would be much like Visual Novel style with multiple answers/questions each changing the story dramatically or slightly. (The game will be first person and characters fully modeled 3D)\n\nBut when characters start to become a problem its time to kill. You'd have multiple killing methods, maybe even try to make it look like an accident,  but you'd have to wait your chance to get them alone. \n\nEach character would have their base stats and through conversation and manipulation you'd be able to change those base stats, for example, falling in love with you or outright disliking you.   \n\nOnce you've "infiltrated" the group you'd be invited to "get togethers" where you'd be able to manipulate them further while they're under the influence (bonus round almost)\n\nEvery time you restart the game the character stats would be randomized so the approach to each character would be slightly different with each play through\n\nOnce you've killed enough characters, you may be able to frame one of the characters left alive (you'd kinda have to decide that when you first meet all of the characters) any murders would be subject to police investigation. \nMurders would occur with a lot of stealth involved, i.e. breaking in. \n\nI do apologize if I rambled on a bit. Tell me what you guys think, if it this would be indeed something you'd enjoy playing multiple times.

How fast a swing is and what it can combo into. You get certain complexity points for each move and would be able to change move loadouts mid battle. New players would have basic moves and can change them.

I don't know about anyone else, but I think this a very underused topic in entertainment.
1441613991|3jy90j|A first person shooter in a medieval setting where you are a blind wizard who can only see through the eyes of your enemies.|
1441852261|3kc7l1|Color blind|So you start off only seeing white. You have a narrarator, he tells you where you are, what to do and some other random stuff. He guides you along your way until he says somrthing like "Oh no, they've found me.. There's sonething I need to tell you, there IS A WAY TO GET-" *cuts off* So now you're alone, but you see something in the distance. Its some yellow jewel. You get closer and touch it. Now you can see yellow. Maybe yellow flowers, the sun, bananas, and other stuff you'd see around. At this point the game would look weird because there would be random yellow stuff that looks as if its floating around, After a bit more exploring, you would find your next jewel, blue. Now you see the sky, and water, and everything thats blue. And then red would be last for the first chapter. (first chapter would be the primary chapter) The next chapter would be the secondary chapter with all the secondary colors, and then the third chapter would probably have some other colors like brown.\n\nSo you're happy now, you can finally see the world. But then darkness fills your screen, until all you see is black. Thats pretty much all I've thought of so far. If you have any ideas or like it, then pleas post below. Thanks
1448079364|3tnlpp|Guys this isn't r/gamedev|Instead of telling people what to do with their lives, just comment what you like or don't like about their game ideas or point them towards a game already made that's close enough to their idea they don't know about. I'm pretty sure that's what this sub is for. If they wanted their game to be made then they could post to that more popular sub.
1443242846|3mfg8s|Turn On The Lights - A Horror Concept|So the basic premise of this game combines typical horror elements with a focus on knowing what you are facing and where it is. You are tasked with the morning shift in an empty factory, and your first task is to turn on all the lights before the other workers arrive. To do this, the player must find switches using faint light pouring in from adjacent rooms already completed. The first room will already be lit when the player starts. The morning shift worker's job is to rid the factory of pests, monsters, and other horrible entities that come out during the night and remain as long as there is darkness in the factory.\n\nIf there is a monster in a room, the player will be able to hear it breathing even in darkness, and will be able to see its silhouette if it is exposed to light from an adjacent room. Some monsters flee into adjacent rooms when the lights are turned on, some will vanish entirely. Monsters which flee into nearby rooms will also vanish when all the rooms around them are already lit. However, some monsters will attack the player when the lights turn on. Monsters which flee or vanish will attack the player if touched in darkness. Monsters which attack when the room is lit will vanish when touched. The player must use the silhouette and sound of the monster to determine what kind it is (each kind will have a distinctive shape and a different trait to its breathing).\n\nIn summary, there are three kinds of monsters: when lights are turned on, one kind flees, one kind vanishes, and one kind attacks. But the former two attack when touched, while the latter vanishes. The player must decide whether to approach the monster or turn on the lights. Choosing correctly will remove the monster at least from the room. Choosing wrongly will result in the player being attacked and/or jumpscared (have not decided if I want that to be a part of the attack).\n\nCan't think of any ways to elaborate on this idea now but I know there are ways it could be improved.
1458721280|4bloie|[Guide] A game concept - How to describe your idea|Hey guys,  \n  \n**Introduction**  \n  \nThis post is meant to help new Ideas to grow to concepts which are implementable.  \nI noticed that /gameideas is full of awesome ideas, but the concepts have very poor quality most of the time.  \nThe concept is the elaboration of your idea. It is necessary for others, which are going to help the concept grow and or are going to implement the concept in the final stage.  \n  \nIf this post is well received, maybe a mod could pin it up(?). \n\n**My background**  \n  \nI'm a professional software developer, working in a small team in long term projects. I'm not a professional game developer. However, games are software and the path of an idea that is growing into a concept which is implementable is similar.   \nThis post is meant as a guide for people with ideas which have no, or a very rough, idea of development.   \nTo make this post a great help for these people, I please you, professionals, semi-professionals and free-time indie developers to share your knowledge and experience. I will adapt them to this post, so whoever comes up with an idea, is able to transform the idea into a concept that is implementable.  \n  \n**Basic Terminology**  \n  \nFirst of all, we have to define some basic terms. This is to make thinks clear and to avoid misunderstandings.\nDue I'm not a game dev, I cannot provide the full game-specific terminology. So in particular this paragraph will grow, as others come up with their knowledge. To get a deeper knowledge, you might read the &lt;In depth Terminology&gt; paragraph at the end of this post. Deep knowledge is not crucial if you do not want to implement the game by yourself.\n\n - Idea  \n   Your initial version of the concept. It lacks a lot, but contains the core of your idea.  \n  \n - Concept  \n   The elaborated idea. The concept might not be full-blown, but whoever reads this will have a better understanding of what exactly you want. Professional game developers might be able to figure out which kind of objects, relations, interfaces and such are needed to implement the game.  \n  \n - Genre  \n   What kind of game is your idea about? Platformer, puzzle, real time strategy, first person shooter,... ? \n  \n - Theme   \n   Describe the ingame world. As an example, I want to mention a real time strategy game. Is it about pirates, or a WWII game, or what do you have in mind? If your idea contains a story, the story is part of this.  \n \n - Gameplay  \n   How does the user interacts with the game? Is it a puzzle game where the user has to move some bricks until the bricks form up a picture, or a car racing shooter where the user drives a car while shooting on his competitors? Is it multiplayer(local or online?) or singleplayer?  \n  \n**From idea to concept - an example post**  \n// Lines that begin like this (double slash) are comments.  \n// They are not part of the example but provide better understanding of why I've written something in what way and order.  \n// Sometimes it is not possible to describe a specific part of a game, because it is "too different".  \n// This will happen in the example, so you can see how to handle this.  \n//  \n// Start of the example post  \n  \nHey guys, I was thinking about a game, where the user runs from the left side to the right side. On his path, he has to cross obstacles by jumping over them. The world is moving, so the player has to time his jumps as otherwise he will fall out of the world and die.  \n// You might, or might not, see a platformer game in this idea. The idea is very rough and easy to misunderstand.  \n\nI'll describe the game a little further:  \n\nGenre:  \nSome kind of sidescrolling platformer, with focus on timing based jumps to overcome moving (And sometimes attacking) obstacles.  \nThe player will not play level by level, but one giant level in one row. Think of super mario, now put the beginning of each level at the end of the level before. tadaa\n// Much creative much wow...\n  \nTheme:  \nYou're a space-cowboy-ninja-detective. You got knowledge about the illuminates evil plan to destroy the world by reviving mega intelligent dinosaurs that can karate and shoot lasers through their eyes.  \nYou have to fight your way through these dinosaurs, and their intelligent defense lines, to the Illuminati king, which turns out to be Gaben Newell, which does all of this just to avoid making Half Life 3.  \n// As you might have noticed, the theme already makes some statements about the gameplay.  \n// So there are laser shooting dinosaurs, and a defense line to overcome.  \n// You know how platformer games work (If not: Super mario is one.) and thus.  \n// With your knowledge about platformers and my theme, you might have a colorful picture of the game in your head.  \n// But your picture might differ from mine, so I'll describe it further.  \n    \n   \nGameplay:  \nThe player can run, jump, crouch and prone.  \nBy running, the player will gain speed until a certain limit. Depending on the speed, movement will become less controllable, the character will react with a little delay, depending on his speed.  \n// How exactly does this speed to delay dependency work? If this is your idea, you should work this out.\n\nThe faster the player is running, the further he jumps.  \nCrouching is necessary to get through some objects, or avoid gunfire or such. The player will have a smaler sillouet and slow speed. He is not able to jump in this mode.  \nThe dinosaurs don't see very good. Lying prone will make the player invisible to most dinosaurs.  \nWhile prone, the player has extremely low speed. Jumping is impossible.   \n// Thats actual the movement, what else to say?  \n// Well, the objects in the world should be described a little further.  \n// What exactly are some obstacles, how do they behave, how to avoid them?  \n// Some "art"-works (Or basic schemes made in paint) would help here a lot.\n\nSo as you know my idea, what do you think about it? Did I miss something, is something unclear?  \nI'd love to see this game and I bet everyone will pay full $60€ to play it. \n//Yeah,.. sure...\n\n// END OF EXAMPLE \n\n\n**In depth Terminology**  \nYou might not need it to elaborate your ideas. But it might help you understand how a developer thinks and thus gives you the ability to make a concept which is better implementable. \n\n - Object  \n   Software development these days is, most of the time, Object-oriented programming. Almost every game today is OOP.  \n   OOP is an programming paradigm (Way to do something) of "objects" which contain data and procedures. For example a paddle in the basic game Pong. The paddle is an object. It has some data (X/Y coordinates) and some procedures(methods/functions/...) like moveUp(), moveDown(), repaint(). The other paddle, as well as the ball, are other objects. \n\n\n
1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**
1433520967|38oorq|Many game ideas here are far too big in scope. I made a (satirical) tool to help.|Hi! I make games.\n\nI see a lot of enthusiasm here for giant dream games -- MMO sandboxes as far as the eye can see. Those ideas unfortunately aren't useful to anyone. Why?

1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.

Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.

1443383212|3mm0c2|A spaceship game that no one will ever make.|I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies.
1399310129|24sf5m|If someone made this game, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.|This game would be a puzzle game. The character would move through a series of levels, getting Energy powerups along the way. Its every move is controlled by a malevolent outside force. Soon, it realizes this and tries to escape. \nYou, the player, are the malevolent force. The energy powerups are drugs to keep the character docile. When he tries to escape, you must block him and try to manipulate him into the drugs. At the end, you'll have the choice to either let him escape (losing the game with no restarts) or to kill him (winning the game). \nYes, it would be essentially Portal from the POV of Glados.
1423955457|2vx3ay|Spy Messenger: Giver orders and fulfill missions through a fake messaging app|**The basic idea**\n\nWhen opening the (mobile?) game, you reach a "messenger app"-like UI where each contact is actually an NPC with whom you can exchange pre-defined texts. Your goal is to fulfill missions through the intermediary of contacts: you gather information, give orders, and get things done all through messages. As the game progresses, you have more and more useful contacts and more and more complex quests.\n\n**Typical game loop**\n\nFor instance, a mission could consist of stealing someone's phone. All you know at first is the target's name, and the fact that he's already served jail time for robbery.\n\n1. You call the white pages service, and realize 15 persons have the same name.\n1. You call a friend from the police, and give him the name to get criminal records for all persons matching it.\n1. There's only two persons known by this name with criminal records, and only one has served for robbery. Great, you now have his address.\n1. Since it's 2am, the guy must be home. Message another contact and ask him to break into the target's home, and steal the phone.\n1. Moments later, he contacts you back saying he's got it. You tell him where to deliver the phone.\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting stories based on the idea, making things harder and harder to solve. Maybe at some point you'll have unreliable contacts that lie to you, and make you need to track your own contacts... Or people that get killed on the job... Or multiple missions to manage simultaneously, that end up being related to each other... Lots of intricate things to imagine :)\n\nIf made as a mobile game, I also wonder whether it could be interesting to make this game real-time, like there's an actual hour to wait until you burglar reaches the target's house. It could add to the immersion, but it would suddenly be heavily notification-based, not sure I'd like to play that.\n\n**Technical aspects**\n\nI'd say the basic gameplay would be quite affordable for beginners: there's a lot of modeling to do for data, NPCs, possible situations and how everything is linked together, but it does seem quite easy and fun to code. And iterative, too, as you can start small and add features as you go. Also, no graphics! The main challenge is rather to make the pre-defined messages thing work well.
1437927452|3eo531|The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it.|Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.\n\nThe hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. \n\nThe GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.\n\nFinally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.\n\nPlaying with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.

1414594926|2kohuo|It's called: You Are The Sword|For some years I simply have not had the time to keep programming and trying to properly realise my game ideas. So here: I'm throwing one of them out into the aether to see what y'all think of it. Please upvote and share if you like it and I can give you more info.\n\nOur protagonist starts at the bottom of a tower with many separate floors. The aim is to get to the top of the tower. The tower is populated by many adventurers seeking to do the same thing. So far, so cliche and uninteresting.\n\nHere's the twist (and working title): **You Are The Sword**.\n\nWhen the character holding you dies, you drop to the floor, and, evetnually, you're picked up by another character who you then gain control over. In some sense the game can never end until you win - which allows us to amp up the difficulty significantly of course.\n\nInspirations: Dwarf Fortress and Sword Art Online, primarily.\n\nOK there's a lot more to this idea that would require a lot (a **lot**) of programming. But that's the very basic idea. I can go on about it more in the comments if you are interested. Imagine all the cool things about dwarf fortress (persistence, random gen, etc.) but in a dungeon crawler. It's pretty cool. Throw in all your classic RPG elements, only with this curveball that your character can completely change at any time.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more.\n\nEdit: someone wanted more information up front rather than in discussion below, so I'll do what I can.\n(NB. there's a lot more here than the basic idea, and I'm well aware of what a colossal amount of work this would be to code!)\n\nBASIC GAME PITCH\n\n* you are a parasitic sword who takes control of your wielder\n* your aim is to get to the top of the tower - you start at the ground floor\n* there are a fixed number of randomly generated adventurers in the tower, and when one dies, a new one enters\n* adventurers wander through the tower fighting monsters on different floors, and perhaps each other\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\n\n* adventurers are procedurally generated at the start of the game, along with the maps of each of the tower's floors, monsters and bosses (a la Dwarf Fortress)\n* adventurers have classic rpg stats alongside temperament stats (which grades them on scales of aggressiveness/passivity, bravery/cowardice, honour/treachery etc.) . This dictates their interactions with other adventurers and their actions more generally\n* monsters get tougher as you go up the tower\n\nSWORDS\n\n* every adventurer climbing the tower needs a sword. You start out getting picked up by some level one scrub at the bottom floor of the tower\n* some swords are special - let's call them soul swords. You're one of them. Soul swords take over the mind of the wielder and are soulbound (cannot be unequipped till death) You're not necessarily the only one...\n* swords level up as their wielders level up\n\nADVENTURERS\n\n* adventurers level up as they fight monsters and grow stronger\n* there are a fixed number of adventurers, so it's technically possible to record all interactions between advs, all injuries sustained, and all rivalries/friendships etc. If you've played dwarf fortress you know the kind of thing I'm talking about: Brian's left toe is broken sort of thing\n* some advs play dirty - if they are 'evil' enough, they might kill other advs for their gear, or because they don't like them. If you're unlucky, your character won't just get killed by their sworn enemy, but you will *become* their sworn enemy. Still, it's probably better than being left on the ground.\n\nTHE TOWER\n\n* for now let's say the tower has 20 floors. Adventurers likewise can level from 1 to 20. They can only access the floor they have hit the level of. Similarly for equipping weapons and armour.\n\nPARTIES\n\n* in order to to tackle bigger monsters, at some point advs have to go out in parties. As a low-level character, you can expect to be resigned to signing up for an available outing with a party looking for another member.\n\n* as your repute grows (of the character, not the sword) you might be able to lead your own parties, by finding other weaker (or less famous) advs to follow you\n\nDEATH\n\n* when an adv dies, their gear falls to the ground. If that includes you, you won't be spared. You lie there in the dirt until a friend claims it, or a adv considers you an upgrade, or, if you're really unlucky, some low level scrub picks you up looking for a cheap buck by selling you on. The higher level you are, the more chance you will find your way to the hands of someone as mighty as your last wielder. Otherwise, you have to work your way back up again.\n\nSTORY (because why the hell not?)\n\n*Nemesis stands at the top of the Tower of Fate, looking down at your battered corpse. She knows that only seconds from now, your body will judder back to life whether you wish it or not. So she does what she did to all the others: as your spirit returns to flow like water into your recently departed body, she catches it in a vial of sand and corks it. It is all you can do to juggle yourself out of her grasp. The vial smashes on the floor and you reach once more for your body. But it is too far away, and the sand weighs you down. Enough sand lands on the sword for your spirit to find a place in the metal to hide. But it has been to long now. Your body is dead.*\n\n*Nemesis kicks your body, your sword and your spirit over the side of the tower with a curse. Now she is the last of the gods, free to feed off all those who dare to reach the top of her tower. Only you can stop her now, but you have fallen to the very bottom of the world, your body smashed to pieces. You are not you anymore.*\n\n*You Are The Sword.*
1430925576|352f8f|A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam|The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., "What did you have for breakfast today?" or "Where do you live?". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable "hallucinations" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness.
1387667572|1tfajy|You will probably not read this, but I need to get this concept out of my head.|A game that I call 'Psychosis', I don't know if this has been done, in that case tell me.\n\nIt's a horror game, where you start in a abandoned hospital with a head injury/amnesia, the\nhospital starts out normal and clean, but once a nurse comes in there's no eyes just holes,\nthis causes the game to go in slow motion and your heartbeat goes louder.\nAfter she leaves you try to escape the hospital. Other people, patients and nurses \nstart out as ghosts/human like creatures and the closer you get to the exit the more scarier they become\n(as well as making the hospital more scarier, moving walls, more worn out, darker, until it's pretty much abandon)\nmaking the player to start attacking them the using various weapons found in the hospital.\nThis causes police and guards to come and try to arrest you, however, to the player they appear\nlike monsters. You escape and go through a almost like typical horror game except you attack\nothers, the longer you wait the scarier/more gross they become. "The Cops" hunts you\nand you'll have to escape to your farm (this is the only objective and the only thing your character remembers).\nAs you progresses through the game, it becomes darker and scarier.\nRight before you reach your farm, you're arrested/kidnapped by the monsters.\nYoul'll then placed in a room with the only normal looking person in the game.\nHe explains to you that you're a hallucinating schizophrenic and had a psychosis,\nhe tells you you've killed countless peoples lives (now you'll get flashbacks from a "normal"perspective"\nshowing you killing innocent men, women, and children) and that you've been the main newstory\nall week and been hunted by the government. Revealing you have been a psychopath.\nYour character can't accept it and kills the psychologist and tries to escape in a \n["Black ops revelations"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02DUaeo9iw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=61) type of mission, getting flashbacks seeing yourself killing people\nwithout regret, your character finally breaks down and kills himself with a gun from a guard. The End.\nThe backstory is you were put in a mental hospital at a young age, one day you're attacked\nby another patient, landing you in the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry it sounds a bit weird, but it has been in my head for a couple of days\nand I can't really get the concept out of my head.\n\nThe thing is, it has to be really well executed. The regular people have to act\nlike normal people just looking scary to the player, the cops are the only ones attacking you first.\nIt's kinda inspired by Postal 2's Apocalypse Weekend.\nIt should be extremely bloody and not using as much jump-scares but more psychological horror.\nFocusing on the feeling of being alone and followed. One defining moment should be\nkilling a monster up close, cutting its throat, looking into human eyes. Moments showing something's\nwrong should be popping up through the entire game.\n\n**TL;DR: You kill monsters in a apocalyptic world, in the end revealing you're a psycho running around killing\ninnocent people.**\n\nIt's still just an idea, so tips, ideas and critique are welcomed. I've also thought of this as a movie and a book, but a game seemed like the best.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.

1437118107|3dlnyi|You're a ghost who must setup freak accidents in a contract with Death!|This game is set on a modern, populated island with a few hundred residents and a northeastern always-cloudy-and-gloomy atmosphere. They all have generic routines around the house; making breakfast, watching TV, mowing the lawn, going to bed, etc..., and most of them have jobs they travel to on the island.\nYou're an invisible ghost. You were once a resident of the island but you were murdered by an unknown killer. Death has spared you eternity in the abyss, for now, under the condition that you help him cross a number of names off his list. As an added bonus, he'll eventually let you get revenge on the person who killed you before the story took off.\nSo, the gameplay.\nYou cannot simply ghost-punch people in the face and kill them, but instead, you have to CAUSE their deaths through moving objects in game and setting up traps and freak accidents like an ill placed toy at the top of the stairs that no one was paying attention to because it wasn't there just a second ago. \nYou have to observe a little and figure out your victims routines for everything to go smoothly. The more bold your actions are, the more likely it is that someone will notice strange things happening in their home. If Ms. Jones notices the toaster sitting by the bathtub then she will carry herself in much more suspect manner and make things more difficult for you, and if she turns a corner and sees a kitchen knife floating in mid-air, ...she may very well call the exorcist. If the exorcist arrives in the home you are at, surviving his encounter will give you a fresh start on the mission, but if he successfully exercises the home then you will be banished from it until you are strong enough to reenter (and you become stronger with each death you cause). As you progress and do become stronger, you slowly work your way to the title of a demon. At this level of strength you may actually give someone a little nudge while they're on a ladder or something similar, but  once again, the more bold your actions are - the more risk you take. At this stage you may attract the attention of guardian angels, and without taking any sides or getting too religious, if a guardian is alerted to your presence then your only hope is to very stealthily avoid it and cause an accidental death (for gameplay/balance reasons). \nIt's obviously a dark narrative and if it were fleshed out properly would be restricted in a few countries, but I think it scores points for originality, concept, and boldness. There are plenty of other details I've thought of for the game but I'd like to hear what someone else says about the basic premise, the mechanics of it, and what they'd add or remove. Very open to criticism! 
1446249293|3qwouw|Idea for a Shooter using a dismemberment system [X-POST from /r/Gaming]|Someone told me to post this here after having posted it in [This Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3qug9q/tis_but_a_scratch/cwixm9v?context=3)\n\nI've always imagined a sort of zombie war game with this kind of dismemberment mechanic. The story was basically going to be that countries began turning their dead soldiers into zombies to fight wars because they feel no pain, and players would play as these zombie soldiers on one side and humans on the other in basic game types like CTF or Deathmatch, Survival (both against waves of zombies *or* humans), etc. You'd have stuff like zombies legs being blown off by mines only to have them keep crawling along the ground with a gun in one hand, or if they only had one arm left they'd crawl up to the enemy and try and grab them to sort of "stun" them, while dealing biting damage. Or, crawl up behind a human player, the zombie pulls the pin on their own grenade, SURPRISE!\n\nGot both arms blown off? Run at the humans in a suicide mauling attempt. Got one leg? You'll still be crawling pretty fast and can shoot just fine. Want a longer melee range? At the sacrifice of one of your arms and the ability to shoot anything but one-handed firearms you can rip it off and use it like a spear with the knife in that hand.\n\nI pictured it as being a sort of goofy game where the story wouldn't really matter all that much. The zombies would be "intelligent", but they'd still be utter dopes, while the humans would probably be anything from satirical portrayals of the "ACTION HERO AMERICA" archetype to the gritty survivor archetype and other ridiculous stuff. Mainly multiplayer, it'd be something along the lines of TF2 (Though, not sure what would be a good replacement for mountains of hats). Someone also mentioned this could make an interesting RTS. I'd have to think more about how that'd work but I've always been somewhat of a fan.
1443800974|3n8llh|The gun that doesn't want to kill|To preface, this is a game I want to make, but with little, meaning zero, experience in game development and no idea where to start, I understand it's likely to never become a reality, and as depressing as that sounds I'd much rather write then develop, though one day I do hope to write for games, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe initial idea was a gun that didn't want to kill, and it bloomed from there.\n\nThe game starts on a sort of old power point esque type of scene, you know, the kind of the thing you see at the fallout 3 start screen? These "panels" tell the story of a group of scientists who were, years ago, intent on developing a weapon that had true artificial intelligence, to give useful intel and combat support in the middle of a fire fight. They succeeded in both creating the AI, and installing it into a simple gun, naming it P.A.G. (Personal Assistant Gun). However, Pags personality proved to be difficult. \n\nHe didn't want to kill. This weapon intended to murder and take lives on a battlefield was making a choice, or trying to at least. Despite being installed into a gun, and having access to several powerful sensors and other neat features, he has no control over his actual functionality as a gun, so he could not stop himself from firing when his trigger was pulled.\n\nThis made him very angry, and he would constantly, and very vocally protest to all his tests, even screaming at his creators to stop forcing him to be a weapon. It was decided that even though they could mute Pag, there was no use in a weapon that didn't want to kill, and would most likely be more detrimental then a help to anyone on an actual battlefield. \n\nFast forward some odd years, and our silent protagonist steps in, being assigned to guard duty at a well known research base. During his first night they are, of course, attacked. The enemy catches the base off guard, storming in, killing many scientists and soldiers alike. Our protagonist wakes up after being knocked out cold from a near by explosions, looking up to see soldiers passing over him, and many other corpses, putting a bullet in any head that moved. The protagonist, with a whole lot of luck is able to stay still, and avoid being killed then and there. \n\nHe makes his way through the now mostly destroyed facility, and finds himself inside an old research wing. Here he finds himself a gun, but it is an odd one, with strange lights, and it's plugged into a wall. He's never seen anything like it, but he picks it up and plans his escape. \n\nWhile moving down a corridor he's spotted by enemy combatants, and is forced to shoot and kill them both (there are 2), but upon firing at the first, the gun springs to life, and cries out, confused and jolted. At first it sounds terrified, afraid, and then asks if the it's wielder just killed some body, then goes through an almost traumatic seeming moment of "oh no", as if it's in some sort of disbelief. \n\nAs the game progresses many more enemies confront our silent killer, the player being forced to either kill them, or die. All the while the gun is screaming, yelling, and even at times begging you to stop, to put him down so he doesn't have to kill again.\n\nDuring the down times, to quiet points, he talks to you, he tells you what it's like to be an intelligent being shoved into something he hates so much, how he wishes only to help, not take lives, and one day he even dreams of becoming a flare gun, so that he can save people rather then kill them. Though, over time the gun realizes you won't stop killing, that you'll do anything to survive, and begins to criticize you more harshly, saying things like "You know those people had families, mother, fathers, spouses waiting for them. They'll never see them alive again because of you."\n\nAt the start Pag is confused, and tries to convince you to stop killing, that you can just sneak by, or even run, but as the game progresses he comes to hate you, to understand that you don't care what he thinks, that you'll use his body however you see fit, and his hopeful determination to stop you becomes a simpering, dark hatred towards the protagonist. \n\nTruth is this is a little dumbed down, and I don't really know how the ending would go. Though, I think it would be fun to find out.
1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1422047947|2tg1o0|A game where you have to make someone late for work|The game consists of you, a god-like character, controlling the world similar to the Sims.  You watch over a person going through their typical morning routine before they leave for work.  It is randomized every time, so while you have no idea exactly what they'll do at every time, it will be a traditional shower/eat/dress type of thing.  You have no control over what the character does, but you will be changing everything around them.\n\nYou will have a limited number of "action points" that will let you change the world around this character, and will let you do absolutely anything.  You can change the timer on the toaster oven so it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.  You can make the phone ring when he/she is in the shower.  You can interact with every single object and move it, break it, or alter it in a realistic way.  You can only affect objects individually, so you can not do things like use a lighter to light a newspaper on fire, or anything like that.\n\nThere are two catches that will make you "fail" your mission.  \n\nThe first one is, you can't kill the character, either intentionally or accidentally.  If you make him slip on the floor and he hits his head too hard, causing him to die, you lose.  The character MUST be in working condition, so even hospitalizing them will cause you to fail.\n\nThe second catch is that the character cannot detect that his world is being interfered with by a higher power.  If you take his car keys and make them float in midair, he/she will freak out and won't go to work.  \n\nThe character's routine will change based on every action you do, and it's totally possible for them do skip breakfast or leave without ironing their pants, so it's not as simple as, do a thing and it makes them late.  It's important to use action points on things that will affect the most important tasks and tasks that are done near the end of the routine.  Different actions also cost different points, so while hiding the car keys under the bed may completely throw your character off, it will also cost an enormous amount of points, and may not be the best way to achieve the goal.\n\nThe appeal would be the replay value.  Every game will feature a new character with a new job, a new routine, and every house will have hundreds of objects to inspect and mess with.  Most of the time spent developing the game would go towards creating objects, so you could play for 50 hours and still be coming up with new ways to cause controlled chaos.  After all, it is a sandbox strategy game.

1432619362|37aolu|You kill monsters|Ive had this idea for a while and Recently got motivated to actually develop it. (i made a post here a while ago and got some pretty great advice) I'm an illustrator and was actually hoping I could get some critique on this project. I barely have anything developed (im serious its literally just a concept right now, all I have is a rather quickly done illustration and some ideas) but I feel that There is enough here for a little advice. :)\n\n\nAnyway, the idea came to me from seeing a picture online. I'm really bummed out that I don't have the picture with be but it depicted this giant monster looming over this little girls bed. On the bed there was a small teddy bear with a sword and shield ready to fight the monster off. I loved this idea. A child's toy fighting off the monsters that live under the child's bed and in the closet. I took the idea and did countless sketches but never reaching anything cohesive  I could turn it into. but after a lot of red bull and procrastination in league of legends i finally came to the conclusion it could be a game. \n\n\nThe basics of the game would be you and a team of 3 others would play as a toy or stuffed animal, like a sock monkey, a bunny, a wind up robot, things like that. Each character having varying abilities such as placing down mouse traps setting up walls. maybe one can have fast melee attacks or someone can have a small nerf gun rigged to shoot teeth. But all 4 of you fight off waves of monsters that try to make it to the child your protecting in bed. Shes sleeping and you need to keep her nightmares at bay! Now the monsters could be anything, Bats, spiders, the scary ass pictures in "Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark" but there would always be something looming through out the room that you cant attack. Like the spider. There would be sort of a silhouette of this spindly thing on the far end of the room pumping out what seems to be an endless swarm of creepy crawlies. The closer the enemies, the more the environment changes to a darker tone. like dirt on the walls and ceiling and floor. maybe cobwebs surrounding most of the room.\n\n\n\nanyway thats my idea. (at least the bulk of it) Critique would be awesome and that one illustration I did is right here ------&gt; http://imgur.com/a/XmR5x (along with the rest of my artwork)
1452018732|3zlg44|Headcrab stealth game|I'd like to share an idea that came to my mind last night. This is a first person stealth game where you play as a headcrab (yup, like one from Half-Life). Bullet-points below describe game-play mechanics without touching the story.\n\n* game consists of separate levels\n* each level has some objective like infiltrating some facility or just killing everyone\n* you may jump onto people's heads, the person becomes your "host" and you basically play as normal FPS game\n* when you are in headcrab mode you are small, silent, could pass under furniture or through went holes but can't do actual damage and if spotted can be killed easily \n* when you are in host mode you could use weapons, kill others etc.\n* when you decide to jump off your host he dies immediately but you need to make sure that others do not spot the body\n* if your host was killed while you were still attached you have a chance to survive and scramble away\n* time of you controlling a host could be limited to keep a balance or levels may be designed to make being on the same host all the time not efficient \n* there are things, typical for stealth games like alarm, enemies have proper vision, hearing etc.
1458182719|4ar5dg|A very disturbing (yet Sadistically funny) racing game.|In a nutshell, the basic twist is that instead of cars, the racers are riding on the backs of large almost-naked humans crawling on all fours, with a large saddle on their backs. Meanwhile, the racers themselves are anthropomorphic car-like robots.\n\nThere would be limb dismemberment when the *vehicles* are damaged, as most of the powerups would involve bladed weapons. Lopping off limbs forces them to keep on crawling at the same pace, often dragging their stumps along the ground. All the while, a blank expression on their faces, "This is why I was bred, this is why I must race" being prolly the only thing they think.\n\n*Vehicles* would persist to writhe and struggle to crawl even after all limbs have been removed. It is up to the player to manually put the *vehicle* out of it's misery to get a new one.\nDecapitation (or severe blood loss) results in death of the *vehicle* and a new one being spawned in: a normal baby that rapidly grows to the size of the other *vehicles*.\n\nEdit: I think the best name for this should be Meatball Run (or Rally), as a reference to the real-life [Cannonball Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Baker_Sea-To-Shining-Sea_Memorial_Trophy_Dash) races and the racing films insipred by it (such as Canonballrun and Gumball Rally), and also due to the fact that the vehicles are infact made of meat.
1436886540|3d9emw|Game system idea - death mechanic with Grim Reaper's Wheel of Fate|This isn't a whole game idea, but a mechanic that can be plugged into some games. Imagine a game with near-permadeath, where being dead is a mini game mode.\n\nUpon dying, you come face-to-face with the Grim Reaper. There is a Wheel of Fate with various fates on it. Swipe to spin.\n\nIdeas for wheel options:\n\n* Divine Intervention -- instantly come back to life. The best, rarest outcome.\n* Purgatory -- this character can respawn again in X hours/days\n* Lake of Fire -- this character is forever, permanently dead.\n* Battle of Wits -- play a chess match against Death. Not a whole chess game, maybe a late-game chess puzzle.\n* Battle of Steel -- combat against the Grim Reaper. If you win, you are resurrected.\n* Sell your soul -- someone has paid a pittance for your soul. Now watch this ad to be resurrected. Can you imagine a player being happy/relieved to watch an ad? I find it amusing to break the 4th wall like this and have an ad company directly buy the player's respawn, instead of allowing the player to buy respawns.\n
1458050667|4aik24|a racing game where you're a poltergeist and you have to rig the results by possessing the racers|There are several (ex. 4) racers racing. You're a poltergeist whose relative has a penchant for gambling. Since he's always down on his luck due to his losing bets, you decide to help him. By possessing the drivers to rig the results.\n\nYou can possess the drivers for a limited time. You can do things like steer them wrong way, make them crash into drivers, etc. You could also help them by using boosters, making them fly (using poltergeist powers), shooting other drivers, etc. Anything to rig the results.\n\nThe only problem is that the higher up their rank is, the harder they are to possess, as well as the shorter the possession time. Whoever is currently in 1st place, you simply can't possess them (or maybe really limited time, like 1/2 second). Last place, instant possession if you try, and lasts pretty much a long time. BTW, all the drivers have different levels of AI, to make things more interesting. \n\nThe goal is to have to reach the EXACT rigged results required.

The players are all invisible like in screencheat, and whenever you shoot, your bullet leaves a trail pointing to where you just were. Movement also leaves a trail, but it is much less noticeable.|Maybe operating with a class system also. A tank with a minigun would be very easy to spot, while a scout character would be harder but take fewer hits to kill. Maybe a class that can mark people also with a special item.\n\nThink classes similar to TF2. You don't have to use similar, but it's a good example of how the balancing could work.

1413350766|2jajrv|A first person home invasion survival game.|It would only run for about 15 - 25 minutes. You wake up late at night to the sound of a door opening downstairs. You walk around in darkness, your world illuminated by the moonlight in some windows and your Iphone, if you can get downstairs and find it. You realise that somebody has broken into your house and is in hiding. The invader has shut off the electricity from the basement and locked all the doors and windows leading outside. You could phone the police but that would let the invader know where you are and he can catch you. If he catches you, its possible to fight him by picking up household objects, but he has brute strength so it would be dangerous to do so.
1433711460|38y6ge|Time controlling heist game|The idea is that you control a team of 4 people trying to pull off a heist. The main mechanic is that you are essentially planning a heist, which means that you can go back and change anything. You play by looking at the level from a top down over view. You then choose a character and take control of them in a first person perspective (might be executed in some other ways if you want to scale the game down). At any time, you can jump back to the overview, and take control of another character. You can also go back through the timeline to redo a specific piece of the character's actions. For example, you might try to get a guy in through the main entrance. However, as soon as he gets in, he is spotted by a guard and shot. So you take another character and make him break a window to distract the guard. You then hide the second character and make the first character go through the entrance, this time without getting shot.\n\nThe idea is to make this a sort of puzzle game with multiple solutions. Perhaps there would be rewards for not redoing any paths or for accomplishing side objectives or for doing it in a very short amount of time. What do you guys think?
1448421044|3u60qi|Computer Building Simulator.|There are plenty of simulation games out there now. Some ridiculous and over the top, others pretty interesting. My idea is that there be a game that teaches you the inner workings of a computer. What different parts do, what works and what doesn't, etc.\n\nPerhaps there would be a career mode. At the beginning of each level, you're given specifics on what your customer is looking for in a computer and you're given a limited budget to achieve it. You shop around for computer parts and put together a computer with them. \n\nIt would, in my opinion, be a great learning tool/game.
1433025309|37w8fo|A game with a mechanism where level bosses are created and uploaded by gamers and randomly appear in single player mode of other players as enemies.|
1356827043|15ncs9|A Hide-and-Seek game in which you don't know if you are the hider or the seeker|A game in which each round would last a relatively short while. There are two characters, the human and the monster. Each character is played by two random strangers chosen from a server (like Omegle). Each player is put into one of the roles, but they don't know which they play. There are no differences so that even if they were to look on each other's screens, it would be impossible to tell. The game takes place in a maze, and there is a time counter on the side. The human has to survive as long as they can, and the monster has to catch the human in as short of a time as they can. As the players come closer to each other, they will hear each other's footsteps. This is the whole game. At this point, will the players run away, or rush forward? Being a monster and running away means you take away from your time, and being a human and rushing forward means you could get caught. But once the two meet, it becomes clear as one player looks like a monster and the other a human. After this point, the monster player speeds up, and the human player gets a gun. The gun only has two bullets, and only slows down the monster. Ammo crates appear around the map, which don't reappear after being taken. This means the monster eventually wins, but the point of the game is to see if your choice to run away or rush forward is correct
1409197714|2esih6|I don't think it's particularly plausible... But I had an idea for an RTS based on terraforming|Basically, there would be two factions. One side is natural (which I've been calling the Growth), and the other is industrial, which I've called the Machine. \n\nThe Machine would be industrialized and be the simpler faction. It just focuses on mass production, and in general would have stronger, more numerous units, but very few special abilities. Massed robot infantry, automated tanks and aircraft. I've been thinking of a swarm-style buildings for them. The buildings would be small and slow to produce, but you could build a lot of them very quickly. Maybe a click-and-drag function for placing down multiples at once in a grid format? \n\nTheir defenses would be a turret "wall" of sorts. Place a base, and then click-and-drag to send out a rail as far as you drag with turrets on it. The rail can go out for a long time, but destroying the base will destroy every turret on it. \n\nThe Growth will play a little more conservatively. No refined metals, but stone could be their armor. So their big units could be things like giants. Other units could be things like large birds, predatory hunters, and giant bugs. Their buildings and units, in general, are weaker and less numerous than the Machine, but they have a much wider range of special abilities and access to druidic magic. Climate warfare, healing, etc., would be available to them.\n\nTheir defenses would be more organic. Giant bug nests, pitfalls, and other natural traps. \n\nAnd my biggest idea is the terraforming. Most of the map can start out as a barren wasteland, fit for neither life or machine. Workers from both faction, instead of building or gathering, can work on converting the land for their needs. The Machine could flatten out the land and lay down metal to prevent the Growth from taking it, and the Growth can fertilize the land and plant seeds to slow down the Machine. Buildings can only be built on land that has been terraformed to your side, so you need to expand as quickly as possible to get the resources you need. In order to terraform an area that your enemy has taken, you would have to remove theirs, first. \n\nI also have an idea for terraforming to be used offensively. If you terraform an area with an enemy building on it, you could synthesize that building. All the units that building was able to create can now be built by you, with some differences. The Machine could add parts to the now enslaved Growth to make them stronger and hardier, but move and recharge their abilities slower. The Growth could overgrow into the Machine's creations and take control from there, making them faster, but more fragile. \n\nHow viable is this without a full game studio? I dunno. I don't expect it to ever get made. Just wanted to see what you guys thought of my idea. 
1417503227|2o0wub|You Will Die- A horror game concept|Opening\n---------------------\nNine thirty. You've been working your dead end job at the Stop Shop department store for two months and you're already regretting it, but your shift is up and that's what matters. Or it would be if you hadn't offered to take the night shift to cover for your lazy friend. It's New Year's and everyone in the whole damn store is going home, Christmas music slowly waning as the lights in the store shut off row by row. You grab your PDA and start stacking items on the shelves like the good little robot you are. Now you're here until four in the morning. Asshole.\nBut you're not alone.\nYou hear footsteps and look over to see a person casually strolling down the hall. You start to say something to him, maybe it was the cheerful hello all Stop Shop employees give, maybe you were going to tell him to get the hell out. What matters is that he pulls out a gun and shoots you from twenty feet away. \nWelcome to the game. \nThis man will kill you. The End.\n\nWhy come up with an idea like this?\n--------------------------------------------\nI'm halfway through my Master's Degree in Criminal Forensics and I've always had to deal with the worst of humanity. I've also been thinking about indie horror games lately; they're getting quite a surge of popularity in the last half-decade. With the advent of games as art, I've been thinking that games shouldn't have to be fun to play. They should be an experience. Possibly a painful experience, but something we can learn from. \nYes, I'm trying to distance this from Alien: Isolation. The difference is this can, and has, happened to people. It is... horrifying. It's ungodly. And I wonder if that feeling of helplessness can be captured in a video game, because I'm weird and it's 12AM and I can't sleep now.\n\nWhat is it?\n---------------------\nYWD is a horror survival first-person adventure game that is based around the main character being hunted by a serial killer. There are no weapons in the game, and nothing you can use can suitably incapacitate him. You're just trying to stay alive as long as you can. The game features permadeath, meaning you can't respawn after you are killed, but you can save items in your locker which will make them available after you restart the game.\n\nThe game would involve hiding from, avoiding confrontation with, and outsmarting the serial killer if the situation came to it. \nThe map it takes place in would be small, but easy to memorize and navigate, with backrooms and non-standard heavy equipment. The store would hypothetically be completely interactive. with the ability to pick up and interact with any item, open any box, knock anything over. There wouldn't be a traditional crafting system but any item could be combined superficially, even if it was just wrapping a rope around a carton of eggs. Each item would have different effects in the world, mostly culminating in whether it attracts or distracts the killer. \n\nThere are many preset paths to try to escape, but most of them have risky consequences. You can attempt to go for the office phone and call 911, but that location has no doors beside the way you enter. You can try to run for it, but the freezing snow will likely slow you down. You can try to hide from the killer, but he will smash everything in sight looking for you. In addition, the killer can access any items in the area to counter your actions.\nThe game would not use a health bar or regenerating health, focusing on a Metal Gear Solid 3 approach where you can look down in First Person to see your body, and view injuries, which need to be handled to resume normal operation. A gunshot to the leg, for example, will cause you to hobble while an injury to the head will make you become dazed. There are no medkits, so you have to scavenge from the store to heal yourself, with items being freely applied due to the completely interactive store design. \nFinally, you have to memorize the killer as well. How many bullets in his gun, the reach of his knife, his overwhelming strength in comparison to yours, his attentiveness to certain areas and what he'll be expecting to look for. Use his knowledge against him.\n\nEveryone dies. \nBut not everyone lives.\nHave fun.
1448344345|3u1myw|Slippery Slope: The Game! (Potentially NSFW, depending on the work, I guess. Not sure, really.)|My apologies if this isn't the right place for this. Seems like the closest match, but there might not actually be a right place for this. I also don't know if it's been suggested before, because I have no idea what to enter in the search box to check.\n\nThe concept is about as politically correct as Cards Against Humanity...\n\n---\n\nI was on Facebook, reading the comments on an article like a true masochist, and I came across a comment claiming abortion will lead to cultural destruction, because immigrants. No further details were given. And then I got this idea, because sometimes I'm very lonely.\n\nThe core premise of the game is to come up with Insane Troll Logic, as it's described on TvTropes, and from there, so many possibilities.\n\nI immediately thought of this party game I played, back when I got invited to parties. Everyone would write a sentence on a piece of paper, and then pass that paper to the person next to them, who'd have to draw that sentence. Then, that person would fold the paper so as to hide the original sentence, and then pass it to the next person, who'd have to describe the drawing in a sentence, and who would then further fold the paper so as to hide the drawing, etc. \nSo my first idea was a variant of that idea, except that instead of interpreting drawings or illustrating sentences, you'd start with a vaguely controversial premise, and each player would add one level of ridiculous cause-and-effect, with knowledge only of the previous layer. \n\n(Player 1: X. Player 2: If X, then Y. Hides 'X'. Player 3: If Y, then Z. Hides 'Y'. And so on...)\n\n\nAnd then I thought of game variants, because my brain won't leave me alone.\n\nYou could have a variant that's a bastardized version of the Wikipedia game, where two or more players are given an initial premise, a disastrous ultimate consequence, and the winner is either whoever completes it quickest or whoever does it in the fewest layers of ridiculous Slippery Slope arguments as possible.\n\nIn either version, the additional layers have to follow from each other, even if the logic involved is patently false. Purely random statements wouldn't be permitted.\n\n(Permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, children would grow up thinking shirts are invariably optional, which would lead to medical personnel not wearing tops to work, which would lead to more botched surgeries due to surgeon distraction, which would lead to a massive upswing in medical malpractice suits, which means most hospitals would be forced to close, meaning more people will die during childbirth because the nearest hospital is too far away.\nAllowing naked female breasts in PG-13 movies will cause tragic, preventable deaths of newborns.'\n\nNot permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, movies as a medium would cease to exist, which would cause supermarkets to hike up food prices by 3000%, because Batman.'\n\nSo, yeah... No good way to end this post, really... My apologies again if I'm in the wrong place, which is entirely likely, or if I've broken scads of subreddit rules, which I don't think I have, but I could easily be wrong.

1458362188|4b1tnn|Robot survival game|Basically, my idea is for a survival game where you play not as a human, but as a robot. You'd still have core survival elements under new headings (energy as opposed to food, oil as opposed to water), but would allow for customization to a greater degree than most survival games, and would allow for more a level playing field PVP-style.  \nFor example, robots can be upgraded, replace parts, download programs in ways humans cannot. You'd have the standard ability increases like faster move speed, increase carrying capacity, but you could have more extreme ones that wouldn't work with humans. You can have your character 'download' a program to, say, double jump or find and install an extra arm, letting characters to be much more varied then there are in survival games right now, which are mostly gear-dependent.  \nRobots also allow for a more level playing field in PVP, since most (read: pretty much every single survival PVP-game) starts off at caveman tech and escalates to current level. So you end up with five guys with bows going against one guy with a semi-automatic rifle; odds are, the one guy wins. On the other hand, robots could start off at our current level (or near enough), and upgrade to future tech, thus, you end up with five robots with Uzi's going against one guy with a plasma cannon. The plasma cannon guy still has an advantage, but the difference between the two groups is less extreme, sort of like the difference between level 1 and level 10, and level 51 and 60.  \nMy idea for a 'robot survival game', I feel, still embraces the core concepts that make survival games enjoyable while expanding on others  and attempting to fix common problems that crop in survival games. If you have any questions, go ahead and leave a comment. 
1424276286|2wbnbb|An Oculus Rift game: Zombie survival.Your character is in a wheel chair.|I've been playing Killer 7 on the PS2 and I think it's sweet that one of the main characters is in a wheel chair. It reminded me of an interview with Cliff Bleszinski where he was talking about the Rift being utilized for seated simulation (flight, racing etc).\n\nI love that concept. The Rift is cool with games like Skyrim and Half Life but not being able to move around kind of breaks the illusion. Someday....someone will make an omni directional treadmill...but in the meantime...why not limit the characters mobility?\n\nI'm imagining a survival horror game with light to medium action. I don't have many ideas beyond the initial concept. I just think it would be super immersive given the technology that is currently available. \n\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\n**Disclaimer:** Beginner post. I did a limited search and didn't find anything...if I missed this idea in another thread...whoops?
1386651406|1six2g|"The Most Dangerous Game"|I have a simple idea: A game based on the short story "The Most Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell. \n     A short summary: a ship-wrecked man is on an island meets a hunter who has decided that animals are boring and would rather hunt another human and gives the man a knife and a three hour head start, and the hunt begins. I won't spoil the story for those who have not read it. \n   \n     Game play\nOverview: a survival game of wit with a focus of survival and hunting skills between two humans on oppose ends. A cold and calculating hunter methodically selecting his equipment, and a primal beast pushed to his limits to try and survive. A game that will leaving you questioning who is truly the prey.\n\nHunter: you select your equipment load out and focus on the hunt, specifically tracking your prey and trying to kill them. The hunter would have to wait a set amount of time to let the prey get a head start. While the hunter is waiting they will be given the equipment load out selection which will change every match to force different hunting strategies. \n\nPrey: you have the same limited equipment each time and focus on evasion and deception, with the ability to create traps to try and kill or immobilize the hunter to allow for your escape. \n\nMap: a forested island with rivers, cliffs, ravines, quicksand, etc.\n\nMy view: Gamers have wanted a survival game for a long time, but the problem has been that the pressure to survive wasn't there. With this format the prey will always have to be a step ahead, and the hunter will always be hot on the trail. The hunter must proceed with caution though because at any moment the tables could be turned.\n\nLet's get this conversation started!\n\nP.S. This is my first post, my days of lurking are finally over.\n
1445465425|3poxrm|Post WW3 survival game that turns into a nation builder|So, stay with me on this, you start out alone in a barren wasteland. If you're careful enough, you slowly get equipment, find companions, fight mutants and rival humans for resources, and do quests for people a la Fallout. Eventually, you get to a point in which you decide to spread your influence and bring stability back to this chaotic land. As you continue along your adventure, your choices will decide the fate of your newly declared nation. Will you try to create a democracy or dictatorship? What of the issue of slavery or the rights of woman in your land, among others. Do you wish to continue to move as nomads or find a place to remain as an isolated state? The balance of power among people, especially those who helped form your nation, matter. Of course, you'll be able to continue to do all the things you did before becoming a founding father/mother, but on a much grander scale, with entire armies taking part!\n\nSo, what do you all think?
1441213607|3jdo90|Two People, One Bullet. An Arena Based Shooter|Enter an arena comprised of smooth white walls and floors. The arena's floor is a 400m x 200m region of large cubes on a grid. Carved into the landscape is a flat road that connects the spawn locations, various upgrades and turret camps. On the other side of the arena your enemy has spawned. You have to navigate this labyrinth by soaring over it or running through it, collecting any upgrades and hacking turret towers until you find the enemy.\n\nYou're equipped with rocket boots for massive jumps and wall running, and your gun. Your gun is a single shot large calibre plasma rifle. When fired, the large neon bullet will continue bouncing throughout the environment until you catch it again.\n\nThe bullets also have another function. They can be grappled to. If you are within sight and range of your bullet you can right click it, stopping the bullet and slinging your character to it.\n\nedit: The title may be misleading, you both have your own bullet, but only one.
1446962824|3rz9y8|A PC multiplayer game where you evacuate massive amounts of civilians from a disaster in the city.|What I mean by this post is something like the interaction/navegation of an unstable environment in a PVP match. \n\nOne example is a gametype thought up in my head 10 minutes ago called "Evacuation". This is borrowed somewhat from counter-strike, metal gear and titanfall but expanded. It has a near-futuristic setting and basically, you are supposed to evacuate as many civilians as you can (There could be hundreds or thousands of them) in a city from an impending disaster. However a team of terrorists are slaughtering the civilians. Defenders gain points for evacuation and attackers gain points for massacres and bonus points for killing defenders.\nHere's the twist: Each player only has one life, so that puts both sides on edge and forces them to think of a strategy. \nAlso there is no radar or anything, forcing players to rely on high places to spot enemies since you have thruster packs that you can climb up buildings and wall-jump, isolating players from the action below and engaging them in dogfights with the bad guys. \n\nIf any player dies they can provide air support by providing ammo, spotting enemies and deploying evacuation vehicles so they can have something to do while they wait.\n\nAs for the chaotic elements, weather is a powerful force. A hurricane can brush through the city, forming a flood and putting people's lives at risk, forcing defenders to prioritize them. If a certain amount of civilians are not saved during these events then defenders lose. \n\nThe Hurricane itself provides for an excellent visual effect. You can see the cloud looming from a distance and slowly approaching the horizon with gradual intensity. Then floods occur and windspeeds prevent you from jetpacking correctly and all the rainfall doesn't let you see a thing. \nThe maps also have a day-time progression system, meaning the day shifts to night and vise-versa since the time is set at random. You could be in the eye of the hurricane, completely safe, watching the crescent moon in the center looking down on you. Or see the sun in the same fashion. \nTsunamis, Sandstorms and Supercells (Tornadoes) are also a thing to watch out for. As these things are completely sporadic. \nYou could have an entire match without weather or you could have the whole match with a flood. You could also see a disaster in the distance and feel uneasy because it may or may not ever approach the city.\n\nA crucial part of the dramatic element is the lighting (Sharp shadows) and the expressions of the civilians themselves and what they go through. The civilians should have deeply expressive feelings of dismay, sorrow and should move and respond to disaster in a very convincing light, much like Elizabeth from bioshock infinite. They should all look distinguished not only in looks but in how they move, their moods and their unpredictability. \n\nYou as a defender are supposed to guide them. You simply tell them to stop or move on command. But whether or not they listen to you depends on their level of panic. Some may listen, others may fight other civilians for safety (In which case you gotta stun them and carry them) and others may actually help you by spotting terrorists or giving you weapons and ammo scavenged on the city or evacuating more civilians while you focus on the terrorists (The volunteers' deaths are not penalized) a worst case scenario would be for a riot to form, which would jeopardize the mission. On the flipside, they could also turn on you and spot you, use weapons against you (Or the surrounding population in a frenzy) and attacking volunteers and taking away their weapons to give to terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists, on the other hand, must kill as many civilians as possible, but there are so many so you can't kill everyone. Instead, you gotta kill and cause as much panic as possible like using bombs, destroying buildings, killing defenders guiding civilians, killing groups of people, blocking passages with their presence to make them run the other way (Or worse, in circles) stagnate them during disasters (Players can die from these too) and killing volunteers and evac vehicles.\n\nA quick trade-off when it comes to dying is that the more players die, the more weapons are supplied on the battlefield due to dead players. There is more support, so the gameplay balances itself out. However disasters can affect dead players as well because they can block satellite vision, misplace supplies (Strong Wind) among other things. This is also balanced out by funds that air support gains depending on the actions of both teams on the ground. That way, air support has to coordinate, sort through options and choose what to deploy in order to make ends meet.\n\nThere would also be a ranking system in place, allowing more skilled players to play against each other and gradually allow for a competitive environment to form without taking away the dramatic tone that players feel. \n\nThe deaths of the civilians should be emphasized. They are the core of the gameplay, so the civilians should cry upon seeing a randomly assigned relative dead with varying lines, expressions and reactions (rage, fear, sorrow, compassion, revenge, ambiguous etc.) and each should have their own unique identity, complete with names they tell each other. You should feel the despair they go through upon seeing bodies floating on the water, burned to ashes, dismembered, shot, etc.\nAnother facet to this would be to see their emotional reactions to being rescued and evacuated. You will see some crying from joy, you would see some reluctant, you would see some rushing to the vehicle or begging to be taken while they are left behind. There would be some who feel safe and comfortable while others feel confused or angry. You would have to take them in one-by-one to add to the immersion that you are saving REAL PEOPLE. And sometimes that could be as easy as letting them walk in or you would have to carry the wounded (bonus points) or you would grab someone by the hand and pull them in (raising morale) or you would have to struggle as you force someone inside against his will. \nCarving convincing individual identities on a mass scale can be achieved by crowdsourcing people from the internet and having them express the lines and names of civilians on the game to make the civilians more fleshed out and dynamic. Having hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of volunteers providing voice acting material could help provide an attachment to the civilians. \n\nAs for the terrorists, stealth is key for two reasons: \n-1 avoid detection by defenders.\n-2 Sporadic attacks are more frightening, which raises panic.\n\nThe mood of the civilians should not be illustrated on a panic meter (damages immersion) it should be detectable on the reactions of the civilians. Also, not everyone will realize what just happened. A group of people in a city could be oblivious to an explosion that murdered 10 people 5 blocks away. And the way this information is transferred also varies. Some civilians notify the ocurrence while others just flee from the crowd that is stampeding towards them. \n\nWhen nothing is ocurring, and it can happen at any point in the game, people are seen doing every day things. It is at this point when the defenders should be careful to preserve the peace as much as possible (REALLY HIGH BONUS POINTS) so any sort of fighting is going to attract attention and raise tension, but when disaster strikes people will be more desensitized to such things. \n\nThe eventual first encounter between defenders and terrorists should be a BIG DEAL. So much so that time should slow down for like 3 seconds while you hear a heartbeat, symbolizing a change of pace in gameplay and initiating a new phase in the conflict. its no longer terrorists killing people, they are also engaging Defenders and a new layer of chaos is added. Now they will focus on each other until disaster strikes. And when it does a third layer initiates. The final layer would be the population sinking into a riot, creating a hell-on-Earth scenario that is almost impossible to stop, only mitigate as much as possible.\n\nThe goal here is to at all costs NOT make the civilians seem disposable or cumbersome. They should enrich the multiplayer experience, not take away from it. \n\nThis game idea is way too big, and is very focused on complex A.I. programming and acting, but maybe you can take some bits and pieces and make something out of it. 
1428761658|328c6x|Two See.|It was an odd idea. One that I'd been coming up with. \n\nIn this world, there are two children, or people.\n\nOne can see Blue light, the other can see Red, but nothing more.\n(Co-op is required here different screens, oculus whathaveyou.)\n\nThere are lights of each color around, and they must guide eachother. I wanted crawling, walking, and running. However, pressing shift, either one can, if they are near, grab the hand of the other. Leading one another through dangerous areas that only one person can see. (Think ico, but co-op.)\n\nFor a twist, I thought if each character was coloured differently and had a torch of the others' light, they would never see eachother, only their beams.\n\nI may not have thought this through enough, but what do you think?

1386185326|1s3ku3|A mech game where the first player pilots on a console and additional players use tablets or smart phones to provide maintenance.|I've been thinking a lot lately about games that focus on connecting ~~hardcore and casual players~~ fans of different genres of games and games that rely heavily on cooperation and putting groups of people in individual roles.\n\nThis idea is kind  of vague but it would basically be a game where the first player would play the game via a console or PC in the traditional way, using a controller and viewing gameplay through a TV or monitor. This player would pilot a mech or other vehicle, fighting AI enemies or perhaps other human opponents. Controls would be typical for a mech shooter.\n\nAdditional players would serve as the mech's engineering and maintenance crew and perform their duties by downloading an app to their smartphones and tablets. This app would link to the main game and would have several different screens and panels, each serving a different purpose and representing a different control panel for the mech. Each control panel would have a different set of puzzle and minigames to perform to provide the mech with better efficiency. Depending on how many additional players there are, each player can cover a certain control panel and divy out maintenence responsibilities. \n\nFor example, a person playing the engineering panel would operate a series of switches and play a rewiring minigame to divert power to whichever weapons system the pilot was using as a priority. The player on the navigational panel would view a sonar map and mark out enemies, which would then be marked on the pilot's screen so he wouldn't be ambushed. A player could act as a "maintenanceperson," switching between panels and putting out electrical fires when the mech takes damage, therefore minimizing the threat of the mech's destruction. \n\nThe HUD of the pilot would be minimal and the pilot would have to communicate with his crew to keep a gauge on health and ammo supply, as those details would only appear on certain screens of the maintenance players' tablets. In fact, communication all around would be key to the team's victory, providing an immersive experience to a team that works well together. In this game, teamwork trumps individual skill.\n\nPVP could rise to a tournament and championship level, pitting the best crews in the world against each other.
1363582745|1aib7o|A Game About The Butterfly Effect|Ideally this would be made with a visually stunning engine. Mechanics would be simple, you mostly just walk/run places and make decisions on everything. But everything you do matters.\n\nIt would begin with you waking up as a high schooler and needing to walk to school in the winter. HUD prompts (or possibly audio directions from the character) would tell the player where to go and if they decided not to then they could within reason. It wouldn't be a totally open world game, it would be a very detailed small game.\n\nSo let's say that instead of walking to school the player decides to run circles in the snow because the particle effect is really cool. Unfortunately, because of this they don't reach the a street with a crosswalk on time and don't press the pedestrian walk button, so a car crash occurs.\n\nThen you would wake up as a man in his forties working a desk job. maybe the player doesn't put a jacket on, so the character drops his keys because his hands are shaking, pushing back the time it takes to get him to the crosswalk, aiding in preventing the crash.\n\nIf it were as good as it could be you would simply go from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning with a bunch of different characters, each impacting the scene in a small way. You job as a player is to clean up your mess hat you made with the previous character.\n\nAnother great thing about this would be DLC galore, adding new characters could be done easily, making it a huge game over the course of a couple years.\n\nTL;DR: You have to clean up your own mess with different characters.
1383733139|1q0nlq|Frequency - A radio based RTS|Hey,    \nThis is just an idea I had bobbing around. I don't have the skills to make it, but hey, maybe I'll learn me some programming :p    \n    \nAnyway, the idea is based around a stripped down RTS based around orders for units taking time to transmit and recieve. Not a long time, but worst case scenario up to 30-40 seconds for a long distance secure order to reach a unit.    \n    \nSo when you give a unit a move/attack/whatever order it takes time for that order to propagate through your comms network so the unit can act on it.    \n    \nThere would be three main units:    \nBase - Large transmission radius. High defensive bonus for stationed troops    \nComms Station - Used to increase transmission range. Provides slight defensive bonus for stationed troops    \nTroops - Short transmission distance. Your fighting soldiers! These can recieve orders either direct from your base or via a comms station or via a nearby unit's radio.     \n\nThe key to the game is managing your communications infrastructure. \nYour base is the origin point of all your transmissions. If a unit is outside of your transmission range, they CANNOT act on any orders given. They will attempt to complete previously issued orders, or otherwise hold position. To receive an order the unit must be within the transmission range of the sending station (the unit's own transmission range does not matter when receiving). So for example, an order would originate from your base, bounce through a couple of comms stations, and then reach your unit.    \n\nThere are three speeds of radio transmission:    \nHardlink - used between a base and a comms station - very fast, secure    \nBuilding - Transmission from a base or comms station to a unit. Moderate speed, can be secure or unsecure (see below)    \nUnit - Troops can relay orders through their own radio sets to other troops. This is slow and always unsecure, and as such is not ideal. Try to keep your units in radio range of a building!     \n    \nTypes of communication:    \nSecure - Slower speed transmission, cannot be jammed, cannot be intercepted    \nUnsecure - Used using a shift or alt key command. 3x as fast as a secure transmission, but succeptable to jamming, and if an enemy unit is within your transmission range the enemy will see the order you gave your units! This can lead to some clever rusing - Send an unsecure order, followed by a secure order. Your enemy won't know the secure order has been sent and may still think your unit is following the unsecure order.    \n    \nAnyway, that's my ramblings for now. I might add more to it later.
1382503460|1p13zj|A new kind of apocalypse game.|So this game would take place before AND after the apocalypse. The first stage of the game is where you try to find food, water, shelter, maybe even companions, and whatever else you may need. \n\nThen strikes the apocalypse. This could be a randomly generated kind of apocalypse, like a nuclear fallout, zombies, the sun going out, etc. The cool thing about this mechanic would be that you would need to be prepared for anything and everything. Here's an example: \n\nSo you get into the game and immediately start gathering weaponry. You think that the worst thing possible could be the zombie apocalypse. So, it is a couple of nights later and you have this base full of weapons, food, and water. You think you have this whole apocalypse thing under control. Then, the apocalypse strikes. The temperature outside starts to drop down below freezing. You realize that an ice age has struck, and all you have is guns to defend you against the brutal cold. \n\nI don't have an idea for an endgame yet, maybe you need to survive a certain amount of days in the apocalypse or complete a list of goals. 
1437712418|3eer6i|Ready, set, Die!!|It's a "sandbox"/physics multiplayer game where you and your friends compete to kill yourselves in the most spectacular manner.    \nYou could run and jump directly into the wall until you eventually die, or strap an explosive to your head, light yourself on fire, jump out of the window, &amp; aim for an expensive car! The map provides all the physics based items to do this with and scores players on how spectacularly they "clock out" in 60 seconds.    \nIt's a very simple concept, very simple design, but it's gives the community map making tools, reputations like "psycho" or "mundane" based on their history, and it would be loads of fun and laughter for anyone who wants to sit for a quick game or two, or three.    \nWhat little features would you add? 
1423366356|2v5qcg|Personal thoughts on submitting Game Ideas|Hey guys, new to this sub-reddit. I am a student studying Software Engineering (Game programming) and am just starting my third year. Often during the holidays, when I finish work early or I am just bored, I work on hobby projects. I have experience with Android, c++, c#, Unity etc.. I often just make little puzzle games or test out mechanics and ideas that I have. I have found myself more and more trying to get inspiration from external sources, such as this sub-reddit. As a programmer I would just like to shed some light on your submissions. I am well aware that this sub-reddit is for ideas people aren't going to make themselves (and most likely no-one will) but no-one submits ideas for nothing. What I recommend to you all is to have a little look into game design documents and how to properly submit an idea. Almost every idea on here is too complex to make, not detailed enough and clearly not enough thought has been put into it being an actual game. I love taking ideas and inspiration from what I read, but if you guys really want results or more interest with your ideas, you should spend some time thinking how practical the idea is, and maybe just simplifying the whole idea down to a few main base mechanics. After all, this is how most unique games are developed. Keep the ideas coming, it really is interesting and useful hearing what people come up with! \n\nThanks for reading my criticism. No offence is intended to anyone, only to help increase the quality of the submissions on here and to help you guys think more on the lines of how games are actually developed etc.. \n\n-- PantherNZ
1431660430|360tlv|Lonely|A random game concept that I just thought up. In the game, you play as the typical RPG hero, except that none of the NPCs will interact with the player. This means the player can only gain information by listening in on conversations between NPCs. The player cannot buy anything, and if the player is pursued into the village by monsters, it is possible to die in the village with villagers looking on. So, instead of the player character being widely known and famous, the player is a humble and reclusive character who simply slays monsters, overhears about the threat of the big baddie from some of the villagers, and simply slays the monster as much for his own survival as much as the survival of everyone else.\n\nI hope that this unconventional take on the classic RPG will serve as a good/bad example for other developers to follow/use as a cautionary tale; I really don't know how the game will turn out, but if there's a developer out there that has experience making RPGs and is looking for an idea for a small project, please do consider making a first version of this game (hey, it's fine to do ascii graphics!)

1441852261|3kc7l1|Color blind|So you start off only seeing white. You have a narrarator, he tells you where you are, what to do and some other random stuff. He guides you along your way until he says somrthing like "Oh no, they've found me.. There's sonething I need to tell you, there IS A WAY TO GET-" *cuts off* So now you're alone, but you see something in the distance. Its some yellow jewel. You get closer and touch it. Now you can see yellow. Maybe yellow flowers, the sun, bananas, and other stuff you'd see around. At this point the game would look weird because there would be random yellow stuff that looks as if its floating around, After a bit more exploring, you would find your next jewel, blue. Now you see the sky, and water, and everything thats blue. And then red would be last for the first chapter. (first chapter would be the primary chapter) The next chapter would be the secondary chapter with all the secondary colors, and then the third chapter would probably have some other colors like brown.\n\nSo you're happy now, you can finally see the world. But then darkness fills your screen, until all you see is black. Thats pretty much all I've thought of so far. If you have any ideas or like it, then pleas post below. Thanks

1443242846|3mfg8s|Turn On The Lights - A Horror Concept|So the basic premise of this game combines typical horror elements with a focus on knowing what you are facing and where it is. You are tasked with the morning shift in an empty factory, and your first task is to turn on all the lights before the other workers arrive. To do this, the player must find switches using faint light pouring in from adjacent rooms already completed. The first room will already be lit when the player starts. The morning shift worker's job is to rid the factory of pests, monsters, and other horrible entities that come out during the night and remain as long as there is darkness in the factory.\n\nIf there is a monster in a room, the player will be able to hear it breathing even in darkness, and will be able to see its silhouette if it is exposed to light from an adjacent room. Some monsters flee into adjacent rooms when the lights are turned on, some will vanish entirely. Monsters which flee into nearby rooms will also vanish when all the rooms around them are already lit. However, some monsters will attack the player when the lights turn on. Monsters which flee or vanish will attack the player if touched in darkness. Monsters which attack when the room is lit will vanish when touched. The player must use the silhouette and sound of the monster to determine what kind it is (each kind will have a distinctive shape and a different trait to its breathing).\n\nIn summary, there are three kinds of monsters: when lights are turned on, one kind flees, one kind vanishes, and one kind attacks. But the former two attack when touched, while the latter vanishes. The player must decide whether to approach the monster or turn on the lights. Choosing correctly will remove the monster at least from the room. Choosing wrongly will result in the player being attacked and/or jumpscared (have not decided if I want that to be a part of the attack).\n\nCan't think of any ways to elaborate on this idea now but I know there are ways it could be improved.

I know it would probably be used mostly for profanities and other various inappropriate banter, but the thought amused me when I went over the many possible ideas which could be recorded, from music parts like "Rick Rolled", to "Gibberish nade" grumbling at you while flying overhead. An entertaining little device that I thought I could throw out there for anyone who thinks similarly and has greater means to actually use the idea.

1433790754|392bst|Solar powered rover exploration game|This game would be a 2D scrolling platformer game. Think a game mainly about exploration, maybe in the general style of Super Metroid but less combat.\n\nThe gimmick is that you are a solar powered rover (science bot on wheels) on a strange alien planet. Just below the surface is an intricate, dark cave system waiting to be explored (for science? for treasure?). \n\nMoving drains a little power. Drilling takes more power. You have few defenses against local creatures. If you run out of battery power stuck somewhere in the dark, it's game over (permadeath, or restart at the last point you had full batteries). So you must carefully conserve your battery reserves, and exploration becomes a risk/reward before you have to retreat back to safety.\n\nPart of exploring the planet is making sure you have a route back to the surface to regain power from the Sun. Sometimes you'll encounter (or drill) shafts of light to recharge in the middle of dark areas. You'll harvest batteries from other failed rovers and use them to go even deeper into the cavern depths.\n\nTL;DR: Metroid minus combat, plus solar powered.

Heavens no, because that clearly isn't the sole purpose of this subreddit! \n\nThis subreddit is just chock full of game programmers, sound artists, and concept artists at your disposal! Why just write down the idea when you can have someone else make it for you? You should just make a new text post recruiting us to team up with you. Because we are absolutely, 100% willing to work for a complete stranger that has both zero programming experience and absolutely no team or time management experience ***FOR FREE!***\n\nYes, you heard right! We don't want to make a single dime off of our hard work and dedication towards the game idea some stranger on the internet had and recruited us to make. We're all somewhere in our 20's and 30's and have absolutely no food/electricity/water bills or crippling student loan debts, so we have absolutely no problem volunteering and devoting our precious time to *your* video game idea! After all, volunteer experience for another person's selfish endeavors is the most valuable thing you can do with your time asides from a stable job that actually pays money!\n\nSince we all want to work for free, we can also assume that you are an excellent team leader! Remember that one time in high school where you were assigned to lead a bunch of kids to glue facts about the Bill of Rights to a piece of cardboard for your History project?

This came to me in a dream.\nIt's a first person game where you find yourself in a mid sized map, such as a state fair or something. Huge crowds. Most people are AI but lets say about 10 or 15 people are real players. One player is a serial killer. All the players can work together to evade the killer or turn on each other. Some players might get randomly selected traits, such as being a parent. This would mean they would have to hold the hand of a child all the time. The other players might be morally swayed by the safety of the child. Basically in the dream I had, me and some other players where on a low bride over a state fair. The bride had a crate lift that took about a minute to lower a family needed to be raised up, but the killer was in a car about 30 seconds away from the bridge, so the family might get saved but it could mean letting the killer on the bridge. I think it would be very cool, but 3D games are not my area of programming expertise. let me know what you guys think. 
1429930381|33s7er|Save the Light|Light has gone from the universe, and it's up to you to find out why.\nGame starts out almost entirely pitch black, until you remember your cell phone light.  \nFlash! The world illuminates, almost blinding you.  \nAlmost immediately, you cell phone light starts darkening, leaving the room only lightly outlined from far away.  \n\n  I envision Save the Light to be a strategy adventure game where light is a tool, weapon, and limited resource.  \nMid-game, the roles are reversed as Light takes revenge on Dark, leaving the screen blindingly white. Story moves towards an understanding that both Light and Dark have roles to play.  \n  \n  During Dark, story characters are affected by a sense of hopeless despair and become very destructive. During Light, Characters become  giddy with mania, over optimistically attempting to achieve their wildest dreams.   \nScattered around are various objects that produce light (later darkness) but only last so long and with so much effectiveness. Obtaining and properly rationing Light will allow players to view and unlock marvelous storytelling elements in addition to optional side quests.  \nOne possible way to ration light would be Flash and "feel" you way through the room with surround sound. Game controller would have vibrations to correspond left right or front.
1450163378|3wwscw|Had a game idea while watching Grave Encounters : horror|
1372318252|1h5zju|My game idea!|I've heard about augmented reality games, and recently I was thinking about when I was a kid and I would be in the car and I used to look out the window and put my hand next to it and pretend my hand was a little man who was jumping and dodging things, and I heard that I wasn't the only one who did this as a kid. So basically I was wondering if a game like this exists only where you can point your phone camera outside of a car and you can actually control a virtual character and make it into a proper game? I don't know if a game like this exists but I think it would be a cool idea. \n\nWould love to hear feedback. :D
1437238449|3dr0ia|A quirky game about an old man obsessed with his lawn.|\nIn a quiet small town neighborhood, old man McGoober just wants to be left alone with his beautiful grass ...and for kids to stop writing the word "gobbler" at the end of his name on his mailbox. \n You, Mr. McGoober, must shower the lawn with a nozzled water hose, evenly as possible, trying not to swamp certain areas or neglect others. The grass will grow at the rate of having to be cut once a week, at which time you'll get a weekly score for how well you've done based on how straight you pushed the mower, yard cleanliness (you didn't just mow over a styrofoam cup did you?), and how evenly you watered the lawn will show at this time too. This is an indication of how satisfied old-loony-goober is (as the local kids call him). The thing is: people just can't stay the hell off your lawn! Occasionally, some punk kid will try to ride his bike through your yard and cut dirt tracks across your grassy domain. Whack him with your trusty cane when he makes a 2nd pass and show him how you earned your psycho rep among the neighborhood kids. Your stupid neighbors stupid dog is also taking a healthy dump on the wrong side of Goober territory and it's the same one that frequently urinates on the mailbox. Grab the newspaper and throw it like a curve ball to his face before the old mans irritation meter hits a boiling g point. Between the mailman taking shortcuts through your grass, thru traffic throwing trash out the window, and local teens flinging rolls of toilet paper over your fence, your irritation meter is the thing to watch. If it boils over, I'm afraid old Goober will have to be committed and all is lost. Your weekly retreat to your lawn mower is your salvation. Cleaning the yard, tidying up, good watering, and an even cut all increase your satisfaction meter which reduces your irritation level in direct proportion. Every couple of weeks it seems like another damned holiday to spice things up. Here you can make little decisions. It's Halloween, so you embrace it and hand out candy but run the risk of trick-or-treaters trampling your grass, or disown the occasion but risk upsetting neighborhood kids to the point that they give you even more hell than usual? What's the end game? The ultimate goal is to keep a lawn that's so nice, so consistently, that your neighbor across the street, Mr. Pecker gets so jealous that he moves away. Don't worry, the kids like to write the word "checker" at the end of his name too, just to keep things on an even keel. As a bonus (the game has day/night cycles) McGoober may every once in a while sneak across the street under the cover of night to litter Pecker's lawn, dump some bagged dog poop, or turn his push mower upside down so that Pecker can't cut his grass this week. Just don't get caught because that's the quickest way for loony Goober to get thrown in the loony house! But, all these things make you, Old-Goob, feel better and lowers stress. This will also speed up Old Wrinkly Pecker getting jealous and beating it out of there. That's the basic idea of it. It's a fun, quirky game for an Indie developer and completely original. Show me some criticism guys!
1422822867|2ufvso|Who wants to play a generic dispensable NPC?|Think of any action video game where generic NPCs are slaughtered just because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (examples: the first level of Halo, the beginning of Skyrim). Do you ever feel bad about them? Of course not! We always control the main character, the hero that always make it out alive. What if we weren't?\n\nImagine a game where the player controls the numerous generic dispensable characters and has the sole objective of trying to get them out of some doomed area alive.\n\nFirst the player chooses the setting of the crisis. Is the tragedy happening in a city, a skyscraper, a sinking vessel, a spaceship, a forest, a haunted mansion...? Is the danger an asteroid, an alien invasion, an outbreak of giant bloodthirsty monsters, a volcanic eruption, a zombie apocalypse...? Once the player has chosen the setting, the game generates it and the player tries to save as many lives as possible by controlling the characters, one by one and from a first person's perspective, and leading them out of the danger zone.\n\nObviously the odds of survival would be low. All of the hazards and baddie attacks would be OHKO's. Some characters in some settings, like soldiers and policemen, could have weapons, but their effectiveness would be close to null. Whenever a controlled character is lead to safety or dies, the player gets to control another one.\n\nThe player would have two perspectives of the game. When the game starts and between characters, the player would have an overhead view of the map. He can't control anything from there, but he can spot the exits and dangers. When ready, the player is given control of a randomly selected character with a first person view and no minimap until the character is either safe of dead.\n\nTo spice things up, the game could also feature "heroes", characters that are guaranteed to survive. The player could choose to follow those  "protagonists" for better odds of survival. But do the NPCs that tail the heroes in video games always make it? Nope, and this game wouldn't be different. Thought he could try to lead other characters to safety, the player would obviously never get to control one of those designated heroes.\n\nSo what do you think of my game idea? This is the first time I've ever posted something on the internet. If anyone likes my gimmicky ideas, I have plenty more to share.

1424456026|2wkkjm|Weird Physics FPS|The idea is have physics weapons in a first person shooter. You can shoot positive/negative gravity items that stick to the wall and influence the gravity of all players. The gravity can further be animated, meaning fluctuating intensity or also rotational fields. You can further shoot positive/negative gravitational bombs/rockets/grenades that bounce off. Also additional gravitational animations/static gravity can be encoded in the level geometry, enabling to walk up the wall at certain points or walk on the ceiling. 
1448127211|3tpof7|A silly, rather rage inducing simulator (Surgeon Simulator like, I suppose).|It might not be something anyone wants to make or play, but I thought I'd put it out there. (Disclaimer: I don't code and I'm going off my husband's suggestion for a flair. I'm sorry if it's not accurate.)\n\nGet Your Kids Ready to Play in the Snow\n\nObjectives: Get your (two) fully dressed kids outside. This requires them to be wearing: pants, shirt, socks, coat, snow pants, gloves, hat, and boots.\n\nThe challenging part: They start off with pants, shirt, and socks on, but that may not always be so. The little one may decide that pants are not for him and he'd rather run away and hide behind the door with one of the older one's boots while you try to get the older one to keep his damn gloves on. Once you finally find the little one and get his pants on, the older one doesn't think he needs a coat anymore and a shirt will be just fine. Why doesn't the little one's left boot fit on? Well, you might need to check and see if there's a toy in it. (Or maybe it's a live octopus or a life-sized bike, I don't know, it's a ridiculous game.)\n\nThe children don't talk (maybe they laugh at you mockingly; "ha ha, you can't get me!"), the controls aren't great, and I figure it'd be funniest if you could accidentally KO the kids or something. (For example, lift the little one's foot up too fast in an attempt to get his boots on and you accidentally make him slam his head against the wall. Or zip up a coat without being aware of where your other hand is and now you're missing some fingers.) Like I said in the title, think Surgeon Simulator.
1440622610|3iiiia|A Game Narrated as if it were a YouTube video|The game could be of any type. I had a platformer in mind but I think it could translate well to more than that.\n\nThere would be no in game dialogue (characters talking to each other) rather everything would be explained and voiced over as if it were someone playing the game in one of those 'let's play...' type series or like they were streaming.\n\nThey could give hints if you get stuck in certain places. "Someone in chat explained that this puzzle can be solved by doing _______ " or something to that effect. \n\nIf you went with someone streaming the game you could implement the streams chat and viewers. Some sort of entertainment meter that if you fill you get more viewers who will help you with more hints, etc. Have a bank of comments that have % chance of being made when doing X or Y in the game. Taking over a minute to solve a puzzle, increased chance to get a hint by a commenter depending on number of viewers and how much time has passed. \n\nIt could make the game funny if you went that route with it. You could have troll commenters telling you to do things that'll hinder you also. \n\nI think it could be pretty interesting if done properly but would require a massive amount of voice work on one persons part haha. Or you could have different stages of the game played by different streamers/youtubers to mix it up.\n\nLet me know if you all have any further ideas that'd help flesh this out :)\n\nEdit: also you could have the narrator have responses to comments made by "viewers". If you went with the YouTube styles videos each chapter or act in the game could be the start of another video in the series. You could have the one guy/gal playing the game and a friend sitting with him so they can joke with each other and have conversations about what's happening.
1429153485|32rhol|Runaway Slave Video Game|I'm new to this subreddit and this is my first time posting, so please bear with me if I make any formatting mistakes:\n\nI'm envisioning this as a 3-D Third Person Stealth Survival Horror, where you're a fugitive slave attempting to escape to freedom.\n\nit's set in Colonial America during Antebellum Slavery\nI was thinking you'd play as a a slave and then could switch over to an Abolitionist\nAs a slave, you're goal is to escape to freedom i.e. The North\nYou're running for your life, you're being hunted by slave catchers with dogs.\n\nSo stealth would play a major part, you're not a ninja, or some other powerful character, you're basically an average person in dire circumstances. Combat is not the focus it's a last resort kind of thing.\n\nSo the game starts off at your master's plantation, you spend a couple days, weeks, this would be the tutorial, showing the controls and rudimentary systems, etc. You could play minigames (Cutting Sugarcane, Tending Farm Animals, learning the Alphabet-This becomes essential because the signs on the roads would be nothing but chickenstratch until you learn letters, you learn all of them you can readall the signs, maybe learning how to swim, picking cotton, etc.) You can gather supplies at the plantation (stealing food, acquiring a compass, maybe stealing a machete/or other farm implement to use as a weapon).\n\n You could try to convince others to leave with you but it puts you at risk since anyone could be a traitor and rat you out to Master. Then you make a break for it one night, the rest of the game would be navigating through country roads, forests, swamps, towns, etc as you try to make it to a certain point on the map where you can escape.\n\nThe obstacles in your way would include slave catchers, slave owners, Watchmen, Dogs, Law Enforcement and natural hazards like wild animals, poor weather, sickness, and injuries. Also you would have to make hard decisions think The Walking Dead Telltale series, maybe you come across a fellow escapee who's injured you could use your own supplies to help them or abandoned them.\n\nAlso a gameplay mechanic would be one for the dogs who can smell you, you can use pepper, or poisoned meat to distract them off your scent trailor cover yourself with mud to mask your scent, as to not alert them.\n\nthe slave would also have to scavenge for resources in the wild(hunt animals for meat, gather berries, etc), find shelter (shed, cave, etc)and i was thinking of having a basic crafting system.\n\nAlso instead of a game over screen or permadeath I was thinking this: Each time you get captured your slave master punished you severely, so much that it affects your stats. Each punishment would get progressively worse: 1. Publicly Whipped(bring down the morale stat.), 2. You get branded with an R (Runaway) this will prevent your character from using a pass(forged or real) 3. You lose an Ear, hindering you're ability to hear your enemies as clearly 4. Mulitilation-Loss of a hand, or a foot. This will keep your character from being effective at navigating and combat.\n\nNow when you play as an Abolitionist the gameplay changes it's not about sneaking to freedom, it's more about the choices you have to make to help slaves achieve freedom.\nYour decisions affect who gets caught, who lives, who dies and who gets to freedom.\n\nThe abolitionists vary since he/she can travel more places without having to avoid slave catchers or the like. Also you get access to era-appropriate firearms and melee weapons(Axe, Sword, etc).\nYou can raid plantations, gather intelligence about situations and characters, and even just buy a slave their freedom(There would be an economy system in place but you cant just buy every slave)\n\nAlso The Abolitionist would have a covered wagon, he could transport slaves in, it would be a whole system, with checkpoints where you can pass a dialogue check, bribe the guards, or use your pistol/rifle just in case things get heavy.\n\nThis is an "extremely controversial" and "story-based game" rooted in true events of American Slavery, it's an interesting way to interactively explore a period of history that doesn't get it due. \n\nAlso, perhaps historical figures could factor in like Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, John Brown, William Lloyd.\n\nMaybe include Bleeding Kansas, a series of violent political confrontations in the United States involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery "Border Ruffian" elements, that took place in the Kansas Territory and the neighboring towns of the state of Missouri between 1854 and 1861.  \n\n
1439499102|3gw8eq|Feature Idea: The story is being told by an unreliable narrator.|RPG and action games would benefit most from this. In between segments of the game, the bits in between are narrated during the loading screens. \n\ni.e.\n\n*And so I hit another slime with a sword. Tired yet? I am. I've said that at least five hundred times the past week!*\n\nIf a character dies, the narrator goes "wait, wait, sorry, that didn't actually happen, my mistake. What actually happened was..." \n\nbefore you restart from the last checkpoint.\n\nThere should be lots of witty snarking about events during gameplay too.\n\nExample 1: character is standing idle for five minutes: *And then I waited. I'm not entirely sure why I waited, I did have things to do, but it seems that I just took a short standing rest for a while. Any time soon I was about to spring into action. Any time. I think.*\n\nExample 2: character is decapitated: *And then I had my head chopped off. \n\n...\n\nWhat, I got better! Oh, fine. What really happened was...*
1437946862|3ep7qn|Cheater|Cheaters is an action game that's a throwback to the golden days where cheat codes reigned as holy grails to millions of kids and young adults.    \nThe main characteristic of the game is the players ability to type in cheat codes to achieve their objectives. The first thing the player does in the game is type in a cheat code to spawn a weapon in their inventory, for instance. Of course, it's only as the game progresses that the player learns more powerful cheats. The first ammo cheat you learn only refills your pistol ammo, later in the game you've discovered infinite ammo.    \nAs your cheats become more powerful so do your enemies, keeping you on your toes. The game will seek to feature all the well known cheats from the games of yesteryear, such as walking through walls and even god mode.    \n**The story is simple but explains much of the gameplay**.    \nYour character is the hero of a series of retro games who was programmed into a modern action game as an Easter egg by a nostalgic game dev.    \nAs you may have guessed, he becomes self aware. This happens when he is discovered by generic player and added to an achievement list. The main menu of the game represents this. Your character begins in a trophy room, leaves through an exit, and enters a room with a few doors titled "New Game", "Load Save", "Options", etc...    \nAs the story unfolds, you basically find this game you're in is an always online game connected to an anti cheat server. The more you cheat, the more detectable you become and enemies will attempt to debuff you. Some cheats are easily detectable and some aren't, it depends on the extent of the cheat. Ammo refill, not a big deal. Walking through walls, you have a few seconds before you get caught. I think this balances the players abilities with keeping the game challenging.    \nThe cheats you find are, themselves, Easter eggs tucked away in levels by the same nostalgic developer who planted you in the game. The problem is that you were never intended to be a playable character. The bug that unlocked you was discovered during the alpha release of the game, and patched in v1.0. Upon starting a new game, you read the patch note explaining this. This tells the hero that if they were to die, the game will reset and install the patch, locking them in oblivion. Each level comes to represent the main character surviving updates to rid it of bugs, mainly him, as each level is marked as v1.01, v1.02, and so on, and at the end of each level you find a strand of code to change your programming just enough to avoid being deleted. For immersion, I'd have the player manually type in this strand of code into the cheat prompt.    \nStory wise, you find out that you're not so different from the enemies you've been fighting. You're not really a retro Easter egg at all. You're more like a virus. You're actually a mod created by a nostalgic game dev who played no part in the actual development of the game you're in. This is revealed in the final patch note where the lead designer expresses giving up on busting cheaters and embraces the modding community.    \nI'm gonna cut this short and just say its all a throwback to the days of cheat codes, as well as a contemporary take on game developers often being at odds with their fan base, and ultimately seeing the light and warming up to community oriented game models.    \n    \n**Edit: there seems to be a lot of ideas floating around right now that have to do with breaking the fourth wall. I don't know why this is but this is not intended rip them off or discount them in any way. They all sound like good, creative ideas.**
1458078310|4akn05|i can hear you breathing|A horror game being hooked up to a microphone, yell at a jumpscare, the monster hears you, turns around. maybe at really tense moments when you're hiding,  you have to breathe quietly/only when its on the other side of the room can't hear you. but you can't just move the microphone because you have to protect a child or something, make noises to distract the monster. \nIn a scene when you have to communicate with the entity, keep speaking and it like the microphone is faulty, the second you yell/shout, the creature gets very angry - idk.\n

1412504167|2icjjt|Möbius: just a really simple concept.|Basically, the mobius band is a shape with only one side (Google it) and if you follow the path, you end up on the opposite side to where you started.\n\nI have no other story details, but I just thought, wouldn't it be freaking awesome if you played the role of a good guy and throughout the game  and without even realising it, the player kinda turned evil. (The other way around seems kind of boring)\n\nThere are games out there that do really well with showing character development throughout the story but I just figured that it'd be awesome if they did a complete 180 and the ending really highlighted this.\n\nI'm not sure how the player wouldn't become aware of it, maybe the game actually physically changes the appearance of certain characters so that the player feels compelled to kill them (because they think it's the right thing to do) and then at the end, the protagonist suddenly becomes aware they've been doing very bad things for the past few hours.\n\nI apologise if I didn't delve too deeply, it's just I read about mobius bands and instantly metaphorised it into a story in my head and figured I'd post it on reddit lol\n\nI also apologise if this is already a game, I rushed over here too quickly to check

For the algorithm to work it will be given a starting morphology and then it  will be trained on various mechanics before your first encounter.  Also it will need a reward system for the various fitness algorithms to enhance it. Each fitness reward will nudge its behavior and morphology in a certain direction. I.e. Climbing, sneaking, attacking, charging, perception, etc.  By the time of your first encounter it will be an easy bumbling target.  By mid or end game you will be matching wits against the creature trying to survive.
1435074591|3auaio|Treehouse base-building, recycling-gathering kids game|Here's a resource gathering, base-building game idea that is smaller scale than open-world survival.\n\nYou're a kid in the suburbs building a treehouse. You collect materials by wandering the neighborhood and picking up trash. Recyclable materials (e.g. metal, glass, plastic, paper) are used as crafting material for base features. Each "day" could last a short time, starting with items randomly spawned in the neighborhood. Return to the treehouse for the crafting and building.\n\nThat's all it has to be. The three basic game states: running around to gather items, crafting menu to convert recyclables into building pieces/furniture, and base-building where created parts are placed to expand the base.

And of course, you could customize your own porn star to your taste.\n\nThis was inspired by a dream I had last night of making naked women on Blender.
1440845370|3iu0ri|[Abstract] A Game in which you are terrible at everything you do.|This is a bit of a strange one, and I can't think of any video game down this line of thinking, but the basic concept is this.\n\nIt's a comedy game, you are an unwilling and unfitting hero in a long awaited prophecy, and you are kidnapped one day by people who tell you "You are THE Guy of Utmost Importance!"\n\nThe plot is never really explained properly, you're just given a gun, and you are sent out, and you have to kill people in various different ways.\n\nUnfortunately for you, you are bad at all these ways. You'll trip over your own feet a lot, your gun will jam, doors will always seem to not open on first try, when trying to use a sniper you drag it along the floor on it's front end (the bit where bullets release), and when you try to stab people it often becomes just a button mashing desperate attempt.\n\nI want the game to kind of exist like a parody on a lot of modern games, in the same ways that Leslie Nielson parodied a lot of spy movies in his day.\n\nI literally thought of this today so I get that it's not good but hopefully someone out there takes this and runs.
1452720388|40u8ir|A team based FPS in which the playable characters are from different genres of video games|Based mostly on TF2, Overwatch, and other team first-person shooters, my idea is to have an FPS where the playable classes in the game are designed and based off of other video game genres like RPGs and horror games for instance. I imagine it sort of like the Smash Bros of first-person shooters in which different games clash together to form one singular game.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I mean, here are some ideas for some playable classes.\n\n**The Veteran** would be the most basic class and be familiar to newcomers. His design would look similar to a soldier from Call of Duty or Battlefield. He would be equipped with team-colored camo and a helmet and an automatic rifle which deals slightly more damage on headshots. His secondary would be a less powerful pistol as backup for when he needs to reload his primary. His melee would be a basic knife which deals more damage behind. A pretty basic character who I think needs improving.\n\nI don't have a name for this one, but another idea for a playable class would be a robot designed similarly to Mega Man. He would be equipped with a single arm cannon only, which by pressing the secondary and melee switch buttons changes it from long range to point blank. The mid range setting is a standard automatic rifle which deals decent damage. The point blank setting will knock enemies back, dealing lots of damage. All of these different settings use the same ammo, but some settings will use more than others.\n\n**Konbo** (name pending) would be based off of 2-D fighting games. His only ranged weapon would be an energy blast from his hands which knocks enemies back and does minor damage. His melee, on the other hand, would be his bare fists, which knocks opponents up into the air and deals lots of damage. As long as the enemy is in the air, Konbo can initiate a combo which deals more damage and heals his own health.\n\nSome other ideas for characters that aren't well-thought out yet is a female mage from an RPG which could be a support character and defense character who can build walls and stop opposing forces styled similarly to simulation game like the Sims.\n\nIn addition to each player having their own special abilities, I imagine each character having a unique meter at the bottom of their screen. For the Veteran it could be based on killstreaks and when it gets to a high enough number he could receive a bazooka or a grenade. Konbo's meter could be based off of Street Fighter which can enhance his moves, allowing for a longer combo. I also hope that as the game receives more updates, more killstreaks or special abilities would be added and available to everyone from the start of the game, but this is just an idea.\n\nI understand if this idea has some balance issues or not enough explanation, but I just wanted to speak my mind of this thing I've had in thought for a while now. Thank you.

The city I would envision would be something like Seattle; lots of trees, variable terrain and buildings.  On top of this, maybe you could have the option of being a cat, and hunting birds.  Or maybe a crazy cat lady option, with an army of cats to attack armies of birds.  You could imagine the hilarity of the narrative that would ensue with characters like this.\n\nSomeone make it, god damnit.
1413085744|2j01wi|An idea me and my friend had.|I thought of an idea for a game: the premise is that you play as a man inside of his own mind while he is in a coma.  When you start out parts of his face are distorted or gone (not like torn or cut away, like as if he were made of pixels and a few just kinda weren't there), and you regain them through boss fights, along with memories and powers. The bosses are identical copies of the man with different powers and face parts, both of which you regain after the fight.  The copies of the man are actually parts of his personality, such as rage, sadness, fear, and creativity.  The man has traveled all over the North american continent, and the areas in the game are different places where major events in his life occurred. Since his mind is fractured, at certain points in the game you could be in Quebec and then suddenly be in the Keys.  Through this ordeal, he not only learns how his own mind works, but how the human mind works in general. While he is in the coma, through conversations with people close to him (just "memories," giving him cryptic instructions, not the actual people), he figures out that the coma wasn't accidental.  After he wakes up, he is able to quickly take down the person who put him in the coma using things he learned while unconscious.\n\nWhat do you think?
1436144154|3c90tg|My Childhood Dream: A Detailed, Immersive, Challenging, Prehistoric Park Builder. (Discussion VERY Welcome)|I, like many people, had that phase as a young child during which dinosaurs were THE shit. I, like slightly less people, never lost the sense of wonder surrounding the fact that these hulking machines of flesh and bone walked the earth that we now inhabit. I think it's a minor tragedy that we will never be able to  really admire the beauty of ancient life in all of its glory. But, all romanticism aside, I would love to see a game that allowed the dinosaur-geek in all of us to experience their own slice of prehistory. I often ponder how this game would play when I'm waiting to fall asleep, in the car, and the like. My base ideas draw heavily from my childhood favorites : Zoo Tycoon and Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis; taking concepts from both, and adding some modern flair.\n\nSo here's what I've got so far. These ideas are welcome to change and I would love some creative input. I'll start off with the major tenets essential to delivering the player experience that I envision.\n\n1.  A Multitude of Detailed Animals\n\nOne thing that I always yearned for in the aforementioned ZT and JPOG was a greater catalog of animals. In my idea, ( which from here on out I will refer to as "Revival". Cheesy as all hell I know, but it's short and sweet,) there would be a large range of species encompassing prehistoric reptiles, dinosaurs in particular, amphibians, mammals, marine life, and possibly Pterosaurs as well. An emphasis would be placed on detail; custom animations would be made for as many animals as possible. The idea here is to give the player a sense of connection and awe of their creations. In the aspect of animal design, scientific accuracy would be critical. Yes, that means some of the dinosaurs would be feathered. But they'd be badass feathers.\n\n2. Somewhat Challenging Gameplay\n\nRevival would be meant to be played on its "campaign" mode, in which there would be standard tycoon gameplay , i.e. , the balance of funds, guest and animal happiness, etc. However, it would be somewhat unique in the sense that the major emphasis would be placed on exhibit design and careful observation to learn each species' likes and dislikes to achieve maximum suitability. Of course, this would have to well balanced, interesting and not overly difficult, to keep from becoming frustrating. Optional hints or an in-game encyclopedia could help. New species would unlock in tiers; the idea being that in the beginning you were somewhat limited to more "basic" creatures, but as you progressed there would be more interesting selections. Depending on the species, getting the animals to breed in captivity would be difficult, hopefully creating a sense of achievement when you finally see your lady Rex building herself a nest. There would be a few special animals that would be unlocked through challenges, rather than progression. Of course there would also be a customizable sandbox mode, in which the player could toggle auto-maximum happiness, unlock-all, and such.\n\n3. Powerful Creative Toolbox\n\nThe player would be able to customize their plot before beginning a new park with a set of flexible terraforming tools. These same tools would be available during the game, but would cost money to use. There would be a variety of themes of building and decoration, to give the player as much creative freedom as possible. The terraforming would also tie in to the animal care aspect, with certain animals taking to alpine terrain and others to desert, etc.\n\n4. Mod Support\n\nDespite their best efforts, realistically, the devs would only be able to create so much content before the game needed to be finished. And while there could be potential for expansion packs, (this could be how mammals and marine life are implemented,) the game would be designed in the most mod-friendly  way possible, to give the community the ability to create the new content that they wanted to see.\n\nSo those are the pillars of Revival. Like I said, much emphasis would be on making the animals feel alive. So pack and herd behavior would be fleshed out.\n\nOne thing that I imagined very vividly in my head was the way a new dinosaur( or any other creature that was born of an egg), would be delivered to the exhibit that you assigned it. The player would select the species in the menu, and would be given the option to choose gender and whether they wanted a single egg or a clutch of unrelated specimens. Then they would select the location in which the egg(s) would be placed. Instead of the egg(s) instantly being there, there would be a detailed sequence in which one of the hired rangers/scientists (haven't decided which one should do it,) would walk to one of the player-built genetics labs and retrieve the egg(s), which they would wheel to the exhibit in some sort of incubation cart. The keeper would place them in the location that the player had specified, and then erect a temporary incubation unit over the makeshift nest. After enough in-game time had passed, the egg(s) would begin to hatch, and the ranger/scientist would return to remove the incubator. The purpose of the whole thing is to create a sense of excitement and suspense in the player for their new baby animals. Kind of like a watered-down version of getting a new puppy. I need to give more thought on how the operations for non terrestrial-egg-laying creatures would play out.\n\nWell, there's what I've got so far. I'd love to bounce ideas around with whoever's interested and I will likely update this post as I flesh the game out better in my head and if other people are interested. I'm glad to finally have this fantasy of mine written out. Alas, I'm kind of like John Hammond. I have the dream, but lack the skills to make it happen myself. But unlike John Hammond, I don't have the money required to make other people do it for me.\n\n
1442496477|3latan|A thriller/horror game.|So the game has to be first person, in order for this to work it has to be very immersive. You start in a kitchen of a home, doing some idle chores. You are tasked with some simple stuff just to get used to the controls, a tutorial pretty much. Picking up food and returning it, answering the phone. A short call from a telemarketer to introduce the dialog system. Just some simple interaction stuff.\n\nAfter this is complete you hear the front door opening and your wife returning home. You go and talk with her and a short conversation ensues before she tells you that she's tired and is going to take a bath. Now your told to go and watch TV, you go to the couch, sit down and switch on the TV. After a few seconds your vision starts to blur and the protagonist complains of a headache. Now your objective is to go back into the kitchen to retrieve some tablets, on your way back you begin to stumble and fall (like feeling lightheaded and dizzy) and eventually you pass out... You awake to lying on the couch with your wife sitting next to you comforting you. "What happened?" you ask. She explains that she found you on the floor passed out. After explaining that the last thing you remember is having a headache and taking medication for it, you begin to notice the ceiling behind her moving and bending, the walls are tearing away to reveal what appears to be a padded room, her face becomes distorted and her voice slurs as she asks you "what's wrong". You begin to feel yourself drifting away, your eyes open and close and each time everything seems further and further away, then your eyes close. \n\nYou awaken again in a padded room. You sit up, then stand up and are back in control of the player after a few minutes someone comes to the door and opens up a small latch and says "it's time for therapy". You immediately question where you are and where your wife is, what is this place etc. To which the man replies "ahh not this again". He calls for others and they open the door and rush you, holding you down and injecting you with a sedative. \n\nYou regain consciousness strapped to a chair in a small room, there's a table in front of you with an empty chair the other side, one light dangles from the ceiling, only just illuminating the table. It's almost like an interrogation room. A man walks in wearing a white coat, and sits down. He opens his folder and begins to scan through before saying "Ahh yes, Patient C. I've been told you were fantasizing about that imaginary wife of yours again, and here I was thinking we had made so much progress with you". \n\n\nSo my ideal dialog system would be that of games like, fallout or skyrim where you are given choices from which you can reply. I won't sit here and write the whole conversation between the protagonist and the "Therapist" (which I've already scripted). But to give you an idea, the conversation will be about you questioning where you are, etc. And the therapist explaining that after a year of progress you've fallen back into these fantasies. The choice as the player will be to believe it or not. The idea of the game is to keep the player guessing about what is real and what's only just an illusion or fantasy. Throughout the game you will find documents and files and if read, they will give you some insight as to what could be going on. \n\nIn the interest of time, I'll fast forward and talk about an objective you will come across. So throughout the game you'll be exploring the mental institution (There'll be open areas you are free to walk and restricted areas that, being caught in them will result in being returned to your room) you'll meet other patients and guards etc. At one point one of the patients tells you "they're all lying, we're not who they say we are. They call us by letters because they're afraid if we know our true names we will remember who we truly are". He then tasks you with breaking into an office to recover documents that would either prove or disprove what he's saying. Bare in mind some of these people you meet could be completely insane. You're not told which room the file is in, so depending on your own choice, you will get the right or wrong answer or just something completely insignificant. Most of the objectives in the game will be open and do not have to be completed, but could help you further into the game. \n\n\nA few times when you are required to return to your room and sleep, you will flash back to the house with your wife, but things will be inconspicuously different each time. Causing more confusion, if the player picks up on them. \n\nI have written down countless dialog's of conversations, objectives, possible plot lines, twists and multiple endings. Even some game play mechanics I feel would better immerse the player into the game. \n\nIf anyone wants to hear more, or has any ideas/suggestions or straight up questions. Let me know.\n

1441902600|3kf4ty|Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better)|So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.
1392466947|1xz6wn|Here's my idea. I call it "Greenlit", and I'd love to discuss it with you guys!|
1446420150|3r53ao|A videogame which seems like a kiddy adventure game, as long as you follow the linear path the story has set you. The more you deviate from the main storyline path, the more unsettling, creepy, and horrific the game gets.|
1449910232|3whung|[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.|(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**
1433520967|38oorq|Many game ideas here are far too big in scope. I made a (satirical) tool to help.|Hi! I make games.\n\nI see a lot of enthusiasm here for giant dream games -- MMO sandboxes as far as the eye can see. Those ideas unfortunately aren't useful to anyone. Why?

1434573095|3a7en0|Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.|Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.

1436397143|3clzms|Breaking the Fourth Wall|I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.\n\nThe game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.\n\nSlowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. \n\nThings become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.\n\nSuddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." \n\nAnyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.
1447633143|3syipp|"Can You Hear Me?" - A unique multiplayer horror game.|
1443383212|3mm0c2|A spaceship game that no one will ever make.|I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies.
1399310129|24sf5m|If someone made this game, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.|This game would be a puzzle game. The character would move through a series of levels, getting Energy powerups along the way. Its every move is controlled by a malevolent outside force. Soon, it realizes this and tries to escape. \nYou, the player, are the malevolent force. The energy powerups are drugs to keep the character docile. When he tries to escape, you must block him and try to manipulate him into the drugs. At the end, you'll have the choice to either let him escape (losing the game with no restarts) or to kill him (winning the game). \nYes, it would be essentially Portal from the POV of Glados.
1423955457|2vx3ay|Spy Messenger: Giver orders and fulfill missions through a fake messaging app|**The basic idea**\n\nWhen opening the (mobile?) game, you reach a "messenger app"-like UI where each contact is actually an NPC with whom you can exchange pre-defined texts. Your goal is to fulfill missions through the intermediary of contacts: you gather information, give orders, and get things done all through messages. As the game progresses, you have more and more useful contacts and more and more complex quests.\n\n**Typical game loop**\n\nFor instance, a mission could consist of stealing someone's phone. All you know at first is the target's name, and the fact that he's already served jail time for robbery.\n\n1. You call the white pages service, and realize 15 persons have the same name.\n1. You call a friend from the police, and give him the name to get criminal records for all persons matching it.\n1. There's only two persons known by this name with criminal records, and only one has served for robbery. Great, you now have his address.\n1. Since it's 2am, the guy must be home. Message another contact and ask him to break into the target's home, and steal the phone.\n1. Moments later, he contacts you back saying he's got it. You tell him where to deliver the phone.\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting stories based on the idea, making things harder and harder to solve. Maybe at some point you'll have unreliable contacts that lie to you, and make you need to track your own contacts... Or people that get killed on the job... Or multiple missions to manage simultaneously, that end up being related to each other... Lots of intricate things to imagine :)\n\nIf made as a mobile game, I also wonder whether it could be interesting to make this game real-time, like there's an actual hour to wait until you burglar reaches the target's house. It could add to the immersion, but it would suddenly be heavily notification-based, not sure I'd like to play that.\n\n**Technical aspects**\n\nI'd say the basic gameplay would be quite affordable for beginners: there's a lot of modeling to do for data, NPCs, possible situations and how everything is linked together, but it does seem quite easy and fun to code. And iterative, too, as you can start small and add features as you go. Also, no graphics! The main challenge is rather to make the pre-defined messages thing work well.
1437927452|3eo531|The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it.|Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.\n\nThe hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. \n\nThe GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.\n\nFinally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.\n\nPlaying with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.

1414594926|2kohuo|It's called: You Are The Sword|For some years I simply have not had the time to keep programming and trying to properly realise my game ideas. So here: I'm throwing one of them out into the aether to see what y'all think of it. Please upvote and share if you like it and I can give you more info.\n\nOur protagonist starts at the bottom of a tower with many separate floors. The aim is to get to the top of the tower. The tower is populated by many adventurers seeking to do the same thing. So far, so cliche and uninteresting.\n\nHere's the twist (and working title): **You Are The Sword**.\n\nWhen the character holding you dies, you drop to the floor, and, evetnually, you're picked up by another character who you then gain control over. In some sense the game can never end until you win - which allows us to amp up the difficulty significantly of course.\n\nInspirations: Dwarf Fortress and Sword Art Online, primarily.\n\nOK there's a lot more to this idea that would require a lot (a **lot**) of programming. But that's the very basic idea. I can go on about it more in the comments if you are interested. Imagine all the cool things about dwarf fortress (persistence, random gen, etc.) but in a dungeon crawler. It's pretty cool. Throw in all your classic RPG elements, only with this curveball that your character can completely change at any time.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more.\n\nEdit: someone wanted more information up front rather than in discussion below, so I'll do what I can.\n(NB. there's a lot more here than the basic idea, and I'm well aware of what a colossal amount of work this would be to code!)\n\nBASIC GAME PITCH\n\n* you are a parasitic sword who takes control of your wielder\n* your aim is to get to the top of the tower - you start at the ground floor\n* there are a fixed number of randomly generated adventurers in the tower, and when one dies, a new one enters\n* adventurers wander through the tower fighting monsters on different floors, and perhaps each other\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\n\n* adventurers are procedurally generated at the start of the game, along with the maps of each of the tower's floors, monsters and bosses (a la Dwarf Fortress)\n* adventurers have classic rpg stats alongside temperament stats (which grades them on scales of aggressiveness/passivity, bravery/cowardice, honour/treachery etc.) . This dictates their interactions with other adventurers and their actions more generally\n* monsters get tougher as you go up the tower\n\nSWORDS\n\n* every adventurer climbing the tower needs a sword. You start out getting picked up by some level one scrub at the bottom floor of the tower\n* some swords are special - let's call them soul swords. You're one of them. Soul swords take over the mind of the wielder and are soulbound (cannot be unequipped till death) You're not necessarily the only one...\n* swords level up as their wielders level up\n\nADVENTURERS\n\n* adventurers level up as they fight monsters and grow stronger\n* there are a fixed number of adventurers, so it's technically possible to record all interactions between advs, all injuries sustained, and all rivalries/friendships etc. If you've played dwarf fortress you know the kind of thing I'm talking about: Brian's left toe is broken sort of thing\n* some advs play dirty - if they are 'evil' enough, they might kill other advs for their gear, or because they don't like them. If you're unlucky, your character won't just get killed by their sworn enemy, but you will *become* their sworn enemy. Still, it's probably better than being left on the ground.\n\nTHE TOWER\n\n* for now let's say the tower has 20 floors. Adventurers likewise can level from 1 to 20. They can only access the floor they have hit the level of. Similarly for equipping weapons and armour.\n\nPARTIES\n\n* in order to to tackle bigger monsters, at some point advs have to go out in parties. As a low-level character, you can expect to be resigned to signing up for an available outing with a party looking for another member.\n\n* as your repute grows (of the character, not the sword) you might be able to lead your own parties, by finding other weaker (or less famous) advs to follow you\n\nDEATH\n\n* when an adv dies, their gear falls to the ground. If that includes you, you won't be spared. You lie there in the dirt until a friend claims it, or a adv considers you an upgrade, or, if you're really unlucky, some low level scrub picks you up looking for a cheap buck by selling you on. The higher level you are, the more chance you will find your way to the hands of someone as mighty as your last wielder. Otherwise, you have to work your way back up again.\n\nSTORY (because why the hell not?)\n\n*Nemesis stands at the top of the Tower of Fate, looking down at your battered corpse. She knows that only seconds from now, your body will judder back to life whether you wish it or not. So she does what she did to all the others: as your spirit returns to flow like water into your recently departed body, she catches it in a vial of sand and corks it. It is all you can do to juggle yourself out of her grasp. The vial smashes on the floor and you reach once more for your body. But it is too far away, and the sand weighs you down. Enough sand lands on the sword for your spirit to find a place in the metal to hide. But it has been to long now. Your body is dead.*\n\n*Nemesis kicks your body, your sword and your spirit over the side of the tower with a curse. Now she is the last of the gods, free to feed off all those who dare to reach the top of her tower. Only you can stop her now, but you have fallen to the very bottom of the world, your body smashed to pieces. You are not you anymore.*\n\n*You Are The Sword.*
1430925576|352f8f|A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam|The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., "What did you have for breakfast today?" or "Where do you live?". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable "hallucinations" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness.
1387667572|1tfajy|You will probably not read this, but I need to get this concept out of my head.|A game that I call 'Psychosis', I don't know if this has been done, in that case tell me.\n\nIt's a horror game, where you start in a abandoned hospital with a head injury/amnesia, the\nhospital starts out normal and clean, but once a nurse comes in there's no eyes just holes,\nthis causes the game to go in slow motion and your heartbeat goes louder.\nAfter she leaves you try to escape the hospital. Other people, patients and nurses \nstart out as ghosts/human like creatures and the closer you get to the exit the more scarier they become\n(as well as making the hospital more scarier, moving walls, more worn out, darker, until it's pretty much abandon)\nmaking the player to start attacking them the using various weapons found in the hospital.\nThis causes police and guards to come and try to arrest you, however, to the player they appear\nlike monsters. You escape and go through a almost like typical horror game except you attack\nothers, the longer you wait the scarier/more gross they become. "The Cops" hunts you\nand you'll have to escape to your farm (this is the only objective and the only thing your character remembers).\nAs you progresses through the game, it becomes darker and scarier.\nRight before you reach your farm, you're arrested/kidnapped by the monsters.\nYoul'll then placed in a room with the only normal looking person in the game.\nHe explains to you that you're a hallucinating schizophrenic and had a psychosis,\nhe tells you you've killed countless peoples lives (now you'll get flashbacks from a "normal"perspective"\nshowing you killing innocent men, women, and children) and that you've been the main newstory\nall week and been hunted by the government. Revealing you have been a psychopath.\nYour character can't accept it and kills the psychologist and tries to escape in a \n["Black ops revelations"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02DUaeo9iw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=61) type of mission, getting flashbacks seeing yourself killing people\nwithout regret, your character finally breaks down and kills himself with a gun from a guard. The End.\nThe backstory is you were put in a mental hospital at a young age, one day you're attacked\nby another patient, landing you in the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry it sounds a bit weird, but it has been in my head for a couple of days\nand I can't really get the concept out of my head.\n\nThe thing is, it has to be really well executed. The regular people have to act\nlike normal people just looking scary to the player, the cops are the only ones attacking you first.\nIt's kinda inspired by Postal 2's Apocalypse Weekend.\nIt should be extremely bloody and not using as much jump-scares but more psychological horror.\nFocusing on the feeling of being alone and followed. One defining moment should be\nkilling a monster up close, cutting its throat, looking into human eyes. Moments showing something's\nwrong should be popping up through the entire game.\n\n**TL;DR: You kill monsters in a apocalyptic world, in the end revealing you're a psycho running around killing\ninnocent people.**\n\nIt's still just an idea, so tips, ideas and critique are welcomed. I've also thought of this as a movie and a book, but a game seemed like the best.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1391828601|1xbt80|Dolphin Call of Duty|So the basic premise is that you are on a team of 128 dolphins in the Pacific ocean. There is another team of dolphins. One team are ninjas and one are pirates. You are using class appropriate weapons. The last dolphin standing then becomes ninja or pirate god. This gets them special buffs the next game.\n\nAlso. Motion controls.
1437118107|3dlnyi|You're a ghost who must setup freak accidents in a contract with Death!|This game is set on a modern, populated island with a few hundred residents and a northeastern always-cloudy-and-gloomy atmosphere. They all have generic routines around the house; making breakfast, watching TV, mowing the lawn, going to bed, etc..., and most of them have jobs they travel to on the island.\nYou're an invisible ghost. You were once a resident of the island but you were murdered by an unknown killer. Death has spared you eternity in the abyss, for now, under the condition that you help him cross a number of names off his list. As an added bonus, he'll eventually let you get revenge on the person who killed you before the story took off.\nSo, the gameplay.\nYou cannot simply ghost-punch people in the face and kill them, but instead, you have to CAUSE their deaths through moving objects in game and setting up traps and freak accidents like an ill placed toy at the top of the stairs that no one was paying attention to because it wasn't there just a second ago. \nYou have to observe a little and figure out your victims routines for everything to go smoothly. The more bold your actions are, the more likely it is that someone will notice strange things happening in their home. If Ms. Jones notices the toaster sitting by the bathtub then she will carry herself in much more suspect manner and make things more difficult for you, and if she turns a corner and sees a kitchen knife floating in mid-air, ...she may very well call the exorcist. If the exorcist arrives in the home you are at, surviving his encounter will give you a fresh start on the mission, but if he successfully exercises the home then you will be banished from it until you are strong enough to reenter (and you become stronger with each death you cause). As you progress and do become stronger, you slowly work your way to the title of a demon. At this level of strength you may actually give someone a little nudge while they're on a ladder or something similar, but  once again, the more bold your actions are - the more risk you take. At this stage you may attract the attention of guardian angels, and without taking any sides or getting too religious, if a guardian is alerted to your presence then your only hope is to very stealthily avoid it and cause an accidental death (for gameplay/balance reasons). \nIt's obviously a dark narrative and if it were fleshed out properly would be restricted in a few countries, but I think it scores points for originality, concept, and boldness. There are plenty of other details I've thought of for the game but I'd like to hear what someone else says about the basic premise, the mechanics of it, and what they'd add or remove. Very open to criticism! 
1446249293|3qwouw|Idea for a Shooter using a dismemberment system [X-POST from /r/Gaming]|Someone told me to post this here after having posted it in [This Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3qug9q/tis_but_a_scratch/cwixm9v?context=3)\n\nI've always imagined a sort of zombie war game with this kind of dismemberment mechanic. The story was basically going to be that countries began turning their dead soldiers into zombies to fight wars because they feel no pain, and players would play as these zombie soldiers on one side and humans on the other in basic game types like CTF or Deathmatch, Survival (both against waves of zombies *or* humans), etc. You'd have stuff like zombies legs being blown off by mines only to have them keep crawling along the ground with a gun in one hand, or if they only had one arm left they'd crawl up to the enemy and try and grab them to sort of "stun" them, while dealing biting damage. Or, crawl up behind a human player, the zombie pulls the pin on their own grenade, SURPRISE!\n\nGot both arms blown off? Run at the humans in a suicide mauling attempt. Got one leg? You'll still be crawling pretty fast and can shoot just fine. Want a longer melee range? At the sacrifice of one of your arms and the ability to shoot anything but one-handed firearms you can rip it off and use it like a spear with the knife in that hand.\n\nI pictured it as being a sort of goofy game where the story wouldn't really matter all that much. The zombies would be "intelligent", but they'd still be utter dopes, while the humans would probably be anything from satirical portrayals of the "ACTION HERO AMERICA" archetype to the gritty survivor archetype and other ridiculous stuff. Mainly multiplayer, it'd be something along the lines of TF2 (Though, not sure what would be a good replacement for mountains of hats). Someone also mentioned this could make an interesting RTS. I'd have to think more about how that'd work but I've always been somewhat of a fan.
1443800974|3n8llh|The gun that doesn't want to kill|To preface, this is a game I want to make, but with little, meaning zero, experience in game development and no idea where to start, I understand it's likely to never become a reality, and as depressing as that sounds I'd much rather write then develop, though one day I do hope to write for games, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe initial idea was a gun that didn't want to kill, and it bloomed from there.\n\nThe game starts on a sort of old power point esque type of scene, you know, the kind of the thing you see at the fallout 3 start screen? These "panels" tell the story of a group of scientists who were, years ago, intent on developing a weapon that had true artificial intelligence, to give useful intel and combat support in the middle of a fire fight. They succeeded in both creating the AI, and installing it into a simple gun, naming it P.A.G. (Personal Assistant Gun). However, Pags personality proved to be difficult. \n\nHe didn't want to kill. This weapon intended to murder and take lives on a battlefield was making a choice, or trying to at least. Despite being installed into a gun, and having access to several powerful sensors and other neat features, he has no control over his actual functionality as a gun, so he could not stop himself from firing when his trigger was pulled.\n\nThis made him very angry, and he would constantly, and very vocally protest to all his tests, even screaming at his creators to stop forcing him to be a weapon. It was decided that even though they could mute Pag, there was no use in a weapon that didn't want to kill, and would most likely be more detrimental then a help to anyone on an actual battlefield. \n\nFast forward some odd years, and our silent protagonist steps in, being assigned to guard duty at a well known research base. During his first night they are, of course, attacked. The enemy catches the base off guard, storming in, killing many scientists and soldiers alike. Our protagonist wakes up after being knocked out cold from a near by explosions, looking up to see soldiers passing over him, and many other corpses, putting a bullet in any head that moved. The protagonist, with a whole lot of luck is able to stay still, and avoid being killed then and there. \n\nHe makes his way through the now mostly destroyed facility, and finds himself inside an old research wing. Here he finds himself a gun, but it is an odd one, with strange lights, and it's plugged into a wall. He's never seen anything like it, but he picks it up and plans his escape. \n\nWhile moving down a corridor he's spotted by enemy combatants, and is forced to shoot and kill them both (there are 2), but upon firing at the first, the gun springs to life, and cries out, confused and jolted. At first it sounds terrified, afraid, and then asks if the it's wielder just killed some body, then goes through an almost traumatic seeming moment of "oh no", as if it's in some sort of disbelief. \n\nAs the game progresses many more enemies confront our silent killer, the player being forced to either kill them, or die. All the while the gun is screaming, yelling, and even at times begging you to stop, to put him down so he doesn't have to kill again.\n\nDuring the down times, to quiet points, he talks to you, he tells you what it's like to be an intelligent being shoved into something he hates so much, how he wishes only to help, not take lives, and one day he even dreams of becoming a flare gun, so that he can save people rather then kill them. Though, over time the gun realizes you won't stop killing, that you'll do anything to survive, and begins to criticize you more harshly, saying things like "You know those people had families, mother, fathers, spouses waiting for them. They'll never see them alive again because of you."\n\nAt the start Pag is confused, and tries to convince you to stop killing, that you can just sneak by, or even run, but as the game progresses he comes to hate you, to understand that you don't care what he thinks, that you'll use his body however you see fit, and his hopeful determination to stop you becomes a simpering, dark hatred towards the protagonist. \n\nTruth is this is a little dumbed down, and I don't really know how the ending would go. Though, I think it would be fun to find out.
1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1422047947|2tg1o0|A game where you have to make someone late for work|The game consists of you, a god-like character, controlling the world similar to the Sims.  You watch over a person going through their typical morning routine before they leave for work.  It is randomized every time, so while you have no idea exactly what they'll do at every time, it will be a traditional shower/eat/dress type of thing.  You have no control over what the character does, but you will be changing everything around them.\n\nYou will have a limited number of "action points" that will let you change the world around this character, and will let you do absolutely anything.  You can change the timer on the toaster oven so it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.  You can make the phone ring when he/she is in the shower.  You can interact with every single object and move it, break it, or alter it in a realistic way.  You can only affect objects individually, so you can not do things like use a lighter to light a newspaper on fire, or anything like that.\n\nThere are two catches that will make you "fail" your mission.  \n\nThe first one is, you can't kill the character, either intentionally or accidentally.  If you make him slip on the floor and he hits his head too hard, causing him to die, you lose.  The character MUST be in working condition, so even hospitalizing them will cause you to fail.\n\nThe second catch is that the character cannot detect that his world is being interfered with by a higher power.  If you take his car keys and make them float in midair, he/she will freak out and won't go to work.  \n\nThe character's routine will change based on every action you do, and it's totally possible for them do skip breakfast or leave without ironing their pants, so it's not as simple as, do a thing and it makes them late.  It's important to use action points on things that will affect the most important tasks and tasks that are done near the end of the routine.  Different actions also cost different points, so while hiding the car keys under the bed may completely throw your character off, it will also cost an enormous amount of points, and may not be the best way to achieve the goal.\n\nThe appeal would be the replay value.  Every game will feature a new character with a new job, a new routine, and every house will have hundreds of objects to inspect and mess with.  Most of the time spent developing the game would go towards creating objects, so you could play for 50 hours and still be coming up with new ways to cause controlled chaos.  After all, it is a sandbox strategy game.

1432619362|37aolu|You kill monsters|Ive had this idea for a while and Recently got motivated to actually develop it. (i made a post here a while ago and got some pretty great advice) I'm an illustrator and was actually hoping I could get some critique on this project. I barely have anything developed (im serious its literally just a concept right now, all I have is a rather quickly done illustration and some ideas) but I feel that There is enough here for a little advice. :)\n\n\nAnyway, the idea came to me from seeing a picture online. I'm really bummed out that I don't have the picture with be but it depicted this giant monster looming over this little girls bed. On the bed there was a small teddy bear with a sword and shield ready to fight the monster off. I loved this idea. A child's toy fighting off the monsters that live under the child's bed and in the closet. I took the idea and did countless sketches but never reaching anything cohesive  I could turn it into. but after a lot of red bull and procrastination in league of legends i finally came to the conclusion it could be a game. \n\n\nThe basics of the game would be you and a team of 3 others would play as a toy or stuffed animal, like a sock monkey, a bunny, a wind up robot, things like that. Each character having varying abilities such as placing down mouse traps setting up walls. maybe one can have fast melee attacks or someone can have a small nerf gun rigged to shoot teeth. But all 4 of you fight off waves of monsters that try to make it to the child your protecting in bed. Shes sleeping and you need to keep her nightmares at bay! Now the monsters could be anything, Bats, spiders, the scary ass pictures in "Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark" but there would always be something looming through out the room that you cant attack. Like the spider. There would be sort of a silhouette of this spindly thing on the far end of the room pumping out what seems to be an endless swarm of creepy crawlies. The closer the enemies, the more the environment changes to a darker tone. like dirt on the walls and ceiling and floor. maybe cobwebs surrounding most of the room.\n\n\n\nanyway thats my idea. (at least the bulk of it) Critique would be awesome and that one illustration I did is right here ------&gt; http://imgur.com/a/XmR5x (along with the rest of my artwork)

Not a whole chess game, maybe a late-game chess puzzle.\n* Battle of Steel -- combat against the Grim Reaper. If you win, you are resurrected.\n* Sell your soul -- someone has paid a pittance for your soul. Now watch this ad to be resurrected. Can you imagine a player being happy/relieved to watch an ad? I find it amusing to break the 4th wall like this and have an ad company directly buy the player's respawn, instead of allowing the player to buy respawns.\n

The players are all invisible like in screencheat, and whenever you shoot, your bullet leaves a trail pointing to where you just were. Movement also leaves a trail, but it is much less noticeable.|Maybe operating with a class system also. A tank with a minigun would be very easy to spot, while a scout character would be harder but take fewer hits to kill. Maybe a class that can mark people also with a special item.\n\nThink classes similar to TF2. You don't have to use similar, but it's a good example of how the balancing could work.

1413350766|2jajrv|A first person home invasion survival game.|It would only run for about 15 - 25 minutes. You wake up late at night to the sound of a door opening downstairs. You walk around in darkness, your world illuminated by the moonlight in some windows and your Iphone, if you can get downstairs and find it. You realise that somebody has broken into your house and is in hiding. The invader has shut off the electricity from the basement and locked all the doors and windows leading outside. You could phone the police but that would let the invader know where you are and he can catch you. If he catches you, its possible to fight him by picking up household objects, but he has brute strength so it would be dangerous to do so.
1433711460|38y6ge|Time controlling heist game|The idea is that you control a team of 4 people trying to pull off a heist. The main mechanic is that you are essentially planning a heist, which means that you can go back and change anything. You play by looking at the level from a top down over view. You then choose a character and take control of them in a first person perspective (might be executed in some other ways if you want to scale the game down). At any time, you can jump back to the overview, and take control of another character. You can also go back through the timeline to redo a specific piece of the character's actions. For example, you might try to get a guy in through the main entrance. However, as soon as he gets in, he is spotted by a guard and shot. So you take another character and make him break a window to distract the guard. You then hide the second character and make the first character go through the entrance, this time without getting shot.\n\nThe idea is to make this a sort of puzzle game with multiple solutions. Perhaps there would be rewards for not redoing any paths or for accomplishing side objectives or for doing it in a very short amount of time. What do you guys think?
1448421044|3u60qi|Computer Building Simulator.|There are plenty of simulation games out there now. Some ridiculous and over the top, others pretty interesting. My idea is that there be a game that teaches you the inner workings of a computer. What different parts do, what works and what doesn't, etc.\n\nPerhaps there would be a career mode. At the beginning of each level, you're given specifics on what your customer is looking for in a computer and you're given a limited budget to achieve it. You shop around for computer parts and put together a computer with them. \n\nIt would, in my opinion, be a great learning tool/game.
1433025309|37w8fo|A game with a mechanism where level bosses are created and uploaded by gamers and randomly appear in single player mode of other players as enemies.|
1356827043|15ncs9|A Hide-and-Seek game in which you don't know if you are the hider or the seeker|A game in which each round would last a relatively short while. There are two characters, the human and the monster. Each character is played by two random strangers chosen from a server (like Omegle). Each player is put into one of the roles, but they don't know which they play. There are no differences so that even if they were to look on each other's screens, it would be impossible to tell. The game takes place in a maze, and there is a time counter on the side. The human has to survive as long as they can, and the monster has to catch the human in as short of a time as they can. As the players come closer to each other, they will hear each other's footsteps. This is the whole game. At this point, will the players run away, or rush forward? Being a monster and running away means you take away from your time, and being a human and rushing forward means you could get caught. But once the two meet, it becomes clear as one player looks like a monster and the other a human. After this point, the monster player speeds up, and the human player gets a gun. The gun only has two bullets, and only slows down the monster. Ammo crates appear around the map, which don't reappear after being taken. This means the monster eventually wins, but the point of the game is to see if your choice to run away or rush forward is correct
1409197714|2esih6|I don't think it's particularly plausible... But I had an idea for an RTS based on terraforming|Basically, there would be two factions. One side is natural (which I've been calling the Growth), and the other is industrial, which I've called the Machine. \n\nThe Machine would be industrialized and be the simpler faction. It just focuses on mass production, and in general would have stronger, more numerous units, but very few special abilities. Massed robot infantry, automated tanks and aircraft. I've been thinking of a swarm-style buildings for them. The buildings would be small and slow to produce, but you could build a lot of them very quickly. Maybe a click-and-drag function for placing down multiples at once in a grid format? \n\nTheir defenses would be a turret "wall" of sorts. Place a base, and then click-and-drag to send out a rail as far as you drag with turrets on it. The rail can go out for a long time, but destroying the base will destroy every turret on it. \n\nThe Growth will play a little more conservatively. No refined metals, but stone could be their armor. So their big units could be things like giants. Other units could be things like large birds, predatory hunters, and giant bugs. Their buildings and units, in general, are weaker and less numerous than the Machine, but they have a much wider range of special abilities and access to druidic magic. Climate warfare, healing, etc., would be available to them.\n\nTheir defenses would be more organic. Giant bug nests, pitfalls, and other natural traps. \n\nAnd my biggest idea is the terraforming. Most of the map can start out as a barren wasteland, fit for neither life or machine. Workers from both faction, instead of building or gathering, can work on converting the land for their needs. The Machine could flatten out the land and lay down metal to prevent the Growth from taking it, and the Growth can fertilize the land and plant seeds to slow down the Machine. Buildings can only be built on land that has been terraformed to your side, so you need to expand as quickly as possible to get the resources you need. In order to terraform an area that your enemy has taken, you would have to remove theirs, first. \n\nI also have an idea for terraforming to be used offensively. If you terraform an area with an enemy building on it, you could synthesize that building. All the units that building was able to create can now be built by you, with some differences. The Machine could add parts to the now enslaved Growth to make them stronger and hardier, but move and recharge their abilities slower. The Growth could overgrow into the Machine's creations and take control from there, making them faster, but more fragile. \n\nHow viable is this without a full game studio? I dunno. I don't expect it to ever get made. Just wanted to see what you guys thought of my idea. 
1417503227|2o0wub|You Will Die- A horror game concept|Opening\n---------------------\nNine thirty. You've been working your dead end job at the Stop Shop department store for two months and you're already regretting it, but your shift is up and that's what matters. Or it would be if you hadn't offered to take the night shift to cover for your lazy friend. It's New Year's and everyone in the whole damn store is going home, Christmas music slowly waning as the lights in the store shut off row by row. You grab your PDA and start stacking items on the shelves like the good little robot you are. Now you're here until four in the morning. Asshole.\nBut you're not alone.\nYou hear footsteps and look over to see a person casually strolling down the hall. You start to say something to him, maybe it was the cheerful hello all Stop Shop employees give, maybe you were going to tell him to get the hell out. What matters is that he pulls out a gun and shoots you from twenty feet away. \nWelcome to the game. \nThis man will kill you. The End.\n\nWhy come up with an idea like this?\n--------------------------------------------\nI'm halfway through my Master's Degree in Criminal Forensics and I've always had to deal with the worst of humanity. I've also been thinking about indie horror games lately; they're getting quite a surge of popularity in the last half-decade. With the advent of games as art, I've been thinking that games shouldn't have to be fun to play. They should be an experience. Possibly a painful experience, but something we can learn from. \nYes, I'm trying to distance this from Alien: Isolation. The difference is this can, and has, happened to people. It is... horrifying. It's ungodly. And I wonder if that feeling of helplessness can be captured in a video game, because I'm weird and it's 12AM and I can't sleep now.\n\nWhat is it?\n---------------------\nYWD is a horror survival first-person adventure game that is based around the main character being hunted by a serial killer. There are no weapons in the game, and nothing you can use can suitably incapacitate him. You're just trying to stay alive as long as you can. The game features permadeath, meaning you can't respawn after you are killed, but you can save items in your locker which will make them available after you restart the game.\n\nThe game would involve hiding from, avoiding confrontation with, and outsmarting the serial killer if the situation came to it. \nThe map it takes place in would be small, but easy to memorize and navigate, with backrooms and non-standard heavy equipment. The store would hypothetically be completely interactive. with the ability to pick up and interact with any item, open any box, knock anything over. There wouldn't be a traditional crafting system but any item could be combined superficially, even if it was just wrapping a rope around a carton of eggs. Each item would have different effects in the world, mostly culminating in whether it attracts or distracts the killer. \n\nThere are many preset paths to try to escape, but most of them have risky consequences. You can attempt to go for the office phone and call 911, but that location has no doors beside the way you enter. You can try to run for it, but the freezing snow will likely slow you down. You can try to hide from the killer, but he will smash everything in sight looking for you. In addition, the killer can access any items in the area to counter your actions.\nThe game would not use a health bar or regenerating health, focusing on a Metal Gear Solid 3 approach where you can look down in First Person to see your body, and view injuries, which need to be handled to resume normal operation. A gunshot to the leg, for example, will cause you to hobble while an injury to the head will make you become dazed. There are no medkits, so you have to scavenge from the store to heal yourself, with items being freely applied due to the completely interactive store design. \nFinally, you have to memorize the killer as well. How many bullets in his gun, the reach of his knife, his overwhelming strength in comparison to yours, his attentiveness to certain areas and what he'll be expecting to look for. Use his knowledge against him.\n\nEveryone dies. \nBut not everyone lives.\nHave fun.
1448344345|3u1myw|Slippery Slope: The Game! (Potentially NSFW, depending on the work, I guess. Not sure, really.)|My apologies if this isn't the right place for this. Seems like the closest match, but there might not actually be a right place for this. I also don't know if it's been suggested before, because I have no idea what to enter in the search box to check.\n\nThe concept is about as politically correct as Cards Against Humanity...\n\n---\n\nI was on Facebook, reading the comments on an article like a true masochist, and I came across a comment claiming abortion will lead to cultural destruction, because immigrants. No further details were given. And then I got this idea, because sometimes I'm very lonely.\n\nThe core premise of the game is to come up with Insane Troll Logic, as it's described on TvTropes, and from there, so many possibilities.\n\nI immediately thought of this party game I played, back when I got invited to parties. Everyone would write a sentence on a piece of paper, and then pass that paper to the person next to them, who'd have to draw that sentence. Then, that person would fold the paper so as to hide the original sentence, and then pass it to the next person, who'd have to describe the drawing in a sentence, and who would then further fold the paper so as to hide the drawing, etc. \nSo my first idea was a variant of that idea, except that instead of interpreting drawings or illustrating sentences, you'd start with a vaguely controversial premise, and each player would add one level of ridiculous cause-and-effect, with knowledge only of the previous layer. \n\n(Player 1: X. Player 2: If X, then Y. Hides 'X'. Player 3: If Y, then Z. Hides 'Y'. And so on...)\n\n\nAnd then I thought of game variants, because my brain won't leave me alone.\n\nYou could have a variant that's a bastardized version of the Wikipedia game, where two or more players are given an initial premise, a disastrous ultimate consequence, and the winner is either whoever completes it quickest or whoever does it in the fewest layers of ridiculous Slippery Slope arguments as possible.\n\nIn either version, the additional layers have to follow from each other, even if the logic involved is patently false. Purely random statements wouldn't be permitted.\n\n(Permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, children would grow up thinking shirts are invariably optional, which would lead to medical personnel not wearing tops to work, which would lead to more botched surgeries due to surgeon distraction, which would lead to a massive upswing in medical malpractice suits, which means most hospitals would be forced to close, meaning more people will die during childbirth because the nearest hospital is too far away.\nAllowing naked female breasts in PG-13 movies will cause tragic, preventable deaths of newborns.'\n\nNot permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, movies as a medium would cease to exist, which would cause supermarkets to hike up food prices by 3000%, because Batman.'\n\nSo, yeah... No good way to end this post, really... My apologies again if I'm in the wrong place, which is entirely likely, or if I've broken scads of subreddit rules, which I don't think I have, but I could easily be wrong.
1424276286|2wbnbb|An Oculus Rift game: Zombie survival.Your character is in a wheel chair.|I've been playing Killer 7 on the PS2 and I think it's sweet that one of the main characters is in a wheel chair. It reminded me of an interview with Cliff Bleszinski where he was talking about the Rift being utilized for seated simulation (flight, racing etc).\n\nI love that concept. The Rift is cool with games like Skyrim and Half Life but not being able to move around kind of breaks the illusion. Someday....someone will make an omni directional treadmill...but in the meantime...why not limit the characters mobility?\n\nI'm imagining a survival horror game with light to medium action. I don't have many ideas beyond the initial concept. I just think it would be super immersive given the technology that is currently available. \n\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\n**Disclaimer:** Beginner post. I did a limited search and didn't find anything...if I missed this idea in another thread...whoops?
1386651406|1six2g|"The Most Dangerous Game"|I have a simple idea: A game based on the short story "The Most Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell. \n     A short summary: a ship-wrecked man is on an island meets a hunter who has decided that animals are boring and would rather hunt another human and gives the man a knife and a three hour head start, and the hunt begins. I won't spoil the story for those who have not read it. \n   \n     Game play\nOverview: a survival game of wit with a focus of survival and hunting skills between two humans on oppose ends. A cold and calculating hunter methodically selecting his equipment, and a primal beast pushed to his limits to try and survive. A game that will leaving you questioning who is truly the prey.\n\nHunter: you select your equipment load out and focus on the hunt, specifically tracking your prey and trying to kill them. The hunter would have to wait a set amount of time to let the prey get a head start. While the hunter is waiting they will be given the equipment load out selection which will change every match to force different hunting strategies. \n\nPrey: you have the same limited equipment each time and focus on evasion and deception, with the ability to create traps to try and kill or immobilize the hunter to allow for your escape. \n\nMap: a forested island with rivers, cliffs, ravines, quicksand, etc.\n\nMy view: Gamers have wanted a survival game for a long time, but the problem has been that the pressure to survive wasn't there. With this format the prey will always have to be a step ahead, and the hunter will always be hot on the trail. The hunter must proceed with caution though because at any moment the tables could be turned.\n\nLet's get this conversation started!\n\nP.S. This is my first post, my days of lurking are finally over.\n
1445465425|3poxrm|Post WW3 survival game that turns into a nation builder|So, stay with me on this, you start out alone in a barren wasteland. If you're careful enough, you slowly get equipment, find companions, fight mutants and rival humans for resources, and do quests for people a la Fallout. Eventually, you get to a point in which you decide to spread your influence and bring stability back to this chaotic land. As you continue along your adventure, your choices will decide the fate of your newly declared nation. Will you try to create a democracy or dictatorship? What of the issue of slavery or the rights of woman in your land, among others. Do you wish to continue to move as nomads or find a place to remain as an isolated state? The balance of power among people, especially those who helped form your nation, matter. Of course, you'll be able to continue to do all the things you did before becoming a founding father/mother, but on a much grander scale, with entire armies taking part!\n\nSo, what do you all think?
1441213607|3jdo90|Two People, One Bullet. An Arena Based Shooter|Enter an arena comprised of smooth white walls and floors. The arena's floor is a 400m x 200m region of large cubes on a grid. Carved into the landscape is a flat road that connects the spawn locations, various upgrades and turret camps. On the other side of the arena your enemy has spawned. You have to navigate this labyrinth by soaring over it or running through it, collecting any upgrades and hacking turret towers until you find the enemy.\n\nYou're equipped with rocket boots for massive jumps and wall running, and your gun. Your gun is a single shot large calibre plasma rifle. When fired, the large neon bullet will continue bouncing throughout the environment until you catch it again.\n\nThe bullets also have another function. They can be grappled to.

1446962824|3rz9y8|A PC multiplayer game where you evacuate massive amounts of civilians from a disaster in the city.|What I mean by this post is something like the interaction/navegation of an unstable environment in a PVP match. \n\nOne example is a gametype thought up in my head 10 minutes ago called "Evacuation". This is borrowed somewhat from counter-strike, metal gear and titanfall but expanded. It has a near-futuristic setting and basically, you are supposed to evacuate as many civilians as you can (There could be hundreds or thousands of them) in a city from an impending disaster. However a team of terrorists are slaughtering the civilians. Defenders gain points for evacuation and attackers gain points for massacres and bonus points for killing defenders.\nHere's the twist: Each player only has one life, so that puts both sides on edge and forces them to think of a strategy. \nAlso there is no radar or anything, forcing players to rely on high places to spot enemies since you have thruster packs that you can climb up buildings and wall-jump, isolating players from the action below and engaging them in dogfights with the bad guys. \n\nIf any player dies they can provide air support by providing ammo, spotting enemies and deploying evacuation vehicles so they can have something to do while they wait.\n\nAs for the chaotic elements, weather is a powerful force. A hurricane can brush through the city, forming a flood and putting people's lives at risk, forcing defenders to prioritize them. If a certain amount of civilians are not saved during these events then defenders lose. \n\nThe Hurricane itself provides for an excellent visual effect. You can see the cloud looming from a distance and slowly approaching the horizon with gradual intensity. Then floods occur and windspeeds prevent you from jetpacking correctly and all the rainfall doesn't let you see a thing. \nThe maps also have a day-time progression system, meaning the day shifts to night and vise-versa since the time is set at random. You could be in the eye of the hurricane, completely safe, watching the crescent moon in the center looking down on you. Or see the sun in the same fashion. \nTsunamis, Sandstorms and Supercells (Tornadoes) are also a thing to watch out for. As these things are completely sporadic. \nYou could have an entire match without weather or you could have the whole match with a flood. You could also see a disaster in the distance and feel uneasy because it may or may not ever approach the city.\n\nA crucial part of the dramatic element is the lighting (Sharp shadows) and the expressions of the civilians themselves and what they go through. The civilians should have deeply expressive feelings of dismay, sorrow and should move and respond to disaster in a very convincing light, much like Elizabeth from bioshock infinite. They should all look distinguished not only in looks but in how they move, their moods and their unpredictability. \n\nYou as a defender are supposed to guide them. You simply tell them to stop or move on command. But whether or not they listen to you depends on their level of panic. Some may listen, others may fight other civilians for safety (In which case you gotta stun them and carry them) and others may actually help you by spotting terrorists or giving you weapons and ammo scavenged on the city or evacuating more civilians while you focus on the terrorists (The volunteers' deaths are not penalized) a worst case scenario would be for a riot to form, which would jeopardize the mission. On the flipside, they could also turn on you and spot you, use weapons against you (Or the surrounding population in a frenzy) and attacking volunteers and taking away their weapons to give to terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists, on the other hand, must kill as many civilians as possible, but there are so many so you can't kill everyone. Instead, you gotta kill and cause as much panic as possible like using bombs, destroying buildings, killing defenders guiding civilians, killing groups of people, blocking passages with their presence to make them run the other way (Or worse, in circles) stagnate them during disasters (Players can die from these too) and killing volunteers and evac vehicles.\n\nA quick trade-off when it comes to dying is that the more players die, the more weapons are supplied on the battlefield due to dead players. There is more support, so the gameplay balances itself out. However disasters can affect dead players as well because they can block satellite vision, misplace supplies (Strong Wind) among other things. This is also balanced out by funds that air support gains depending on the actions of both teams on the ground. That way, air support has to coordinate, sort through options and choose what to deploy in order to make ends meet.\n\nThere would also be a ranking system in place, allowing more skilled players to play against each other and gradually allow for a competitive environment to form without taking away the dramatic tone that players feel. \n\nThe deaths of the civilians should be emphasized. They are the core of the gameplay, so the civilians should cry upon seeing a randomly assigned relative dead with varying lines, expressions and reactions (rage, fear, sorrow, compassion, revenge, ambiguous etc.) and each should have their own unique identity, complete with names they tell each other. You should feel the despair they go through upon seeing bodies floating on the water, burned to ashes, dismembered, shot, etc.\nAnother facet to this would be to see their emotional reactions to being rescued and evacuated. You will see some crying from joy, you would see some reluctant, you would see some rushing to the vehicle or begging to be taken while they are left behind. There would be some who feel safe and comfortable while others feel confused or angry. You would have to take them in one-by-one to add to the immersion that you are saving REAL PEOPLE. And sometimes that could be as easy as letting them walk in or you would have to carry the wounded (bonus points) or you would grab someone by the hand and pull them in (raising morale) or you would have to struggle as you force someone inside against his will. \nCarving convincing individual identities on a mass scale can be achieved by crowdsourcing people from the internet and having them express the lines and names of civilians on the game to make the civilians more fleshed out and dynamic. Having hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of volunteers providing voice acting material could help provide an attachment to the civilians. \n\nAs for the terrorists, stealth is key for two reasons: \n-1 avoid detection by defenders.\n-2 Sporadic attacks are more frightening, which raises panic.\n\nThe mood of the civilians should not be illustrated on a panic meter (damages immersion) it should be detectable on the reactions of the civilians. Also, not everyone will realize what just happened. A group of people in a city could be oblivious to an explosion that murdered 10 people 5 blocks away. And the way this information is transferred also varies. Some civilians notify the ocurrence while others just flee from the crowd that is stampeding towards them. \n\nWhen nothing is ocurring, and it can happen at any point in the game, people are seen doing every day things. It is at this point when the defenders should be careful to preserve the peace as much as possible (REALLY HIGH BONUS POINTS) so any sort of fighting is going to attract attention and raise tension, but when disaster strikes people will be more desensitized to such things. \n\nThe eventual first encounter between defenders and terrorists should be a BIG DEAL. So much so that time should slow down for like 3 seconds while you hear a heartbeat, symbolizing a change of pace in gameplay and initiating a new phase in the conflict. its no longer terrorists killing people, they are also engaging Defenders and a new layer of chaos is added. Now they will focus on each other until disaster strikes. And when it does a third layer initiates. The final layer would be the population sinking into a riot, creating a hell-on-Earth scenario that is almost impossible to stop, only mitigate as much as possible.\n\nThe goal here is to at all costs NOT make the civilians seem disposable or cumbersome. They should enrich the multiplayer experience, not take away from it. \n\nThis game idea is way too big, and is very focused on complex A.I. programming and acting, but maybe you can take some bits and pieces and make something out of it. 
1428761658|328c6x|Two See.|It was an odd idea. One that I'd been coming up with. \n\nIn this world, there are two children, or people.\n\nOne can see Blue light, the other can see Red, but nothing more.\n(Co-op is required here different screens, oculus whathaveyou.)\n\nThere are lights of each color around, and they must guide eachother. I wanted crawling, walking, and running. However, pressing shift, either one can, if they are near, grab the hand of the other. Leading one another through dangerous areas that only one person can see. (Think ico, but co-op.)\n\nFor a twist, I thought if each character was coloured differently and had a torch of the others' light, they would never see eachother, only their beams.\n\nI may not have thought this through enough, but what do you think?
1386185326|1s3ku3|A mech game where the first player pilots on a console and additional players use tablets or smart phones to provide maintenance.|I've been thinking a lot lately about games that focus on connecting ~~hardcore and casual players~~ fans of different genres of games and games that rely heavily on cooperation and putting groups of people in individual roles.\n\nThis idea is kind  of vague but it would basically be a game where the first player would play the game via a console or PC in the traditional way, using a controller and viewing gameplay through a TV or monitor. This player would pilot a mech or other vehicle, fighting AI enemies or perhaps other human opponents. Controls would be typical for a mech shooter.\n\nAdditional players would serve as the mech's engineering and maintenance crew and perform their duties by downloading an app to their smartphones and tablets. This app would link to the main game and would have several different screens and panels, each serving a different purpose and representing a different control panel for the mech. Each control panel would have a different set of puzzle and minigames to perform to provide the mech with better efficiency. Depending on how many additional players there are, each player can cover a certain control panel and divy out maintenence responsibilities. \n\nFor example, a person playing the engineering panel would operate a series of switches and play a rewiring minigame to divert power to whichever weapons system the pilot was using as a priority. The player on the navigational panel would view a sonar map and mark out enemies, which would then be marked on the pilot's screen so he wouldn't be ambushed. A player could act as a "maintenanceperson," switching between panels and putting out electrical fires when the mech takes damage, therefore minimizing the threat of the mech's destruction. \n\nThe HUD of the pilot would be minimal and the pilot would have to communicate with his crew to keep a gauge on health and ammo supply, as those details would only appear on certain screens of the maintenance players' tablets. In fact, communication all around would be key to the team's victory, providing an immersive experience to a team that works well together. In this game, teamwork trumps individual skill.\n\nPVP could rise to a tournament and championship level, pitting the best crews in the world against each other.
1363582745|1aib7o|A Game About The Butterfly Effect|Ideally this would be made with a visually stunning engine. Mechanics would be simple, you mostly just walk/run places and make decisions on everything. But everything you do matters.\n\nIt would begin with you waking up as a high schooler and needing to walk to school in the winter. HUD prompts (or possibly audio directions from the character) would tell the player where to go and if they decided not to then they could within reason. It wouldn't be a totally open world game, it would be a very detailed small game.\n\nSo let's say that instead of walking to school the player decides to run circles in the snow because the particle effect is really cool. Unfortunately, because of this they don't reach the a street with a crosswalk on time and don't press the pedestrian walk button, so a car crash occurs.\n\nThen you would wake up as a man in his forties working a desk job. maybe the player doesn't put a jacket on, so the character drops his keys because his hands are shaking, pushing back the time it takes to get him to the crosswalk, aiding in preventing the crash.\n\nIf it were as good as it could be you would simply go from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning with a bunch of different characters, each impacting the scene in a small way. You job as a player is to clean up your mess hat you made with the previous character.\n\nAnother great thing about this would be DLC galore, adding new characters could be done easily, making it a huge game over the course of a couple years.\n\nTL;DR: You have to clean up your own mess with different characters.
1383733139|1q0nlq|Frequency - A radio based RTS|Hey,    \nThis is just an idea I had bobbing around. I don't have the skills to make it, but hey, maybe I'll learn me some programming :p    \n    \nAnyway, the idea is based around a stripped down RTS based around orders for units taking time to transmit and recieve. Not a long time, but worst case scenario up to 30-40 seconds for a long distance secure order to reach a unit.    \n    \nSo when you give a unit a move/attack/whatever order it takes time for that order to propagate through your comms network so the unit can act on it.    \n    \nThere would be three main units:    \nBase - Large transmission radius. High defensive bonus for stationed troops    \nComms Station - Used to increase transmission range. Provides slight defensive bonus for stationed troops    \nTroops - Short transmission distance. Your fighting soldiers! These can recieve orders either direct from your base or via a comms station or via a nearby unit's radio.     \n\nThe key to the game is managing your communications infrastructure. \nYour base is the origin point of all your transmissions. If a unit is outside of your transmission range, they CANNOT act on any orders given. They will attempt to complete previously issued orders, or otherwise hold position. To receive an order the unit must be within the transmission range of the sending station (the unit's own transmission range does not matter when receiving). So for example, an order would originate from your base, bounce through a couple of comms stations, and then reach your unit.    \n\nThere are three speeds of radio transmission:    \nHardlink - used between a base and a comms station - very fast, secure    \nBuilding - Transmission from a base or comms station to a unit. Moderate speed, can be secure or unsecure (see below)    \nUnit - Troops can relay orders through their own radio sets to other troops. This is slow and always unsecure, and as such is not ideal. Try to keep your units in radio range of a building!     \n    \nTypes of communication:    \nSecure - Slower speed transmission, cannot be jammed, cannot be intercepted    \nUnsecure - Used using a shift or alt key command. 3x as fast as a secure transmission, but succeptable to jamming, and if an enemy unit is within your transmission range the enemy will see the order you gave your units! This can lead to some clever rusing - Send an unsecure order, followed by a secure order. Your enemy won't know the secure order has been sent and may still think your unit is following the unsecure order.    \n    \nAnyway, that's my ramblings for now. I might add more to it later.
1382503460|1p13zj|A new kind of apocalypse game.|So this game would take place before AND after the apocalypse. The first stage of the game is where you try to find food, water, shelter, maybe even companions, and whatever else you may need. \n\nThen strikes the apocalypse. This could be a randomly generated kind of apocalypse, like a nuclear fallout, zombies, the sun going out, etc. The cool thing about this mechanic would be that you would need to be prepared for anything and everything. Here's an example: \n\nSo you get into the game and immediately start gathering weaponry. You think that the worst thing possible could be the zombie apocalypse. So, it is a couple of nights later and you have this base full of weapons, food, and water. You think you have this whole apocalypse thing under control. Then, the apocalypse strikes. The temperature outside starts to drop down below freezing. You realize that an ice age has struck, and all you have is guns to defend you against the brutal cold. \n\nI don't have an idea for an endgame yet, maybe you need to survive a certain amount of days in the apocalypse or complete a list of goals. 
1437712418|3eer6i|Ready, set, Die!!|It's a "sandbox"/physics multiplayer game where you and your friends compete to kill yourselves in the most spectacular manner.    \nYou could run and jump directly into the wall until you eventually die, or strap an explosive to your head, light yourself on fire, jump out of the window, &amp; aim for an expensive car! The map provides all the physics based items to do this with and scores players on how spectacularly they "clock out" in 60 seconds.    \nIt's a very simple concept, very simple design, but it's gives the community map making tools, reputations like "psycho" or "mundane" based on their history, and it would be loads of fun and laughter for anyone who wants to sit for a quick game or two, or three.    \nWhat little features would you add? 
1423366356|2v5qcg|Personal thoughts on submitting Game Ideas|Hey guys, new to this sub-reddit. I am a student studying Software Engineering (Game programming) and am just starting my third year. Often during the holidays, when I finish work early or I am just bored, I work on hobby projects. I have experience with Android, c++, c#, Unity etc.. I often just make little puzzle games or test out mechanics and ideas that I have. I have found myself more and more trying to get inspiration from external sources, such as this sub-reddit. As a programmer I would just like to shed some light on your submissions. I am well aware that this sub-reddit is for ideas people aren't going to make themselves (and most likely no-one will) but no-one submits ideas for nothing. What I recommend to you all is to have a little look into game design documents and how to properly submit an idea. Almost every idea on here is too complex to make, not detailed enough and clearly not enough thought has been put into it being an actual game. I love taking ideas and inspiration from what I read, but if you guys really want results or more interest with your ideas, you should spend some time thinking how practical the idea is, and maybe just simplifying the whole idea down to a few main base mechanics. After all, this is how most unique games are developed. Keep the ideas coming, it really is interesting and useful hearing what people come up with! \n\nThanks for reading my criticism. No offence is intended to anyone, only to help increase the quality of the submissions on here and to help you guys think more on the lines of how games are actually developed etc.. \n\n-- PantherNZ
1431660430|360tlv|Lonely|A random game concept that I just thought up. In the game, you play as the typical RPG hero, except that none of the NPCs will interact with the player. This means the player can only gain information by listening in on conversations between NPCs. The player cannot buy anything, and if the player is pursued into the village by monsters, it is possible to die in the village with villagers looking on. So, instead of the player character being widely known and famous, the player is a humble and reclusive character who simply slays monsters, overhears about the threat of the big baddie from some of the villagers, and simply slays the monster as much for his own survival as much as the survival of everyone else.\n\nI hope that this unconventional take on the classic RPG will serve as a good/bad example for other developers to follow/use as a cautionary tale; I really don't know how the game will turn out, but if there's a developer out there that has experience making RPGs and is looking for an idea for a small project, please do consider making a first version of this game (hey, it's fine to do ascii graphics!)
1417288731|2ns185|Badass Game About Eskimos|I don't know if this is just me, but I would TOTALLY play a badass, graphically intense, Far Cry-Esque game about Eskimos.

I don't know about anyone else, but I think this a very underused topic in entertainment.
1441613991|3jy90j|A first person shooter in a medieval setting where you are a blind wizard who can only see through the eyes of your enemies.|
1441852261|3kc7l1|Color blind|So you start off only seeing white. You have a narrarator, he tells you where you are, what to do and some other random stuff. He guides you along your way until he says somrthing like "Oh no, they've found me.. There's sonething I need to tell you, there IS A WAY TO GET-" *cuts off* So now you're alone, but you see something in the distance. Its some yellow jewel. You get closer and touch it. Now you can see yellow. Maybe yellow flowers, the sun, bananas, and other stuff you'd see around. At this point the game would look weird because there would be random yellow stuff that looks as if its floating around, After a bit more exploring, you would find your next jewel, blue. Now you see the sky, and water, and everything thats blue. And then red would be last for the first chapter. (first chapter would be the primary chapter) The next chapter would be the secondary chapter with all the secondary colors, and then the third chapter would probably have some other colors like brown.\n\nSo you're happy now, you can finally see the world. But then darkness fills your screen, until all you see is black. Thats pretty much all I've thought of so far. If you have any ideas or like it, then pleas post below. Thanks
1448079364|3tnlpp|Guys this isn't r/gamedev|Instead of telling people what to do with their lives, just comment what you like or don't like about their game ideas or point them towards a game already made that's close enough to their idea they don't know about. I'm pretty sure that's what this sub is for. If they wanted their game to be made then they could post to that more popular sub.
1443242846|3mfg8s|Turn On The Lights - A Horror Concept|So the basic premise of this game combines typical horror elements with a focus on knowing what you are facing and where it is. You are tasked with the morning shift in an empty factory, and your first task is to turn on all the lights before the other workers arrive. To do this, the player must find switches using faint light pouring in from adjacent rooms already completed. The first room will already be lit when the player starts. The morning shift worker's job is to rid the factory of pests, monsters, and other horrible entities that come out during the night and remain as long as there is darkness in the factory.\n\nIf there is a monster in a room, the player will be able to hear it breathing even in darkness, and will be able to see its silhouette if it is exposed to light from an adjacent room. Some monsters flee into adjacent rooms when the lights are turned on, some will vanish entirely. Monsters which flee into nearby rooms will also vanish when all the rooms around them are already lit. However, some monsters will attack the player when the lights turn on. Monsters which flee or vanish will attack the player if touched in darkness. Monsters which attack when the room is lit will vanish when touched. The player must use the silhouette and sound of the monster to determine what kind it is (each kind will have a distinctive shape and a different trait to its breathing).\n\nIn summary, there are three kinds of monsters: when lights are turned on, one kind flees, one kind vanishes, and one kind attacks. But the former two attack when touched, while the latter vanishes. The player must decide whether to approach the monster or turn on the lights. Choosing correctly will remove the monster at least from the room. Choosing wrongly will result in the player being attacked and/or jumpscared (have not decided if I want that to be a part of the attack).\n\nCan't think of any ways to elaborate on this idea now but I know there are ways it could be improved.
1389146491|1uobzy|[Individual game mechanic] Recordable Audio Grenades|Just an idea I had a long time ago that I thought could be entertaining. Allowing players to record a small segment of audio with a grenade which when thrown will play that segment. I know it would probably be used mostly for profanities and other various inappropriate banter, but the thought amused me when I went over the many possible ideas which could be recorded, from music parts like "Rick Rolled", to "Gibberish nade" grumbling at you while flying overhead. An entertaining little device that I thought I could throw out there for anyone who thinks similarly and has greater means to actually use the idea.

I think the overall architecture of the game would make for a very interesting parkour game, and the location could have some very moving scenes about the poor living there.
1433790754|392bst|Solar powered rover exploration game|This game would be a 2D scrolling platformer game. Think a game mainly about exploration, maybe in the general style of Super Metroid but less combat.\n\nThe gimmick is that you are a solar powered rover (science bot on wheels) on a strange alien planet. Just below the surface is an intricate, dark cave system waiting to be explored (for science? for treasure?). \n\nMoving drains a little power. Drilling takes more power. You have few defenses against local creatures. If you run out of battery power stuck somewhere in the dark, it's game over (permadeath, or restart at the last point you had full batteries). So you must carefully conserve your battery reserves, and exploration becomes a risk/reward before you have to retreat back to safety.\n\nPart of exploring the planet is making sure you have a route back to the surface to regain power from the Sun. Sometimes you'll encounter (or drill) shafts of light to recharge in the middle of dark areas. You'll harvest batteries from other failed rovers and use them to go even deeper into the cavern depths.\n\nTL;DR: Metroid minus combat, plus solar powered.

1402943990|28atqy|[META] Let's talk about "Recruitment threads":|Congratulations, you have an idea for a video game!\n\nBut golly, maybe you're asking yourself: "What should I do now?" Well gee criminy, you certainly shouldn't write down the idea and share it on /r/gameideas! Heavens no, because that clearly isn't the sole purpose of this subreddit! \n\nThis subreddit is just chock full of game programmers, sound artists, and concept artists at your disposal! Why just write down the idea when you can have someone else make it for you? You should just make a new text post recruiting us to team up with you. Because we are absolutely, 100% willing to work for a complete stranger that has both zero programming experience and absolutely no team or time management experience ***FOR FREE!***\n\nYes, you heard right! We don't want to make a single dime off of our hard work and dedication towards the game idea some stranger on the internet had and recruited us to make. We're all somewhere in our 20's and 30's and have absolutely no food/electricity/water bills or crippling student loan debts, so we have absolutely no problem volunteering and devoting our precious time to *your* video game idea! After all, volunteer experience for another person's selfish endeavors is the most valuable thing you can do with your time asides from a stable job that actually pays money!\n\nSince we all want to work for free, we can also assume that you are an excellent team leader! Remember that one time in high school where you were assigned to lead a bunch of kids to glue facts about the Bill of Rights to a piece of cardboard for your History project? That's all the experience you'll ever need to manage 10 adults that have actual real lives in several parts of the world-- there's no way you'll ever have to worry about team members falling out of touch with you or backing out of your project or losing interest in your project because they can't afford to continue working on it for zero/menial pay and balance their own life at home at the same time! This is the real world, where money is never an issue, people will do anything for you if you ask them nicely enough, and they will stay with you throughout the entire development process regardless of how long it takes to make your game!\n\nWhy, the development process is easy as pie, too! It's entirely possible to make a game in just a few days if you wanted to! How hard could it be to come up with rough drafts of character sketches, write and flesh out a story, decide on the final story and character designs, create all of the art that will be used in the game, compose an entire soundtrack and sound effects, write down, program, play-test, and refine level designs, enemies, and bosses (and their AIs), market the game through video game journalism websites that will have no problem halting their coverage of the new Call of Duty for your game, and completely finish a product from start to finish within a certain time frame without losing interest or losing team members that suddenly go off the grid? It's a piece of cake, so of course we shouldn't ever expect to be paid for anything!\n\nSo just remember, the next time you have a game idea, don't just tell us the game idea, beg us to work for you instead!\n\n**TL;DR IF YOU WRITE A POST IN THIS SUBREDDIT ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE YOUR GAME (ESPECIALLY FOR FREE) YOU DESERVE TO HAVE A CACTUS SHOVED UP YOUR ASS SIDEWAYS**
1431736663|364c70|An online game where you evade a murderer|No, not like Gmod. This came to me in a dream.\nIt's a first person game where you find yourself in a mid sized map, such as a state fair or something. Huge crowds. Most people are AI but lets say about 10 or 15 people are real players. One player is a serial killer. All the players can work together to evade the killer or turn on each other. Some players might get randomly selected traits, such as being a parent. This would mean they would have to hold the hand of a child all the time. The other players might be morally swayed by the safety of the child. Basically in the dream I had, me and some other players where on a low bride over a state fair. The bride had a crate lift that took about a minute to lower a family needed to be raised up, but the killer was in a car about 30 seconds away from the bridge, so the family might get saved but it could mean letting the killer on the bridge. I think it would be very cool, but 3D games are not my area of programming expertise. let me know what you guys think. 
1429930381|33s7er|Save the Light|Light has gone from the universe, and it's up to you to find out why.\nGame starts out almost entirely pitch black, until you remember your cell phone light.  \nFlash! The world illuminates, almost blinding you.  \nAlmost immediately, you cell phone light starts darkening, leaving the room only lightly outlined from far away.  \n\n  I envision Save the Light to be a strategy adventure game where light is a tool, weapon, and limited resource.  \nMid-game, the roles are reversed as Light takes revenge on Dark, leaving the screen blindingly white. Story moves towards an understanding that both Light and Dark have roles to play.  \n  \n  During Dark, story characters are affected by a sense of hopeless despair and become very destructive. During Light, Characters become  giddy with mania, over optimistically attempting to achieve their wildest dreams.   \nScattered around are various objects that produce light (later darkness) but only last so long and with so much effectiveness. Obtaining and properly rationing Light will allow players to view and unlock marvelous storytelling elements in addition to optional side quests.  \nOne possible way to ration light would be Flash and "feel" you way through the room with surround sound. Game controller would have vibrations to correspond left right or front.
1450163378|3wwscw|Had a game idea while watching Grave Encounters : horror|
1372318252|1h5zju|My game idea!|I've heard about augmented reality games, and recently I was thinking about when I was a kid and I would be in the car and I used to look out the window and put my hand next to it and pretend my hand was a little man who was jumping and dodging things, and I heard that I wasn't the only one who did this as a kid. So basically I was wondering if a game like this exists only where you can point your phone camera outside of a car and you can actually control a virtual character and make it into a proper game? I don't know if a game like this exists but I think it would be a cool idea. \n\nWould love to hear feedback. :D
1437238449|3dr0ia|A quirky game about an old man obsessed with his lawn.|\nIn a quiet small town neighborhood, old man McGoober just wants to be left alone with his beautiful grass ...and for kids to stop writing the word "gobbler" at the end of his name on his mailbox. \n You, Mr. McGoober, must shower the lawn with a nozzled water hose, evenly as possible, trying not to swamp certain areas or neglect others. The grass will grow at the rate of having to be cut once a week, at which time you'll get a weekly score for how well you've done based on how straight you pushed the mower, yard cleanliness (you didn't just mow over a styrofoam cup did you?), and how evenly you watered the lawn will show at this time too. This is an indication of how satisfied old-loony-goober is (as the local kids call him). The thing is: people just can't stay the hell off your lawn! Occasionally, some punk kid will try to ride his bike through your yard and cut dirt tracks across your grassy domain. Whack him with your trusty cane when he makes a 2nd pass and show him how you earned your psycho rep among the neighborhood kids. Your stupid neighbors stupid dog is also taking a healthy dump on the wrong side of Goober territory and it's the same one that frequently urinates on the mailbox. Grab the newspaper and throw it like a curve ball to his face before the old mans irritation meter hits a boiling g point. Between the mailman taking shortcuts through your grass, thru traffic throwing trash out the window, and local teens flinging rolls of toilet paper over your fence, your irritation meter is the thing to watch. If it boils over, I'm afraid old Goober will have to be committed and all is lost. Your weekly retreat to your lawn mower is your salvation. Cleaning the yard, tidying up, good watering, and an even cut all increase your satisfaction meter which reduces your irritation level in direct proportion. Every couple of weeks it seems like another damned holiday to spice things up. Here you can make little decisions. It's Halloween, so you embrace it and hand out candy but run the risk of trick-or-treaters trampling your grass, or disown the occasion but risk upsetting neighborhood kids to the point that they give you even more hell than usual? What's the end game? The ultimate goal is to keep a lawn that's so nice, so consistently, that your neighbor across the street, Mr. Pecker gets so jealous that he moves away. Don't worry, the kids like to write the word "checker" at the end of his name too, just to keep things on an even keel. As a bonus (the game has day/night cycles) McGoober may every once in a while sneak across the street under the cover of night to litter Pecker's lawn, dump some bagged dog poop, or turn his push mower upside down so that Pecker can't cut his grass this week. Just don't get caught because that's the quickest way for loony Goober to get thrown in the loony house! But, all these things make you, Old-Goob, feel better and lowers stress. This will also speed up Old Wrinkly Pecker getting jealous and beating it out of there. That's the basic idea of it. It's a fun, quirky game for an Indie developer and completely original. Show me some criticism guys!
1422822867|2ufvso|Who wants to play a generic dispensable NPC?|Think of any action video game where generic NPCs are slaughtered just because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (examples: the first level of Halo, the beginning of Skyrim). Do you ever feel bad about them? Of course not! We always control the main character, the hero that always make it out alive. What if we weren't?\n\nImagine a game where the player controls the numerous generic dispensable characters and has the sole objective of trying to get them out of some doomed area alive.\n\nFirst the player chooses the setting of the crisis. Is the tragedy happening in a city, a skyscraper, a sinking vessel, a spaceship, a forest, a haunted mansion...? Is the danger an asteroid, an alien invasion, an outbreak of giant bloodthirsty monsters, a volcanic eruption, a zombie apocalypse...? Once the player has chosen the setting, the game generates it and the player tries to save as many lives as possible by controlling the characters, one by one and from a first person's perspective, and leading them out of the danger zone.\n\nObviously the odds of survival would be low. All of the hazards and baddie attacks would be OHKO's. Some characters in some settings, like soldiers and policemen, could have weapons, but their effectiveness would be close to null. Whenever a controlled character is lead to safety or dies, the player gets to control another one.\n\nThe player would have two perspectives of the game. When the game starts and between characters, the player would have an overhead view of the map. He can't control anything from there, but he can spot the exits and dangers. When ready, the player is given control of a randomly selected character with a first person view and no minimap until the character is either safe of dead.\n\nTo spice things up, the game could also feature "heroes", characters that are guaranteed to survive. The player could choose to follow those  "protagonists" for better odds of survival. But do the NPCs that tail the heroes in video games always make it? Nope, and this game wouldn't be different. Thought he could try to lead other characters to safety, the player would obviously never get to control one of those designated heroes.\n\nSo what do you think of my game idea? This is the first time I've ever posted something on the internet. If anyone likes my gimmicky ideas, I have plenty more to share.

1424456026|2wkkjm|Weird Physics FPS|The idea is have physics weapons in a first person shooter. You can shoot positive/negative gravity items that stick to the wall and influence the gravity of all players. The gravity can further be animated, meaning fluctuating intensity or also rotational fields. You can further shoot positive/negative gravitational bombs/rockets/grenades that bounce off. Also additional gravitational animations/static gravity can be encoded in the level geometry, enabling to walk up the wall at certain points or walk on the ceiling. 
1448127211|3tpof7|A silly, rather rage inducing simulator (Surgeon Simulator like, I suppose).|It might not be something anyone wants to make or play, but I thought I'd put it out there. (Disclaimer: I don't code and I'm going off my husband's suggestion for a flair. I'm sorry if it's not accurate.)\n\nGet Your Kids Ready to Play in the Snow\n\nObjectives: Get your (two) fully dressed kids outside. This requires them to be wearing: pants, shirt, socks, coat, snow pants, gloves, hat, and boots.\n\nThe challenging part: They start off with pants, shirt, and socks on, but that may not always be so. The little one may decide that pants are not for him and he'd rather run away and hide behind the door with one of the older one's boots while you try to get the older one to keep his damn gloves on. Once you finally find the little one and get his pants on, the older one doesn't think he needs a coat anymore and a shirt will be just fine. Why doesn't the little one's left boot fit on? Well, you might need to check and see if there's a toy in it. (Or maybe it's a live octopus or a life-sized bike, I don't know, it's a ridiculous game.)\n\nThe children don't talk (maybe they laugh at you mockingly; "ha ha, you can't get me!"), the controls aren't great, and I figure it'd be funniest if you could accidentally KO the kids or something. (For example, lift the little one's foot up too fast in an attempt to get his boots on and you accidentally make him slam his head against the wall. Or zip up a coat without being aware of where your other hand is and now you're missing some fingers.) Like I said in the title, think Surgeon Simulator.
1440622610|3iiiia|A Game Narrated as if it were a YouTube video|The game could be of any type. I had a platformer in mind but I think it could translate well to more than that.\n\nThere would be no in game dialogue (characters talking to each other) rather everything would be explained and voiced over as if it were someone playing the game in one of those 'let's play...' type series or like they were streaming.\n\nThey could give hints if you get stuck in certain places. "Someone in chat explained that this puzzle can be solved by doing _______ " or something to that effect. \n\nIf you went with someone streaming the game you could implement the streams chat and viewers. Some sort of entertainment meter that if you fill you get more viewers who will help you with more hints, etc. Have a bank of comments that have % chance of being made when doing X or Y in the game. Taking over a minute to solve a puzzle, increased chance to get a hint by a commenter depending on number of viewers and how much time has passed. \n\nIt could make the game funny if you went that route with it. You could have troll commenters telling you to do things that'll hinder you also. \n\nI think it could be pretty interesting if done properly but would require a massive amount of voice work on one persons part haha. Or you could have different stages of the game played by different streamers/youtubers to mix it up.\n\nLet me know if you all have any further ideas that'd help flesh this out :)\n\nEdit: also you could have the narrator have responses to comments made by "viewers". If you went with the YouTube styles videos each chapter or act in the game could be the start of another video in the series. You could have the one guy/gal playing the game and a friend sitting with him so they can joke with each other and have conversations about what's happening.
1429153485|32rhol|Runaway Slave Video Game|I'm new to this subreddit and this is my first time posting, so please bear with me if I make any formatting mistakes:\n\nI'm envisioning this as a 3-D Third Person Stealth Survival Horror, where you're a fugitive slave attempting to escape to freedom.\n\nit's set in Colonial America during Antebellum Slavery\nI was thinking you'd play as a a slave and then could switch over to an Abolitionist\nAs a slave, you're goal is to escape to freedom i.e. The North\nYou're running for your life, you're being hunted by slave catchers with dogs.\n\nSo stealth would play a major part, you're not a ninja, or some other powerful character, you're basically an average person in dire circumstances. Combat is not the focus it's a last resort kind of thing.\n\nSo the game starts off at your master's plantation, you spend a couple days, weeks, this would be the tutorial, showing the controls and rudimentary systems, etc. You could play minigames (Cutting Sugarcane, Tending Farm Animals, learning the Alphabet-This becomes essential because the signs on the roads would be nothing but chickenstratch until you learn letters, you learn all of them you can readall the signs, maybe learning how to swim, picking cotton, etc.) You can gather supplies at the plantation (stealing food, acquiring a compass, maybe stealing a machete/or other farm implement to use as a weapon).\n\n You could try to convince others to leave with you but it puts you at risk since anyone could be a traitor and rat you out to Master. Then you make a break for it one night, the rest of the game would be navigating through country roads, forests, swamps, towns, etc as you try to make it to a certain point on the map where you can escape.\n\nThe obstacles in your way would include slave catchers, slave owners, Watchmen, Dogs, Law Enforcement and natural hazards like wild animals, poor weather, sickness, and injuries. Also you would have to make hard decisions think The Walking Dead Telltale series, maybe you come across a fellow escapee who's injured you could use your own supplies to help them or abandoned them.\n\nAlso a gameplay mechanic would be one for the dogs who can smell you, you can use pepper, or poisoned meat to distract them off your scent trailor cover yourself with mud to mask your scent, as to not alert them.\n\nthe slave would also have to scavenge for resources in the wild(hunt animals for meat, gather berries, etc), find shelter (shed, cave, etc)and i was thinking of having a basic crafting system.\n\nAlso instead of a game over screen or permadeath I was thinking this: Each time you get captured your slave master punished you severely, so much that it affects your stats. Each punishment would get progressively worse: 1. Publicly Whipped(bring down the morale stat.), 2. You get branded with an R (Runaway) this will prevent your character from using a pass(forged or real) 3. You lose an Ear, hindering you're ability to hear your enemies as clearly 4. Mulitilation-Loss of a hand, or a foot. This will keep your character from being effective at navigating and combat.\n\nNow when you play as an Abolitionist the gameplay changes it's not about sneaking to freedom, it's more about the choices you have to make to help slaves achieve freedom.\nYour decisions affect who gets caught, who lives, who dies and who gets to freedom.\n\nThe abolitionists vary since he/she can travel more places without having to avoid slave catchers or the like. Also you get access to era-appropriate firearms and melee weapons(Axe, Sword, etc).\nYou can raid plantations, gather intelligence about situations and characters, and even just buy a slave their freedom(There would be an economy system in place but you cant just buy every slave)\n\nAlso The Abolitionist would have a covered wagon, he could transport slaves in, it would be a whole system, with checkpoints where you can pass a dialogue check, bribe the guards, or use your pistol/rifle just in case things get heavy.\n\nThis is an "extremely controversial" and "story-based game" rooted in true events of American Slavery, it's an interesting way to interactively explore a period of history that doesn't get it due. \n\nAlso, perhaps historical figures could factor in like Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, John Brown, William Lloyd.\n\nMaybe include Bleeding Kansas, a series of violent political confrontations in the United States involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery "Border Ruffian" elements, that took place in the Kansas Territory and the neighboring towns of the state of Missouri between 1854 and 1861.  \n\n
1439499102|3gw8eq|Feature Idea: The story is being told by an unreliable narrator.|RPG and action games would benefit most from this. In between segments of the game, the bits in between are narrated during the loading screens. \n\ni.e.\n\n*And so I hit another slime with a sword. Tired yet? I am. I've said that at least five hundred times the past week!*\n\nIf a character dies, the narrator goes "wait, wait, sorry, that didn't actually happen, my mistake. What actually happened was..." \n\nbefore you restart from the last checkpoint.\n\nThere should be lots of witty snarking about events during gameplay too.\n\nExample 1: character is standing idle for five minutes: *And then I waited. I'm not entirely sure why I waited, I did have things to do, but it seems that I just took a short standing rest for a while. Any time soon I was about to spring into action. Any time. I think.*\n\nExample 2: character is decapitated: *And then I had my head chopped off. \n\n...\n\nWhat, I got better! Oh, fine. What really happened was...*
1437946862|3ep7qn|Cheater|Cheaters is an action game that's a throwback to the golden days where cheat codes reigned as holy grails to millions of kids and young adults.    \nThe main characteristic of the game is the players ability to type in cheat codes to achieve their objectives. The first thing the player does in the game is type in a cheat code to spawn a weapon in their inventory, for instance. Of course, it's only as the game progresses that the player learns more powerful cheats. The first ammo cheat you learn only refills your pistol ammo, later in the game you've discovered infinite ammo.    \nAs your cheats become more powerful so do your enemies, keeping you on your toes. The game will seek to feature all the well known cheats from the games of yesteryear, such as walking through walls and even god mode.    \n**The story is simple but explains much of the gameplay**.    \nYour character is the hero of a series of retro games who was programmed into a modern action game as an Easter egg by a nostalgic game dev.    \nAs you may have guessed, he becomes self aware. This happens when he is discovered by generic player and added to an achievement list. The main menu of the game represents this. Your character begins in a trophy room, leaves through an exit, and enters a room with a few doors titled "New Game", "Load Save", "Options", etc...    \nAs the story unfolds, you basically find this game you're in is an always online game connected to an anti cheat server. The more you cheat, the more detectable you become and enemies will attempt to debuff you. Some cheats are easily detectable and some aren't, it depends on the extent of the cheat. Ammo refill, not a big deal. Walking through walls, you have a few seconds before you get caught. I think this balances the players abilities with keeping the game challenging.    \nThe cheats you find are, themselves, Easter eggs tucked away in levels by the same nostalgic developer who planted you in the game. The problem is that you were never intended to be a playable character. The bug that unlocked you was discovered during the alpha release of the game, and patched in v1.0. Upon starting a new game, you read the patch note explaining this. This tells the hero that if they were to die, the game will reset and install the patch, locking them in oblivion. Each level comes to represent the main character surviving updates to rid it of bugs, mainly him, as each level is marked as v1.01, v1.02, and so on, and at the end of each level you find a strand of code to change your programming just enough to avoid being deleted. For immersion, I'd have the player manually type in this strand of code into the cheat prompt.    \nStory wise, you find out that you're not so different from the enemies you've been fighting. You're not really a retro Easter egg at all. You're more like a virus. You're actually a mod created by a nostalgic game dev who played no part in the actual development of the game you're in. This is revealed in the final patch note where the lead designer expresses giving up on busting cheaters and embraces the modding community.    \nI'm gonna cut this short and just say its all a throwback to the days of cheat codes, as well as a contemporary take on game developers often being at odds with their fan base, and ultimately seeing the light and warming up to community oriented game models.    \n    \n**Edit: there seems to be a lot of ideas floating around right now that have to do with breaking the fourth wall. I don't know why this is but this is not intended rip them off or discount them in any way. They all sound like good, creative ideas.**
1398737266|248qf7|A game where you are Earth and must defeat all Humans|As the title says.  It could be like a sim/god game where you control wind/ocean currents, asteroids hitting, volcanoes, tectonic plate movements, floods, avalanches, etc. to try to wipe out the human race as it slowly survives each attack and improves in technology / survivability with each wave.
1412504167|2icjjt|Möbius: just a really simple concept.|Basically, the mobius band is a shape with only one side (Google it) and if you follow the path, you end up on the opposite side to where you started.\n\nI have no other story details, but I just thought, wouldn't it be freaking awesome if you played the role of a good guy and throughout the game  and without even realising it, the player kinda turned evil. (The other way around seems kind of boring)\n\nThere are games out there that do really well with showing character development throughout the story but I just figured that it'd be awesome if they did a complete 180 and the ending really highlighted this.\n\nI'm not sure how the player wouldn't become aware of it, maybe the game actually physically changes the appearance of certain characters so that the player feels compelled to kill them (because they think it's the right thing to do) and then at the end, the protagonist suddenly becomes aware they've been doing very bad things for the past few hours.\n\nI apologise if I didn't delve too deeply, it's just I read about mobius bands and instantly metaphorised it into a story in my head and figured I'd post it on reddit lol\n\nI also apologise if this is already a game, I rushed over here too quickly to check
1448856911|3ut3p7|My simple yet complicated idea|The simple:\nA monster that evolves as it hunts you, hurts you, and kills you and vice versa\n\nA little back ground on the idea:\nhttp://aigamedev.com/open/article/evolving-virtual-creatures/\n\nThe complicated:\nThe monster will be an evolving virtual creature(EVC).  For the algorithm to work it will be given a starting morphology and then it  will be trained on various mechanics before your first encounter.  Also it will need a reward system for the various fitness algorithms to enhance it. Each fitness reward will nudge its behavior and morphology in a certain direction. I.e. Climbing, sneaking, attacking, charging, perception, etc.  By the time of your first encounter it will be an easy bumbling target.  By mid or end game you will be matching wits against the creature trying to survive.
1435074591|3auaio|Treehouse base-building, recycling-gathering kids game|Here's a resource gathering, base-building game idea that is smaller scale than open-world survival.\n\nYou're a kid in the suburbs building a treehouse. You collect materials by wandering the neighborhood and picking up trash. Recyclable materials (e.g. metal, glass, plastic, paper) are used as crafting material for base features. Each "day" could last a short time, starting with items randomly spawned in the neighborhood. Return to the treehouse for the crafting and building.\n\nThat's all it has to be. The three basic game states: running around to gather items, crafting menu to convert recyclables into building pieces/furniture, and base-building where created parts are placed to expand the base.
1449012736|3v2g5e|A similar game to The Movies, but for porn [NSFW]|For those who don't know what The Movies was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Movies\n\nThis game would be very similar to The Movies, but as it is focused on porn, it would have unique stats such as penis size, breast size, ass size, sexual orientation, etc. There would also be different categories of movies such as striptease, masturbation, teacher-student, incest, plumber, and the like. And of course, you could customize your own porn star to your taste.\n\nThis was inspired by a dream I had last night of making naked women on Blender.
1440845370|3iu0ri|[Abstract] A Game in which you are terrible at everything you do.|This is a bit of a strange one, and I can't think of any video game down this line of thinking, but the basic concept is this.\n\nIt's a comedy game, you are an unwilling and unfitting hero in a long awaited prophecy, and you are kidnapped one day by people who tell you "You are THE Guy of Utmost Importance!"\n\nThe plot is never really explained properly, you're just given a gun, and you are sent out, and you have to kill people in various different ways.\n\nUnfortunately for you, you are bad at all these ways. You'll trip over your own feet a lot, your gun will jam, doors will always seem to not open on first try, when trying to use a sniper you drag it along the floor on it's front end (the bit where bullets release), and when you try to stab people it often becomes just a button mashing desperate attempt.\n\nI want the game to kind of exist like a parody on a lot of modern games, in the same ways that Leslie Nielson parodied a lot of spy movies in his day.\n\nI literally thought of this today so I get that it's not good but hopefully someone out there takes this and runs.
1385503674|1riyr8|You are a bird, in an urban landscape.|Be a crow, a raven, a pidgeon, whatever.  Along with all things birds do like eating, flying, pooping, mating, and making noise (pedestrians + pooping = awesome).  Massive multiplayer is a given.  Create a murder of crows with your friends, terrorize pedestrians or get into fights with other gangs of bird folk.  The city I would envision would be something like Seattle; lots of trees, variable terrain and buildings.  On top of this, maybe you could have the option of being a cat, and hunting birds.  Or maybe a crazy cat lady option, with an army of cats to attack armies of birds.  You could imagine the hilarity of the narrative that would ensue with characters like this.\n\nSomeone make it, god damnit.
1413085744|2j01wi|An idea me and my friend had.|I thought of an idea for a game: the premise is that you play as a man inside of his own mind while he is in a coma.  When you start out parts of his face are distorted or gone (not like torn or cut away, like as if he were made of pixels and a few just kinda weren't there), and you regain them through boss fights, along with memories and powers. The bosses are identical copies of the man with different powers and face parts, both of which you regain after the fight.  The copies of the man are actually parts of his personality, such as rage, sadness, fear, and creativity.  The man has traveled all over the North american continent, and the areas in the game are different places where major events in his life occurred. Since his mind is fractured, at certain points in the game you could be in Quebec and then suddenly be in the Keys.  Through this ordeal, he not only learns how his own mind works, but how the human mind works in general. While he is in the coma, through conversations with people close to him (just "memories," giving him cryptic instructions, not the actual people), he figures out that the coma wasn't accidental.  After he wakes up, he is able to quickly take down the person who put him in the coma using things he learned while unconscious.\n\nWhat do you think?
1436144154|3c90tg|My Childhood Dream: A Detailed, Immersive, Challenging, Prehistoric Park Builder. (Discussion VERY Welcome)|I, like many people, had that phase as a young child during which dinosaurs were THE shit. I, like slightly less people, never lost the sense of wonder surrounding the fact that these hulking machines of flesh and bone walked the earth that we now inhabit. I think it's a minor tragedy that we will never be able to  really admire the beauty of ancient life in all of its glory. But, all romanticism aside, I would love to see a game that allowed the dinosaur-geek in all of us to experience their own slice of prehistory. I often ponder how this game would play when I'm waiting to fall asleep, in the car, and the like. My base ideas draw heavily from my childhood favorites : Zoo Tycoon and Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis; taking concepts from both, and adding some modern flair.\n\nSo here's what I've got so far. These ideas are welcome to change and I would love some creative input. I'll start off with the major tenets essential to delivering the player experience that I envision.\n\n1.  A Multitude of Detailed Animals\n\nOne thing that I always yearned for in the aforementioned ZT and JPOG was a greater catalog of animals. In my idea, ( which from here on out I will refer to as "Revival". Cheesy as all hell I know, but it's short and sweet,) there would be a large range of species encompassing prehistoric reptiles, dinosaurs in particular, amphibians, mammals, marine life, and possibly Pterosaurs as well. An emphasis would be placed on detail; custom animations would be made for as many animals as possible. The idea here is to give the player a sense of connection and awe of their creations. In the aspect of animal design, scientific accuracy would be critical. Yes, that means some of the dinosaurs would be feathered. But they'd be badass feathers.\n\n2. Somewhat Challenging Gameplay\n\nRevival would be meant to be played on its "campaign" mode, in which there would be standard tycoon gameplay , i.e. , the balance of funds, guest and animal happiness, etc. However, it would be somewhat unique in the sense that the major emphasis would be placed on exhibit design and careful observation to learn each species' likes and dislikes to achieve maximum suitability. Of course, this would have to well balanced, interesting and not overly difficult, to keep from becoming frustrating. Optional hints or an in-game encyclopedia could help. New species would unlock in tiers; the idea being that in the beginning you were somewhat limited to more "basic" creatures, but as you progressed there would be more interesting selections. Depending on the species, getting the animals to breed in captivity would be difficult, hopefully creating a sense of achievement when you finally see your lady Rex building herself a nest. There would be a few special animals that would be unlocked through challenges, rather than progression. Of course there would also be a customizable sandbox mode, in which the player could toggle auto-maximum happiness, unlock-all, and such.\n\n3. Powerful Creative Toolbox\n\nThe player would be able to customize their plot before beginning a new park with a set of flexible terraforming tools. These same tools would be available during the game, but would cost money to use. There would be a variety of themes of building and decoration, to give the player as much creative freedom as possible. The terraforming would also tie in to the animal care aspect, with certain animals taking to alpine terrain and others to desert, etc.\n\n4. Mod Support\n\nDespite their best efforts, realistically, the devs would only be able to create so much content before the game needed to be finished. And while there could be potential for expansion packs, (this could be how mammals and marine life are implemented,) the game would be designed in the most mod-friendly  way possible, to give the community the ability to create the new content that they wanted to see.\n\nSo those are the pillars of Revival. Like I said, much emphasis would be on making the animals feel alive. So pack and herd behavior would be fleshed out.\n\nOne thing that I imagined very vividly in my head was the way a new dinosaur( or any other creature that was born of an egg), would be delivered to the exhibit that you assigned it. The player would select the species in the menu, and would be given the option to choose gender and whether they wanted a single egg or a clutch of unrelated specimens. Then they would select the location in which the egg(s) would be placed. Instead of the egg(s) instantly being there, there would be a detailed sequence in which one of the hired rangers/scientists (haven't decided which one should do it,) would walk to one of the player-built genetics labs and retrieve the egg(s), which they would wheel to the exhibit in some sort of incubation cart. The keeper would place them in the location that the player had specified, and then erect a temporary incubation unit over the makeshift nest. After enough in-game time had passed, the egg(s) would begin to hatch, and the ranger/scientist would return to remove the incubator. The purpose of the whole thing is to create a sense of excitement and suspense in the player for their new baby animals. Kind of like a watered-down version of getting a new puppy. I need to give more thought on how the operations for non terrestrial-egg-laying creatures would play out.\n\nWell, there's what I've got so far. I'd love to bounce ideas around with whoever's interested and I will likely update this post as I flesh the game out better in my head and if other people are interested. I'm glad to finally have this fantasy of mine written out. Alas, I'm kind of like John Hammond. I have the dream, but lack the skills to make it happen myself. But unlike John Hammond, I don't have the money required to make other people do it for me.\n\n
1442496477|3latan|A thriller/horror game.|So the game has to be first person, in order for this to work it has to be very immersive. You start in a kitchen of a home, doing some idle chores. You are tasked with some simple stuff just to get used to the controls, a tutorial pretty much. Picking up food and returning it, answering the phone. A short call from a telemarketer to introduce the dialog system. Just some simple interaction stuff.\n\nAfter this is complete you hear the front door opening and your wife returning home. You go and talk with her and a short conversation ensues before she tells you that she's tired and is going to take a bath. Now your told to go and watch TV, you go to the couch, sit down and switch on the TV. After a few seconds your vision starts to blur and the protagonist complains of a headache. Now your objective is to go back into the kitchen to retrieve some tablets, on your way back you begin to stumble and fall (like feeling lightheaded and dizzy) and eventually you pass out... You awake to lying on the couch with your wife sitting next to you comforting you. "What happened?" you ask. She explains that she found you on the floor passed out. After explaining that the last thing you remember is having a headache and taking medication for it, you begin to notice the ceiling behind her moving and bending, the walls are tearing away to reveal what appears to be a padded room, her face becomes distorted and her voice slurs as she asks you "what's wrong". You begin to feel yourself drifting away, your eyes open and close and each time everything seems further and further away, then your eyes close. \n\nYou awaken again in a padded room. You sit up, then stand up and are back in control of the player after a few minutes someone comes to the door and opens up a small latch and says "it's time for therapy". You immediately question where you are and where your wife is, what is this place etc. To which the man replies "ahh not this again". He calls for others and they open the door and rush you, holding you down and injecting you with a sedative. \n\nYou regain consciousness strapped to a chair in a small room, there's a table in front of you with an empty chair the other side, one light dangles from the ceiling, only just illuminating the table. It's almost like an interrogation room. A man walks in wearing a white coat, and sits down. He opens his folder and begins to scan through before saying "Ahh yes, Patient C. I've been told you were fantasizing about that imaginary wife of yours again, and here I was thinking we had made so much progress with you". \n\n\nSo my ideal dialog system would be that of games like, fallout or skyrim where you are given choices from which you can reply. I won't sit here and write the whole conversation between the protagonist and the "Therapist" (which I've already scripted). But to give you an idea, the conversation will be about you questioning where you are, etc. And the therapist explaining that after a year of progress you've fallen back into these fantasies. The choice as the player will be to believe it or not. The idea of the game is to keep the player guessing about what is real and what's only just an illusion or fantasy. Throughout the game you will find documents and files and if read, they will give you some insight as to what could be going on. \n\nIn the interest of time, I'll fast forward and talk about an objective you will come across. So throughout the game you'll be exploring the mental institution (There'll be open areas you are free to walk and restricted areas that, being caught in them will result in being returned to your room) you'll meet other patients and guards etc. At one point one of the patients tells you "they're all lying, we're not who they say we are. They call us by letters because they're afraid if we know our true names we will remember who we truly are". He then tasks you with breaking into an office to recover documents that would either prove or disprove what he's saying. Bare in mind some of these people you meet could be completely insane. You're not told which room the file is in, so depending on your own choice, you will get the right or wrong answer or just something completely insignificant. Most of the objectives in the game will be open and do not have to be completed, but could help you further into the game. \n\n\nA few times when you are required to return to your room and sleep, you will flash back to the house with your wife, but things will be inconspicuously different each time. Causing more confusion, if the player picks up on them. \n\nI have written down countless dialog's of conversations, objectives, possible plot lines, twists and multiple endings. Even some game play mechanics I feel would better immerse the player into the game. \n\nIf anyone wants to hear more, or has any ideas/suggestions or straight up questions. Let me know.\n
1431554948|35vo60|Monarchy Simulator - What Sims Medieval Should Have Been|#Name\n\nThe Kingdom\n\n#Concept Overview\n\nA game that puts you at the very center of an age-old feudal medieval land. You play the leader of a house and attempt to rule the entire nation by the end of the forty-year period. You do this through espionage, battle, diplomacy, immigration etc.\n\n#Plot\n\nYou are Lord X of House Carron (Where X = A player chosen first name). House Carron rules over a small portion of the nation of Geralda, called 'The Horselands'. The people of the Horselands are renowned for, you guessed it, horses. Located in the south of Geralda, The Horselands are filled with rolling hills and grassy plains. Geralda as a nation is in turmoil. The more northern Kingdoms are constantly at war, and the plague of the west is claiming more and more lives every day. The east was lost to bandits only the last year. Now remains nine Kingdoms. The Horselands, Kerran, Snow Peaks, Redrock, Moon Lake, The Northern Eyes, The Greylands, Blunt and Darkstone Basin.\n\nThe night of your coronation, you are visited by a spectre. She explains to you that in forty years time, a great evil will be upon Geralda, and only you are capable of stopping it. She says you must do whatever it takes to unite the nation, cure the plague and banish the bandit coast. Or else Geralda will suffer a fate worse than death. She brands your hand with a mark, so that you may show the people of your divine blessing.\n\nThis is where our game begins, over forty years you must do everything in your power to prevent the evil force from taking over Geralda.\n\n#Setting\n\nGeralda is akin to medieval Britain in both it's culture and technology. The neighbouring country of Erredos lends no hand in your task, and is shrouded in mystery. It is said magic originated in Erredos.\n\nThe Horselands are your home, and the Carron family is loved here.\n\nKerran is a dark, dirty place, filled with thieves and scoundrels. Most of it's citizens live in poverty, but it is rumoured there is a great espionage guild deep underground. Kerran is ruled by the Denton Family.\n\nSnow Peaks is a mountainous region, inhabited by the Dwellers. People of low intelligence, but great strength. It is littered with expensive mines. Snow Peaks is ruled by the Kanlac Family.\n\nRedrock is another plains Kingdom, but is renowned for it's builders and architects. They use the red stone of the land in most of their building and contraptions, and it keeps them sturdy and strong. Redrock is ruled by the Joyce Family.\n\nMoon Lake is a tranquil land. Peaceful people inhabit it, all very skilled in green magic. That is healing, soothing, aide and mysticism. Moon Lake is ruled by the Orryn Family.\n\nThe Northern Eyes are mountains to the very north of Geralda. Myth says they used to guard the land from dragons who would fly south from the mythical island of Draconia. Here we have great warriors, and even better weapons. The Northern Eyes are ruled by the Stonegut Family.\n\nThe Greylands are marshes to the west. The plague has only just begun here. The Greylands are home to great scholars and historians. The Greylands are loved by all citizens of Geralda. They are ruled by the Ford Family.\n\nBlunt is a rocky region to the west. Next to the bandit coast. It is famous for it's great alchemist guild. It is ruled by the Wenders Family.\n\nAnd lastly we have Darkstone Basin. The land of Red Magic. That is, magic that can be used in combat. Darkstone Basin is ruled by the Thorne Family.\n\n#Characters/Abilities\n\nThe major characters are your advisors. You have a small council, each member has a particular job. By choosing which members of your kingdom fill each job, you open up different options.\n\nYou begin with four advisors; \n\nPosition | Name | Morality | Intelligence | Loyalty\n:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|\nCoinmaster | Eric Endbridge of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\nSwordmaster | Daniel Tootwit of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\nPeoplemaster | Simon Layne of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\nSpymaster | Jonas Redhill of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\n\nOnly by conquering the other Kingdoms can you unlock more council members\n\n#Gameplay Mechanics\n\nThrough meetings with your advisory council, you must attempt to take over the other Kingdoms of Geralda. You can purchase spies and armies. You can bribe officials or wed lordlings to ladylings. Basically, think of it like you are a house leader from Game of Thrones.\n\nYou can either fight wars, spy on people, or forge alliances.\n\nYou could even contract bards to write songs about you to boost your popularity.\n\nThe difficulty is each Kingdom is different, and it will take a different approach to claim each. In order to win the game, you must occupy every kingdom as they each hold an important piece to your success. It would also help if you managed to cure the Western plague and thwart the Eastern bandits, but that isn't necessary. It will just improve your chances of winning\n\nYou also have the option to Knight people for doing particularly good work. This involves buying them better armour, a better house and gifting them a sum of money. This boosts morale and loyalty for wherever they hail from.\n\n#Standout Features\n\nAn intense, life-like relations and loyalty system. Your spies could be caught or snitch on you if they don't have enough skill or loyalty. \n\nThere could be revolutions in small towns if you do not feed them or neglect their needs. It will be a lot to handle, but thats the fun of it.\n\nRandom events could happen too, like the Red Wedding, if your loyalty ratings are low enough.\n\n#Possible Platforms\n\nI imagine only PC, although it might work on Phones too. I imagine a Console port would be possible, but unnecessary.
1427603302|30o73n|Squatch Watch|My idea for a game is to have a game where you assume the role of a Sasquatch. It would sorta be in the vein of destroy all humans.\n\nI will outline the gameplay:\n-3rd person\n-mainly forest areas\n-each level's goal is to capture humans without being photographed\n-if you are photographed, there will consequently be more squatch hunters in the arena actively looking to kill you\n-you will have abilites such as climbing trees, a phase ability to fade into the near invisibility for a time, a screech ability that would stun all humans within a certain vicinity at the cost of revealing your position, calling other squatchs to help you, night vision, sprint, setting traps, \n-player is able to capture humans by attacking them up close or setting up rudimentary traps\n- control scheme would be similar to metal gear but with more freedom- leaping, sprinting\n-each level brings you closer and closer to civilization. The game will progressively get harder but how much harder depends on how often you are spotted/photographed\n-the ultimate goal is to wipe out manking and become the next apex predator. Perhaps having the last few levels actually take place within a city or town  
1441773441|3k70ii|Spellcraft - mage focused roguelike|Spellcraft will be a dungeon crawling, turn-based, tile-based roguelike for mobile devices. Inspiration from games like diablo, baldurs gate and pokemon mystery dungeon. \n\nThe main gameplay would consist of travelling through dungeon floors and crafting spells to overcome the dungeon. \n\nThe part that makes it interesting is you craft your own spells. Using the turn based system and the mobile touch interface you draw a series of patterns on the screen representing a spell you have learnt to cast it (think like triangle, triangle, triangle with a line through it). You craft spells through a spell tree with different elements and extensions (fire, ice, etc. And aoe, dot, linear, etc.) Which would be upgraded from picking up elemental shards from dead enemies.\n\nI have more ideas but will leave it there as I'm on mobile device, should be working and no one might find it interesting anyway. If someone does like it enough, please consider letting me help, I have no experience in mobile development and little in game development but am studying computer science and mathematics and would love to learn.
1433704780|38xrvl|God vs. Man|A multiplayer online game wherein some players are gods and some are humans. I'm picturing this as an RTS-style game. The humans must work together to harvest resources, grow their populations, build cities and advance technologically. \n\nThe gods seek to subvert the humans advancement and keep them dependent. Gods interact with the humans by making laws, performing miracles, smiting, destroying or creating resources, influencing weather, etc. The gods must use these tools to influence the populations of humans establishments and convert them. \n\nMan must play by gods rules. Breaking the gods rules can offer faster advancement, but makes the humans vulnerable to being smited.\n\nIf a certain percentage of the mans population is converted for a certain period of time, advancement is stagnated and the gods win. If man evolves to the point that he no longer needs the gods to survive he wins. 
1438783920|3fvlha|survival game with physics based crafting + a few other ideas|physics based crafting:\n\nThere are lots of games with a crafting element which generally involve some kind of recipe e.g. 1 stick + 1 rock = axe.\nI would like to play a game where sticks and rocks and other objects exist but you can connect them in any way you want.\nI think you would have to abstract away the connecting mechanism but you could connect a stick and a rock, and then somehow program in how the character will swing it, and hopefully the physics engine does the rest.\nIf you use a massive rock and a tiny stick then the stick will snap or you just won't be able to pick it up. Objects could lose strength over time so they will just break eventually.\n\nSome things you might be able to make:\n\n* traps: a single plank of wood over a hole should break if someone walks over it. Could get more complicated with springs, certain triggers.\n\n* weapons: attach a sharp object to a stick to make a spear, program in how it will be thrown; could have several different ways to use it e.g. throwing, stabbing , swiping. \nCould perhaps get more complicated and make bows, crossbows using sticks, stretchy string.\n\n* fences / platforms / bridges etc: pretty self-explanatory, one important thing would be that you can only craft things within your reach, so you can't just make a tree house and magically put it in a tree, you'd have to make the steps first, then the platform to stand on, then the walls.\n\n* vehicles: not sure about engines but potentially you could cut wood into circles to make wheels and therefore make some kind of cart to carry stuff. Also could use logs to move massive stones somehow.\n\n* boats / flying things: you could make things that float; certain designs will give better stability. You could make a sail that catches the wind, or if gravity is low enough you could maybe even fly.\n\nI've looked around at what exists already in this area and there isn't much, although what I'm describing is sort of a physics version of minecraft redstone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\npossibility of living through offspring:\n\nYou could find a mate and have offspring, and if you die, you transfer into the body of your oldest child. There could be some element of passing on skills to them before dying. If you have no offspring then it's permadeth.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nan adapting enemy using evolutionary algorithms:\n\nThe enemy would also be able to craft stuff using the same things you have. As time goes on the enemy gets better at getting over your defences, finding food, etc.\nTo start off it will attack you with no weapons so it'll be easy to kill, then it might learn to use a stick, then a stick with a knife on the end, etc. Eventually it might learn to use a vehicle, fire long range weapons, fly.\n\nPartly inspired by this kind of thing: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_8tNGKm87U  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFws_hhZs8  \n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be evolutionary, it could use neural nets or something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n
1408985197|2ejju2|A Dune Survival RPG: Why Hasn't This Happened?|It occurred to me as a rather brilliant idea in college, but it still has yet to happen. Why hasn't there been a Dune survival RPG? The universe of Dune, and particularly the forbidding climes of Arrakkis, provides a level of detail that could open up a broad yet entirely unique set of survival mechanics, such as the arythmic gait necessary to avoid attracting the attention of sandworms. A big part the books was about portraying Dune as a crucible for humanity and humanity's savior, Muad'Dib. This necessitated the intense level of detail that Herbert goes into in the books regarding how one could survive in such desolation.\n\nTo be Paul Muad'Dib from the time of his family's betrayal and his subsequent exile, to use the powers of the Bene Gesserit combined with the hardy survivalism of the Fremen. It seems a cocktail made in heaven for engrossing, engaging, challenging and epic survival roleplay.\n\nI just can't help but wonder why it hasn't been done already. Has anyone else thought of this? I looked up Dune video games on Wikipedia, but all that's ever been made are RTS's, nothing close to a survival RPG. The MMORTS that's currently in the works looks neat, but again, the idea of giving the player a chance to pit themselves against one of the most forbidding landscapes in all of science fiction seems to tantalizing a concept to give up, and not one that can be substituted.\n\nI want it to happen. To actually be a part of it would be magical and, I imagine, profitable, but I really just want this game to exist at all, first and foremost.\n\nHas anyone else thought about a similar game concept? Is there anyone out there trying to make something like this happen? I wanna know.\n\nAlso, the possibilities with game mechanics in a Dune survival game are endless, and I would love to hear any ideas from fellow Dune fans who are in game development.
1442313286|3l0z2f|Versus|Title: Versus\n\nPlatform: Android/iOS/PC\n\nGenre: Casual\n\n\n[Image concept](http://i.imgur.com/E1Dx8k6.png)\n\n\nVersus is a simple split screen infinite runner game meant to be played by 2 players on the same phone/tablet. The goal of the game is to make your ball (in this case a placeholder) travel the furthest into the level. The player which is left behind loses the game.\n\n\nThe player would need to tap the raised ground in order to pass that tile, otherwise they are stuck until they remove the obstacle. When his ball reaches the bottom part of the screen it’s game over. When the raised tile is taped it lowers down, raising the opposite part on the other side of the screen where the second player advances. The following gif should give you a rough idea:\n\n\n[Concept gif](http://i.imgur.com/9oJSbQq.gif)\n\nDo note that the gif above represents the start of the game. The moment the balls reach the middle of the screen the “background” starts scrolling. At this point whenever a player gets stuck he ends up getting left behind until he taps the raised tile that stopped him. When he does that he starts moving again trying to regain terrain.\n\n\nExtra elements: the moment a tile is lowered not only does it raise the opposite part but it also lowers and/or raises a second random tile from the opponent’s side of the screen. While the concepts and images I did are a sketch and could work out if the visual style is meant to be minimalist the game concept could reach a bigger audience if the game has for example 2 cats running upwards instead of the balls. The moment a cat hits a wall it starts scratching it until the player taps it and lowers it down for his cat to pass.\n\n\nIf we were to expand on this idea a little more, there could be ingame purchases of “skins”, or entities that would replace the cats. There could be dogs, penguins, heck, anything might work. The dog could start barking when it hits a wall, the penguin could start crying, a light bulb would crack or turn on and off. Try to think about Crossy Road and the vast skins they have.\n\n\nThe starting speed would be the same every time, the further the players advances the faster the game gets. Fine tuning and testing would be required. The game should be difficult from the beginning. \nA PC version could work as well, making the game a coop or multiplayer game worthy of Steam itself.\n\n\nAnd here's my wordpress [post](https://ailailou.wordpress.com/2015/09/15/versus/) about it. 
1423177529|2ux985|Game based on the imagination I had while taking a shower|Hey guys! I searched on google "game ideas" because I wanted to submit mine. I think my idea is pure genius and it could be a really awesome game. \n\nThe game starts normally with a guy taking a shower, doing his daily routine, going to sleep and then he has a flashy nightmare he doesn't really understand what is happening and there's a voice whispering creeply : "blink and you will survive".\nHe wakes up and he is underwater and starts drowining, then he blinks and he is on a field where a battle takes place, then he blinks again and he is in his apartament again and he has like 5 minutes or so to blink again (he has the urge to blink, his vision starts getting blurrier and blurrier each minute, the screen gets red progresively) and he find a letter or something explaining what is happening that with each blink he basically travels through parallel universes and only when he keeps his eyes closed he is nowhere and everything disappears, and its just him.\nSo his goal is ..actually I have no idea what his goal is but the general idea seems pretty interesting.\n\nI don't know. Seems cool in my head.
1439982835|3hkkjl|A game which merges multiple smaller games of different genres|So basically the idea here is that the player is a sort of "dimension-jumper", and the player needs to travel between multiple stories in order to obtain the items needed to progress.\n\nFor example, a modern, James Bond-style story where you need to access a hyper-locked door. You have no lockpicking skills. The solution? Hop over to Demolition Simulator 2015, grab some dynamite. Unfortunately, it's not strong enough to blast through the door, so switch into Tale of Heroes V: Dragon's Crystal, where you can then smash open the thick stone wall leading to the chamber of the Skeleton Key, which can open any lock. Return to 007: Goldentooth and use the key to open the lock.\nThat was a pretty simple puzzle. Once you've got whatever was on the other side of the vault, you can probably use it to blow something up super-efficiently (*cough* Demolition Simulator 2015 *cough*).\n\n"Sometimes the tools you need just aren't where you need them..."

1387482241|1t9nq7|Brainstorm character ideas for a magical PvP game? The convention so far is "______"Mancer.|So I just got an artist for my game! We are pretty far into the development but we have had to use crappy placeholders for the graphics up until now. I'm very excited to start seeing the game take form visually. But anyway, He asked me for a list of character classes to start drawing up some samples. We've made it very modular so we can easily add more character classes as we go. This is the list so far:\n\n.\n\nPyroMancer - Fire/Smoke\n\nGeoMancer - Rock/Quakes\n\nHydroMancer - Water/ possibly Marine Life?\n\nCryoMancer - Cold/Frost/Ice\n\nPsychoMancer - Fear/Insanity/Mind\n\nTechnoMancer - Technology/Robots/Lasers\n\nGraviMancer - Gravity/Warping\n\nChronoMancer - Time Manipulation\n\n.\n\nWe want there to be close to 30 character classes before we go into alpha. And we want this number to always be going up as the development continues. As we brainstorm more potential ideas I thought I might as well present the topic to Reddit and see if anyone wanted to share a few ideas for our new artist to play around with. Thanks in advance for anything you can contribute! Feel free to include spell ideas for the characters too if you like! Any brainstorming is welcome!\n
1388033168|1tpv5o|Game Idea where you don't want to level up.|
1377125464|1ku3zf|Game Ideas : Survival into Civilization|After playing way too much Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, and Civilization, I got the idea for a game that somewhat combines the three:\n\nAt game start you appear as a single character in the middle of a vast world.  You have no contact with anyone, have no idea who you are or where you came from, but do possess certain skills to survive.\n\nAfter exploring the vicinity, you'll discover that some plants and animals are familiar to you, and therefore useful, while others are unknown, which is random each time you play.\n\nAfter doing some basic survival activities, such as building a basic shelter (lean-to, cave, grass hut), gathering food, and getting fire going, you'll discover something of great worth nearby, such as a lode of gold, river with abundant fish, or strange monolith.   \n\nSoon after, strangers will appear whom see your dwelling and the item of wealth and will either attempt to make claim to it or work with you, depending on your skills and their demeanor.  \n\nOnce you get a few people to work with you, then larger constructions will be possible, using the knowledge retained by those that come along, so some times you may be able to make a barn really well, while other times you may be stuck with smaller structures until more people come along and are skilled enough at engineering.\n\nOver time you end up with a settlement that is able to exploit the nearby wealth and continue to grow.\n\nEventually, other settlements will make their presence known and they can be traded with, or possibly attacked to try to expand into a larger civilization.  \n\nIdeally, there would not necessarily be an 'end', but rather there just be more land to explore, more settlements to find, and possibly dark forces to muster armies to fight.
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1356827043|15ncs9|A Hide-and-Seek game in which you don't know if you are the hider or the seeker|A game in which each round would last a relatively short while. There are two characters, the human and the monster. Each character is played by two random strangers chosen from a server (like Omegle). Each player is put into one of the roles, but they don't know which they play. There are no differences so that even if they were to look on each other's screens, it would be impossible to tell. The game takes place in a maze, and there is a time counter on the side. The human has to survive as long as they can, and the monster has to catch the human in as short of a time as they can. As the players come closer to each other, they will hear each other's footsteps. This is the whole game. At this point, will the players run away, or rush forward? Being a monster and running away means you take away from your time, and being a human and rushing forward means you could get caught. But once the two meet, it becomes clear as one player looks like a monster and the other a human. After this point, the monster player speeds up, and the human player gets a gun. The gun only has two bullets, and only slows down the monster. Ammo crates appear around the map, which don't reappear after being taken. This means the monster eventually wins, but the point of the game is to see if your choice to run away or rush forward is correct
1363582745|1aib7o|A Game About The Butterfly Effect|Ideally this would be made with a visually stunning engine. Mechanics would be simple, you mostly just walk/run places and make decisions on everything. But everything you do matters.\n\nIt would begin with you waking up as a high schooler and needing to walk to school in the winter. HUD prompts (or possibly audio directions from the character) would tell the player where to go and if they decided not to then they could within reason. It wouldn't be a totally open world game, it would be a very detailed small game.\n\nSo let's say that instead of walking to school the player decides to run circles in the snow because the particle effect is really cool. Unfortunately, because of this they don't reach the a street with a crosswalk on time and don't press the pedestrian walk button, so a car crash occurs.\n\nThen you would wake up as a man in his forties working a desk job. maybe the player doesn't put a jacket on, so the character drops his keys because his hands are shaking, pushing back the time it takes to get him to the crosswalk, aiding in preventing the crash.\n\nIf it were as good as it could be you would simply go from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning with a bunch of different characters, each impacting the scene in a small way. You job as a player is to clean up your mess hat you made with the previous character.\n\nAnother great thing about this would be DLC galore, adding new characters could be done easily, making it a huge game over the course of a couple years.\n\nTL;DR: You have to clean up your own mess with different characters.

So basically I was wondering if a game like this exists only where you can point your phone camera outside of a car and you can actually control a virtual character and make it into a proper game?

1376487371|1kchuv|Hey - I've had loads of game ideas in archive, if people are interested I will find them?|As title said, I had a load of ideas for games about half a year ago. I posted some of them on the "Extra Credits" forum and posted almost all of them to a friend via Facebook messaging. It got frustrating, though, because obviously none of these would get made - apart from maybe some of the more "indie-esque" ideas, I would need a huge studio and lots of funding to realize most of them.\n\nSo I stopped actively thinking the ideas up. Sometimes when I play a game, though, an idea pops into my head. I would totally love a job where I got paid for my ideas... Anyway, if there is an actual interest in hearing these ideas then I could dig them out of the Facebook log or check if I've saved any in Notepad. I wrote quite a lot about each game - a small essay about some of the more complicated/thought out ideas that I'd had.\n\nLess relevant, but I also wrote a /ton/ of ideas for (less than serious) TF2 weapons/mods...
1373297971|1hvagt|Playing with trust...|Hey guys,\n\nI'm a game developer, mostly 2D. This game idea I had really makes me want to move into 3D.\n\nImagine a first person game. You and 8-10 other people online. You can only communicate through voice chat when you're within a reasonable distance/earshot of one another. No text chat. The initial idea I had involved the game taking place in an old mansion. \n\nThe 8-10 players play as young adults looking to ease their boredom by exploring this mansion for a mythical serial killer that lurks within its walls (Imagine something like Jason Voorhees, except no immortality or other powers such as those like Freddy Krueger's). \n\nThe game starts in the foyer.\n\nOnce you arrive, the front door locks itself. You are then given a certain period of time to collect keys and complete other objectives to escape. The game informs you that the killer is within the mansion, and is looking for you.\n\nThe only issue: **you are given less time than required to gather all of the items and complete the objectives as one big group. The only solution is to split up.** The game will give half or a quarter of the players lanterns, which can be picked up upon death or given willingly to another player. It will be very difficult, but not impossible to see clearly without a lantern. Due to this, it forces players to break up the teams so that at least one person has a lantern in each team. Once you team up, these are the rules:\n\n* There may be between 1-3 killers.\n* The killers can be AI, or someone from your group of 6-10 people. Never both.\n* There is a minimal HUD, and no way to keep track of who is dead and who is alive.\n* There will be a persistent clock in the game, each character wears a watch showing the current time in the game and how much time is left for the objectives.\n* You may leave notes to meet up at at a certain location at a certain time to reorganize... Or if you're a killer... To plan a murder.\n* The only way to deduce who the killers are is by trust, and logic.\n* Each player has a somewhat accurate blueprint of the mansion. There are secret passages only shown on the killers' maps. It does not update or show player locations. It can however, be marked by each individual player with notes or sketches for reference.\n* If the killers are players, they can fake their death by leaving blood somewhere and by going into hiding.\n* There are no menus besides an options menu. Everything is done "FarCry 2" style. Maps are brought up in game in the player's hand. The inventory are accessed through a backpack.\n\nThe player/killer ratio will be set up something like this (P = Player, K = Killer):\n\n* pppppk = 6 Total Players\n* pppppkk = 7 Total Players\n* ppppppkk = 8 Total Players\n* ppppppkkk = 9 Total Players\n* pppppppkkk = 10 Total Players\n\nImagine that your group of 4 goes off and 2 are killed by an AI who then hides again. When you meet up with the rest and inform them, how can they trust that you and the remaining team member aren't the killers?\n\nI would like to make the game very customizable. It will use random values for determining objective and item locations. You can edit gameplay options before starting. Some ideas that come to mind:\n\n* Allowing player killers to disguise their character, and even their voice.\n* Adjust the range in feet for how far the voice chat works.\n* Pro difficulty modes and settings.\n* Classic, but awesome Scooby Doo gags. Paintings with holes in the eyes, secret passageways only shown on the killers' maps. Secret bookshelf exits. Quick ways for the killer(s) to move around.\n\nObviously there are flaws. External VOIP applications such as ventrillo are definitely a cause for concern.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n**TL;DR** I recommend you read it anyway, but I want to make a game where trust, deceit, and doubt are not only integral, but required for your success. However, most games that involve trust are set up in ways that trust is guaranteed once obtained. I want this game to involve just enough doubt to where you can never completely, or forever trust who you're with.\n\n**EDIT 1: Formatting**\n\n**EDIT 2: Ideaz**

1348452257|10de0s|Survival RPG game|It is kind of like Fallout 3, the world has been ravaged by an apocalypse, but after it went through this it lost most of the oxygen in the atmosphere, and to survive you have to carry oxygen cannisters. \n\nYou start out with a fairly small machine that takes the oxygen that is in the air, compresses it, and makes it concentrated enough to survive on. Throughout the game you can make improvements to this machine.\n\nWhen you explore the world you will happen upon other survivor. They can be hostile, friendly, or neutral. You can work together with them to survive, or kill them and take their oxygen and other parts to improve your machine, weapons, and armor.\n\nThat's all I've got right now.

1370400426|1fp3dc|A small idea to improve cooperation between high level and low level characters in online games|I've always found that there is a big gap in online games between the godlike high-level players and the noob first-timers. Isn't it true, that a player 30 minutes into a game is a lot different from a player 30 hours into a game? Let alone 300 hours or more? \n\nMy idea is a little thing that is versatile, and is not really necessary in any way, but would be a kind of fun way to have low and high level characters interact, boost the game economy, and give some power to new players. \n\nMy idea is that of an optional side quest very early in the game. One core requirement would be it be completed before, say, level five or some such early-game achievement. This quest can only be completed if a player above level 30 joins (it requires an item only level 30+ players can use, for instance) and is a sort of co-op piece. The players do their thing, it requires communication, and the point is to have the new player learn from the veteran. \n\nAt the end of the mission (which can be restarted if one of the players quits unexpectedly, to prevent trolls from making sure people can never complete it) the noob has the option of giving a token to the high level player, or destroying that token. This would be equivalent to the party hats in Runescape, though probably not as valuable. They can be worth some money or some unique bonus, which is what entices the high level players to help low level players in the first place- this reward. If they help the low level player without being a prick, there is a good chance they can get this cool thing.\n\nTherefore the high level player gets a cool reward, the low and high level players interact, the low level player gets experience and gets a taste of high-level action.\n\nWhat do you think?
1372802626|1hiydm|Dinosaur Game|This could be classified as a survival/adventure game.  Or even billed as an educational game for middle school and up.\n\n\n**Premise:**\n\n\nYou play a time traveling scientist exploring the Cretaceous time period.  Your goal is to collect research data, samples, photographs, and more - without getting trampled, gored, or eaten.\n\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n\n- First or third person view.\n\n\n\n- Large open world (think *Just Cause 2* or larger).\n\n\n\n- Assignment based missions.\n\n\n- No lethal weapons!  This isn't that kind of game.  You could have smoke grenades and flashbangs to facilitate an escape, plus a tranquilizer gun and knock-out gas to subdue dinosaurs.\n\n\n\n- You could have a research portfolio with dozens of dinosaur species that you have to seek out.  Each species would have a set of goals to accomplish, such as take a photo, collect a blood sample, observe a behavior, measure a footprint, etc.\n\n\n- Don't die.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n**Cry Engine 3** sounds ideal.
1374075506|1ihoyd|A game where you hide in crowds.|[Actually I've already made a functioning prototype!] (http://i.imgur.com/UkA9Sg1.png)\n\nThe idea is to have a multiplayer game with lots of characters. The goal is for one person (Or people) to hide in a crowd and avoid detection, while trying to find an object. \n\nThe other team is simply trying to find this person and stop them.\n\nYou have to watch people's walking patterns carefully. There is no HUD or any display to show you where the hiding man is, so you have to rely solely on watchful eyes.\n\nSo I guess pretty much Assassin's creed with guns? \n\nI'm a little bit out of inspiration and ideas. I feel the idea is nearly there, but missing some crucial elements to make it really work. I'm also not really wanting to make it incredibly ambitious, something still reasonable for a one-man team.
1351683558|12e6rj|Top down Zombie Apocalypse Multiplayer game idea!|Okay so the game would be based on squares, each square has a different terrain, Wild, Infected or civilisation. There are 2 teams, Zombies and of course, humans. If you're on the human team you pick a career/role, Scientist, Scout, Soldier. I'll get to their specifics later, If you're on the zombies team there is scout, soldier or scientist. They both start on a randomly generated map apart from eachother. The scientist can claim land and cure infected areas, Soldiers can kill scout zombies and kill zombie civilisation and scout can scout the map without getting infected but can be attacked easily. The scientist zombie can infect areas and claim land, he can be easily killed, the soldier and scout are the same as the humans. The goal of the game is to wipe out the other team, by doing that you need more power to attack them, to get more power you have to claim land, but you can't claim land if its occupied or infected. Have fun!

1365880417|1ca76c|Find new creatures and use their abilities to solve puzzles|The point of the game would be to freely explore a 2d platforming world to find new creatures.  Puzzles would be everywhere and enable you to travel to new locations.\n\nYou could bring a creature somewhere to use its ability.  Maybe a mole-like creature could dig a hole for you or one with a shell could shield you from an environmental hazard or you could simply hitch a ride on a flying creature.\n\nThe puzzles would use more and more creatures as you went along and the creatures could potentially be further and further away from the puzzles they are used to solve.\n\nDoes this sound like a fun game?

1375534480|1jmh5w|[Game Idea] Childhood.|The game i am envisioning is a RPG/FPS (ala Bioshock) that's heavily focused on the story. It's main property is bringing back all the players to their childhoods by incorporating juvenile fantasies into the combat/story/puzzles.\n\nThe game starts out with a Cutscene/Tutorial mix. You are portrayed as a child that's waking up. You get up, get dressed and go out to a small village that's quite unkempt. Everything is dry, dirty and very inhumane. You look around, back to the crumbling old house and take it all in. As you are looking you find a stick on the ground.\n\nHere comes the first tutorial part. You swing the stick and as it swings it becomes a majestic sword. Once the swing ends it returns back to a stick. This is one of the most important introductury elements of the game as it has to showcase the true amazement you get from the swing and the occuring magic. For all the kid knows it's his imagination, for the player though, they get taken back to their childhood where that stick really was a sword.\n\nAs you pick the stick back up (again demonstrating basic gameplay functions) and swing some more you see something in the distance. A black tree, without any leaves standing on the top of a steep hill. You go there and swing it with the sword (more tutorial stuff). As you swing the entire tree falls off and you can see the shadow of something standing behind you. This is the first enemy you encounter (tutorial stuff again; enemy not defined). You kill it and go back to the house to the mom washing dishes.\n\nThe cutscene comes back up and now you're begging to show your mom your newfound abilities. All is in vein when after she actually decides to come see the stick is no more than that. She puts you to bed and you get to character creation. This is where the game starts, you are now 25 years old and in a corrupt world. Your powers return when the situation is dire.\n\nYou can choose three classes.\n\n* Warrior = Pen (sword) + watch (shield) + Leather jacket (armor).\n\n* Mage = Deck of cards (magic stuff) + beer (alchemic potion/poison).\n\n* Archer = Random objects (Throwing knaves) + Blanket (invisibility cloak).\n\nThe game evolves as you gain access to levels, talent trees and a multitude of random household objects which eventually trough your imagination can be transformed into weapons/armor for your class. A vaccum cleaner tube can be either a long-sword, a flameshooter or a crossbow. A pack of gumballs are shooting stars, exploding mines or a protective shield.\n\nThe game is centered around the million possibilities every object you encounter could actually be in your imagination. But that's not all.\n\nWhile the game will have an established villain. Everything can also be an enemy. That shadow can be a ghost. A hanging coat can be a wraith. A mannequin can be a thug.\n\nAnd all of this will become the parts of the game that will be alive in the multitude of enviroments you are presented with: That storm drain can be a hunter's burrow. That tree you climb on can be a royal tower. Your hotel can be haunted.\n\nNow i've noticed that in my description from a designer's prespective that would be too much variables to create every possible combination of scenarios. That doesn't have to be like that though. In reality it's a story-telling game and while imagination is the main idea behind it, you can get incredibly imaginitive with how the story goes.\n\nHope you enjoy it!
1371914240|1guwm1|"Blind" game|Alright so here are some notes I quickly wrote down in order to outline the game play\n\n* You play as a blind person in a dark "room" or environment\n* The only visible parts of the character are feet, heart and hands\n* You navigate around by using your hands as guidance, everything you feel, hear, smell or touch will appear to you in white\n* Different items will give you a better ability to identify the world around you, example: an iron pipe would allow you to hit objects to hear the sound from them, while your hands can feel the texture and temperature of an object.\n\n\nJust a quick thought that came to mind
1375071008|1j98oc|[Game Idea] Ancient Roman Gladiator School Manager|Okay, so I know that the Spartacus Legends game just came out a few weeks ago but there has got to be a better way to create this type of game.\n\nHere is what I am envisioning.  It is a fully realized Roman World.  You start out managing a ludus in a lesser-known part of the empire and over time build up your ludus until you can take your gladiators to the Colosseum (if it is after it has been built).\n\nGame-play:  I was thinking you would have to manage several aspects of the ludus (gladiator school).\n\n1: Income\n2: Gladiators and happiness\n3: Food\n4: Beasts\n5: Arena\n6: Domus\n\n\nFirst, you have to set a budget for the ludus.  Where are you going to get income, just from your gladiator's victories, or are there other means?  My thoughts were that not only did you run the school, you also obtained money from other ventures (your latifundium,  other slaves you buy and resell after cleaning up that couldn't cut it as gladiators).\n\nOkay, got your budget, great.  Now off to the slave market to buy some potential gladiators.  Wait, only scrawny boys and women today, that's fine.  You buy them and use them as house servants or as comfort-women for your gladiators.\n\nYou have to keep your gladiators happy so they do not revolt against you.  A few methods; let them keep their winnings in the arena, give them slaves to keep them "comfortable," provide them with adequate food, do not fight them too often or train them too hard.\n\nHow to work food:  Do you supply your own food from your latifundium or do you buy produce/meats in town.  One is cheaper, the other could be problematic if a drought occurs.\n\nTraining:  How often do you train your gladiators?  Too much and they may revolt, too little and they won't be any good.\n\nBeasts: Do you involve yourself in the trapping, raising, and caring of beasts?  It would be additional costs to start, but the benefits would mean more notoriety for your ludus.\n\nArena:  Do you host gladiator fights (will be small)?  Which might cost your house money to host, but the revenue and good-will from the people will increase your notoriety.  Where do you fight your gladiators?  If a senator wishes to throw a game, how many of your gladiators do you send?  \n\nDomus:  Manage your home.  Host events for the senators in an attempt to work your ludus towards Rome.\n\nNotoriety:  How noticeable your ludus has become?  Are you the best ludus in Rome, or do others outshine you?  How many champions have you trained?\n\nLet me know what you think and sorry for the long post.
1362142023|19gka3|Not sure what the meaning of this would be, but it has a ton of moral impact.|An rpg game where you need to level up by killing people. No one want's to fight you and by killing people you attract the cops (much like GTA). It's also a city builder and for each person you kill you get less income per hour. Basically a game where you can help others and never exceed mediocrity. Or you can become a god in infamy.\n 
1360101765|17yihh|Vampires or Mechs?|So, I'm pretty far along with the game I'm making's engine, but I have yet to come up with ideas for the enemies.  It takes place in the future, but not that far ahead.  I think I've probably narrowed it down to either robots/mechs, or vampirish things.  Which would you prefer?
1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1348373398|10buwz|The Hunger Games: The Game.|Hi, just thought I'd post this =3\n\nThe game **DOES NOT** revolve around katniss or any other canon characters. It simply exists within the universe of the hunger games.\n\n\nThe game would be a 3rd person survival game with light RPG elements. When you make your character, you pick some basic stuff. Note that these skills are not balanced as of yet.\n\n**District**\nThe district you choose to be from earns you a small bonus trait that you use throughout your game.\n\n\n**District one**\nThe player gets the "career" bonus trait, which gives a small bonus to health, regeneration, weapons skill and other skills. This bonus is small, as it encompasses a large variety of traits.\n\n\n**District two**\nAlso have the "career" trait.\n\n\n**District three**\nGets access to technical advantages. For instance, they can take the mines from outside the cornucopia and re-set them. If other technological pieces would be present within a specific hunger games match, then that player would have better skill with it than others.\n\n\n**district four**\nHas a bonus to swim speed and how long they can hold their breath. Also has better skills when making nets or similar traps. Extra damage with weapons such as spears and tridents.\n\n\n**district five**\nI have yet to come up with a viable trait for this district. District five is based around energy, so if you have an idea let me know.\n\n\n**district six**\nPlayers from district six learn skills faster than others.\n\n\n**district seven**\nHave a bonus with axes, can identify trees as poisonous/safe. Have a small bonus to tree climbing.\n\n\n*district eight**\nDistrict eight players can craft items with better proficiency than other districts. \n\n\n**district nine**\nPlayers who choose district nine will be able to identify edible plants.\n\n\n**district ten**\nPlayers from this district can preserve food to last for longer periods.\n\n\n**district eleven**\nPlayers who choose district eleven will be able to create healing items from plants and can climb trees.\n\n\n**district twelve**\nPlayers from district twelve have better skills with fire and have a bonus to strength.\n\n\n\nNext, players will select age and gender. The only effect age has is that the closer to people are in terms of age, the better they will work together. Gender has no effect.\n\nPlayers can then customize their face, hair, etc. This also has no effect.\n\n\nOnce this has been done, the players cut to the training room. They have 6 points to spend. The player will go to each training table. The instructor will tell them what this particular skill will do, and how it will help them. They can then choose to invest a point with the instructor, and then they will be more proficient with that skill. Skills include things like archery, foraging, etc.\n\n\nDuring this time, the player may interact with his or her fellow participants. Here, they can plan and attempt to work together during the actual hunger games event. Depending on how you interact with them, they with either like you or dislike you.\n\nAfter that's finished, the player must show off their skills. This is simply a small event in which the player attempts to get as many points as possible. This dictates the player's score, ranging from 1-12, with 1 being the worst and 12 being the best. The higher the score, the more likely sponsors are to help you in a time of need.\n\n\nThere will be no interview as that feels like it would just be asking too much from the player before they actually get to play the game.\n\n\nWhen the player spawns, the world is generated with random elements. It can be a desert, plains, forest, tundra or anything else. Like in the books, the players stay on their plates for 60 seconds before they can run.\n\nThey then take what they can and flee, joining up with allies if they can.\n\n\nThere will then be 3 days of standard combat. This means the gamesmaster does not influence the world in any way. After that, the gamesmaster will try and drive people together, away from the borders of the map. The match ends when all but one player is dead.\n\n\nPlayers will be very fragile. A broken foot can't be fixed. You won't survive an arrow to the chest. Broken hands? You can't use those. All players are like this. Smaller wounds heal naturally over time, but larger wounds do not.\n\n\nIf a player is in desperate need of help, they may attempt to get a sponsor to help them. The parachute will arrive a few minutes after the plea, and will contain something to help them. However, other players may take note of the parachute and use it to locate you.\n\n_________________________________\n\nThe environment will be just as big an enemy as the careers. You will need to consume food and water regularly. In a desert, water will be incredibly scarce, and thus players will meet at points where there is water, making these spots heavily contested. Players will also have to make sure they do not become too hot or too cold, as this will have negative effects on their skills and will eventually kill them. 
1346692857|zadss|So I got this idea after playing Slender for the first time...|I don't think Slender is that scary. It's only scary because of the jump scares. So I thought hard on what would have jump scares everywhere. Then it hit me. Jack. Based on a jack in the box. When I was a little kid, that thing always used to scare the hell out of me. And I bet it did for many other people. So you're trying to get to the other side of a parking lot of a run down circus after you find your friends dead after sneaking in. It would play "Pop goes the weasel" in music box form really slowly and at the end of it a very disturbing looking jack in the box may or may not pop out of the ground, and you have to dodge it in time before it kills you and you have to start over again. Again, there's a chance he might not. I think it would be scary. What do you guys think?
1369948501|1fd1oc|A Fantasy world that I can't stop thinking about|As a small time indie devolper there is no way I could devolp such a game [writing all this burnt me out lol], but I think that this would make for such a cool game, I would hope that anyone would build it. All the names can/should be replaced.\n\n**Genre**: The games genre would be like a zelda, in the sense that it'd be 3rd person action/adventure with a linear plot[protagonist saves the world from evil] and has some rpg elements. However unlike the game should not be puzzle-centric [a few puzzles in there though], the focus of the game should be  about the combat against massive demons[think shadow of the colossus]. Perhaps sandbox, but that is not 100% necessary for the game to work.\n\n**Plot**: The story would follow the main character Lance. Lance is a loner, social awkward [maybe even mildy autistic], but highly intelligent. Throughout conversations with other characters in the game you should also hear Lance's thought process[which should also give hints during fighting, and general observations about the enviorment, give him some wit!]\n\nThe opening sequence of the game should showcase off Lance's attempts at socialization with his co-workers at his generic, monotonous, mundane office job. A few awkward conversations later will leave Lance wondering if he'll ever feel confortable in this world. Thats when he notices dark energy leaking the building. [Could make the screen kind of greyish, make doors glow with a that's-definitively-an-evil-aura aura] Only the Demon Hunters can notice the dark energy, and using Lance's demon hunter talisman*, Excailbur, any door that he opens turns into a portal into the demon world.\n\nLance's thoughts should shift once he's in the demon world, he should feel significantly more confortable in the demon world then he does in the human world. Almost right of the bat you should see a demon slightly bigger than you, [it better look interesting] and you have to fight. Lance will already been a seasoned demon hunter by this point so the basic level demon should be nothing to defeat. He should hurt when he makes contact, but seeing as this is basically the tutorial level he should have extra-exagerated moves. [Long windup moves, easy to predict.], the option to absorb the demon will be present in this battle, but during the battle Lance should be thinking that this demon isn't even worth asborbing and he can't be the source of all that dark energy that was leaking through to the human world.\n\nExcalibur also can sense the direction of nearby demons, and after using it to find two more of the same shitty weakling demons, you'll find one that is slightly bigger then the others and is taunting you. [No more exagerated, slow moves, quick consise, however it is still a demon and demons are stupid creatures and easily Lance should be defeating it. However when it gets to 1/3 health it begins to flee. You begin chasing after it when Lance reminds himself that you should never chase[sprint] after a demon as boom ambushed by the first real demon of the game. The little demons are his minions so that he can bait demon hunters.\n\nThis demon should tower over you, at least x3 as large as you [again creativity, do not make this demon human shaped at all]. Its attacks should be somewhat slow but unbelievably powerful, every attack that is even close to you should knock you off your feet. Direct attacks should do ~50-75% your health as well as knocking you back, [deals more damage when you smash into a wall etc]. By the time you get this guy down to 1/3 health theres no doubt in your mind that your gonna absorb him. Once absorbed lance will get depressed and be like "I guess I have to go back to work then ... *sigh*"\n\nNot going to be as in detail about these parts because near the character limit\n\nLance leaves his job early to go to DHHQ[demon hunter headquarters). The people there should be commenting on how there hass been a suspiciously large amount of demon activity recently and that they are starting to get worried. One guy claims that there are new types of demons that are stronger then ever and are integellent enough to speak. Lance just keeps to himself overhearing the conversations and thinking about the topics. \n\nLance goes to a vendor to trade in his soul for an ability making extremly awkward small talk why buying.\nVendor:"Hope you enjoy your purchase"\nLance:"You too, erh...I mean..uh.....sorry"\nVendor:"Wut?"\nLance:...*walks away*\n\nLance is mad at himself for being unable to convey his thoughts in a easy small talk conversation when he meets a young demon hunter, Jake, who actually likes Lance's quirks and awkwardness. Jake informs Lance that he's a part of the Bzb Squad that is going to take on a demon queen and a huge demon nest tommorow that Lance overheard someone talking about before. When they part ways Lance says something weid and Jake just laughs it off saying something along of the lines of your funny thats how I know we'll be good friends.\n\nLance is ecstatic to have a friend. However it is just not destined to happen as the next day during the mission there is a huge explosion in the demon world and while no one knows exactly what happened, it is confirmed that no one from the BZB squad managed to come back alive.\n\nLance is now on a quest to find out what happened to his first friend ever. Upon getting to the demon queen's laire he fins only 5 demon hunter bodies none of them being jake. Also the nest has been cleared out so what could have possibly done this to them?\n\n\n**Controls/Mechanics**: I see this game working better on a console because of how I envision the controls should be laid out. Seeing as the main focus of the game will be the fights the controls for them should sleek, easy to do but flexiable. [I'm going to be talking about the buttons on a standard xbox controller sorry if that confuses you]. I'd want this game to handle somewhat simular to the [ninja storm series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM5Uxgi2Zkw); very open 3d fights. Your health should not recover until your full energy and only very slowly then [instantly healed up upon leaving the demon world though, leaving the demon world resets and non-lethal blows.]\n\nThe RT buton would be energy modifier. By holding it down it enhances everything else lance does at the cost of more energy.\n\nThe A button would be a movement modifier. Pressing it once will make you dash in the direction your running at the cost of a little energy. Holding it down will make you sprint in the direction your running draining a very small amount of energy per second. With the energy modifier down your dashing will be nearly instantanous and your sprint speed will be a % faster.\n\nThe B button would be the melee button, Lance will start out with 5 basic combos, upgradeable with demon soul xp. B with no movement on the right stick, and B in all the cardinal directions, pressing b+the same direction after every attack lands [that could be annoying phantasy star online had it and I thought it was pretty cool there.] At the end of each combo is a smash, which will knock the target back and indicate the end of a combo. Regular attacks can be blocked, dodged, how every energy-powered attacks will break through any guards and stun the target until your next attack is schedueled to land [allows you to combo easier]\n\nThe Y button would be the jump button you can double jump [not high at all] but with energy you can triple-jump [pretty costly]. Energy based jumps go twice as high[or something]\n\nThe X Button would be deticated energy moves, which are unlockable in the demon hunter HQ. varying from shields to ranged blast attacks or healing type things. [again right stick handle what attack you fire off]\n\nAnd the LT button would be in control of excalibur. Holding it down only affects you during melee combos, where he'll sneak in extra slashes with it [at the cost of energy omg big shocker]. LT+UP activate the demon tracker, LT+DOWN to bring up communications with demon hunter HQ. LT+LEFT to absorb a soul [idk what else It should do lol]\n\n\n**-*Note 1:**\n\nThe demon hunters talisman would be a small multipurpose piece of technology [I was thinking like a cross or something]. By itself it is usesless, but with a little demon hunter magic it can do many thing Its primary usage is for the absorbtion and collection of demon souls. After getting a demon to 1/3 its max health, and using a combo or ability to stun the demon you can asorb the demon into the talisman. The talisman can only hold 5 demon souls at a time, however you can release the soul to get a 1 time ability out of it [also freeing the demon. What I mean by that is if you captured a high level fire demon you can release it later to do an AoE pulse of fire, but release the demon back into the world] The talisman can also turn into a sword of energy [think lightsaber], during combos, and it will have a few abilities you can unlock from brining demon souls to the demon hunter HQ. [That'll be the rpg element, which skills you equip, get xp depending on the quality of souls you bring in because 3 imp demons should not even give close to the same xp as grand demons]\n\nTheres no chance anyones gonna read any of this. TL;DR.
1373513169|1i21zd|Tell me what you think, physics based storage.|What do you think of a game that has a good enough physics engine to support *real* storage, lets say you have a bag, or the cargo hold of a ship, usually, you would "put" items in the bag or cargo hold and those would just dissapear and be "stored" there, like in any rpg inventory (Take Skyrim as an example) but in this game, you'd open your bag (automatically), and you could put items in and sort them controlling your hand manually (Like in surgeon simulator) the point would be to hace a good enough physics engine and controls so that things wouldn't glitch out of the bag, get blown off when they get put through an infinite ammount of pressure by your hand pressing them accidentally against the bag, dissapear into the cargo hold's wall when you use a crane to place them and accidentaly bump them hard enough, etc.\n\nDo you think it could be possible soon? I think it would make a great adition to rpg's and survival games, you know, having to sort out your inventory in real time rather than through an excel sheet, or searching for that bullet cartridge you really really need right now, etc.

1360343392|1851qr|In Dubious Battle - Strike Management Game|I happened to be reading John Steinbeck's [*In Dubious Battle*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Dubious_Battle) and kept thinking that despite its setting/content it could be made into a very awesome game, either as a text/stats based sim (think Football Manager or Risk) or a fully fledged adventure game.\n\nYou are a Political Extremist in 1930s California, tasked with organising labour strikes and violence to economically cripple the elite of a small town. By starting off as a single worker talking to individuals to eventually taking over entire farms and fending off law enforcement with "bending the law" and deception, eventually violence.\n\n* The key mechanic of the game is morale. Every event affects morale positively or negatively. Your strike camp gets rats? Morale down! Someone donates six pigs for slaughter? Morale up.\n\n* Alongside morale you must also manage aggression. Too high a morale can result in workers becoming aggressive and wanting to act on their own accord. One death or fire could cause your game to descend into violence - something that could result in 'make it or break it' end game content, or simply a sullen return to work.\n\n* You will also have specialists, engineers who can repair/manage resources and sabotage law enforcement or landowners. Doctors who can keep your camp in good health. Soldiers who will train your men in how to stick together and beat down any scabs who come to take your jobs - and how to kill should things escalate.\n\n* The objective of the game is to take every worker group in the valley and see them all get great wages and conditions. Alternatively you can send them out to burn down the entire valley.\n\n* The game should also have a non-violent strategy. Whilst in my mind the UI is geared towards people/resource management a social dialogue tree could also allow for players to convince landowners to give workers better wages and conditions, and blackmail them with all their high society escapades to ensure they see it through.\n\n* Of course, you could just watch the world burn. Convince a thousand workers to truly believe in your cause and send them against the military in a fight that will see blue collar workers remember them for generations *or* watch them return to work, whilst your character lies bloody and beaten in a field for trying to get them to strike.\n\nI have no knowledge of programming, but if you do, maybe this interests you!\n\n\n\n
1358523716|16tjey|A Final Fantasy game idea.|I had a dream where I watched my friend play this Final Fantasy styled game. After I woke up, I still remembered it and thought it out a bit.\n\n----\n\n\n**Story**\n\n\nSetting takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. The main character is a guy/girl who has somehow survived. MC is about 30 years old, and fairly reserved/quiet. \n\n\nFor a while, tutorial and some story progression is done through MC's internal monologue. Most of the story elements should not be presented with words, but instead use the setting, so as to add to the quiet post-apoc environment. When MC meets other characters, there will be less internal monologue presented and the story will be shown through interaction with events and other characters. It is shown that the world was very technologically advanced. Much of it has decayed in the apocalyptic event. \n\n\nPlayer fights mutated creatures and malfunctioned robots (sounds generic, but think fancy FF design). To lead the player, MC starts with simple goals such as reaching a location to get supplies, etc. By the end of the tutorial, MC's main goal is revealed: getting to the place where his husband/wife lived.\n\n\nAlong the way, MC happens along a research facility. Here, he finds a 'stored memory'. 'Stored memories' are basically a person's mind stored in electronic form. Under instructions by the 'stored memory', MC helps him/her into a robotic body. This becomes the first party member.\n\n\nNote: The parts below haven't been thought out in as much detail.\n\n\nMC finds other party members along the way (characters like a weird AI robot and friendly sentient mutant and stuff like that; each has their own story and conflict). When MC gets to the place where his/her spouse lived, he/she finds a 'stored memory' of his/her beloved. However, as dialogue plays out, it's revealed there isn't a 'stored memory'. It's simply a recording as MC's significant other decided not to keep herself as a 'stored memory'.\n\n\nSome point soon, MC meets a clan of people that lived using magic instead of technology and were shielded from the apocalypse. MC meets them at some point. One of them becomes a party member. The clan reveals that the apocalypse was caused by some tortured result of technology and magic (this would be the final boss). MC's new goal is to destroy this thing, so as to protect something valuable he cares about or something.\n\n\nEach character should have side missions that reveal more of their story. They get triggered through locations, events, or items.\n\n \n\n----\n\n\n**Battle System**\n\n\nThe battle system is based around the classic rpg turn-based system where you take turns selecting moves. There's your usual attack/special move/use item/defend/run. Each character has a their own resource system (traditionally mana). Examples are: an ammo system where reload would take up time, resource-free special moves that debuff your character or buff your enemy afterwards for some time.\n\n\nCharacter stats will have the traditional strenghth/defense/magic/etc stuff. Leveling up gives you base stats as well as giving you points in a stat tree like FF10. Instead of simply stat nodes, there could also be nodes that gives extra bonuses to a character's attack/special move.\n\n\nCharacters (some or maybe all) equip 'machine parts' that substitute traditional armor can drastically change the battle system. Each 'machine part' comes with intrinsic properties that cannot be changed but also AI settings that the player can tweak. AI settings would be unlocked through the story. AI settings can be toggled between offense/defense/support/various elements and would give bonus stats or attributes to certain attacks. This allow for a lot of customization.\n\n---- \n\n\nI guess this could have simply been an rpg game idea but I thought of it with the graphics polish of a FF game. Although FF games are not exactly great at the moment I still feel like they do a good job designing beautiful fantasy environments.\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this idea or if it's been done somewhere before. Also this is my first post to reddit so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong in terms of reddiquette as well.
1352497994|12xnps|BUG WARFARE: An idea I had.|An RTS game where you play as a group of insects/arachnids, doing what bugs do best: survive.  You're after all the sugar, otherwise known as SP (sugar points) which is scattered across various parts of the neighborhood, like parks, houses, backyards, junkyards, public pools, restaurants, and movie theaters.  There's many bug classes, including but not limited to:\n \nAnts\n\n-common, run of the mill black ants that include a female, flying ant in each party\n\n-fire ants (anti-infantry) who breath fire\n\n-very serious, gruff-voiced army veteran ants (anti-vehicle) that carries a machine gun\n\n-Rage-fueled, bull-like ants with horns instead of antenna, that charge at the enemy\n\n-Slave-maker ants that raid the colonies of other species and steal worker larvae and pupae (they have whips)\n \nSpiders\n\n-normal, house spiders that can be upgraded into tarantulas\n\n-funnel web spiders that act as traps/turrets of some sort\n\n-sac spiders that stun enemies and makes web armor for their comrades\n\n-jumping spiders, with very high evasion, and the large version can carry other spiders from place to place\n\n-a black widow spider (shes black and red, wears sexy clothes and a seductive voice) that lures enemies to attack\n\n-brown recluse spiders(anti-infantry), that upgrade to poison on bite\n \nRoaches\n\n-run of the mill roaches (you see where im going with this)\n\n-giant, hissing cockroaches (with nazi overtones)\n\n-burrowing roaches that travel quickly underground\n\n-death head roaches, that emit noxious gases\n \nFlies\n\n-typical flies\n\n-horse flies, will have increased attack and larger sizes\n\n-crane flies that carry other flies on them, for swarm attacks\n\n-deer flies that cause bleeding damage along\n\n-gnats, they travel in groups to swarm the enemy\n \n\n The structures found and created are mostly various forms of the bugs' habitats, such as mounds of dirt/sand/mud, webs, nests, and piles of trash, rotten food, or feces. The game will have very large 3D environments, full of interactivity and objectives such as going under a desk to retrieve some gum, or up on a dinner table to snatch some food.  Other creatures bother you, like mice, squirrels, dogs, cats, and even humans.\n \n\nIt's not done, but what do you think so far?
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1343211115|x4ice|Game Proposal (x-post from r/gaming)|**Short Description**\n\nEver seen shows like Dual Survival or Man Vs. Wild? What if we turned that into a game, only with a few changes? What if someone created a game with massive worlds, all in different parts of the world, some with snow, some in the desert, some in subtropical climates etc. where you could do anything. See a flower? Do you want to eat it or keep it in your bag? Do you want to scorch it in a fire, provided you're near one while having the flower in your bag, if so then you can. You see a lake. Do you want to drink the water or do you want to put some in a conatiner? I think you get the point.\n\n**features**\n\n* *Massive areas, up to at least 8 square kilometers*.\n This is both Islands, Deserts, Tropical Climates, Subtropical climates, Polar climates etc.\n\n* *Singleplayer, LAN and multiplayer*.\n You'd be able to play all by yourself. Whether or not that's good or bad is up to you. After all, the more people you bring the more mouths there are to feed.\n You'd be able to play on a LAN connection. This means that the only persons who're able to join you are the ones on the same network connection as yourself. Great for LAN parties, obviously.\n\n* *The ability to modify servers, such as adding your own maps*.\n You would be able to buy your very own server, just like you're able too in games like Counter Strike, and add whatever you'd like to it. Maybe you add a new map, maybe you add new animals or sounds or whatever. That's totally up to you. Running the content provided by the game would obviously also be an option\n\n* *The ability to do most everything*\n And that I mean. I want one to be able to focus on stuff. Maybe do that using a keybinding, or maybe if you look at the same object for like 5 seconds it zooms in, therefore focusing your eyes to it. After all we need to be able to see stuff like beetles in a fallen tree, or maybe a scorpion on the ground. Something like that. The ability to interact with as many things as possible, whether they're good for you or not, and the ability to construct, and do as many things as possible is also crucial. I imagine hiring a survivalist expert and simply have him explain as many scenarios with as many features as he possibly can. One might even hire several, all depending on the income of the company.\n\n* A whole lot more that I haven't even thought of, since I focused more on the engine itself, as it's quite important.\n\n**Engine**\n\nAll right, so the engine. I've given this a lot of thought. I'm an amateur Level Designer, so I know how big of a deal the engine is. I also know more about Level Design than Game Design, so I'm able to elaborate a lot more when it comes to engines.\n\n* Source\nSo the Source engine... I consider myself a bit of a novice when it comes to the Source engine. I know most everything about it, the only thing I haven't really dug myself into is scripting. The main reason for that is because I simply don't create maps with gameplay that require scripting. At least I haven't yet :)\nAnyway, down to the engine itself. This game will require large environments with very rich foliage and nature in itself. This the Source engine cannot deliver. First of all there's the space issue. Source is limited to a grid which is far below the 8 kilometers we're looking for, it simply won't be able to pull this off without any form of instancing. Secondly there's the technique behind it. If you want to plant a tree, you need to do that individually. There's no tool to plant several trees using some sort of brush, and that is very much needed in this game. The areas are so large so creating an island, we're talking about simply creating the island, should be something you can do within an hour or so. Will Source be able to create an island at the scale we're looking for? No. Beside, adding the detail I want to see would take very very very long, even if you were able to actually pull this off.\n\n* Unreal\nYou don't have to be interested in Level Design, or any for of Game Design, to know the Unreal engine. It's used for most games, and is by far the engine that supports most games. It's easy to use and modify which makes it perfect for most games. Is it perfect for 'our' game? No, it's not. I haven't spend much time in the Unreal Development Kit, and the time I've had I haven't done anything but creating random shit and messing about with textures. Regardless of how capable this engine is, I know there is a much better engine able to pull this off a whole lot better than Unreal can.\n\n* Creative Engine (Or is it creation?)\nThe reason for my insecure statement is because it basically goes by two names. The engines name is called Creative Engine, as far as I'm aware of, where the kit itself is called Creation Kit... Or else it's the other way around... Anyway, moving on!\nThis engine was used for Skyrim, and as we all know, that game is gorgeous! I've spend a couple of hours in this engine, and while I haven't messed about with landscaping, this is mainly due to the fact that moving around in Skyrim in-engine is a bitch, so I'd rather just create my own detailed caves and add it to my own copy, but it's also due to the fact that I haven't spend THAT much time using it. It's completely model based, beside the landscape itself, which makes it very easy to use, not to mention to understand. While the game is pretty, it's large and is the best option thus far, we're still not there yet. In my opinion, we have a far better engine coming up.\n\n* Frostbite\nAll right, 'imma cut this short. No way.\nSure, Frostbite is one hell of an engine, one of the best ones out there, but there's one thing keeping us from even considering this engine. License. To acquire this engine you need to purchase a, most like very expensive, license, and we can't have that! The thing most people don't realize is that allowing people to modify your game will increase the lifetime of the game A LOT, not to mention the level of enjoyment people will have. Let's face it, PC gamers would be less satisfied with Skyrim if they couldn't head to the community and put trees in Whiterun. Nor would... well most VALVe games be as popular as they are. Imagine a Team Fortress or Counter Strike game where they disallowed us to create our own content. As if that would be successful...\n\n* Cryengine\nThis engine is PERFECT for our game. First of all we have realtime lighting, we can play our map in-engine with the push of a button (In engines like Source you need to compile before you're able to do that. Compiling an eight square kilometer large map... Let me put it like this - it won't happen...) we can paint the landscape with foliage and that works perfectly, and we can create our large map with the push of a button... Literally!\nThis is the engine I've spend the second most time in, and I can tell you, for a game like this it is perfect. I think it would be able to handle anything we throw at it. Another crucial aspect would be graphically. This game HAS to be good looking. I don't know about you guys, but I can't really picture myself being in Half Life 1. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but graphically it's quite old. I at least find it to be a lot easier to immerse myself into a game if it's good looking.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n* Spawning\nI imagine that when you enter a new game, you get to choose an area of which you'd like to spawn in. The game then takes over and spawn you somewhere in that area randomly. One thing I hate when I play DayZ with my friends is the spawn system. I don't want to be able to spawn the same place every time, that sort of ruins the fun, but if my friend spawns on the south coast, and I spawn on the east coast we're kind of fucked. So at least being able to spawn within like 1 kilometer of one another.\n\n* AI\nI only imagine one type of AI being available - Animals. This is anything from bugs to wolfs, all depending on the climate. You'd be able to interact with every animal, that  means being able to eat every bug in the game. Whether or not it gives you diarrhea I do not know, but it would be an option if you don't know exactly what you're eating. This is a game that relies on you knowing stuff, that means a Wiki would be crucial.\n\n* Building\nObviously you'd be able to build. Now I ain't talking about no big ass mansion or anything, but something like a campfire and some shelter would be implemented. This gives the player the option to choose, which is nonlinear gameplay, and we all love that! Another thing you'd be able to build is weaponry. You would obviously not be able to craft a gun, but something like bows and arrows, spears, knifes made out of rocks and all that good stuff.\n\n* Disease\nWhen in the wilderness there's the ever growing chance of getting a disease, these often lead to death, so it's something I almost demand to be implemented. I mean, what's the fun of adding flowers if they could literally only either do nothing to you or do something good. The aspect of knowing you could die any minute is a good aspect. There's a reason why Amnesia is such a popular game!\n\n**'Outro'**\nThat's all I have in mind. After all, it is just a game proposal, and it doesn't have to be executed this way. I'm not gonna ask you to upvote this, and I didn't do it for the karma either. All I'd like you to do is at least not downvote it. I'd like this to go out to as many people as possibly, since I honestly did spend quite a long time thinking about it. Anyway, thanks for reading all of this, if you did, and I hoped I catched your interest. If not I'm terribly sorry for wasting your time :)
1373745033|1i8fd8|A game idea that came to me in a dream.|I had a pretty crazy dream last night and I think it would make a pretty cool video game. He is a brief description of what happens. I'm no writer so fell free to correct or add ideas. Please forgive any errors. Enjoy.\n     An amusement park is sunken into the ground in the early turn of the century. A man and his girlfriend go to abandoned amusement  park in NJ only to fall into a sink whole. Man wakes up in the underground amusement park and is woken by a Johnny. A Johnny is the perfect full blooded mutant. He is dressed in carnival clothing/red and white stripes. He is smaller than the average human by a few inches with a humped back with uneven limbs and a droopy semi- melted face. The Johnny explains how he found the boyfriend by telling him that it is his job to collect what ever falls into the amusement park and bring it back to his city. He then tells how the Johnnys  came to be and tells the boyfriend of the mixed ones. Another group of mutants that are only half or less pure mutant. The Johnny explains that the mixed ones are treated equal among the Johnny but do not want to be. The mixed ones(no race name yet) believe that they are better than the Johnnys because they are closer to the human race. They believe if they go to the surface that they will be accepted into society above ground as equals. During the exploration you and the Johnny are attack by gunfire from an unknown enemy. The Johnny yells for the boyfriend to follow him to a near by bathroom. Dodging bullets the two make it into the bathroom and the Johnny slides down into the toilet. The boyfriend follows by sliding in but the piping in which he is sliding on gives way and the boyfriend is separated from the Johnny. With no knowing of the underground the boyfriend presses on into the unknown darkness. \n     There's more to the dream but that's all for now. Let me know what you thought.  
1374902582|1j5a1i|Slasher: The Game|A while back, I watched a developer video for the game Chivalry. I haven't played it, nor is this post about that game- but in the video they described the game as being a "First-Person Slasher" instead of a First-Person Shooter.\n\nThat got me thinking. What if there *was* a First-Person Slasher?\n\nWhat I mean is this. Imagine your favorite Slasher movie franchise- Halloween, Friday the 13th, whatever. They're always about some hapless teens who are on vacation when some masked killer shows up and kills them all, one by one, without any of the others knowing until the final act. Standard fare for horror viewers. Nothing new here. I'm sure lots of games used that.\n\n*But what if it was the other way around?*\n\nImagine this game: You're the killer. The game starts with you standing outside of the sorority house, weapon in hand. You can see and hear the characters inside, talking and carousing. Maybe you walk up to the open window, and you can hear them talking. You hear one of the characters say she's going back to her room to study, while the others tease her for being such a wet blanket. Taking your opportunity, you go around the back of the building. Maybe you climb up the tree near the second-floor bedroom window, sneaking into the bedroom before the co-ed gets there. You hide in the closet, wait until she's in and she closes the door, then you slip out, draw your machete, and kill her. Hopefully you waited until she was looking away so she didn't have time to scream!\n\nBut that's not all. You see, now you've got a dead body, and you know that her roommate was going to take a shower and then head up to bed. You've only got a few minutes to find a hiding place for the body (say, in the closet or under the bed?) and clean up any evidence before anyone arrives. And, once the roommate gets there, you can wait for the perfect opportunity to jump out and kill her too. But if anyone hears you, or if anyone finds a blood splatter you left behind or a dead body you forgot to hide, then it's all over for you!\n\nDifferent levels could be in different environments (from easy levels where there's lots of hiding places, to difficult levels where there's almost no cover and lots of possible witnesses), and there could even be levels where you're a different type of killer (possibly even stages where you have certain supernatural powers, which you have to use wisely). There could even be different stylized weapons for some added flair. You could set traps, put on disguises to walk through crowds unnoticed, and utilize hidden passages between rooms- all the while watching out for traps set by potential victims trying to escape!\n\nI thought this sounded like a great idea. Would any of you play this game? Has anything like this been done before? Give me your thoughts!

1367191875|1dauya|A random idea for an online game, buyable land and player created content|i just had a random idea. the game basically has an ingame grid-like system. it is divided into 100x100 blocks, technically 99x99 because one column and one row is reserved for roads. there are a few blocks that are developer controlled, eg they make buildings, npcs, quests, dungeons, minigames, items etc. the developer controlled blocks will be nicknamed "cities" or something like that. cities may be made out of as little as 3-4 blocks, or as many as 100 blocks.\n\nplayers can "buy" blocks of land. they are bought with either real life money or ingame currency. my idea is it works like an auction, whoever bids the most for a block of land recieves it. if it is a certain distance away from a city(maybe 5 blocks for a minor city and 10-20 blocks for a major city) it must be open to the public. otherwise you can choose to let people who arent your friends in or not.\n\nif you own a block of land, you can create content like buildings, npcs, quests, dungeons, minigames, items etc. generally, you want to own a block of land closer to a city if you want people to visit, otherwise, it doesnt really matter. you can always "quicktele" to any city, or a block of land you or your friend owns, or a public block of land you know the address of. alternatively, you can take the road, which can be walking, biking, driving, taking trains or whatever the transport system is on the roads.\n\nif the owner of a block is inactive for more than ~30 days, you can forcibly buy their block of land for double what they paid for it, the original owner gets the money. if multiple people want it, it goes to auction with the stating price double the original owner paid for it. they do not get what the owner has created, only the empty land. if someone has forcibly bought something off you, you still keep what you have created, you just must relocate to a new area(and pay for the land there). this is to keep areas around cities which are more valuable current so inactive players cannot hog them. you also can sell your land if you dont want it.\n\nso basically this means that it functions more like the real world does in which there are some areas which are publicly owned and some areas which are privately owned etc. i was hoping this idea would make the game more interesting. thoughts?  
1365767412|1c78c3|A mortal kombat style fighting game with horror movie characters|Ever since Freddy Kruger was a downloadable character for the new Mortal Kombat, i thought "What if there was an entire game like this with horror characters?" So mechanically, it'll be similar to Mortal Kombat and the new DC game Injustice, but the character roster will be the unique thing, including characters spanning back to classic horror (Dracula, Nosferatu, Frankenstein's Monster, Wolfman) to JHorror (Ring, Grudge, etc) and more modern horror (Ghostface, Jason, Clayface, Slenderman, Alien) I think a game like this will be really popular, but the only problem is licensing all these characters, since they all belong to different companies, not just one or two (as crossovers usually go)

The solution will be to accept only the reality that you see, and humour/pacify the other person so you can get ahead and solve the crime, doing so will prevent them from solving the crime in their reality.
1371000989|1g5zk4|A New Generation for the Action RPG|I've been giving this a lot of thought lately. A couple inspirations came to me:\n\n1. The Action RPG genre seems stuck in a rut. All the ones I see have a single player campaign, some sort of online economy, and PvP dueling. I feel like this outside of a small niche, created limited appeal\n\n2. Gaming in general is going through some major shifts in pricing. Online distribution and DLCs are changing games many times over.\n\n3. The show Dr. Who showed me that a story can be compelling, but designed at the root to be episodic, modular, and potentially last forever.\n\nThe story is a fantasy/sci-fi premise on an order of time police, who take various famous orders of warriors from throughout history, train them to become a policing force for time, and place them in areas to stop whoever is trying to manipulate history. The classes can be Human, alien, and range in classes such as spartan warriors, wild west sharpshooters, space marines, all given technology to accentuate their martial skills and make a difference. The game places people anywhere, anywhen.\n\nCharacter Features:\n\n-Characters are much more customizable than other arpgs. Your character should look the way you want. So many options exist to make them your own.\n\n-Character progression is based on gear rather than levels, and challenges to unlock skills that you can switch around in a similar manner to Diablo 3\n\n-Gear is dyable with an unlock system like Guild Wars 2, and many many models will be made. The option to remodel gear will be available as well.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-The game will have a single player story to introduce the world, characters, and mechanics of the game.\n\n-Every few months, a new adventure will be added for you to play though single player, or with your friends\n\n-Boss fights that take groups of players can be done, at various skill levels that promote team work for success. New bosses will be added to regularly. Think MMO raid bosses, but none of the trash and all of the fun. In an ARPG format, this could be really interesting.\n\n-A new class every year or so.\n\n-PvP arenas, and dueling for those who want the straight up slugfest.\n\n-PvP scenarios that allow for different game formats. Including a Dota clone scenario that it just seems natural to the ARPG genre.\n\nSocial Features:\n\n-Total clan support, including an in-house economy, tags, or anything else. Clans are a huge part of longevity.\n\n-Player driven economy. Trading zones that I would think to try and strike a balance for the convenience of the auction house and the human touch of the trading bartering system. I am thinking something more akin to craigslist than ebay.\n\n-All the ladders and chat channels a healthy playerbase needs.\n\nPricing Model:\n\nThe plan is to have it contain a small upfront cost, and then a reasonable price for each new boss, adventure, scenario, class that comes out after release. Maybe some discounted bundles and of course lots and lots of sales. Something like the Steam Workshop for making items could be another monetization option and help build a really cool base of item models to make customization even better.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe idea is to take the fun ARPG genre and make changes to give it some real longevity. Most of these ideas have been implemented in other games (Mostly Guild Wars 2, DOTA 2, Paradox Games, and the major successes and failures of Diablo 3). It would be a great long-lasting experience and bring the genre into a new generation. Any thoughts are appreciated.
1376113654|1k2r3o|A fantasy game in 3 parts|The basic premise of the story would involve a prince or princess who is kidnapped right before they assume the throne and locked away in a fortress far away. The prince/princess would have to sneak out of the fortress, make their way back to their kingdom, and reclaim their rightful throne.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple, but the gameplay is where it gets interesting. There are 3 sections of the game, each with their own unique gameplay styles.\n\nThe first part would be entirely stealth-based, as the player finds a way to sneak out of the fortress. Direct combat is not an option and often times combat of any sort is completely discouraged.\n\nThe second part would be a survival horror game, as the player tries to make their way back into the kingdom, trying to avoid criminals, animals, monsters, and demons while trying to find food, water, and shelter.\n\nThe third part would be an action RPG, as the player is now inside the kingdom and tries to gain back their power. This part would take a more open approach to the story in that your choice of party members and sidequests affects how you make your back to the top. Do you get the support of ambitious generals and silently gain power? Do you appeal to the poor masses and start a rebellion? Do you combine both approaches?
1375649170|1jp5p8|The Definitive Star Wars Game|I found out today that at least 2 INCREDIBLE-looking Star Wars games were cancelled, Battlefront 3 and more recently Star Wars 1313. Obviously this wasn't any game makers fault but something to do with expense and corporate handovers etc but for the love of Christ if any game makers with any access to Star Wars licensing see this, MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR ALL OUR SAKES!!\nAn open world console based Star Wars game that's not MMO. Full open world planets with multiple cities climates and distinct geographical styles. Scale is everything. All of the major planets moons and systems from the films and series. I don't care when it's set but I want it to be an infamous sort of game where you become Jedi or Sith. Fully customisable everything. Ships, cruisers, speeders, blasters, pod racers, (yes, pod racers) i mean seeeeerious customisation. Mission based gameplay earning credits, to spend on said customisation, real estate and property. Weapons for missions, clearly lightsabres, but you go on a quest properly to the planet with the crystal caves to get your light sabre crystal and how you do it determines what colour blade you have. It can be fully local in a single player sense or you can do your quests with friends online or multiplayer on the same console split screen with separate network login. It could intersplice the film stories as you play minor background characters aiding the main characters in notable battles and going off to do your own missions in between. Years can pass between featured film battles. Scale of both space and time are unparallelled. Even if you need to buy a new disc for each planet or system for that scale to be there, thats how they could make their money to make the game. Lightsabre motion controls in first person. Fully switchable to third person (a la skyrim) all forms of recreation, outdoor activities on naboo, metropolitan lifestyle of coruscant including dining, shopping. Landmark set pieces fully explorable like Jedi temple, senate, Jedi archives, all that shit. I want this to be real so bad. And the graphics have to be mental.\nWhat I'm asking for is a less-obscene Grand Theft Auto in the Star Wars galaxy. I can't be the only one who's thought of or wanted this to happen. I would throw all of my money at it, and I guarantee other will too.
1370747404|1fynuq|Survival game idea|\nIt'd be a survival game based off a similar premise of Cloverfield. (Yes, I'm currently watching Cloverfield, which is where I got this idea)\n\nYou start in a major city, all is fine and dandy, until (like traditional monster movie fashion) some event occurs which triggers all out chaos. You're then tasked to gather as many people as you care to gather, and survive while simultaneously trying to kill the monster. You can make moral choices, setup safe-houses and bases all around the city anywhere you want. If you die, the game ends and you are forced to start from scratch, except it might not be in the same city, and it might not be the same threat you are facing.\n\nThe game would need to have a large amount of buildings and levels within said buildings in order to help with the idea of setting up wherever you please.\n\n-Edit- Perhaps instead of restarting somewhere else in an different event, you'd take over someone else's journey during the event, and are shown a short video of how that person came to be involved in the whole event.
1373010786|1hoiyl|Urban exploration game.|A completely empty city, something like NYC or likewise. There are no NPCs, ragdolls, or anything. Only buildings that you can go into and explore. Each room is completely different in terms of content, including the textures of food to carpet types. Stores with items with dust settling on them, clipboards with shipping details. Drivable cars that you can store things in, like bikes or other items. I feel like a game like this would be very surreal, but incredibly interesting. It's practically answering the question "What would you do if everyone disappeared?".

1361941111|19b600|A special kind of sidescrolling platformer/shooter...|You start the game in an 8-bit setting, with everything looking like Contra.  As you progress through the chapters of the game, it starts to look better and more hi-def.  Near the end of the game, it's basically a modern first person shoot-em-up platformer.  For example:  Chp 2= Earthworm Jim-esque graphics; somewhere between 3 and 6 or so= 3 dimensional platforming as opposed to side scrolling.

You go down to check it out, nothing there. Turn around, you see a grey, skinny, leg disappear around the corner. Convince yourself nothing was there, get a glass of water. Go back up to your bed, hear a small chittering sound. hear a door open down the hall, visible from your bed, out walks an extremely tall, extremely skinny "grey" alien. It looks at you for the longest time, then walks away.\n\nand that's just the first night.\n
1349524290|111ecw|Zombie RPG top down defense/puzzle game|The core concept for this game is a post zombie apocalypse world and a group of survivors trying to create a safe zone to further their goals.\n\nOutdoors or indoors map where the border of each map is some sort of impassable object. Walls, cliffs, etc. Roaming zombies are everywhere on the map except where you start. The zombies control the world. Humans have lost. The player is just trying to make it a bit more bearable at the start.\n\nYou push out in straight lines that build safe zones. These lines are visualized as barbed wire with people/robots/turrets spreading out to defend it. This part is mostly identical to capture/trap style puzzle games like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattwach.trap2) or [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix). Besides capturing area, you will have to budget your survivors as a resource to protect and improve your safe area as a normal part of gameplay and as special map conditions.\n\nGoals for each map will not only be to push the zombies back, but to reach certain areas on the map and use your supply of survivors to fix bathrooms, gather food, get weapons, research defenses/healing items, and find survivors before their defenses get overrun. Some maps timed with timers called "hunger" or "tired". These could be a soft timer that doesn't make you lose, just slow down.\n\nCreate traps that need to be placed away from the safe area. Too close and they blow up part of the wall. A team of survivors would rush out into zombie territory, set up the trap, and run back before getting eaten.\n\nIf a zombie gets captured inside your safe area by a poorly placed defense it will enrage and either break down walls or kill people; creating more zombies inside the safe area.\n\nThought this up while dreaming. I'm so proud of myself because usually my ideas suck. This idea can be considered FreeBSD licensing.\n\n

1373368641|1hxfqb|Stranded/Paranormal mash up|A combination survival island/gradual horror game (As time passes, creepier events start to occur). For instance, totems may appear after you wake up on the second or third day, or your food starts to disappear, things start to be rearranged. I'm thinking that for each game, these events are random, much like Paranormal, and a certain event may not happen at all. These events could be put into tiers, with higher/scarier things happening later in the game. Of course all this time you are trying to survive on this island, gathering food, building shelter, and exploring. I was also thinking that you could forgo sleep during the night, since scary shit can happen to you while you sleep. Of course the less you sleep, you have a higher chance of having hallucinations, both visually and auditory. That's really all I have, and others can expand on this idea. I'm thinking of calling it Paul 5. I like the setting to be a bit Far Cry 3, albeit smaller and creepier as you go further and further in.

1370573391|1fu63m|Not really a game- but a new idea for a sport, involving swinging from a rope attached to the ceiling. It could presumably work in a video game too.|Okay, this is a dream I had. It can be played in a typical indoor court basketball/volleyball or something like that, just empty though. Maybe 21x30 metres(but i dont know if that size would work). or so. It is split in half, so each side is 21x15m. It also must be pretty tall, maybe 10 or so metres high? Im bad at distances/measurement so im not even sure this idea can work. \n\nThere are two teams, each with three people. They are distributed so they are all the same distance apart from their teammates and same distance from the center "line". Maybe the person in the middle is slightly further back from the center. They are attached via a rope to the ceiling, made out of a velvety smooth material but strong and thick. Three are dyed red and three are dyed blue, and they are just less in length than the height of the room, so no one is able to touch the ground while attached. \n\nThe (padded)walls also have either small platforms around the perimeter(on the 21m length sides) at varying heights, or a sort of railing which allows you to hook your feet around it so you can actually be next to the wall and rest, and unhook their feet to start swinging. You can also push(kick) off on the walls, and there are a few pillars around(padded of course) which allow you to kick to gain speed or change direction. The padding is made in a way that doesnt make your kicks significantly weaker, so you still can gain speed.\n\nYou can also grab on a higher spot on your rope to swing higher. You can also climb your rope to the top to be at the top of the playing field, but this rarely has advantages as you cannot gain speed(or attack) that way and you have to let go eventually dropping you down and leaving you a vulnerable stationary target.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate all three members of the opposite team. To eliminate a player, you have to swing with enough speed that you end up higher than an opponent(likely directly opposite you) and become able to grab their rope. You then climb their rope(and probably keep hold of your own so they cannot grab yours) to the ceiling and at the top is a mechanism to unattach them from the ceiling. It could either be a button or an actual hook or something, but it must be safe and able to stay attached until someone unattaches them. \n\nAn unattached player is not eliminated as long as they do not touch the ground, so if they are holding on to an opponents rope(or a teammates-but this is probably not advantageous) they can climb it and unattach that opponent and reduce the speed of their swings. It probably is difficult/impossible to unattach more than one player while unattached, so it is sorta a tit for tat scenario. Once a player touches the ground, they are eliminated and cannot intentionally touch other players/ropes. \n\nOnce an opponent is eliminated, they drop to the padded ground below(they likely would have a helmet or something to prevent injuries) Because you still are attached, you can swing back to your wall and kick off again to try and help your teammates eliminate their opponents, and it would be easier 3v2 as opposed to a 3v3. So the first elimination is critical. The rope must be long enough for you to be able to eliminate someone in the diagonal furthest from you. Once a whole team is eliminated, the remaining team gains points based on how many players remain attached, and everyone is reattached for another round. \n \n\n\n\n\n
1375202095|1jcv7s|Top-Down Open World Action/Diplomatic/Stealth RPG|Background/Setting:\n\nA virus, PXH-34, was released onto the world from an unknown source. Humanity was decimated except for people living for years in quarantine. Officials had estimated that the virus would dissipate after 300 years, and so humanity lived, literally, in a bubble; quarantine zones had been created by blowing up massive domes that communities lived in. These zones, however, had been limited, and only people able to reproduce we're allowed inside (of course, this quickly became subject to the corruption of money, so many of the wealthier folk were also able to survive the virus). Finally, after 300 years, the domes are being torn down and humanity is able to live in the cities once more.\n\nUnfortunately, many gangs had also managed to either steal or talk their way into the domes. Thus, when humans were released, the cities became overwhelmingly gang-driven. The military did not have enough force to drive away these gangs. Cities and their outlying suburbs swiftly became subject to faction wars between the gangs fighting over territory, weapons, and people. The population grew attached to the gangs as their leaders rather than government officials due to the tangibility of their progress and power.\n\nTen years after humanity's release, you find yourself in a homemade and self-sustaining fallout shelter which had been built by your ancestors who were doomsday preppers. One day, a large explosion rocks the shelter and the door is blown open. Several gang members, spotting a scavenging opportunity, had broken in. Almost every resident of the shelter is brutally killed or kidnapped except for you, who was able to hide before being dragged away or shot. The gang leaves, taking almost all of your supplies. The next day, a man by the name of Gerald is walking alone within the shelter, talking to himself. Confronting him, he decides to introduce you to the outside. As he brings you through the blown-open door, he turns to you, flings out his arms, and yells, "Welcome to the end of the fucking world!"\n\nPlot:\n\nThe game takes place in the Milwaukee and Waukesha areas. Four gangs have taken over the counties: the Mila Family holds the industrial district, as well as Miller Park (these are very family-oriented people who look for the good of the people they control. This, of course, requires money and power and they are willing to use force in order to achieve these), the Sementales hold the suburban areas (these are people focused upon territory because, of course, there is power in numbers. They hope to expand, but other territories block their advance. They are very accepting of newcomers to their gang (they have to be in order to expand in such a way), but they do not trust easily), the Lapans control Lapham peak in Waukesha county and the immediately surrounding areas (these people are extremely untrusting to outsiders. There are stories of the road leading up to Lapham Peak being covered in bodies from the Lapans shooting them on sight. These people wish only to be left alone), the Brooks who occupy in downtown Waukesha (these people are fairly accepting of folks who respect their territory and respect their members. They can turn nasty very quickly, however, if you get on their bad side. They are people who are running a democratic society (well, as democratic as a society such as this can get) and wish to grow in a healthy way), and finally the Old Military who occupy the metropolitan Milwaukee area (they wish to control the anarchy of the other gangs, as well as give civilians a stable place to live. They have many refugee camps, and are in constant tension with the Semantales and Mila Family). Most other areas are open for scavenging, but some towns may have smaller factions that play less of a role than the Big Five. As Gerald says, "I want you to look around and honestly try to tell me that this world, this... This corrupt shitshow of a world is not free for the taking." The gangs have noticed this as well, and are doing their best against the rival factions to maintain what control they have or seize control over other parts of the counties. With your influence, maybe the counties can be taken over.  The question remains as to who will rule? This, of course, is left to you. Also, if you play your cards right, you could even help a smaller faction rise to power and contend with the Big Five, and, with enough effort, could help this new superpower take over as well.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis game will take place from a top-down perspective (trying to be as realistic as possible considering the resources of most devs, although the complexity of my idea is probably a bit much anyways) and will have RPG elements. Classes will be in the form of "gifts" as in naturally being a good shot, or having always been a silver-tongued devil, etc. Stats will be organized into tiers. For example, there is an all encompassing Diplomacy skill that a single point could be added to which adds one point to Persuasion, Charisma, and Leadership, while the one point to Persuasion adds one point to Intimidation, Bribery, Blackmail, Lying, and Trustworthiness. Also, instead of adding a point to overall Diplomacy, a person simply add three points to Persuasion which adds three points to each of the five sub-stats, and the person could also just add fifteen points to their Lying skill. Many of these abilities go hand-in-hand, however, so only leveling Lying while ignoring Trustworthiness will be ineffective in situations of persuasion.\n\nThe combat will be a mix dice roll combat and top-down shooter. This works in such a way that, when Combat Mode is engaged, time stops and you are given a chance to examine the battlefield. When a "move" is made, time will play for the duration of that move and it's cool down period. For example, actual movement of the player has a one second cool down period, while taking a shot has a three/fourths second cool down period. This does not mean, however, that you have to wait a second to move. You can continue to fire and move even before the cool down period has run up, but time will simply continue to play if this is done. In this case it becomes a Hotline Miami-esque shooter if the cool down periods are ignored, but it can also be very strategic due to its "turn based" nature. Combat Mode engages if you are spotted in an area where there is a kill-on-sight rule, if a group of bandits decide to ambush you, or even if you instigate the fight yourself. Basically, any time there is live combat, whether it be a small or big firefight or even a brawl, Combat Mode engages.\n\nAlso, since Combat Mode only engages when you are spotted in a restricted area, stealth is a viable option. Noise plays an ENORMOUS factor in stealth; it can be a hinderance, but it can also be used to your advantage. The advantageous nature of sound is not only used in the way of "throw a bottle, the crash attracts noise," it can also be used to actually cause fear within the enemy. Fear and psychological deterioration play a big part in stealth. For example, if a guard finds a body, he might freak out and run for the alarm. But what if the alarm was busted by the player previously? The enemy would then feel very extreme panic. He might call his other guards for help. They're freaked out by the body as well (also, just a suggestion, but what if the way a person was killed affected how they reacted? For example, beating somebody to death very violently might cause more panic than simply putting a bullet in the back of their head. Just a thought). Then things such as throwing bottles or bricks would instill even more fear within the person as they looked for you. Then, if the guard is so jumpy and scared, they shoot a fellow guard who came around the corner because he thought that the guard was you. Then the other guards become suspicious and mistrusting of the killer; some groups may even kill him. Also, perhaps if a person who is weaker-willed finds the bodies of all of his fellow guards, he may run away (or, if the "cause of death" thing applies, commit suicide to escape the horrible death causes to the others). This type of social and psychological commotion gives the perfect opportunity to slip past silently.\n\nThere is an alternate route through everything, though; in fact, it is possible to beat the game without killing a single person or having to worry about sight lines and noise, and this is through diplomacy. Every situation can be talked out of with the correct amount of skill and proper reputation. For example, if a shop owner finds you snooping in the back of his store and holds you at gunpoint, you can put your hands up and try to convince them of your innocence before they start shooting. This can be done through charisma (if the person likes you enough, they will let you go), intimidation (pulling your gun on them is very effective, and pairing this with intimidating speech could allow you to not only be set free, but rob the owner of the store as well), simply lying (convincing the person that you were looking for the bathroom or something like that), and more. In this way, it is possible to steal from people without pickpocketing, knocking out, or killing them; with the proper Intimidation skill level, you can rob a person at gunpoint, or with enough Charisma and Trustworthiness you can get the person to like you enough to hand over some cash. Also, finding dirt on a person is equally effective as Blackmail is a very real option if you are looking to get a lot of money fast.\n\nThe World:\n\nThe general idea is that standing in a spot and leaving the game on overnight could greet you with an entirely changed world in the morning. Maybe the Sementales' territory expanded, or maybe the Old Military conducted a raid on a factory belonging to the Mila Family, or maybe two sovereign factions in the middle of nowhere had one conquer the other. Perhaps a Sementales caravan had accidentally gone through Lapan territory and was shot, creating further tension between the two. Maybe the Patriots elected a new governor that some are happy about and some aren't. The idea is essentially that the game does not wait for you. In fact, one of the Big Five could take over the counties without any help you. It is a living, breathing world that is constantly changing during the most tumultuous time of the area's history.\n\nTL;DR: It is an RPG with a fully simulated world with turn based and action combat, psychological stealth, and diplomacy set in a large game world five rival factions are competing for.\n\nThe programming for this game would be ridiculously complex, and I am very well aware of that. This is essentially just a slew of ideas thrown together with a plot to go along with it.
1374826284|1j33zp|Thanks for this sub - I'm a game developer|Industry vet. Going to make some games after work, but not sure what. Been looking for sources of inspiration for games I can bang out in 4mo or so. \n\nEvery idiot and their dog has an idea, so I'm surprised it's so sparse here.
1362100354|19flvh|An Interesting Take on Dungeon Crawlers|This idea was forming for a while for me, inspired by a few other games and some fantasy stories.\n\n[This](http://imaginarymonsters.com/2013/01/28/catacombs-15-the-demons-kiss/) is the main bit of inspiration, it bugged me how in stories such as this they'll get fairly violent and show dismemberment, but when games are made in the same genre it doesn't translate. \n\nI'm thinking of a combination of Diablo and the Souls series, a fairly difficult dungeon crawler but with the player's state changing depending on what happened to them. The limb physics would be similar to games like Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, or Never Dead; each limb could be directly affected by the environment. While death would take longer in some cases, it would make the game more difficult.\n\nSay you were a mage going through and an enemy bites off your left hand, your left hand spells would be gone but you could still fight with your right. Fall damage would follow the same idea, you can break your legs and limp or even just have to crawl. I know it sounds like it would get tedious, but I feel the magic aspect would be able to fill in the gap as you are able to either replace limbs or fix them.\n\nThe inventory would work around this as you equip different tools, weapons, or spells to each limb; even your head would have spells in the event you got both arms cut off. The armor would work in the same matter as your limbs, if broken the armor would just fall off to which you would just not have armor for that slot anymore unless equipped. \n\nI understand this would put a lot of strain on hit boxes and be fairly difficult, but I want to play a game where instead of saying how hard a fight was because this little bar almost went down, but because I don't have a left arm, my legs are burned, and my right eye is missing. \n\nEdit: As an addition I wanted to have the ability of scars, something a bit better than what's been featured before. Something purely cosmetic, can be easily fixed, but still has to first be earned in a related injury.
1357403489|160ft4|Open world zombie idea|I would love to see a game come out that is a mix between GTA4 and Prototype. \n\nNot sure how the story would go, but you'd be able to free roam like in GTA4 and have a massive zombie outbreak and be able to upgrade your character (ie: faster and or longer running, car upgrades, gun upgrades, the whole nine yards) like in Prototype.\n\nI absolutely love the open world aspect of GTA4, what better way to improve than to add zombies.\n\nThis might be stupid, seeing as there are so many zombie ideas out there, but I personally would love a game like this.
1358456670|16ruv4|Spy mmo Idea|the basic idea is it a PVP only mmo similar to planetside but rather than using machine guns, you use bugs and silenced pistols. I was thinking it would be set in the 1980s with two areas Moscow and DC, The basic gameplay would be class based with all the things you would expect bomb makers, field agents, counter intel, forgers and undercover operatives. I was thinking the gameplay would work similar to DnD if an undercover operative walks up to another players and tries to convince him they are the same faction it runs a check based on their skills. the gunplay would all be like planetside, where you have to aim and aren't just pressing the 1 key to shoot.
1354319478|142tva|Planetside + Medieval Total War + Chivalry |First off I apologize if this is long winded, but I have a lot on my mind. I have always been a fan of Medival themed games, obviously focusing on the fighting styles. I love swords and maces, longbows, catapults, etc. Fast forward to the present, Ive been playing Planetside 2 and Chivalry, alterating between the two and cant stop myself from thinking what itd be like with a crossover. If this is an idea thats already been covered, please just let me know and we'll pretend all this never happened. Few basic thoughts, and what I would take from each game...\n\n\n* Medieval Total War - theme, time period, factions, units, massive battles \n* Chivalry - first person combat (similar to Skyrim if youve never played Chivalry), class sytem\n* Planetside 2 - sandbox-ish continent with 2000+ people on at a given time, platoon system, overall "big" gameplay elements, teamwork, big battles (not using their dumb render system)\n* any RPG - leveling system, class system, unlockable weapons, armor, etc, maybe some class based skills.\n\n\nSo if youre still following me here, you end up with a game that has multiple factions (im thinking like 8, anything more would be chaotic), all active and organized on the same "continent". You would have leaders telling people where to go and who to attack. You could spawn as a Man-at-Arms, a Knight, a bowman, an engineer (catapults, ballista) or other similar types. You would also be able to level up your character to have better abilities, weapons, armor, etc. When you go to battle, it would be a massive BF3/PS2 style fight, but in this case, you charge in bravely screaming, swinging your sword at any and all comers. Archers and equipment in the back to provide support. Similar to how Total War handles their battles, except each unit would be controlled by a human, rather than giving orders to the whole group. You would use Chivalry style controls. For those who dont know, this is a first person sword/board system, similar to skyrim. It also includes some combo moves, parrying, dodging, blocking, etc. \n\nAs far as the map/world. It would be a mix of total war and planetside, with it leaning more towards planetside. Im thinking take the whole land grab and "control an important fort/base/area" would be good. But rather than just the 3 factions like in Planetside, you would have 6-8 trying to control the important parts of the world. You could also introduce some sort of time-based treaty system so you could team up and help our allied factions and to cut down on the free for all feel. \n\nNot sure where to go about having a "victory" sort of circumstance. Maybe if you control a certain amount of the world, you get some global credit like "The Faction of the Turks have conquered the world!" Each team would have to have a faction castle or something so they couldnt be completely wiped off the map, but are "defeated" when they only have that land. After a faction conquers the world, the other teams would be tasked to push out against the spread out faction. This is closer to Planetside's setup, which i like. But this part could definitely use some tweaking. \n\nAnother thing is vehicles. Obviously people arent going to walk everywhere, but this is also back in time. So in my eyes the easy solution is horses, chariots, elephants, and the like. Knights could be a playable class, maybe like an "uber" or "advanced" class that you can only spawn a certain amount of times. Also naval warfare could certainly be implemented, but I could see this being pretty worthless, as people would just not go in the water if they didnt want to. Maybe make it so that the boats can assault the factions main bases to reduce resource generation? Transport ships and what not could add a nice level of mobility for sneakier factions.\n\nAny thoughts? Is this something decent? Or did I waste like 15 minutes typing all this up?
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1355520739|14v2vh|Detective game set in 1950s London (A spin on LA Noire)|Thought I might as well throw this here in case someone needs an idea. I will probably never get to it, because I'm quite an unmotivated person.\n\nWhy London, because [this.](http://cdn1.retronaut.co/2010/09/london-1950s-in-hi-res-colour/) I'm pretty sure this idea was on Reddit earlier but I have a twist (A TWIST!) that will hopefully make this more interesting.\n\nNow then:\n\nTimes are restless in London. With a backdrop of large riots that have forced the authorities to actually close off a portion of South London, we find our detective working to solve a series of murders and disappearances. It seems as though all the victims have one thing in common: the army. Whether men returned from the war or family of active servicemen, all victims seem to have been connected to the forces - and even more curiously, connected to a prominent scientist on visit from Italy.\n\nStudying these cases, our detective is led to a government project kept under tight control. What project is this, and what role did the Italian play in it? Right as our detective gets close to some potential answers, he is given notice of a new disappearance - it's the Italian!\n\nOur detective sets off to inspect the residence of the mysteriously vanished scientist; a residence which happens to lie on the outskirts of the riot area, closed off and guarded by military. At the house, our detective is met with a ghost town. It seems nobody has decided to stay amidst the chaos of the riots. At the end of the street looms a barricade ten feet high. Our detective sees a figure climb over the barricade and fall down on the street. It gives a small groan and gets up, walking toward him. Still quite a distance away, the figure is shot and collapses as a military vehicle rolls into view. Our detective hides behind a corner sensing something is amiss. Why was the figure shot? More importantly, however, why did it seem like *it was already dead?*\n\nAs the military vehicle drives away, our detective goes inside the Italians house finding a right old mess and signs of a struggle. He does not have time to search for clues though, as he is met with a sudden case of shovel-to-the-back-of-the-head-itis. A medical condition most commonly found in victims of assault.\n\nOur detective wakes up an unspecified time later on a boat, staring into the eyes of the vanished Italian scientist. As he comes out of his post-shovel grogginess, he is treated to a classic criminal mastermind story where he finds out all about the mysterious government project.\n\nThe Italian never gave up on his fascist ideals after the fall of Mussolini in Italy during the war. He harbours a great resentment toward the powers of the Allied nations and, as such, when he was hired to work on deciphering some captured Nazi scientific material, he was all too happy to take it and use it to bring about the fall of Great Britain and the United States. The contents of the scientific material is seen on the shores of the river in the supposed riot district: zombies.\n\nSince our detective showed such a keen interest in the murders and disappearances orchestrated by the Italian for the purpose of unleashing a zombie plague on London, our detective was set up and is now to be left into the plague zone to die. Meanwhile, the Italian means to take a boat to mainland Europe and then continue his journey by plane to North America as to fulfill his plan of revenge.\n\nOur detective is left on the shore along with his pistol (because that's just fair) knowing that he must now face not only a horde of zombies, but also a race against time to stop the Italian before he brings about what might be the extinction of the entire human race.\n\n(Woah, this ended up a bit long...)\n\ntl;dr: Detective story meets zombies.

1346329981|z2oe6|MMORPG idea: Mad Max|**Note:** I understand Americans might not be familiar with the Mad Max series but Mad Max 2 was released as "the Road Warrior" \n\n**Concept** Admittedly I am not an MMORPG expert but I am told that some of the main frustrations with them is the lack of variety in combat and missions. So I thought the solution might be a highly stripped down RPG with no missions where everything else is sacrificed in favour of greater customisability of your weaponry and thus greater variety in combat. I was thinking about kids playing conkers - you make your conker as strong as possible, you fight it against other conkers and that is it.\n\n**Premise** The currency of the game is petrol, petrol is scarce. You drive a car, in fact for simplicity you are a car. Your car uses petrol to move around and in addition you can trade petrol for repairs and upgrades to your car - be it weapons, a faster engine, armour etc.. As customising your car is the major part of the game this needs to be a sophisticated process - considering elements such as the impact of extra weight on speed etc...\n\nYou then drive around the map fighting other players. You win and you can siphon their petrol out of the wreck of their car - lose and something bad happens. I think the fairest result is that your car respawns but with an empty petrol tank so you need to downgrade some equipment to refill your tank. That way you don't totally lose your last 6 months work, but its still pretty bad - especially if you had a full tank.\n\n**Map** To facilitate gameplay the map needs to be massive. To facilitate the map being massive it can be largely featureless desert with such features as there are (cacti, sand dunes, ravines etc...) being reasonably repetitive.\n\n**Economics** My original idea was that, like Mad Max, the game's economics simulate Peak Oil. That is, it is zero sum - in face negative sum. There is a finite amount of petrol in the game and as that petrol is used up (by driving around) that amount is getting smaller and smaller and petrol is becoming scarcer and scarcer.\n\nHowever this may make for quite a dull game as things literally grind to a halt. Of course petrol would enter the game as new players join the game with full tanks but this is not a good long term method of supply as it would result in newbies being heavily targeted and possibly even farmed. So there probably is a need to have some in-game sources of petrol. \n\nOne idea I had was for there to be oil wells that randomly spring up around the map (giving an incentive to explore), are then tapped for petrol, fought over (presumably), but then run dry reasonably quickly (otherwise we get into a situation where the game becomes purely about attacking and defending certain locations).\n\nIn any instance by subtly increasing or decreasing the petrol efficiency of the engines it should be possible for the admins to control the economy quite well. The idea that petrol is very very scarce should be maintained but, so that the game doesn't involve endless parking up trying to conserve petrol, it makes sense to have the engines be very energy efficient relative to petrol's purchasing power (so a gallon of petrol won't buy you anything much but can keep you going for a few day's driving)\n\nAnother potential problem is high level players finding killing weaker players too easy and so acquiring vast amounts of petrol. Two options here: one is to make petrol storage not infinite (so extra fuel tanks are a severe weight load and fire hazard - thus providing a disincentive to hoarding). The other is to see how well the community can police itself - with weaker players banding together for protection or forming posses to hunt down stronger players. \n\nIndeed it would be interesting to see the consequences of these two options intermingling - a player might decide to design a car which is effectively a massive petrol tanker and would then store petrol for other players in exchange for protection.\n\n**Gameplay** In the interests of making designing the best possible car and driving around blowing up other people's creations as good as it can possibly be I suggest everything else is as stripped down as possible - no complicated systems of villages, markets, workshops or anything like that. Just a menu system which allows you to make any modification and repair you like to your car at any time by pausing (save for in the heat of battle) and by trading petrol with the central bank. For simplicity's sake I suggest to begin with there not even be trading between players - that can be added in later (allowing people to run protection rackets, venture capital, loan shark businesses etc... all self policing - violently of course).\n\nLater on we could look at adding in things like villages with workshops or NPCs. One idea I had was for newbie areas where powerful NPCs patrol and attack players above a certain level. We could also look at things like players building and fortifying their own petrol storage areas or oil wells. Or flight. Or boats. Or submarines. But the main thing is to concentrate on making the vehicles as customisable as possible and the combat as interesting as possible - with everything else secondary\n\n**TL:DR I'm not a game developer but I had this idea. So anyone that is, you are welcome to it**
1368823473|1ejg01|Looking for suggestions, I have a solution looking for a problem. (so to speak)|Apologies in advance is this is the incorrect place.\n\nI'm working through a masters program for computer science, and my thesis is an economic engine designed to be incorporated into a game. It's always been my intention to take the finished engine and build a game around it but I'm stumbling for what sort of game would be best.\n\nFor Background:\nThe engine operates on a set of nodes (cities, space stations, planets, whatever) connected by static routes.\nEach node can have a market or can be empty.\nEach market has 1+ traders that consume and produce commodities.\nTraders in a market buy and sell commodities with prices fluctuating with supply.\nMovers move along routes carrying commodities between nodes.\nMovers also fight other movers and can take control of nodes.\n\nEssentially Nodes are cities, Routes are roads, and Movers are merchants and armies moving around the world.\n\nThe original intent behind the engine was to give some dynamism and life to a sandbox game, so that player actions could better effect the world, but beyond that I have a creative block.\n\nAny ideas or discussion would be most appreciated.\n\nEdit: bulleted lists apparently hate me
1375728565|1jr93l|FPS inspired by "The Most Dangerous Game"|I'm sure everyone here has read the short story, so you should have an idea of where this is going.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YhAJVqZ.jpg\n\nLet's call it TMDG, for now. TMDG would be like a generic FPS title COD/BF3 with very similar mechanics, movement speed, weapon handling. Two factions: The Hunters and The Hunted. The Hunters are civilized, dressed to impress, carry single shot firearms. The Hunted are beaten, rough, dirty, and carry stone knives, construct traps, throw rocks, spears, and fire arrows. \n\nGameplay would be like hopping into tdm and getting a high score. However, each faction has different ways to score points faster than just killing. The Hunters can destroy traps which helps keep their hounds alive, and the hunted can sneak behind enemies to capture or restrain them. I guess the games starts to sound a lot like spy vs. mercs from splinter cell, but that's a good thing imo. If at all possible, maps would be randomly generated with different settings: jungle, snow forest, etc.\n\nPlayer voice is proximity based, so you can whisper, "Sshh, sshh, it's okay." As you slice an enemies neck.

1375057817|1j8u9g|RPG Speed Run Game.|I've had this idea floating around for a while, and I've come to terms with the fact that I just don't have the time to create it.\n\nIt would be a 2D side scrolling arcade-y RPG game, with all the usual features (classes, xp, levelling, skill trees, stats, gear, gold, loot.), with user designed levels (including a level editor). You start at level 1, and you would die fairly easily. If you level up before you die, you keep your level and loot, but (maybe) lose the XP you have gained towards the next level.\n\nOnce you die, you start again at your higher level, making it easier to get further. The levels would be short, but hard enough that you would need to level several times to get through. All of this would be timed, and the clock only pauses when you are in menu screens (managing inventory, levelling up, choosing stats and skills etc.). The idea is to get the quickest time on the level. Times would be tracked with an online leader board per level.\n\nSo the idea of the game is to basically speed run it, and with user created levels. Those with higher skill may be able to beat the level with less xp and levels under their belt, but those with more xp and levels would find it easier (and faster) to get through the level. It would be a balancing act of difficulty vs. time.\n\n
1363482433|1afubr|An Alien game which wouldn't suck.|Basically, its 6 guys about, on large spaceship, with lots of corridors. But there is and Alien from the movie, Alien. It would be a bit like slender, exept you can fight back, you all have pulse rifles, and to have the best chances agenst  the alien, you need to group together, but, there's no hud, no minimap, and random spawns.
1363443013|1aeqh8|Dawn to Dusk: An Empire Builder|I've had this idea knocking about in my head for about five or so years, it is an RTS of a scope I personally haven't seen before.\n\nSo, the games starts at the dawn of the bronze age, around 3500 BC, you choose an area on the globe to start and this grants a culture (i.e. the type that developed there historically, so a mesoamerican culture if you start in modern day Mexico etc, and then you can choose another from a list to obtain a blend of said cultures, so you could be greco-barbarian or Jomon-Songhai.\n\nOnce these are chosen a village is formed. You then control this village age of empires style, developing farms and other buildings, recruiting soldiers of an appropriate level, at this point technology is available when the materials and buildings to create it are present. Once your village gets to a large enough size and you control, through conquering, trade etc, enough surrounding territory and villages, the map zooms out as you enter a new era.\n\nAt this point the map is more in the style of the total war games, though still only covering a small (though larger area), think about the size of Belgium in total, with various city states present, including your developed village, which you name, likewise, any religion you develop you can name and you can adopt the religions of neighbours. The goal here is the same, to take over the area and become the most powerful, through trade or war etc, you could also form a federation of cities for example. At this stage battles would be separate from the campaign like TW and take place on separate maps with the units you have, which are affected by what you can build and the cultures chosen.\n\nAt this point you reach the level of a local power and the map extends once more, to cover an area akin to Europe (think again of total war) - at this point you will probably be in about 1000-500 BC and it continues, the map expanding as your nation's size does through to the entire world when the technology allows it - so ships that can cross oceans and vaccinations etc to prevent disease. This would then go into the future, with an end date of perhaps 3000 AD, so about 6000 years covered, research all the way through determines what technology you have, along with your religion etc, final goal world domination.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, your nation picks up traits that also affect its gameplay from your style in previous steps, so don't use cavalry early on? Don't expect to have a nation of horse lovers, spend a lot of time perfecting siege weapons? Expect to get more advanced ones sooner.\n\nWhat do you think?

1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.
1351033997|11z2xv|How has nobody made this game yet?!|Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this...\nI've been searching the webs for a game like this and I simply can't understand why nobody has made it yet?! It's a perfect crossover. The market would be huge.\nWhat I'm picturing in my head is Football (American) but with Halo-like maps, physics, weapons, and vehicles. Obviously this would be difficult to pull off on a 100 yard field, since a typical football play usually lasts around 5 seconds, but if you scale that up to about 500-1000 yards, and make the distances between the players at the starting position greater so they have time to advance on each-other, this could get rather interesting. Football afterall was modeled on warfare when it was originally designed.\nI'm picturing a 3rd person shooter, though I suppose a 1st person shooter would work as well. The football element would of course need to be maintained strictly. Nothing "resembling" football would work. It would have to be real-time football with all the rules and scoring.\nOn offense the player would have to chose a formation, and the personnel, exactly like in regular football. A precise number of players must line up on "the line". The player needs to be able to select a pre-designed play with x's and o's, and would need to advance the ball, some distance in 3 downs or less, filed goals, pass interference, blitzes, etc etc.\nThe interesting thing would be the player types. I'm picturing linemen as tanks, jeeps/warthogs for linebackers/running backs, and quick vehicles like motorcycles/ghosts as wide receivers and defensive backs. Then there's all sorts of special abilities like invisibility, temporary invincibility, speed bursts, jetpacks, shields, etc, which can be spread out over the map just like in regular shooters.\nOn defense, in order to tackle the player, you would simply need to kill them. If you kill somebody without the ball, they would re-spawn after a few seconds, just like in football where if you block a player they can still get back in the play. The strategies that would emerge are fascinating since you don't have to be physically present next to the player to "tackle" them. For example sniping a wide receiver who is breaking away. Or mining the middle of the filed against a running play. Or getting a head shot on the player JUST as he's catching the ball to cause an incomplete pass.\nOn offense you could set up screen plays by overloading one side. You could bum rush the middle with a running play. You could sprint out your wide receiver on a ghost to get the invisibility. You could do flea-flickers. Misdirection plays, reversals, etc.\nI haven't even thought about what halo-like launchers and teleporters would do to this game.\nAnyway, I'm not sure why nobody has made this game yet. I know it's not too complex to pull off because all the elements exist other games. Do the big studios not think that people who play Madden don't also play COD or Halo? They know the crossover is huge.\nWhy not at least make it a game type in an existing shooter game?
1355632734|14xfe9|"The Legends of Torragrae" A true RPG|I've had this idea for almost a year. Using other current games as examples to show you guys how this game plays out. \n\n* Some Lore:\n The game takes place on the planet "Torragrae" which is part of a solar system with multiple planets. There is a grand total of 16 races, which all come from different planets in the solar system using "Celestial Magics". Races are: \nHuman, \nDwarf,\nElf,\nArchan (Larger, Winged Elf),\nValkrie (Bird Person),\nWolfen (Wolf Person),\nBjordur (Bear People),\nOrc, Troll,\nFallakar (Vampire-ish person),\nDeamos (Demon-like person),\nVillikyr (Bat Person),\nLyon (Tiger-Person),\nTudnyr (Turtle People),\nWoodKiin (Wood-skinned, leaf-haired people),\nDeereskavan (Deer People).\nThere are 9 different fighting styles (Warrior - sword + shield, Brute - 2H Sword, Gaurdian - spear + large shield, Archer - Bow [short-sword secondary], Scout - Throwing Knives [dagger secondary], Rogue - Duel Daggers, Mage - 4 elemental Magics, Relic - Healing/Poison/Light magic, and Necromancer - Possession/Summon/Dark spells) and 1 "Aoe" for each. A master of the style, gifted by the "Spirits".\n*  Main Story: You play as the "10th Aoe" selected to be reborn by the "Spirits" only when there is an extremely large threat to planet Torragrae and it's people. The last 10th Aoe was reborn over 5000 years ago, and he was selected to defend Torragrae from a Demi-God named "Tzhaekr" who seeked to enslave the planet. Unfortunately, there are two major problems, 1: You don't have the other Aoes by your side at first, and some of the Aoes are against each other, as they are on different sides of the largest war in Torragrae History. 2: You have absolutely no idea what the major threat is, but you are considering it's the war.\n* Gameplay: The fighting would be like Skyrim in a sense that you hit people with things and they wouldn't (unrealistically) just die right there. They would take a multitude of hits. It would be like dishonored in a sense that the last hit would do a small cinematic of killing the enemy. It would be like TF2 in a sense that your hits would display damage in text (If you had the option on) and there would be random critical hits that do extra damage and have a higher chance if you hit them in a critical part of the body. It would be like Far Cry 3 in a sense you unlock abilities and perks as you do quests, and the harder the quest, the more XP you get to level up and unlock another perk that you can get as a tattoo anywhere on you to show off. And like many RPGs, it takes place in a huge open world with many countries, all with slightly different laws and many different cultures. You choose your beginning, you play through and make your choices throughout the game, which all add up and decide your end. \n\nIf you got this far, I really appreciate you guys taking your time to read this. Please send feedback, or If you want to know more, I'll tell!
1366943388|1d4mtn|First person open world futuristic SciFi shooter|An elite alien race from a galaxy far away travels from star system to star system searching for life that they may find suitable for contributing in their competitive survival arenas for the sake of entertainment.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you choose what race you want to be. There would be a large variety ranging from humans to something like squid-faced people. You customize their appearence and the different races would have preset attributes or skills that they may specialize in. These skills are yet to be decided. \n\nOnce you've completed your character creation, your character will awake to a giant bright light looming in the sky. You are unable to remember how you ended up in such a unfamiliar place. Still disorientated, you look around for the first time and you raise your hands to your face and notice that you are in an unusual suit. You are startled when you see mountains of corpses behind you and beneath yourself. Out of the bright light you see more bodies spewing out flailing as they crush the ground. Another smaller and strange machine approaches in sky, but it seems to be patroling the area. Suddenly, its gaze becomes fixed on your player. It draws closer. By this time, your character jumps to their feet and stumbles down the hill. You hit the bottom and bolt blindly between the gaps of the bodies without looking back. \n\nWhile sprinting, you are taken to the ground by an unknown force. On your back you look up to see a black reptillian like creature staring you in the face with both of your arms pinned. "Fooooooooood." it hisses. Surprisingly you are able to understand it. As the monster raises his arm ready to strike, he is pounded in the skull with a peice of debri. The reptile is out cold and your savior, a human, helps you up. He wore a sideways tied cloth that covered his left eye. He was grimy and sported a suit similar to your own. He looked tough, and his brown hair was a mess. He takes you back to a makeshift shelter in the dump where he explains the situation to you.\n\nYour character soon has flashbacks of their home planet. Scenes of them running with other creatures of the same race from giant airships with blinding lights. Another scene flashes of you clamped down to an operating table as mechanical arms began to perform procedures on you. The human speaking to you tells you that species are usually disposed of when an operation has malfunctioned or you are deemed unusable in the arena game. Most die on impact from the drop and if any survive, they are cleaned up by drones. The human tells you that few manage to get away. He explains to you that his eye was a failed operation while trying to implant his heads up display. He also mentions that you seem healthy looking and are most likely an operation error. He tells you that language translation aids are implanted in your ears in order for more interesting fights within the arena. \n\nThe game will go on progressing with a main story, and you'll have many side quests. You'll scavenge loot, level up skills, and explore the mysterious world. Many districts are accepting of escaped contestants while others aren't. You can be caught and jailed up by the local enforcement or killed off if things really get out of hand. I apologize if It got boring to read. I feel like I began to ramble on, but you get the point. Tell me what you think. I know this subreddit isn't that big, and this was typed on my phone so excuse my mistakes.\n\nTL;DR: An elite alien race from a galaxy far away travels from star system to star system searching for life that they may find suitable for contributing in their competitive survival arenas for the sake of entertainment. Lol.
1367230300|1dbvpu|A fantasy RPG with Binding of Isaac-like gameplay|A quick brainstorm so let's make it quick :)\nSetting: Warhammer Fantasy\nTitle: "Dark Apotheosis"\n\nOpen world, no random generated content, plenty of choices and quest branches. No main quest. \n\nSkill and stat system like Morrowind, inventory and equipment as well, but perhaps more simplyfied. Maybe a class system, maybe not.\n\nGameplay like BoI (Dunno if it has a certain name or genre), graphics in the same alley but more gritty and "realistic".\n\nThe world could consist of the northern areas of the warhammer world. You'd start very southernly and the game would increase in difficulty the more north you went (much like in warhammer fantasy). There would be neutral villages and factions. Meaning that some villages/towns would be hostile unless you join their faction.\n\nYou start as male / female with ragged clothing but no "in-game" background. Maybe you're a runaway slave? Maybe you're a southerner drawn to chaos? And so on. \n\nEnd-game would be having enough favour from the chaos gods to archive demonhood, probably only attainable in the realm of chaos (which would be the most challenging area of the game).\n\nGame would be about exploration of northern wastes. The story(ies) would be kinda subtle (think Dark souls) but engaging. The world would be riddled with secrets and items to reward exploring.\n\nI dunno! Just kinda something I thought up :)\n\n\n\n
1364361401|1b3fd3|An RPG with fighter gameplay.|I've played many turn-based RPGs but little actually have kept me in. The reason for this is because of the gameplay. I love most of the stories and that's mostly the highpoint of them. I also love the detailed worlds they have to offer. One of these games is [Grandia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandia_(series) a lovable set of characters and a charming story, although i've never beaten it. On the other side of the gaming franchise, fighting games. Only known for their gameplay.      The story (if it even has one.) is a side factor that is rarely credited. \nMy idea for a game is a mixture of these two genres. With the exterior shell of an RPG but during battles it transitions into a very technical fighter. The closest thing i've found to this is Zelda II: Adventure of Link.\nI would also like to know what coding language this would best fit and how to execute it.\n\n**tldr:** RPG but instead of turn based action, fighter type gameplay.
1363991558|1atsp8|A game where the main character has prosopagnosia.|This idea suddenly occured to me out of nowhere. \n\nImagine a game where the main character has [face blindness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia), meaning that it's harder or maybe impossible for them to identify different faces. In the context of a first person shooter, imagine being trapped in a room with a bad guy and good guy, but their faces are just, for the sake of representing it, blurry messes. Who do you shoot? What do you do? What if you're chasing someone through a crowd?\n\nCould lead to some interesting twists.

1364141685|1ax22a|The game of Life.|So me and a friend of mine had this idea about a game. The idea: A mix of Skyrim, Minecraft, Sims, SimCity (without the bad servers), Farcry. You start in the Prehistory (Just before the stone age) you have nothing but a Stone stick (75cm,30inch.). You see some animals here and there walking around, you can kill them for food and skins &gt; which you can make new stuff of. First Quest is to find a shelter, you can either choose to find a cave or an abandonned village (Tents made of animalskins, no loot). Once you've found either one of them your quest is to make fire (for every quest you complete you gain XP). These type of quests continue until you're at the 21st century (where the SimCity part starts), It gets more complicated en deeper. This is the basic idea of it all, we're currently making a beta of it all. Ideas of this game are very welcome, Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: game of where you play in every century (from Stone age to 21st century).
1369260189|1ev34h|game where you re-play as the "villians"|I've had this idea for a while now, and I heard about this subreddit, so I thought I might tell it to see how others think of it.\n\nBasically it is a game where you play as both the heroes and the villians. The first time you play the game, you would play it as the heroes. The game would be short-ish (maybe 4 hours), and seem really bland/unorigional. Think about the plots of the "Fast and Furious" movies in video game form. A lot of show and flash, but not really any real substance. It would almost seem like a fairy tale (just set in a different setting).\n\nThroughout the playthrough, however, there are extremely subtle hints that things are not as they seem. A single NPC that talks with a different speaking-style than the other npcs in that area, grafitti on *one* wall in an obscure area, a security camera watching the player in a building that shouldn't have any power. Just small things that almost seem like the developers messed up or it was a feature that was removed in development, but that the developers overlooked in this one single area. Things so small that a player on a speed-run would overlook.\n\nThroughout the game there is an antagonist. The antagonist seems like a children's cartoon style vilian; evil without any seemingly apparent purpose. Trying to do things that don't have any apparent pay-off. Just being a total jerk face for no reason. This guy would only add to the corny-ness of the game.\n\nAt the end of the game, you have the "final showdown," with overly dramatic music and a "meh" final boss. Overall the game wouldn't seem that great. It wouldn't have been bad, but it wouldn't have been that great either. In the celebration that follows the boss battle, some random npc says a single sentence suggesting that the player start a new game. It would be totally breaking the fourth wall, and seem really out of place. Maybe the audio quality drops dramatically for that one sentence. Talking to the same npc would not make them say the same thing again. The only way to re-hear what was said would be to re-load a save.\n\nWhen the player goes to the main menu next time, the layout would be changed. The background behind the options would be different, the logo would be different, it would seem like a completely different game. The layout of the page would be arranged so as to draw the attention of the player to the "new game" option. Starting a new game at this point would be the real game. Everything before had just been a really long introduction. You would play as the "villian" of the first play-through, and the "hero" you had just played would be a wildly-incompetent pawn of a far-greater enemy. \n\nThose strange things that the antagonist had done in the first part of the game would all make sense now. The antagonist/you are desperately trying to stop things from getting out of control after the "hero" had done something incredibly mundane early in the game, causing a butter-fly effect of increasingly terrible things to happen. You are desperately trying to fix things that the hero keeps making worse.\n\nThe thing is though, you know you will fail. The first and second playthroughs would happen simultaneously in the story, and playing as the "villian" does not change anything that happened in the "hero" playthrough. You already know that the hero defeats the "villian" at the end of the game, but you also know that the ramifications of the hero "winning" are horrifying, and must still try to stop the hero from winning, all the while destined to fail.\n\nI know this was more of a template than a game idea itself, but I wanted to know what you all thought of it.

1376052348|1k0t8e|General story + Concept: Hardcore Openworld/Openended Oldschool RPG|Backstory: I was introduced to RPG's when I was 8 years old or so. 2 years later, FF7 came out and I got sucked in hard. For any mathers, I was 10 years old. Around the 8th grade or so, I had already gotten sick of where MOST RPG's were going, how they lacked immersion. The games were great, but I felt they lacked something else, something more than 'hard' difficulty. So I thought of some neat ideas. Ideas such as wearing 2 sets of armor for temperature specific areas to counter frostbite. How wearing certain armor in certain temperatures negatively affects your character. I was chock full of ideas. So I set out to create a story that would fully utilize this system. Never got anywhere with it, couldn't think of 'the right story' to fully utilize the system without it feeling 'forced'. So I shelved it in the back of my mind. I was always thinking about it, but nothing sounded right. Then one day in April (or May) of this year (2013, 10 years later) it hit me. I finally thought of 'the perfect story' to fully utilize my immersion gameplay ideas without it feeling forced. So I developed the story. It's all still in my head, but I know the entirety of the story. The major characters, the plot, the climax, everything except the ending. Simply because this will be an open ended game where the ending will be dependant upon the players actions and decisions. Now, along the way, I have thought of some more very unique gameplay immersion concepts as well to incorporate in to the game. Here is a tl;dr list:\n\n* Non-linear 3rd person RPG\n* Medieval setting, with SLIGHT fantasy elements\n* No set quest goals (think elder scrolls)\n* Temperature (and damage) can affect player (think Fallout 3 body part damage)\n* Difficulty will affect realism settings instead of enemy/player health/damage\n* "Magic" will actually be alchemy\n* PC Only, with consideration for nextgen console ports AFTER PC release\n* Will NOT have multiplayer without EXTREMELY GOOD REASON. IE: MP will not be 'forced'\n* Will not hold your hand with tutorials in the first hour of the game like every other game ever made (with some exceptions) in the past 15 years. (Side note, this is something that has EXTREMELY bothered me. I bought BF3, and the beginning of the game was HOW TO SHOOT. SCREW YOU DICE, I KNOW HOW TO FUCKING SHOOT I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR SHITTY 20 MINUTE TUTORIAL ON HOW TO SHOOT A DAMN GUN. Sorry, but this REALLY pisses me off. If I need to figure out controls, I read the fucking manual.)\n\n* Story Beginning: You start as the King of a province (out of 8), Province choice affects starting area climate. You can go around doing kingly things, sex with mistresses, hold an execution, whatever you want to do that a King would do. There is peace throughout all the lands, with the exception of various rebel barbarian attacks now and again that the kingdom's individual armies have no trouble dealing with. You eventually have a public appearance scheduled to help keep loyalty and morale (as well as popular opinion) high. A week before your scheduled appearance, your head security advisor informs you they have uncovered a plot to assassinate you, but do not know who is behind the plot. So to save your hide, you hire a double to do the appearance in your place. On the day of the appearance, the assassination attempt takes place, and during the chaos and confusion, your double gets mistaken as the actual king, and YOU get banished from the land (being the double and having fulfiled your kingly duty) by the double-now-king. The rest of the game will be you proving you are the king by visiting the other 7 provinces to obtain support to prove you are the king. How you do that will be entirely up to you. You can contact the barbarian rebels and storm castles to take them by force, and force the leaders to side with you, you can gain loyalty of the King/Queen by performing royal duties (remember, to them YOUR province has a king and YOU were banished by the double having fulfilled your duties as a double), whatever you want. Goal is to reclaim your throne by any means necessary.\n\nNow, there are quite a bit of plot twists, like who the double actually is, who is behind the assassination attempt, lots of things that will be uncovered as you play. I was even thinking about including a sort of 'Alan Wake-esque' story delivery system to help progress the story. Theres also other little things I'll include, like quest timers. Think about Skyrim for a minute: You can go around, collect as many quests in your quest log as you want, then go sit in your house for 2 years, come back and still complete them like no time has passed. In my game, time keeps going. So if you walk up to the farmer and tell him you'll help him catch his escaped chickens, wait 2 weeks and come back to do it then, he's gonna tell you to piss off, and you get no reward. You'll have the option of accepting or denying quests though, so you can talk to someone that may deliver a quest, but you won't have any time constraints until you actually accept the quest. If you want to hop on a horse and run through the forest for hours collecting flowers, you'll be able to do that. If you want to build an ice fort in the frozen tundra, you can do that. This game will be as open world as possible, with just enough focus to keep the player going back.\n\nIn closing, how do I begin the process? I know very little coding (though I do understand the logic of coding), I suck at art (I can do stick figures, thats about it), and when I write I have add and bounce all over the place. This post took roughly 30 minutes to write due to constantly going back and rearranging certain parts so my post actually flows correctly. I have some posts up in r/shortstories and r/poems of some prior works I have done (nothing fancy, but I like them). Money is also very limited, so its not like I could go up to someone and say hey I'll pay you to draw some concept art based on my descriptions and your creative ideas.\n\nI should note, my overall goal for this game is to be a true hardcore oldschool rpg (great, compelling story that can make you laugh, cry, or move you), completely open world (almost sandbox-ish), and I fully expect 40-50 hours to complete the BASIC game, with enough extras and replayability to be played over and over again. The game will flow as such where you wont even realize 6 hours have passed. One of those, "holy crap this really sucked me in" type of games.
1376854121|1kmc4q|General Game Idea: Roleplaying Fighter|So, it is a fighting game that combines elements of roleplaying. Players begin the game picking a basic style class centered around distribution of stats for strength, speed, defense, and an energy/chi stat for fireball attacks. Player designs an avatar, then begins an "adventure" mode where you travel the country, fighting exhibition matches for experience and money, finding dojos to train and learn new moves. Things like how much sleep you get, food you've eaten, etc., effect your ability to fight well. Maybe as you get to a certain level, you unlock the ability to use supermoves or finishing moves. Mixes in some scrolling beat-em'up levels to diversify gameplay.
1372440287|1h9csn|Space Exploration RPG|So I was watching some videos of the Mako from Mass Effect and I was hit with an awesome game idea. It's a space exploration RPG in the same vein as Eve (I think), except events are procedurally generated around you and you can explore planets and such. \n\nFor example, imagine that you're flying through deep space and you see, in the distance, a large abandoned space station. This station object was placed near you procedurally by the game engine. You are able to land on the ship and fight off whatever malevolent life form has taken it over, after which a message appears that says something like \n\n    STATION CLEARED\n    [ ] Salvage for parts\n    [ ] Leave station\n\nIf you chose "salvage for parts", the station would disappear and you would get some sort of mechanical bonus - e.g., the ability to add another weapon onto your ship or whatever. \n\nIf you choose "leave station", then the station remains in place and explorable for a certain amount of time (depending on memory) and then disappears.\n\nPlanets would also be explorable and would have procedural events. The next generation of games will be able to support fully explorable planets. [We are already able to run a procedurally generated planet in real-time with additional atmospheric and environmental effects](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meB6oElrp5I), which is pretty damn amazing.\n\nThere could be procedurally-generated random settlements on the planet, varying between friendly and hostile, or maybe even small towns where one could trade (a la Skyrim or Metro 2033).\n\nThe events on the planet could range from a wild alien animal attack to a skirmish with raiders or whatever. It's not hard to imagine the possibilities.\n\nIf possible, I think that there should be the ability to switch between first and third-person during spaceflight and walking/exploration. This gameplay mechanic was explored in the ArmA series, as well as in earlier Hitman games. It provides a tactical advantage at times, and allows players to play in whatever style they prefer. I know that I would probably fly ships from a third-person perspective, but explore planets and space stations from first-person.\n\nHere's some further "reading" on some of the shit I talked about:\n\n[Starforge: Procedurally Generated FPS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZccMtpenqxI)\n\n[Kind of crappy example of procedurally generated terrain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfDAWZ-7AI)\n\n[Outerra procedural planet engine, showing off potential scale of objects in game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnqcSsEurBs)\n\n[Just a cool Outerra+Oculus Rift video, shows procedural terrain and all dat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LPPdV2Md1c)

1372025407|1gxjb5|Video Game idea based off a subreddit.|I've been contributing to this subreddit for a few days now and I feel as if this would make a kick-ass video game.\n\n/r/PercyJacksonRP\n\nThis subreddit is a role playing subreddit for fans of the Percy Jackson book series. Basically, everyone on the subreddit is a half blood. A half blood is a person who is the son/daughter of a god and a human. The basis of the subreddit is that everyone joins, answers a bunch of questions, and based on your answers, you are told which god is your parent. From there you design who you are and what types of powers and weapons you will use, and every week there are certain events that happen, such as chariot races, capture the flag, and weekly quests that people are sent on. The game would utilize an idea that the subreddit does not, a leveling system. Dependent on who wins chariot races and wether or not you complete quests, you will level up.\n\nThis is just a basis for a game that would be amazing. \n\nIf a game developer would like to create a game like this, just PM me at /u/bonzaijoe and I will contact the mods and admins of percyjacksonrp because I think this would be an awesome idea to throw around but I'd really have to get their approval before any development is started.\n\nThanks for the consideration!
1359247067|17cdfj|Hermitage Game|With the positive response to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I started imagining some other games which could create a calming environment. The following is what I came up with...\n\nYou start on a deserted island which you can explore in detail and marvel at the day-night cycle and weather system. On this island you'll find a cabin which contains roughly 120 public domain books and classics.\n\nThe inventory system allows you to take the books wherever and read them. As you read some of them, such as Archimedes, building boats becomes possible and you can explore other people's islands and what they have done.\n\nIn the end though there's no escape, all four corners of the skybox are transparent and the waters end there. However consider this type of game, you can fish, hunt, read and converse with others or simply experience the environments, with the focus being books, conversation and wisdom.\n\nI call it Hermitage.
1359961149|17utjv|Zombie Conversation|So I had this idea this morning for a game (using the loosest possible definition for game), so I thought I would share it here.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple. Basically, the entire game is a conversation simulator, set during the late stages of zombie apocalypse, when there are not many people left. Encountering other people is rare and the world is mostly a wasteland.\n\nSo, the set up is that you are sitting in a train carriage. The only weapon you have is a pistol with a few bullets left. Suddenly this guy comes in and sits down in the seat opposite you. He's the first guy you've seen in ages.\n\nThe guy, however, has been bitten, but has not yet turned. He asks you, when it is time, to put a bullet in his head. You agree.\n\nThen you start talking. You can pick what to say from a couple of options, and as the game progresses and you find out more information about each other more options are available. Topics range from what they did before the apocalypse, what they have done since, regrets or any number of things that you can think of. It's pretty extensive, and you may not unlock all the possible topics during one play-through.\n\nThe guy will also react to things other than what you say too. If you point your gun at him, he might say "Not yet, I've still got some time left. " or if you take too long to pick an option he might just start talking by himself, or comment on your silence.\n\nAt any point in the game you can draw your gun and shoot him. You don't have to shoot him once you draw your gun though, and you can put it back down.\n\nSometimes you might hear noises from outside the train carriage. He might comment on them or you can choose to.\n\nAs the game progresses the guy's zombie symptoms become more pronounced. His appearance gradually changes and his voice becomes more slurred. He will also more frequently forget what he was saying or make pained noises as the game goes on. After about an hour his head will slump, and when he raises it again to look at you, he will be a full zombie. You have plenty of time to shoot him though once this happens, or you can choose not to and let him eat you if you prefer. The game is not about lasting as long as possible before shooting him. You don't 'win' once you kill him, nor do you lose if you don't. The game just ends.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* The game will be from a first person perspective (with oculus rift support ideally), and you don't ever move from your seat.\n* There may also be a fifteen minute mode, which is essentially the same as the hour mode, but the disease progresses four times faster.\n* Graphics will be 3d and as realistic as possible.\n* There is no GUI. There will be variables such as how the guy feels about you, but you will have to judge this from facial expressions and how he reacts to questions. I.e., how we do it IRL.\n* It is fully voiced acted, both his side of the conversation and yours.\n\n**TL;DR:** A game about having a conversation with a guy who has been bitten by a zombie.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think.
1356827043|15ncs9|A Hide-and-Seek game in which you don't know if you are the hider or the seeker|A game in which each round would last a relatively short while. There are two characters, the human and the monster. Each character is played by two random strangers chosen from a server (like Omegle). Each player is put into one of the roles, but they don't know which they play. There are no differences so that even if they were to look on each other's screens, it would be impossible to tell. The game takes place in a maze, and there is a time counter on the side. The human has to survive as long as they can, and the monster has to catch the human in as short of a time as they can. As the players come closer to each other, they will hear each other's footsteps. This is the whole game. At this point, will the players run away, or rush forward? Being a monster and running away means you take away from your time, and being a human and rushing forward means you could get caught. But once the two meet, it becomes clear as one player looks like a monster and the other a human. After this point, the monster player speeds up, and the human player gets a gun. The gun only has two bullets, and only slows down the monster. Ammo crates appear around the map, which don't reappear after being taken. This means the monster eventually wins, but the point of the game is to see if your choice to run away or rush forward is correct
1363582745|1aib7o|A Game About The Butterfly Effect|Ideally this would be made with a visually stunning engine. Mechanics would be simple, you mostly just walk/run places and make decisions on everything. But everything you do matters.\n\nIt would begin with you waking up as a high schooler and needing to walk to school in the winter. HUD prompts (or possibly audio directions from the character) would tell the player where to go and if they decided not to then they could within reason. It wouldn't be a totally open world game, it would be a very detailed small game.\n\nSo let's say that instead of walking to school the player decides to run circles in the snow because the particle effect is really cool. Unfortunately, because of this they don't reach the a street with a crosswalk on time and don't press the pedestrian walk button, so a car crash occurs.\n\nThen you would wake up as a man in his forties working a desk job. maybe the player doesn't put a jacket on, so the character drops his keys because his hands are shaking, pushing back the time it takes to get him to the crosswalk, aiding in preventing the crash.\n\nIf it were as good as it could be you would simply go from 8:00 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning with a bunch of different characters, each impacting the scene in a small way. You job as a player is to clean up your mess hat you made with the previous character.\n\nAnother great thing about this would be DLC galore, adding new characters could be done easily, making it a huge game over the course of a couple years.\n\nTL;DR: You have to clean up your own mess with different characters.
1347231067|zmg5c|Battle Royale!|Simply put for those who have never read the book or who have never seen the movie. this story takes a random class and puts them on an island together and there can only be one survivor.\n\nEach Player gets a bag containing the following.\n\n* Map and Compass (compass and or map could be activated on the Hud when match starts)\n* food and water (a set number of healing supplies, like water heals 10% and food heals 50%)\n* Random weapon.\n\nrandom weapon can be anything ranging from a defensive item like a bulletproof vest (which protects you from ranged weapons but not Melee hits, unless its a headshot) to an assault rifle. (even a GPS tracker was an item in the story, which showed the location of other players).\n\nThe match has a time limit, who ever has the most kills by the end time, or whoever gets the last kill wins.\n\nThe longer the match goes on specific zones in the map become hazard zones, and you die if you get caught in a zone.\n\nLet me know also if anyone plans on making it a thing. or if anyone knows how to make it a thing. because i would play the fuck out of it.

1348452257|10de0s|Survival RPG game|It is kind of like Fallout 3, the world has been ravaged by an apocalypse, but after it went through this it lost most of the oxygen in the atmosphere, and to survive you have to carry oxygen cannisters. \n\nYou start out with a fairly small machine that takes the oxygen that is in the air, compresses it, and makes it concentrated enough to survive on. Throughout the game you can make improvements to this machine.\n\nWhen you explore the world you will happen upon other survivor. They can be hostile, friendly, or neutral. You can work together with them to survive, or kill them and take their oxygen and other parts to improve your machine, weapons, and armor.\n\nThat's all I've got right now.

1370400426|1fp3dc|A small idea to improve cooperation between high level and low level characters in online games|I've always found that there is a big gap in online games between the godlike high-level players and the noob first-timers. Isn't it true, that a player 30 minutes into a game is a lot different from a player 30 hours into a game? Let alone 300 hours or more? \n\nMy idea is a little thing that is versatile, and is not really necessary in any way, but would be a kind of fun way to have low and high level characters interact, boost the game economy, and give some power to new players. \n\nMy idea is that of an optional side quest very early in the game. One core requirement would be it be completed before, say, level five or some such early-game achievement. This quest can only be completed if a player above level 30 joins (it requires an item only level 30+ players can use, for instance) and is a sort of co-op piece. The players do their thing, it requires communication, and the point is to have the new player learn from the veteran. \n\nAt the end of the mission (which can be restarted if one of the players quits unexpectedly, to prevent trolls from making sure people can never complete it) the noob has the option of giving a token to the high level player, or destroying that token. This would be equivalent to the party hats in Runescape, though probably not as valuable. They can be worth some money or some unique bonus, which is what entices the high level players to help low level players in the first place- this reward. If they help the low level player without being a prick, there is a good chance they can get this cool thing.\n\nTherefore the high level player gets a cool reward, the low and high level players interact, the low level player gets experience and gets a taste of high-level action.\n\nWhat do you think?
1351683558|12e6rj|Top down Zombie Apocalypse Multiplayer game idea!|Okay so the game would be based on squares, each square has a different terrain, Wild, Infected or civilisation. There are 2 teams, Zombies and of course, humans. If you're on the human team you pick a career/role, Scientist, Scout, Soldier. I'll get to their specifics later, If you're on the zombies team there is scout, soldier or scientist. They both start on a randomly generated map apart from eachother. The scientist can claim land and cure infected areas, Soldiers can kill scout zombies and kill zombie civilisation and scout can scout the map without getting infected but can be attacked easily. The scientist zombie can infect areas and claim land, he can be easily killed, the soldier and scout are the same as the humans. The goal of the game is to wipe out the other team, by doing that you need more power to attack them, to get more power you have to claim land, but you can't claim land if its occupied or infected. Have fun!

1365880417|1ca76c|Find new creatures and use their abilities to solve puzzles|The point of the game would be to freely explore a 2d platforming world to find new creatures.  Puzzles would be everywhere and enable you to travel to new locations.\n\nYou could bring a creature somewhere to use its ability.  Maybe a mole-like creature could dig a hole for you or one with a shell could shield you from an environmental hazard or you could simply hitch a ride on a flying creature.\n\nThe puzzles would use more and more creatures as you went along and the creatures could potentially be further and further away from the puzzles they are used to solve.\n\nDoes this sound like a fun game?
1367778790|1dqr6g|an Adventure/RPG you build yourself|The "plot" mechanic and "plot" interactions + terrain generation like the Civilisation World Map.  You can of course choose the plots in size and location by yourself.  \nThe building aspect like "Timber &amp; Stone" or similar with the graphics of Oblivion or Skyrim, being still in the isometric view.  \nExploration aspect like Minecraft with said graphics (no blocks). You are able to either create an adventurer or play one of your characters you played with in the isometric view.
1371914240|1guwm1|"Blind" game|Alright so here are some notes I quickly wrote down in order to outline the game play\n\n* You play as a blind person in a dark "room" or environment\n* The only visible parts of the character are feet, heart and hands\n* You navigate around by using your hands as guidance, everything you feel, hear, smell or touch will appear to you in white\n* Different items will give you a better ability to identify the world around you, example: an iron pipe would allow you to hit objects to hear the sound from them, while your hands can feel the texture and temperature of an object.\n\n\nJust a quick thought that came to mind
1362142023|19gka3|Not sure what the meaning of this would be, but it has a ton of moral impact.|An rpg game where you need to level up by killing people. No one want's to fight you and by killing people you attract the cops (much like GTA). It's also a city builder and for each person you kill you get less income per hour. Basically a game where you can help others and never exceed mediocrity. Or you can become a god in infamy.\n 
1360101765|17yihh|Vampires or Mechs?|So, I'm pretty far along with the game I'm making's engine, but I have yet to come up with ideas for the enemies.  It takes place in the future, but not that far ahead.  I think I've probably narrowed it down to either robots/mechs, or vampirish things.  Which would you prefer?
1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1348373398|10buwz|The Hunger Games: The Game.|Hi, just thought I'd post this =3\n\nThe game **DOES NOT** revolve around katniss or any other canon characters. It simply exists within the universe of the hunger games.\n\n\nThe game would be a 3rd person survival game with light RPG elements. When you make your character, you pick some basic stuff. Note that these skills are not balanced as of yet.\n\n**District**\nThe district you choose to be from earns you a small bonus trait that you use throughout your game.\n\n\n**District one**\nThe player gets the "career" bonus trait, which gives a small bonus to health, regeneration, weapons skill and other skills. This bonus is small, as it encompasses a large variety of traits.\n\n\n**District two**\nAlso have the "career" trait.\n\n\n**District three**\nGets access to technical advantages. For instance, they can take the mines from outside the cornucopia and re-set them. If other technological pieces would be present within a specific hunger games match, then that player would have better skill with it than others.\n\n\n**district four**\nHas a bonus to swim speed and how long they can hold their breath. Also has better skills when making nets or similar traps. Extra damage with weapons such as spears and tridents.\n\n\n**district five**\nI have yet to come up with a viable trait for this district. District five is based around energy, so if you have an idea let me know.\n\n\n**district six**\nPlayers from district six learn skills faster than others.\n\n\n**district seven**\nHave a bonus with axes, can identify trees as poisonous/safe. Have a small bonus to tree climbing.\n\n\n*district eight**\nDistrict eight players can craft items with better proficiency than other districts. \n\n\n**district nine**\nPlayers who choose district nine will be able to identify edible plants.\n\n\n**district ten**\nPlayers from this district can preserve food to last for longer periods.\n\n\n**district eleven**\nPlayers who choose district eleven will be able to create healing items from plants and can climb trees.\n\n\n**district twelve**\nPlayers from district twelve have better skills with fire and have a bonus to strength.\n\n\n\nNext, players will select age and gender. The only effect age has is that the closer to people are in terms of age, the better they will work together. Gender has no effect.\n\nPlayers can then customize their face, hair, etc. This also has no effect.\n\n\nOnce this has been done, the players cut to the training room. They have 6 points to spend. The player will go to each training table. The instructor will tell them what this particular skill will do, and how it will help them. They can then choose to invest a point with the instructor, and then they will be more proficient with that skill. Skills include things like archery, foraging, etc.\n\n\nDuring this time, the player may interact with his or her fellow participants. Here, they can plan and attempt to work together during the actual hunger games event. Depending on how you interact with them, they with either like you or dislike you.\n\nAfter that's finished, the player must show off their skills. This is simply a small event in which the player attempts to get as many points as possible. This dictates the player's score, ranging from 1-12, with 1 being the worst and 12 being the best. The higher the score, the more likely sponsors are to help you in a time of need.\n\n\nThere will be no interview as that feels like it would just be asking too much from the player before they actually get to play the game.\n\n\nWhen the player spawns, the world is generated with random elements. It can be a desert, plains, forest, tundra or anything else. Like in the books, the players stay on their plates for 60 seconds before they can run.\n\nThey then take what they can and flee, joining up with allies if they can.\n\n\nThere will then be 3 days of standard combat. This means the gamesmaster does not influence the world in any way. After that, the gamesmaster will try and drive people together, away from the borders of the map. The match ends when all but one player is dead.\n\n\nPlayers will be very fragile. A broken foot can't be fixed. You won't survive an arrow to the chest. Broken hands? You can't use those. All players are like this. Smaller wounds heal naturally over time, but larger wounds do not.\n\n\nIf a player is in desperate need of help, they may attempt to get a sponsor to help them. The parachute will arrive a few minutes after the plea, and will contain something to help them. However, other players may take note of the parachute and use it to locate you.\n\n_________________________________\n\nThe environment will be just as big an enemy as the careers. You will need to consume food and water regularly. In a desert, water will be incredibly scarce, and thus players will meet at points where there is water, making these spots heavily contested. Players will also have to make sure they do not become too hot or too cold, as this will have negative effects on their skills and will eventually kill them. 
1346692857|zadss|So I got this idea after playing Slender for the first time...|I don't think Slender is that scary. It's only scary because of the jump scares. So I thought hard on what would have jump scares everywhere. Then it hit me. Jack. Based on a jack in the box. When I was a little kid, that thing always used to scare the hell out of me. And I bet it did for many other people. So you're trying to get to the other side of a parking lot of a run down circus after you find your friends dead after sneaking in. It would play "Pop goes the weasel" in music box form really slowly and at the end of it a very disturbing looking jack in the box may or may not pop out of the ground, and you have to dodge it in time before it kills you and you have to start over again. Again, there's a chance he might not. I think it would be scary. What do you guys think?
1369948501|1fd1oc|A Fantasy world that I can't stop thinking about|As a small time indie devolper there is no way I could devolp such a game [writing all this burnt me out lol], but I think that this would make for such a cool game, I would hope that anyone would build it. All the names can/should be replaced.\n\n**Genre**: The games genre would be like a zelda, in the sense that it'd be 3rd person action/adventure with a linear plot[protagonist saves the world from evil] and has some rpg elements. However unlike the game should not be puzzle-centric [a few puzzles in there though], the focus of the game should be  about the combat against massive demons[think shadow of the colossus]. Perhaps sandbox, but that is not 100% necessary for the game to work.\n\n**Plot**: The story would follow the main character Lance. Lance is a loner, social awkward [maybe even mildy autistic], but highly intelligent. Throughout conversations with other characters in the game you should also hear Lance's thought process[which should also give hints during fighting, and general observations about the enviorment, give him some wit!]\n\nThe opening sequence of the game should showcase off Lance's attempts at socialization with his co-workers at his generic, monotonous, mundane office job. A few awkward conversations later will leave Lance wondering if he'll ever feel confortable in this world. Thats when he notices dark energy leaking the building. [Could make the screen kind of greyish, make doors glow with a that's-definitively-an-evil-aura aura] Only the Demon Hunters can notice the dark energy, and using Lance's demon hunter talisman*, Excailbur, any door that he opens turns into a portal into the demon world.\n\nLance's thoughts should shift once he's in the demon world, he should feel significantly more confortable in the demon world then he does in the human world. Almost right of the bat you should see a demon slightly bigger than you, [it better look interesting] and you have to fight. Lance will already been a seasoned demon hunter by this point so the basic level demon should be nothing to defeat. He should hurt when he makes contact, but seeing as this is basically the tutorial level he should have extra-exagerated moves. [Long windup moves, easy to predict.], the option to absorb the demon will be present in this battle, but during the battle Lance should be thinking that this demon isn't even worth asborbing and he can't be the source of all that dark energy that was leaking through to the human world.\n\nExcalibur also can sense the direction of nearby demons, and after using it to find two more of the same shitty weakling demons, you'll find one that is slightly bigger then the others and is taunting you. [No more exagerated, slow moves, quick consise, however it is still a demon and demons are stupid creatures and easily Lance should be defeating it. However when it gets to 1/3 health it begins to flee. You begin chasing after it when Lance reminds himself that you should never chase[sprint] after a demon as boom ambushed by the first real demon of the game. The little demons are his minions so that he can bait demon hunters.\n\nThis demon should tower over you, at least x3 as large as you [again creativity, do not make this demon human shaped at all]. Its attacks should be somewhat slow but unbelievably powerful, every attack that is even close to you should knock you off your feet. Direct attacks should do ~50-75% your health as well as knocking you back, [deals more damage when you smash into a wall etc]. By the time you get this guy down to 1/3 health theres no doubt in your mind that your gonna absorb him. Once absorbed lance will get depressed and be like "I guess I have to go back to work then ... *sigh*"\n\nNot going to be as in detail about these parts because near the character limit\n\nLance leaves his job early to go to DHHQ[demon hunter headquarters). The people there should be commenting on how there hass been a suspiciously large amount of demon activity recently and that they are starting to get worried. One guy claims that there are new types of demons that are stronger then ever and are integellent enough to speak. Lance just keeps to himself overhearing the conversations and thinking about the topics. \n\nLance goes to a vendor to trade in his soul for an ability making extremly awkward small talk why buying.\nVendor:"Hope you enjoy your purchase"\nLance:"You too, erh...I mean..uh.....sorry"\nVendor:"Wut?"\nLance:...*walks away*\n\nLance is mad at himself for being unable to convey his thoughts in a easy small talk conversation when he meets a young demon hunter, Jake, who actually likes Lance's quirks and awkwardness. Jake informs Lance that he's a part of the Bzb Squad that is going to take on a demon queen and a huge demon nest tommorow that Lance overheard someone talking about before. When they part ways Lance says something weid and Jake just laughs it off saying something along of the lines of your funny thats how I know we'll be good friends.\n\nLance is ecstatic to have a friend. However it is just not destined to happen as the next day during the mission there is a huge explosion in the demon world and while no one knows exactly what happened, it is confirmed that no one from the BZB squad managed to come back alive.\n\nLance is now on a quest to find out what happened to his first friend ever. Upon getting to the demon queen's laire he fins only 5 demon hunter bodies none of them being jake. Also the nest has been cleared out so what could have possibly done this to them?\n\n\n**Controls/Mechanics**: I see this game working better on a console because of how I envision the controls should be laid out. Seeing as the main focus of the game will be the fights the controls for them should sleek, easy to do but flexiable. [I'm going to be talking about the buttons on a standard xbox controller sorry if that confuses you]. I'd want this game to handle somewhat simular to the [ninja storm series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM5Uxgi2Zkw); very open 3d fights. Your health should not recover until your full energy and only very slowly then [instantly healed up upon leaving the demon world though, leaving the demon world resets and non-lethal blows.]\n\nThe RT buton would be energy modifier. By holding it down it enhances everything else lance does at the cost of more energy.\n\nThe A button would be a movement modifier. Pressing it once will make you dash in the direction your running at the cost of a little energy. Holding it down will make you sprint in the direction your running draining a very small amount of energy per second. With the energy modifier down your dashing will be nearly instantanous and your sprint speed will be a % faster.\n\nThe B button would be the melee button, Lance will start out with 5 basic combos, upgradeable with demon soul xp. B with no movement on the right stick, and B in all the cardinal directions, pressing b+the same direction after every attack lands [that could be annoying phantasy star online had it and I thought it was pretty cool there.] At the end of each combo is a smash, which will knock the target back and indicate the end of a combo. Regular attacks can be blocked, dodged, how every energy-powered attacks will break through any guards and stun the target until your next attack is schedueled to land [allows you to combo easier]\n\nThe Y button would be the jump button you can double jump [not high at all] but with energy you can triple-jump [pretty costly]. Energy based jumps go twice as high[or something]\n\nThe X Button would be deticated energy moves, which are unlockable in the demon hunter HQ. varying from shields to ranged blast attacks or healing type things. [again right stick handle what attack you fire off]\n\nAnd the LT button would be in control of excalibur. Holding it down only affects you during melee combos, where he'll sneak in extra slashes with it [at the cost of energy omg big shocker]. LT+UP activate the demon tracker, LT+DOWN to bring up communications with demon hunter HQ. LT+LEFT to absorb a soul [idk what else It should do lol]\n\n\n**-*Note 1:**\n\nThe demon hunters talisman would be a small multipurpose piece of technology [I was thinking like a cross or something]. By itself it is usesless, but with a little demon hunter magic it can do many thing Its primary usage is for the absorbtion and collection of demon souls. After getting a demon to 1/3 its max health, and using a combo or ability to stun the demon you can asorb the demon into the talisman. The talisman can only hold 5 demon souls at a time, however you can release the soul to get a 1 time ability out of it [also freeing the demon. What I mean by that is if you captured a high level fire demon you can release it later to do an AoE pulse of fire, but release the demon back into the world] The talisman can also turn into a sword of energy [think lightsaber], during combos, and it will have a few abilities you can unlock from brining demon souls to the demon hunter HQ. [That'll be the rpg element, which skills you equip, get xp depending on the quality of souls you bring in because 3 imp demons should not even give close to the same xp as grand demons]\n\nTheres no chance anyones gonna read any of this. TL;DR.
1360343392|1851qr|In Dubious Battle - Strike Management Game|I happened to be reading John Steinbeck's [*In Dubious Battle*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Dubious_Battle) and kept thinking that despite its setting/content it could be made into a very awesome game, either as a text/stats based sim (think Football Manager or Risk) or a fully fledged adventure game.\n\nYou are a Political Extremist in 1930s California, tasked with organising labour strikes and violence to economically cripple the elite of a small town. By starting off as a single worker talking to individuals to eventually taking over entire farms and fending off law enforcement with "bending the law" and deception, eventually violence.\n\n* The key mechanic of the game is morale. Every event affects morale positively or negatively. Your strike camp gets rats? Morale down! Someone donates six pigs for slaughter? Morale up.\n\n* Alongside morale you must also manage aggression. Too high a morale can result in workers becoming aggressive and wanting to act on their own accord. One death or fire could cause your game to descend into violence - something that could result in 'make it or break it' end game content, or simply a sullen return to work.\n\n* You will also have specialists, engineers who can repair/manage resources and sabotage law enforcement or landowners. Doctors who can keep your camp in good health. Soldiers who will train your men in how to stick together and beat down any scabs who come to take your jobs - and how to kill should things escalate.\n\n* The objective of the game is to take every worker group in the valley and see them all get great wages and conditions. Alternatively you can send them out to burn down the entire valley.\n\n* The game should also have a non-violent strategy. Whilst in my mind the UI is geared towards people/resource management a social dialogue tree could also allow for players to convince landowners to give workers better wages and conditions, and blackmail them with all their high society escapades to ensure they see it through.\n\n* Of course, you could just watch the world burn. Convince a thousand workers to truly believe in your cause and send them against the military in a fight that will see blue collar workers remember them for generations *or* watch them return to work, whilst your character lies bloody and beaten in a field for trying to get them to strike.\n\nI have no knowledge of programming, but if you do, maybe this interests you!\n\n\n\n
1358523716|16tjey|A Final Fantasy game idea.|I had a dream where I watched my friend play this Final Fantasy styled game. After I woke up, I still remembered it and thought it out a bit.\n\n----\n\n\n**Story**\n\n\nSetting takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. The main character is a guy/girl who has somehow survived. MC is about 30 years old, and fairly reserved/quiet. \n\n\nFor a while, tutorial and some story progression is done through MC's internal monologue. Most of the story elements should not be presented with words, but instead use the setting, so as to add to the quiet post-apoc environment. When MC meets other characters, there will be less internal monologue presented and the story will be shown through interaction with events and other characters. It is shown that the world was very technologically advanced. Much of it has decayed in the apocalyptic event. \n\n\nPlayer fights mutated creatures and malfunctioned robots (sounds generic, but think fancy FF design). To lead the player, MC starts with simple goals such as reaching a location to get supplies, etc. By the end of the tutorial, MC's main goal is revealed: getting to the place where his husband/wife lived.\n\n\nAlong the way, MC happens along a research facility. Here, he finds a 'stored memory'. 'Stored memories' are basically a person's mind stored in electronic form. Under instructions by the 'stored memory', MC helps him/her into a robotic body. This becomes the first party member.\n\n\nNote: The parts below haven't been thought out in as much detail.\n\n\nMC finds other party members along the way (characters like a weird AI robot and friendly sentient mutant and stuff like that; each has their own story and conflict). When MC gets to the place where his/her spouse lived, he/she finds a 'stored memory' of his/her beloved. However, as dialogue plays out, it's revealed there isn't a 'stored memory'. It's simply a recording as MC's significant other decided not to keep herself as a 'stored memory'.\n\n\nSome point soon, MC meets a clan of people that lived using magic instead of technology and were shielded from the apocalypse. MC meets them at some point. One of them becomes a party member. The clan reveals that the apocalypse was caused by some tortured result of technology and magic (this would be the final boss). MC's new goal is to destroy this thing, so as to protect something valuable he cares about or something.\n\n\nEach character should have side missions that reveal more of their story. They get triggered through locations, events, or items.\n\n \n\n----\n\n\n**Battle System**\n\n\nThe battle system is based around the classic rpg turn-based system where you take turns selecting moves. There's your usual attack/special move/use item/defend/run. Each character has a their own resource system (traditionally mana). Examples are: an ammo system where reload would take up time, resource-free special moves that debuff your character or buff your enemy afterwards for some time.\n\n\nCharacter stats will have the traditional strenghth/defense/magic/etc stuff. Leveling up gives you base stats as well as giving you points in a stat tree like FF10. Instead of simply stat nodes, there could also be nodes that gives extra bonuses to a character's attack/special move.\n\n\nCharacters (some or maybe all) equip 'machine parts' that substitute traditional armor can drastically change the battle system. Each 'machine part' comes with intrinsic properties that cannot be changed but also AI settings that the player can tweak. AI settings would be unlocked through the story. AI settings can be toggled between offense/defense/support/various elements and would give bonus stats or attributes to certain attacks. This allow for a lot of customization.\n\n---- \n\n\nI guess this could have simply been an rpg game idea but I thought of it with the graphics polish of a FF game. Although FF games are not exactly great at the moment I still feel like they do a good job designing beautiful fantasy environments.\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this idea or if it's been done somewhere before. Also this is my first post to reddit so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong in terms of reddiquette as well.
1352497994|12xnps|BUG WARFARE: An idea I had.|An RTS game where you play as a group of insects/arachnids, doing what bugs do best: survive.  You're after all the sugar, otherwise known as SP (sugar points) which is scattered across various parts of the neighborhood, like parks, houses, backyards, junkyards, public pools, restaurants, and movie theaters.  There's many bug classes, including but not limited to:\n \nAnts\n\n-common, run of the mill black ants that include a female, flying ant in each party\n\n-fire ants (anti-infantry) who breath fire\n\n-very serious, gruff-voiced army veteran ants (anti-vehicle) that carries a machine gun\n\n-Rage-fueled, bull-like ants with horns instead of antenna, that charge at the enemy\n\n-Slave-maker ants that raid the colonies of other species and steal worker larvae and pupae (they have whips)\n \nSpiders\n\n-normal, house spiders that can be upgraded into tarantulas\n\n-funnel web spiders that act as traps/turrets of some sort\n\n-sac spiders that stun enemies and makes web armor for their comrades\n\n-jumping spiders, with very high evasion, and the large version can carry other spiders from place to place\n\n-a black widow spider (shes black and red, wears sexy clothes and a seductive voice) that lures enemies to attack\n\n-brown recluse spiders(anti-infantry), that upgrade to poison on bite\n \nRoaches\n\n-run of the mill roaches (you see where im going with this)\n\n-giant, hissing cockroaches (with nazi overtones)\n\n-burrowing roaches that travel quickly underground\n\n-death head roaches, that emit noxious gases\n \nFlies\n\n-typical flies\n\n-horse flies, will have increased attack and larger sizes\n\n-crane flies that carry other flies on them, for swarm attacks\n\n-deer flies that cause bleeding damage along\n\n-gnats, they travel in groups to swarm the enemy\n \n\n The structures found and created are mostly various forms of the bugs' habitats, such as mounds of dirt/sand/mud, webs, nests, and piles of trash, rotten food, or feces. The game will have very large 3D environments, full of interactivity and objectives such as going under a desk to retrieve some gum, or up on a dinner table to snatch some food.  Other creatures bother you, like mice, squirrels, dogs, cats, and even humans.\n \n\nIt's not done, but what do you think so far?
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1343211115|x4ice|Game Proposal (x-post from r/gaming)|**Short Description**\n\nEver seen shows like Dual Survival or Man Vs. Wild? What if we turned that into a game, only with a few changes? What if someone created a game with massive worlds, all in different parts of the world, some with snow, some in the desert, some in subtropical climates etc. where you could do anything. See a flower? Do you want to eat it or keep it in your bag? Do you want to scorch it in a fire, provided you're near one while having the flower in your bag, if so then you can. You see a lake. Do you want to drink the water or do you want to put some in a conatiner? I think you get the point.\n\n**features**\n\n* *Massive areas, up to at least 8 square kilometers*.\n This is both Islands, Deserts, Tropical Climates, Subtropical climates, Polar climates etc.\n\n* *Singleplayer, LAN and multiplayer*.\n You'd be able to play all by yourself. Whether or not that's good or bad is up to you. After all, the more people you bring the more mouths there are to feed.\n You'd be able to play on a LAN connection. This means that the only persons who're able to join you are the ones on the same network connection as yourself. Great for LAN parties, obviously.\n\n* *The ability to modify servers, such as adding your own maps*.\n You would be able to buy your very own server, just like you're able too in games like Counter Strike, and add whatever you'd like to it. Maybe you add a new map, maybe you add new animals or sounds or whatever. That's totally up to you. Running the content provided by the game would obviously also be an option\n\n* *The ability to do most everything*\n And that I mean. I want one to be able to focus on stuff. Maybe do that using a keybinding, or maybe if you look at the same object for like 5 seconds it zooms in, therefore focusing your eyes to it. After all we need to be able to see stuff like beetles in a fallen tree, or maybe a scorpion on the ground. Something like that. The ability to interact with as many things as possible, whether they're good for you or not, and the ability to construct, and do as many things as possible is also crucial. I imagine hiring a survivalist expert and simply have him explain as many scenarios with as many features as he possibly can. One might even hire several, all depending on the income of the company.\n\n* A whole lot more that I haven't even thought of, since I focused more on the engine itself, as it's quite important.\n\n**Engine**\n\nAll right, so the engine. I've given this a lot of thought. I'm an amateur Level Designer, so I know how big of a deal the engine is. I also know more about Level Design than Game Design, so I'm able to elaborate a lot more when it comes to engines.\n\n* Source\nSo the Source engine... I consider myself a bit of a novice when it comes to the Source engine. I know most everything about it, the only thing I haven't really dug myself into is scripting. The main reason for that is because I simply don't create maps with gameplay that require scripting. At least I haven't yet :)\nAnyway, down to the engine itself. This game will require large environments with very rich foliage and nature in itself. This the Source engine cannot deliver. First of all there's the space issue. Source is limited to a grid which is far below the 8 kilometers we're looking for, it simply won't be able to pull this off without any form of instancing. Secondly there's the technique behind it. If you want to plant a tree, you need to do that individually. There's no tool to plant several trees using some sort of brush, and that is very much needed in this game. The areas are so large so creating an island, we're talking about simply creating the island, should be something you can do within an hour or so. Will Source be able to create an island at the scale we're looking for? No. Beside, adding the detail I want to see would take very very very long, even if you were able to actually pull this off.\n\n* Unreal\nYou don't have to be interested in Level Design, or any for of Game Design, to know the Unreal engine. It's used for most games, and is by far the engine that supports most games. It's easy to use and modify which makes it perfect for most games. Is it perfect for 'our' game? No, it's not. I haven't spend much time in the Unreal Development Kit, and the time I've had I haven't done anything but creating random shit and messing about with textures. Regardless of how capable this engine is, I know there is a much better engine able to pull this off a whole lot better than Unreal can.\n\n* Creative Engine (Or is it creation?)\nThe reason for my insecure statement is because it basically goes by two names. The engines name is called Creative Engine, as far as I'm aware of, where the kit itself is called Creation Kit... Or else it's the other way around... Anyway, moving on!\nThis engine was used for Skyrim, and as we all know, that game is gorgeous! I've spend a couple of hours in this engine, and while I haven't messed about with landscaping, this is mainly due to the fact that moving around in Skyrim in-engine is a bitch, so I'd rather just create my own detailed caves and add it to my own copy, but it's also due to the fact that I haven't spend THAT much time using it. It's completely model based, beside the landscape itself, which makes it very easy to use, not to mention to understand. While the game is pretty, it's large and is the best option thus far, we're still not there yet. In my opinion, we have a far better engine coming up.\n\n* Frostbite\nAll right, 'imma cut this short. No way.\nSure, Frostbite is one hell of an engine, one of the best ones out there, but there's one thing keeping us from even considering this engine. License. To acquire this engine you need to purchase a, most like very expensive, license, and we can't have that! The thing most people don't realize is that allowing people to modify your game will increase the lifetime of the game A LOT, not to mention the level of enjoyment people will have. Let's face it, PC gamers would be less satisfied with Skyrim if they couldn't head to the community and put trees in Whiterun. Nor would... well most VALVe games be as popular as they are. Imagine a Team Fortress or Counter Strike game where they disallowed us to create our own content. As if that would be successful...\n\n* Cryengine\nThis engine is PERFECT for our game. First of all we have realtime lighting, we can play our map in-engine with the push of a button (In engines like Source you need to compile before you're able to do that. Compiling an eight square kilometer large map... Let me put it like this - it won't happen...) we can paint the landscape with foliage and that works perfectly, and we can create our large map with the push of a button... Literally!\nThis is the engine I've spend the second most time in, and I can tell you, for a game like this it is perfect. I think it would be able to handle anything we throw at it. Another crucial aspect would be graphically. This game HAS to be good looking. I don't know about you guys, but I can't really picture myself being in Half Life 1. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but graphically it's quite old. I at least find it to be a lot easier to immerse myself into a game if it's good looking.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n* Spawning\nI imagine that when you enter a new game, you get to choose an area of which you'd like to spawn in. The game then takes over and spawn you somewhere in that area randomly. One thing I hate when I play DayZ with my friends is the spawn system. I don't want to be able to spawn the same place every time, that sort of ruins the fun, but if my friend spawns on the south coast, and I spawn on the east coast we're kind of fucked. So at least being able to spawn within like 1 kilometer of one another.\n\n* AI\nI only imagine one type of AI being available - Animals. This is anything from bugs to wolfs, all depending on the climate. You'd be able to interact with every animal, that  means being able to eat every bug in the game. Whether or not it gives you diarrhea I do not know, but it would be an option if you don't know exactly what you're eating. This is a game that relies on you knowing stuff, that means a Wiki would be crucial.\n\n* Building\nObviously you'd be able to build. Now I ain't talking about no big ass mansion or anything, but something like a campfire and some shelter would be implemented. This gives the player the option to choose, which is nonlinear gameplay, and we all love that! Another thing you'd be able to build is weaponry. You would obviously not be able to craft a gun, but something like bows and arrows, spears, knifes made out of rocks and all that good stuff.\n\n* Disease\nWhen in the wilderness there's the ever growing chance of getting a disease, these often lead to death, so it's something I almost demand to be implemented. I mean, what's the fun of adding flowers if they could literally only either do nothing to you or do something good. The aspect of knowing you could die any minute is a good aspect. There's a reason why Amnesia is such a popular game!\n\n**'Outro'**\nThat's all I have in mind. After all, it is just a game proposal, and it doesn't have to be executed this way. I'm not gonna ask you to upvote this, and I didn't do it for the karma either. All I'd like you to do is at least not downvote it. I'd like this to go out to as many people as possibly, since I honestly did spend quite a long time thinking about it. Anyway, thanks for reading all of this, if you did, and I hoped I catched your interest. If not I'm terribly sorry for wasting your time :)

1367191875|1dauya|A random idea for an online game, buyable land and player created content|i just had a random idea. the game basically has an ingame grid-like system. it is divided into 100x100 blocks, technically 99x99 because one column and one row is reserved for roads. there are a few blocks that are developer controlled, eg they make buildings, npcs, quests, dungeons, minigames, items etc. the developer controlled blocks will be nicknamed "cities" or something like that. cities may be made out of as little as 3-4 blocks, or as many as 100 blocks.\n\nplayers can "buy" blocks of land. they are bought with either real life money or ingame currency. my idea is it works like an auction, whoever bids the most for a block of land recieves it. if it is a certain distance away from a city(maybe 5 blocks for a minor city and 10-20 blocks for a major city) it must be open to the public. otherwise you can choose to let people who arent your friends in or not.\n\nif you own a block of land, you can create content like buildings, npcs, quests, dungeons, minigames, items etc. generally, you want to own a block of land closer to a city if you want people to visit, otherwise, it doesnt really matter. you can always "quicktele" to any city, or a block of land you or your friend owns, or a public block of land you know the address of. alternatively, you can take the road, which can be walking, biking, driving, taking trains or whatever the transport system is on the roads.\n\nif the owner of a block is inactive for more than ~30 days, you can forcibly buy their block of land for double what they paid for it, the original owner gets the money. if multiple people want it, it goes to auction with the stating price double the original owner paid for it. they do not get what the owner has created, only the empty land. if someone has forcibly bought something off you, you still keep what you have created, you just must relocate to a new area(and pay for the land there). this is to keep areas around cities which are more valuable current so inactive players cannot hog them. you also can sell your land if you dont want it.\n\nso basically this means that it functions more like the real world does in which there are some areas which are publicly owned and some areas which are privately owned etc. i was hoping this idea would make the game more interesting. thoughts?

So mechanically, it'll be similar to Mortal Kombat and the new DC game Injustice, but the character roster will be the unique thing, including characters spanning back to classic horror (Dracula, Nosferatu, Frankenstein's Monster, Wolfman) to JHorror (Ring, Grudge, etc) and more modern horror (Ghostface, Jason, Clayface, Slenderman, Alien) I think a game like this will be really popular, but the only problem is licensing all these characters, since they all belong to different companies, not just one or two (as crossovers usually go) 
1361784326|196nwr|metaphysics detective game.|You're a detective.. and have to solve a puzzle / crime.\n\nIt's a co-op game.. but only one of you can solve the puzzle.\n\nThe game presents a completely different set of evidence &amp; environmental clues to both people - only it sets out with the intent to make you think that player 2 is insane &amp; stupid (he'll claim that rooms exist that don't... and be running into walls &amp; following invisible people.\n\nThe idea is to show the concept of naive realism &amp; idealism. The solution will be to accept only the reality that you see, and humour/pacify the other person so you can get ahead and solve the crime, doing so will prevent them from solving the crime in their reality.
1371000989|1g5zk4|A New Generation for the Action RPG|I've been giving this a lot of thought lately. A couple inspirations came to me:\n\n1. The Action RPG genre seems stuck in a rut. All the ones I see have a single player campaign, some sort of online economy, and PvP dueling. I feel like this outside of a small niche, created limited appeal\n\n2. Gaming in general is going through some major shifts in pricing. Online distribution and DLCs are changing games many times over.\n\n3. The show Dr. Who showed me that a story can be compelling, but designed at the root to be episodic, modular, and potentially last forever.\n\nThe story is a fantasy/sci-fi premise on an order of time police, who take various famous orders of warriors from throughout history, train them to become a policing force for time, and place them in areas to stop whoever is trying to manipulate history. The classes can be Human, alien, and range in classes such as spartan warriors, wild west sharpshooters, space marines, all given technology to accentuate their martial skills and make a difference. The game places people anywhere, anywhen.\n\nCharacter Features:\n\n-Characters are much more customizable than other arpgs. Your character should look the way you want. So many options exist to make them your own.\n\n-Character progression is based on gear rather than levels, and challenges to unlock skills that you can switch around in a similar manner to Diablo 3\n\n-Gear is dyable with an unlock system like Guild Wars 2, and many many models will be made. The option to remodel gear will be available as well.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-The game will have a single player story to introduce the world, characters, and mechanics of the game.\n\n-Every few months, a new adventure will be added for you to play though single player, or with your friends\n\n-Boss fights that take groups of players can be done, at various skill levels that promote team work for success. New bosses will be added to regularly. Think MMO raid bosses, but none of the trash and all of the fun. In an ARPG format, this could be really interesting.\n\n-A new class every year or so.\n\n-PvP arenas, and dueling for those who want the straight up slugfest.\n\n-PvP scenarios that allow for different game formats. Including a Dota clone scenario that it just seems natural to the ARPG genre.\n\nSocial Features:\n\n-Total clan support, including an in-house economy, tags, or anything else. Clans are a huge part of longevity.\n\n-Player driven economy. Trading zones that I would think to try and strike a balance for the convenience of the auction house and the human touch of the trading bartering system. I am thinking something more akin to craigslist than ebay.\n\n-All the ladders and chat channels a healthy playerbase needs.\n\nPricing Model:\n\nThe plan is to have it contain a small upfront cost, and then a reasonable price for each new boss, adventure, scenario, class that comes out after release. Maybe some discounted bundles and of course lots and lots of sales. Something like the Steam Workshop for making items could be another monetization option and help build a really cool base of item models to make customization even better.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe idea is to take the fun ARPG genre and make changes to give it some real longevity. Most of these ideas have been implemented in other games (Mostly Guild Wars 2, DOTA 2, Paradox Games, and the major successes and failures of Diablo 3). It would be a great long-lasting experience and bring the genre into a new generation. Any thoughts are appreciated.
1370747404|1fynuq|Survival game idea|\nIt'd be a survival game based off a similar premise of Cloverfield. (Yes, I'm currently watching Cloverfield, which is where I got this idea)\n\nYou start in a major city, all is fine and dandy, until (like traditional monster movie fashion) some event occurs which triggers all out chaos. You're then tasked to gather as many people as you care to gather, and survive while simultaneously trying to kill the monster. You can make moral choices, setup safe-houses and bases all around the city anywhere you want. If you die, the game ends and you are forced to start from scratch, except it might not be in the same city, and it might not be the same threat you are facing.\n\nThe game would need to have a large amount of buildings and levels within said buildings in order to help with the idea of setting up wherever you please.\n\n-Edit- Perhaps instead of restarting somewhere else in an different event, you'd take over someone else's journey during the event, and are shown a short video of how that person came to be involved in the whole event.
1361941111|19b600|A special kind of sidescrolling platformer/shooter...|You start the game in an 8-bit setting, with everything looking like Contra.  As you progress through the chapters of the game, it starts to look better and more hi-def.  Near the end of the game, it's basically a modern first person shoot-em-up platformer.  For example:  Chp 2= Earthworm Jim-esque graphics; somewhere between 3 and 6 or so= 3 dimensional platforming as opposed to side scrolling.

1357123271|15tjvo|An Idea for the creepiest survival horror game ever.|it starts off like the sims, but first person, for a little while, then on the second or third night, shit starts happening\n\nyou see lights in the sky, shadows outside that don't look right. you go to bed, you hear noises downstairs. You go down to check it out, nothing there. Turn around, you see a grey, skinny, leg disappear around the corner. Convince yourself nothing was there, get a glass of water. Go back up to your bed, hear a small chittering sound. hear a door open down the hall, visible from your bed, out walks an extremely tall, extremely skinny "grey" alien. It looks at you for the longest time, then walks away.\n\nand that's just the first night.\n
1349524290|111ecw|Zombie RPG top down defense/puzzle game|The core concept for this game is a post zombie apocalypse world and a group of survivors trying to create a safe zone to further their goals.\n\nOutdoors or indoors map where the border of each map is some sort of impassable object. Walls, cliffs, etc. Roaming zombies are everywhere on the map except where you start. The zombies control the world. Humans have lost. The player is just trying to make it a bit more bearable at the start.\n\nYou push out in straight lines that build safe zones. These lines are visualized as barbed wire with people/robots/turrets spreading out to defend it. This part is mostly identical to capture/trap style puzzle games like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattwach.trap2) or [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix). Besides capturing area, you will have to budget your survivors as a resource to protect and improve your safe area as a normal part of gameplay and as special map conditions.\n\nGoals for each map will not only be to push the zombies back, but to reach certain areas on the map and use your supply of survivors to fix bathrooms, gather food, get weapons, research defenses/healing items, and find survivors before their defenses get overrun. Some maps timed with timers called "hunger" or "tired". These could be a soft timer that doesn't make you lose, just slow down.\n\nCreate traps that need to be placed away from the safe area. Too close and they blow up part of the wall. A team of survivors would rush out into zombie territory, set up the trap, and run back before getting eaten.\n\nIf a zombie gets captured inside your safe area by a poorly placed defense it will enrage and either break down walls or kill people; creating more zombies inside the safe area.\n\nThought this up while dreaming. I'm so proud of myself because usually my ideas suck. This idea can be considered FreeBSD licensing.\n\n
1338275730|ua0eq|Necromancer: Dead Army Rising|Basically it would be a combination of tower defense and pvp. Leaderboards, Largest army of the day, etc. There would be different wizard classes that you could choose. Each one would have their own kingdom to protect. You lose your land if your king is killed. The different wizard classes would control different aspects of the dead. \n    \n    * Ethereal class would be able to command banshees and poltergeist. \n\n    * Elemental class would control the 4 spirits of nature.\n    \n    * Demon class would summon the defeated swarms of hellbeasts from previous wars. \n\n    * Dishonored class would force fallen soliders to rise from their graves and attack their former allies. \n\n\nJust some of the ideas I got off the top of my head.

1365450135|1bxrdc|sanity check: idea for a video game|
1370573391|1fu63m|Not really a game- but a new idea for a sport, involving swinging from a rope attached to the ceiling. It could presumably work in a video game too.|Okay, this is a dream I had. It can be played in a typical indoor court basketball/volleyball or something like that, just empty though. Maybe 21x30 metres(but i dont know if that size would work). or so. It is split in half, so each side is 21x15m. It also must be pretty tall, maybe 10 or so metres high? Im bad at distances/measurement so im not even sure this idea can work. \n\nThere are two teams, each with three people. They are distributed so they are all the same distance apart from their teammates and same distance from the center "line". Maybe the person in the middle is slightly further back from the center. They are attached via a rope to the ceiling, made out of a velvety smooth material but strong and thick. Three are dyed red and three are dyed blue, and they are just less in length than the height of the room, so no one is able to touch the ground while attached. \n\nThe (padded)walls also have either small platforms around the perimeter(on the 21m length sides) at varying heights, or a sort of railing which allows you to hook your feet around it so you can actually be next to the wall and rest, and unhook their feet to start swinging. You can also push(kick) off on the walls, and there are a few pillars around(padded of course) which allow you to kick to gain speed or change direction. The padding is made in a way that doesnt make your kicks significantly weaker, so you still can gain speed.\n\nYou can also grab on a higher spot on your rope to swing higher. You can also climb your rope to the top to be at the top of the playing field, but this rarely has advantages as you cannot gain speed(or attack) that way and you have to let go eventually dropping you down and leaving you a vulnerable stationary target.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate all three members of the opposite team. To eliminate a player, you have to swing with enough speed that you end up higher than an opponent(likely directly opposite you) and become able to grab their rope. You then climb their rope(and probably keep hold of your own so they cannot grab yours) to the ceiling and at the top is a mechanism to unattach them from the ceiling. It could either be a button or an actual hook or something, but it must be safe and able to stay attached until someone unattaches them. \n\nAn unattached player is not eliminated as long as they do not touch the ground, so if they are holding on to an opponents rope(or a teammates-but this is probably not advantageous) they can climb it and unattach that opponent and reduce the speed of their swings. It probably is difficult/impossible to unattach more than one player while unattached, so it is sorta a tit for tat scenario. Once a player touches the ground, they are eliminated and cannot intentionally touch other players/ropes. \n\nOnce an opponent is eliminated, they drop to the padded ground below(they likely would have a helmet or something to prevent injuries) Because you still are attached, you can swing back to your wall and kick off again to try and help your teammates eliminate their opponents, and it would be easier 3v2 as opposed to a 3v3. So the first elimination is critical. The rope must be long enough for you to be able to eliminate someone in the diagonal furthest from you. Once a whole team is eliminated, the remaining team gains points based on how many players remain attached, and everyone is reattached for another round. \n \n\n\n\n\n
1362100354|19flvh|An Interesting Take on Dungeon Crawlers|This idea was forming for a while for me, inspired by a few other games and some fantasy stories.\n\n[This](http://imaginarymonsters.com/2013/01/28/catacombs-15-the-demons-kiss/) is the main bit of inspiration, it bugged me how in stories such as this they'll get fairly violent and show dismemberment, but when games are made in the same genre it doesn't translate. \n\nI'm thinking of a combination of Diablo and the Souls series, a fairly difficult dungeon crawler but with the player's state changing depending on what happened to them. The limb physics would be similar to games like Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, or Never Dead; each limb could be directly affected by the environment. While death would take longer in some cases, it would make the game more difficult.\n\nSay you were a mage going through and an enemy bites off your left hand, your left hand spells would be gone but you could still fight with your right. Fall damage would follow the same idea, you can break your legs and limp or even just have to crawl. I know it sounds like it would get tedious, but I feel the magic aspect would be able to fill in the gap as you are able to either replace limbs or fix them.\n\nThe inventory would work around this as you equip different tools, weapons, or spells to each limb; even your head would have spells in the event you got both arms cut off. The armor would work in the same matter as your limbs, if broken the armor would just fall off to which you would just not have armor for that slot anymore unless equipped. \n\nI understand this would put a lot of strain on hit boxes and be fairly difficult, but I want to play a game where instead of saying how hard a fight was because this little bar almost went down, but because I don't have a left arm, my legs are burned, and my right eye is missing. \n\nEdit: As an addition I wanted to have the ability of scars, something a bit better than what's been featured before. Something purely cosmetic, can be easily fixed, but still has to first be earned in a related injury.
1357403489|160ft4|Open world zombie idea|I would love to see a game come out that is a mix between GTA4 and Prototype. \n\nNot sure how the story would go, but you'd be able to free roam like in GTA4 and have a massive zombie outbreak and be able to upgrade your character (ie: faster and or longer running, car upgrades, gun upgrades, the whole nine yards) like in Prototype.\n\nI absolutely love the open world aspect of GTA4, what better way to improve than to add zombies.\n\nThis might be stupid, seeing as there are so many zombie ideas out there, but I personally would love a game like this.
1358456670|16ruv4|Spy mmo Idea|the basic idea is it a PVP only mmo similar to planetside but rather than using machine guns, you use bugs and silenced pistols. I was thinking it would be set in the 1980s with two areas Moscow and DC, The basic gameplay would be class based with all the things you would expect bomb makers, field agents, counter intel, forgers and undercover operatives. I was thinking the gameplay would work similar to DnD if an undercover operative walks up to another players and tries to convince him they are the same faction it runs a check based on their skills. the gunplay would all be like planetside, where you have to aim and aren't just pressing the 1 key to shoot.
1354319478|142tva|Planetside + Medieval Total War + Chivalry |First off I apologize if this is long winded, but I have a lot on my mind. I have always been a fan of Medival themed games, obviously focusing on the fighting styles. I love swords and maces, longbows, catapults, etc. Fast forward to the present, Ive been playing Planetside 2 and Chivalry, alterating between the two and cant stop myself from thinking what itd be like with a crossover. If this is an idea thats already been covered, please just let me know and we'll pretend all this never happened. Few basic thoughts, and what I would take from each game...\n\n\n* Medieval Total War - theme, time period, factions, units, massive battles \n* Chivalry - first person combat (similar to Skyrim if youve never played Chivalry), class sytem\n* Planetside 2 - sandbox-ish continent with 2000+ people on at a given time, platoon system, overall "big" gameplay elements, teamwork, big battles (not using their dumb render system)\n* any RPG - leveling system, class system, unlockable weapons, armor, etc, maybe some class based skills.\n\n\nSo if youre still following me here, you end up with a game that has multiple factions (im thinking like 8, anything more would be chaotic), all active and organized on the same "continent". You would have leaders telling people where to go and who to attack. You could spawn as a Man-at-Arms, a Knight, a bowman, an engineer (catapults, ballista) or other similar types. You would also be able to level up your character to have better abilities, weapons, armor, etc. When you go to battle, it would be a massive BF3/PS2 style fight, but in this case, you charge in bravely screaming, swinging your sword at any and all comers. Archers and equipment in the back to provide support. Similar to how Total War handles their battles, except each unit would be controlled by a human, rather than giving orders to the whole group. You would use Chivalry style controls. For those who dont know, this is a first person sword/board system, similar to skyrim. It also includes some combo moves, parrying, dodging, blocking, etc. \n\nAs far as the map/world. It would be a mix of total war and planetside, with it leaning more towards planetside. Im thinking take the whole land grab and "control an important fort/base/area" would be good. But rather than just the 3 factions like in Planetside, you would have 6-8 trying to control the important parts of the world. You could also introduce some sort of time-based treaty system so you could team up and help our allied factions and to cut down on the free for all feel. \n\nNot sure where to go about having a "victory" sort of circumstance. Maybe if you control a certain amount of the world, you get some global credit like "The Faction of the Turks have conquered the world!" Each team would have to have a faction castle or something so they couldnt be completely wiped off the map, but are "defeated" when they only have that land. After a faction conquers the world, the other teams would be tasked to push out against the spread out faction. This is closer to Planetside's setup, which i like. But this part could definitely use some tweaking. \n\nAnother thing is vehicles. Obviously people arent going to walk everywhere, but this is also back in time. So in my eyes the easy solution is horses, chariots, elephants, and the like. Knights could be a playable class, maybe like an "uber" or "advanced" class that you can only spawn a certain amount of times. Also naval warfare could certainly be implemented, but I could see this being pretty worthless, as people would just not go in the water if they didnt want to. Maybe make it so that the boats can assault the factions main bases to reduce resource generation? Transport ships and what not could add a nice level of mobility for sneakier factions.\n\nAny thoughts? Is this something decent? Or did I waste like 15 minutes typing all this up?
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1355520739|14v2vh|Detective game set in 1950s London (A spin on LA Noire)|Thought I might as well throw this here in case someone needs an idea. I will probably never get to it, because I'm quite an unmotivated person.\n\nWhy London, because [this.](http://cdn1.retronaut.co/2010/09/london-1950s-in-hi-res-colour/) I'm pretty sure this idea was on Reddit earlier but I have a twist (A TWIST!) that will hopefully make this more interesting.\n\nNow then:\n\nTimes are restless in London. With a backdrop of large riots that have forced the authorities to actually close off a portion of South London, we find our detective working to solve a series of murders and disappearances. It seems as though all the victims have one thing in common: the army. Whether men returned from the war or family of active servicemen, all victims seem to have been connected to the forces - and even more curiously, connected to a prominent scientist on visit from Italy.\n\nStudying these cases, our detective is led to a government project kept under tight control. What project is this, and what role did the Italian play in it? Right as our detective gets close to some potential answers, he is given notice of a new disappearance - it's the Italian!\n\nOur detective sets off to inspect the residence of the mysteriously vanished scientist; a residence which happens to lie on the outskirts of the riot area, closed off and guarded by military. At the house, our detective is met with a ghost town. It seems nobody has decided to stay amidst the chaos of the riots. At the end of the street looms a barricade ten feet high. Our detective sees a figure climb over the barricade and fall down on the street. It gives a small groan and gets up, walking toward him. Still quite a distance away, the figure is shot and collapses as a military vehicle rolls into view. Our detective hides behind a corner sensing something is amiss. Why was the figure shot? More importantly, however, why did it seem like *it was already dead?*\n\nAs the military vehicle drives away, our detective goes inside the Italians house finding a right old mess and signs of a struggle. He does not have time to search for clues though, as he is met with a sudden case of shovel-to-the-back-of-the-head-itis. A medical condition most commonly found in victims of assault.\n\nOur detective wakes up an unspecified time later on a boat, staring into the eyes of the vanished Italian scientist. As he comes out of his post-shovel grogginess, he is treated to a classic criminal mastermind story where he finds out all about the mysterious government project.\n\nThe Italian never gave up on his fascist ideals after the fall of Mussolini in Italy during the war. He harbours a great resentment toward the powers of the Allied nations and, as such, when he was hired to work on deciphering some captured Nazi scientific material, he was all too happy to take it and use it to bring about the fall of Great Britain and the United States. The contents of the scientific material is seen on the shores of the river in the supposed riot district: zombies.\n\nSince our detective showed such a keen interest in the murders and disappearances orchestrated by the Italian for the purpose of unleashing a zombie plague on London, our detective was set up and is now to be left into the plague zone to die. Meanwhile, the Italian means to take a boat to mainland Europe and then continue his journey by plane to North America as to fulfill his plan of revenge.\n\nOur detective is left on the shore along with his pistol (because that's just fair) knowing that he must now face not only a horde of zombies, but also a race against time to stop the Italian before he brings about what might be the extinction of the entire human race.\n\n(Woah, this ended up a bit long...)\n\ntl;dr: Detective story meets zombies.

1346329981|z2oe6|MMORPG idea: Mad Max|**Note:** I understand Americans might not be familiar with the Mad Max series but Mad Max 2 was released as "the Road Warrior" \n\n**Concept** Admittedly I am not an MMORPG expert but I am told that some of the main frustrations with them is the lack of variety in combat and missions. So I thought the solution might be a highly stripped down RPG with no missions where everything else is sacrificed in favour of greater customisability of your weaponry and thus greater variety in combat. I was thinking about kids playing conkers - you make your conker as strong as possible, you fight it against other conkers and that is it.\n\n**Premise** The currency of the game is petrol, petrol is scarce. You drive a car, in fact for simplicity you are a car. Your car uses petrol to move around and in addition you can trade petrol for repairs and upgrades to your car - be it weapons, a faster engine, armour etc.. As customising your car is the major part of the game this needs to be a sophisticated process - considering elements such as the impact of extra weight on speed etc...\n\nYou then drive around the map fighting other players. You win and you can siphon their petrol out of the wreck of their car - lose and something bad happens. I think the fairest result is that your car respawns but with an empty petrol tank so you need to downgrade some equipment to refill your tank. That way you don't totally lose your last 6 months work, but its still pretty bad - especially if you had a full tank.\n\n**Map** To facilitate gameplay the map needs to be massive. To facilitate the map being massive it can be largely featureless desert with such features as there are (cacti, sand dunes, ravines etc...) being reasonably repetitive.\n\n**Economics** My original idea was that, like Mad Max, the game's economics simulate Peak Oil. That is, it is zero sum - in face negative sum. There is a finite amount of petrol in the game and as that petrol is used up (by driving around) that amount is getting smaller and smaller and petrol is becoming scarcer and scarcer.\n\nHowever this may make for quite a dull game as things literally grind to a halt. Of course petrol would enter the game as new players join the game with full tanks but this is not a good long term method of supply as it would result in newbies being heavily targeted and possibly even farmed. So there probably is a need to have some in-game sources of petrol. \n\nOne idea I had was for there to be oil wells that randomly spring up around the map (giving an incentive to explore), are then tapped for petrol, fought over (presumably), but then run dry reasonably quickly (otherwise we get into a situation where the game becomes purely about attacking and defending certain locations).\n\nIn any instance by subtly increasing or decreasing the petrol efficiency of the engines it should be possible for the admins to control the economy quite well. The idea that petrol is very very scarce should be maintained but, so that the game doesn't involve endless parking up trying to conserve petrol, it makes sense to have the engines be very energy efficient relative to petrol's purchasing power (so a gallon of petrol won't buy you anything much but can keep you going for a few day's driving)\n\nAnother potential problem is high level players finding killing weaker players too easy and so acquiring vast amounts of petrol. Two options here: one is to make petrol storage not infinite (so extra fuel tanks are a severe weight load and fire hazard - thus providing a disincentive to hoarding). The other is to see how well the community can police itself - with weaker players banding together for protection or forming posses to hunt down stronger players. \n\nIndeed it would be interesting to see the consequences of these two options intermingling - a player might decide to design a car which is effectively a massive petrol tanker and would then store petrol for other players in exchange for protection.\n\n**Gameplay** In the interests of making designing the best possible car and driving around blowing up other people's creations as good as it can possibly be I suggest everything else is as stripped down as possible - no complicated systems of villages, markets, workshops or anything like that. Just a menu system which allows you to make any modification and repair you like to your car at any time by pausing (save for in the heat of battle) and by trading petrol with the central bank. For simplicity's sake I suggest to begin with there not even be trading between players - that can be added in later (allowing people to run protection rackets, venture capital, loan shark businesses etc... all self policing - violently of course).\n\nLater on we could look at adding in things like villages with workshops or NPCs. One idea I had was for newbie areas where powerful NPCs patrol and attack players above a certain level. We could also look at things like players building and fortifying their own petrol storage areas or oil wells. Or flight. Or boats. Or submarines. But the main thing is to concentrate on making the vehicles as customisable as possible and the combat as interesting as possible - with everything else secondary\n\n**TL:DR I'm not a game developer but I had this idea. So anyone that is, you are welcome to it**
1368823473|1ejg01|Looking for suggestions, I have a solution looking for a problem. (so to speak)|Apologies in advance is this is the incorrect place.\n\nI'm working through a masters program for computer science, and my thesis is an economic engine designed to be incorporated into a game. It's always been my intention to take the finished engine and build a game around it but I'm stumbling for what sort of game would be best.\n\nFor Background:\nThe engine operates on a set of nodes (cities, space stations, planets, whatever) connected by static routes.\nEach node can have a market or can be empty.\nEach market has 1+ traders that consume and produce commodities.\nTraders in a market buy and sell commodities with prices fluctuating with supply.\nMovers move along routes carrying commodities between nodes.\nMovers also fight other movers and can take control of nodes.\n\nEssentially Nodes are cities, Routes are roads, and Movers are merchants and armies moving around the world.\n\nThe original intent behind the engine was to give some dynamism and life to a sandbox game, so that player actions could better effect the world, but beyond that I have a creative block.\n\nAny ideas or discussion would be most appreciated.\n\nEdit: bulleted lists apparently hate me

With cats! ~Gato|You play as a cat in the victorian era london.It is a first-person parkour-ey open world game. \n\nYou are a goon/thug for the mobster of animals, an unkinow animal with an unknown name who you will eventually rebel against and attempt to kill but you dont, leaving fans wanting to buy the sequal to find out who the boss of the mobs is.\n\nYou get given assignments - people you need to kill, when you find them if you find them without alerting them you can kill them straight away, if not they will run away and you will have to chase after them,when you find them but and get to killing them you can take a moral choice on wheter you kill them or not and this will affect how the game plays. For example if you don't kill them you might make a friend or the animal will hate you and attempt to kill you depending on how you found/chased them. When chasing them there will be certain oppertunities to hinder/harm them and will result in them not liking you. This can affect how they fight you when you catch up with them. If you don't catch up with them you will have to find them again which will involve using you CAT SENSES. Of course when chasing them if you don't hinder there progress they will be harder to catch.\n\nThis is just a few ideas I have for the game. Of course, I don't have any idea how I could possibly make this game if there was any interest in it. This is just an idea I had.

1363443013|1aeqh8|Dawn to Dusk: An Empire Builder|I've had this idea knocking about in my head for about five or so years, it is an RTS of a scope I personally haven't seen before.\n\nSo, the games starts at the dawn of the bronze age, around 3500 BC, you choose an area on the globe to start and this grants a culture (i.e. the type that developed there historically, so a mesoamerican culture if you start in modern day Mexico etc, and then you can choose another from a list to obtain a blend of said cultures, so you could be greco-barbarian or Jomon-Songhai.\n\nOnce these are chosen a village is formed. You then control this village age of empires style, developing farms and other buildings, recruiting soldiers of an appropriate level, at this point technology is available when the materials and buildings to create it are present. Once your village gets to a large enough size and you control, through conquering, trade etc, enough surrounding territory and villages, the map zooms out as you enter a new era.\n\nAt this point the map is more in the style of the total war games, though still only covering a small (though larger area), think about the size of Belgium in total, with various city states present, including your developed village, which you name, likewise, any religion you develop you can name and you can adopt the religions of neighbours. The goal here is the same, to take over the area and become the most powerful, through trade or war etc, you could also form a federation of cities for example. At this stage battles would be separate from the campaign like TW and take place on separate maps with the units you have, which are affected by what you can build and the cultures chosen.\n\nAt this point you reach the level of a local power and the map extends once more, to cover an area akin to Europe (think again of total war) - at this point you will probably be in about 1000-500 BC and it continues, the map expanding as your nation's size does through to the entire world when the technology allows it - so ships that can cross oceans and vaccinations etc to prevent disease. This would then go into the future, with an end date of perhaps 3000 AD, so about 6000 years covered, research all the way through determines what technology you have, along with your religion etc, final goal world domination.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, your nation picks up traits that also affect its gameplay from your style in previous steps, so don't use cavalry early on? Don't expect to have a nation of horse lovers, spend a lot of time perfecting siege weapons? Expect to get more advanced ones sooner.\n\nWhat do you think?

1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.
1351033997|11z2xv|How has nobody made this game yet?!|Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this...\nI've been searching the webs for a game like this and I simply can't understand why nobody has made it yet?! It's a perfect crossover. The market would be huge.\nWhat I'm picturing in my head is Football (American) but with Halo-like maps, physics, weapons, and vehicles. Obviously this would be difficult to pull off on a 100 yard field, since a typical football play usually lasts around 5 seconds, but if you scale that up to about 500-1000 yards, and make the distances between the players at the starting position greater so they have time to advance on each-other, this could get rather interesting. Football afterall was modeled on warfare when it was originally designed.\nI'm picturing a 3rd person shooter, though I suppose a 1st person shooter would work as well. The football element would of course need to be maintained strictly. Nothing "resembling" football would work. It would have to be real-time football with all the rules and scoring.\nOn offense the player would have to chose a formation, and the personnel, exactly like in regular football. A precise number of players must line up on "the line". The player needs to be able to select a pre-designed play with x's and o's, and would need to advance the ball, some distance in 3 downs or less, filed goals, pass interference, blitzes, etc etc.\nThe interesting thing would be the player types. I'm picturing linemen as tanks, jeeps/warthogs for linebackers/running backs, and quick vehicles like motorcycles/ghosts as wide receivers and defensive backs. Then there's all sorts of special abilities like invisibility, temporary invincibility, speed bursts, jetpacks, shields, etc, which can be spread out over the map just like in regular shooters.\nOn defense, in order to tackle the player, you would simply need to kill them. If you kill somebody without the ball, they would re-spawn after a few seconds, just like in football where if you block a player they can still get back in the play. The strategies that would emerge are fascinating since you don't have to be physically present next to the player to "tackle" them. For example sniping a wide receiver who is breaking away. Or mining the middle of the filed against a running play. Or getting a head shot on the player JUST as he's catching the ball to cause an incomplete pass.\nOn offense you could set up screen plays by overloading one side. You could bum rush the middle with a running play. You could sprint out your wide receiver on a ghost to get the invisibility. You could do flea-flickers. Misdirection plays, reversals, etc.\nI haven't even thought about what halo-like launchers and teleporters would do to this game.\nAnyway, I'm not sure why nobody has made this game yet. I know it's not too complex to pull off because all the elements exist other games. Do the big studios not think that people who play Madden don't also play COD or Halo? They know the crossover is huge.\nWhy not at least make it a game type in an existing shooter game?
1355632734|14xfe9|"The Legends of Torragrae" A true RPG|I've had this idea for almost a year. Using other current games as examples to show you guys how this game plays out. \n\n* Some Lore:\n The game takes place on the planet "Torragrae" which is part of a solar system with multiple planets. There is a grand total of 16 races, which all come from different planets in the solar system using "Celestial Magics". Races are: \nHuman, \nDwarf,\nElf,\nArchan (Larger, Winged Elf),\nValkrie (Bird Person),\nWolfen (Wolf Person),\nBjordur (Bear People),\nOrc, Troll,\nFallakar (Vampire-ish person),\nDeamos (Demon-like person),\nVillikyr (Bat Person),\nLyon (Tiger-Person),\nTudnyr (Turtle People),\nWoodKiin (Wood-skinned, leaf-haired people),\nDeereskavan (Deer People).\nThere are 9 different fighting styles (Warrior - sword + shield, Brute - 2H Sword, Gaurdian - spear + large shield, Archer - Bow [short-sword secondary], Scout - Throwing Knives [dagger secondary], Rogue - Duel Daggers, Mage - 4 elemental Magics, Relic - Healing/Poison/Light magic, and Necromancer - Possession/Summon/Dark spells) and 1 "Aoe" for each. A master of the style, gifted by the "Spirits".\n*  Main Story: You play as the "10th Aoe" selected to be reborn by the "Spirits" only when there is an extremely large threat to planet Torragrae and it's people. The last 10th Aoe was reborn over 5000 years ago, and he was selected to defend Torragrae from a Demi-God named "Tzhaekr" who seeked to enslave the planet. Unfortunately, there are two major problems, 1: You don't have the other Aoes by your side at first, and some of the Aoes are against each other, as they are on different sides of the largest war in Torragrae History. 2: You have absolutely no idea what the major threat is, but you are considering it's the war.\n* Gameplay: The fighting would be like Skyrim in a sense that you hit people with things and they wouldn't (unrealistically) just die right there. They would take a multitude of hits. It would be like dishonored in a sense that the last hit would do a small cinematic of killing the enemy. It would be like TF2 in a sense that your hits would display damage in text (If you had the option on) and there would be random critical hits that do extra damage and have a higher chance if you hit them in a critical part of the body. It would be like Far Cry 3 in a sense you unlock abilities and perks as you do quests, and the harder the quest, the more XP you get to level up and unlock another perk that you can get as a tattoo anywhere on you to show off. And like many RPGs, it takes place in a huge open world with many countries, all with slightly different laws and many different cultures. You choose your beginning, you play through and make your choices throughout the game, which all add up and decide your end. \n\nIf you got this far, I really appreciate you guys taking your time to read this. Please send feedback, or If you want to know more, I'll tell!
1366943388|1d4mtn|First person open world futuristic SciFi shooter|An elite alien race from a galaxy far away travels from star system to star system searching for life that they may find suitable for contributing in their competitive survival arenas for the sake of entertainment.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you choose what race you want to be. There would be a large variety ranging from humans to something like squid-faced people. You customize their appearence and the different races would have preset attributes or skills that they may specialize in. These skills are yet to be decided. \n\nOnce you've completed your character creation, your character will awake to a giant bright light looming in the sky. You are unable to remember how you ended up in such a unfamiliar place. Still disorientated, you look around for the first time and you raise your hands to your face and notice that you are in an unusual suit. You are startled when you see mountains of corpses behind you and beneath yourself. Out of the bright light you see more bodies spewing out flailing as they crush the ground. Another smaller and strange machine approaches in sky, but it seems to be patroling the area. Suddenly, its gaze becomes fixed on your player. It draws closer. By this time, your character jumps to their feet and stumbles down the hill. You hit the bottom and bolt blindly between the gaps of the bodies without looking back. \n\nWhile sprinting, you are taken to the ground by an unknown force. On your back you look up to see a black reptillian like creature staring you in the face with both of your arms pinned. "Fooooooooood." it hisses. Surprisingly you are able to understand it. As the monster raises his arm ready to strike, he is pounded in the skull with a peice of debri. The reptile is out cold and your savior, a human, helps you up. He wore a sideways tied cloth that covered his left eye. He was grimy and sported a suit similar to your own. He looked tough, and his brown hair was a mess. He takes you back to a makeshift shelter in the dump where he explains the situation to you.\n\nYour character soon has flashbacks of their home planet. Scenes of them running with other creatures of the same race from giant airships with blinding lights. Another scene flashes of you clamped down to an operating table as mechanical arms began to perform procedures on you. The human speaking to you tells you that species are usually disposed of when an operation has malfunctioned or you are deemed unusable in the arena game. Most die on impact from the drop and if any survive, they are cleaned up by drones. The human tells you that few manage to get away. He explains to you that his eye was a failed operation while trying to implant his heads up display. He also mentions that you seem healthy looking and are most likely an operation error. He tells you that language translation aids are implanted in your ears in order for more interesting fights within the arena. \n\nThe game will go on progressing with a main story, and you'll have many side quests. You'll scavenge loot, level up skills, and explore the mysterious world. Many districts are accepting of escaped contestants while others aren't. You can be caught and jailed up by the local enforcement or killed off if things really get out of hand. I apologize if It got boring to read. I feel like I began to ramble on, but you get the point. Tell me what you think. I know this subreddit isn't that big, and this was typed on my phone so excuse my mistakes.\n\nTL;DR: An elite alien race from a galaxy far away travels from star system to star system searching for life that they may find suitable for contributing in their competitive survival arenas for the sake of entertainment. Lol.
1367230300|1dbvpu|A fantasy RPG with Binding of Isaac-like gameplay|A quick brainstorm so let's make it quick :)\nSetting: Warhammer Fantasy\nTitle: "Dark Apotheosis"\n\nOpen world, no random generated content, plenty of choices and quest branches. No main quest. \n\nSkill and stat system like Morrowind, inventory and equipment as well, but perhaps more simplyfied. Maybe a class system, maybe not.\n\nGameplay like BoI (Dunno if it has a certain name or genre), graphics in the same alley but more gritty and "realistic".\n\nThe world could consist of the northern areas of the warhammer world. You'd start very southernly and the game would increase in difficulty the more north you went (much like in warhammer fantasy). There would be neutral villages and factions. Meaning that some villages/towns would be hostile unless you join their faction.\n\nYou start as male / female with ragged clothing but no "in-game" background. Maybe you're a runaway slave? Maybe you're a southerner drawn to chaos? And so on. \n\nEnd-game would be having enough favour from the chaos gods to archive demonhood, probably only attainable in the realm of chaos (which would be the most challenging area of the game).\n\nGame would be about exploration of northern wastes. The story(ies) would be kinda subtle (think Dark souls) but engaging. The world would be riddled with secrets and items to reward exploring.\n\nI dunno! Just kinda something I thought up :)\n\n\n\n
1364361401|1b3fd3|An RPG with fighter gameplay.|I've played many turn-based RPGs but little actually have kept me in. The reason for this is because of the gameplay. I love most of the stories and that's mostly the highpoint of them. I also love the detailed worlds they have to offer. One of these games is [Grandia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandia_(series) a lovable set of characters and a charming story, although i've never beaten it. On the other side of the gaming franchise, fighting games. Only known for their gameplay.      The story (if it even has one.) is a side factor that is rarely credited. \nMy idea for a game is a mixture of these two genres. With the exterior shell of an RPG but during battles it transitions into a very technical fighter. The closest thing i've found to this is Zelda II: Adventure of Link.\nI would also like to know what coding language this would best fit and how to execute it.\n\n**tldr:** RPG but instead of turn based action, fighter type gameplay.

1364141685|1ax22a|The game of Life.|So me and a friend of mine had this idea about a game. The idea: A mix of Skyrim, Minecraft, Sims, SimCity (without the bad servers), Farcry. You start in the Prehistory (Just before the stone age) you have nothing but a Stone stick (75cm,30inch.). You see some animals here and there walking around, you can kill them for food and skins &gt; which you can make new stuff of. First Quest is to find a shelter, you can either choose to find a cave or an abandonned village (Tents made of animalskins, no loot). Once you've found either one of them your quest is to make fire (for every quest you complete you gain XP). These type of quests continue until you're at the 21st century (where the SimCity part starts), It gets more complicated en deeper. This is the basic idea of it all, we're currently making a beta of it all. Ideas of this game are very welcome, Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: game of where you play in every century (from Stone age to 21st century).
1369260189|1ev34h|game where you re-play as the "villians"|I've had this idea for a while now, and I heard about this subreddit, so I thought I might tell it to see how others think of it.\n\nBasically it is a game where you play as both the heroes and the villians. The first time you play the game, you would play it as the heroes. The game would be short-ish (maybe 4 hours), and seem really bland/unorigional. Think about the plots of the "Fast and Furious" movies in video game form. A lot of show and flash, but not really any real substance. It would almost seem like a fairy tale (just set in a different setting).\n\nThroughout the playthrough, however, there are extremely subtle hints that things are not as they seem. A single NPC that talks with a different speaking-style than the other npcs in that area, grafitti on *one* wall in an obscure area, a security camera watching the player in a building that shouldn't have any power. Just small things that almost seem like the developers messed up or it was a feature that was removed in development, but that the developers overlooked in this one single area. Things so small that a player on a speed-run would overlook.\n\nThroughout the game there is an antagonist. The antagonist seems like a children's cartoon style vilian; evil without any seemingly apparent purpose. Trying to do things that don't have any apparent pay-off. Just being a total jerk face for no reason. This guy would only add to the corny-ness of the game.\n\nAt the end of the game, you have the "final showdown," with overly dramatic music and a "meh" final boss. Overall the game wouldn't seem that great. It wouldn't have been bad, but it wouldn't have been that great either. In the celebration that follows the boss battle, some random npc says a single sentence suggesting that the player start a new game. It would be totally breaking the fourth wall, and seem really out of place. Maybe the audio quality drops dramatically for that one sentence. Talking to the same npc would not make them say the same thing again. The only way to re-hear what was said would be to re-load a save.\n\nWhen the player goes to the main menu next time, the layout would be changed. The background behind the options would be different, the logo would be different, it would seem like a completely different game. The layout of the page would be arranged so as to draw the attention of the player to the "new game" option. Starting a new game at this point would be the real game. Everything before had just been a really long introduction. You would play as the "villian" of the first play-through, and the "hero" you had just played would be a wildly-incompetent pawn of a far-greater enemy. \n\nThose strange things that the antagonist had done in the first part of the game would all make sense now. The antagonist/you are desperately trying to stop things from getting out of control after the "hero" had done something incredibly mundane early in the game, causing a butter-fly effect of increasingly terrible things to happen. You are desperately trying to fix things that the hero keeps making worse.\n\nThe thing is though, you know you will fail. The first and second playthroughs would happen simultaneously in the story, and playing as the "villian" does not change anything that happened in the "hero" playthrough. You already know that the hero defeats the "villian" at the end of the game, but you also know that the ramifications of the hero "winning" are horrifying, and must still try to stop the hero from winning, all the while destined to fail.\n\nI know this was more of a template than a game idea itself, but I wanted to know what you all thought of it.

1371849566|1gtin4|Using quests in RPG games for machine learning|Games that are being used for machine learning are becoming bigger (https://www.zooniverse.org/ http://www.eyewire.org - http://www.fold.it - http://eterna.cmu.edu/web/).       \n\nBut they are still quite boring! Fun to do if you want to find a way to contribute to science, but not so much fun purely mechanic wise.     \n\nSo how could we make it more fun? Well, that's a big question that requires a lot of experimentation/thought for contemporary game designers. But here's on potential way this could be solved: \n\n**Using quests in RPG games for machine learning**     \n\nLet's take WoW as an example. One possible quest could be to collect two artifacts: two pictures of butterflies.     \nThe player has to find these artifacts and bring them to some person. Then it turns out that this person is blind, and the player has to answer a set of questions about the artifacts to this person.       \n\nThe results of the answer to these questions can then be used for machine learning. To prevent people from answering the questions incorrectly, the answers to the questions could partially be known (for example the answer for one of the two artifacts could be completely known, while the other is unknown). 
1371957855|1gw2ye|Hey Reddit, I want your feedback!|I am beginning development right now on a simple game for android devices as a way to advance my programming knowledge. At first I wanted to create a Tetris clone just to learn how to do it, and move on from there to other classic titles. I knew that a Tetris clone wouldn't even be worth putting on the android app store (is it even an app store? I don't actually have an android device. I will be borrowing one for troubleshooting and testing though) \n\nSo my idea was this, create a game that is based on Tetris, the Tetris game mechanics we all know. On the side though, have the player select a "character" or "class" perhaps, that will fight monsters. Whenever you clear a row in the Tetris part of the game, your character is healed and can fight longer. Whenever your character slays an enemy you obtain gold and your character obtains XP, and the next more difficult enemy moves out. If your character is slain, or your Tetris board fills up, you lose. After so many enemies you will encounter a boss fight, that will lead to the next "level" of the game, causing the blocks to fall faster and introducing new pieces. \n\nAs your character gains XP he can level up and acquire better base stats. With the gold you have acquired from the enemies, you can purchase better gear for your character from a store accessible in between levels. There will be a "progressive" mode, where your game is continued from the beginning of the last level you made it to, and a "hardcore" mode, where you play until you lose and the save is deleted. \n\nLet me know what you guys think, what would you like to see in a game like this? Would you purchase a game like this for $1 if you saw it on the app store? Let me know, and feel free to leave any kind of suggestion or ask questions. Thanks for your time!
1362499676|19pn1w|Civilization: Wanderer|So the multi-player game I imagine would be part civilization, part trader, and part space explorer/RPG like starflight/star control 2, part space combat, and maybe a bit of Farmville.  The setting of the game is a persistent galaxy in a virtual 'Matrix' style universe that has been setup by a highly advanced race to study human development and interactions.  There would be no apparent main storyline, but the game may include a few prefab side missions.\n\nThe game starts very much like a game of Civilization, but instead of managing a nation to greatness, all nations are AI controlled, growing and/or dying around the player.  The player's job is to explore the world, find resources, make contacts, establish trading and perform missions.  The missions are generated by cities and capitals to aid them in whatever their current objective is, and may include contributing resources or performing acts of espionage.  The player can choose to help or to be counterproductive, but the goal is to ensure at least one nation acquires space faring technology,\n\nOnce the player can space travel they can visit and trade with other player planets, or explore the galaxy, collect bounties, mine reources or seed new colonies.  The colonies would start primitively and grow in the same way the player's homeworld did.  It would not need to be maintained, but will eventually crumble if not visited.  Each spacefaring player planet would also have a crafting speciality to augment various spacecraft upgrades like engines, hull styles, weapons, shields, etc.  In addition, the player will be able to build and customize a space port others can visit besides the planet.\n\nEven though the galaxy is persistent and the locations of stars are known, the planets are not generated until a player visits a system.  Information about the system can be shared with a central database, but it's reliability degrades over time if the system is neglected.  (This is due to the special nature of the matrix galaxy, that accelerates time and reforms planets when abandoned.)  The galaxy will never become overcrowded because it can be augmented in all directions to accommodate the number of players.  Player home planets would only occupy 1 flat plane of the galaxy, added in a spiral fashion from the center.\n\nThe player can choose to make it on his own, or join one of several alliances that will establish themselves as guilds in many other RPGs. Among other advantages, alliances will allow for the construction of jump points to enable faster travel.  (Free for members, a toll for others.)\n\nI haven't ironed out all the particulars, but I strongly believe this platform lends itself to many other possibilities, and one without any endgame grinding.  If I think of other details, I'll post them in the comments.\n\nPlease let me know what you think!
1363467585|1afeny|.mage (Yes, that's the title.)|Set in a world where magic and advanced tech coexist, humans have found a way to link their lifeforce with their DNA augmentations, leading to the creation of the Biomages. They do not require meditation and training for their powers, but rely on improving their overall genetic 'equipment' through the use of magical stones, runes, wands, and other external things. You play as one of the first Biomages created from the body of a scientist named Antoine and experience the outrage from factions that oppose you, such as the 'all natural' magic users and the holier-than-thou augmented humans.\n\n-RPG with no leveling up, you get better equipment to improve and find many forms of equipment throughout the world\n\n-choose your lifeforce type from the beginning (fire/wind/water/earth), which will affect your augmentations' overall effects and which catalysts can work on you, like lifeforce --&gt; aug --&gt; catalyst that fits with aug\n\n-you can stack them or spread them out, there'll be tons of combinations with you weapons and armor/clothes\n\n-customizable sentries who you can set to attack with you, defend you, find things\n\n-magic and health are linked, use too many strong spells and you'll kill yourself, don't use much and you live off your remaining magic after losing all of your health\n\nThoughts, fellas?

1354030095|13vk5o|Lineage of Blood|One of my biggest disappointments about Skyrim was that you could go to each city, establish yourself locally, buy a house, become an important person...and then nothing. You couldn't rule, or influence the city, or anything.\n\nWith that in mind, on my way home from work yesterday, I envisioned a whole new game that I call "Lineage of Blood".\n\nWith the same feel/camera view as games like Skyrim, the entire experience would be about ruling. Starting off, you'd be a child of your father the king, who moves from private tutor to private tutor learning all of the essential parts of being a king. There'd be three main categories: Military (command, strategy, combat), Diplomacy (history of other nearby kingdoms, negotiating) and Ruling (Tournament-holding, festivals, taxing, administrating).\n\nThe whole game is about ascending to the throne and keeping your lineage there. You can get there through honorable means and by distinguishing yourself from your siblings, or you can conspire to assassinate and exile whoever is in your way, or simply wait for him to die. Once you're king, your story continues by siring offspring whom you take control of once they ascend to the throne.\n\nOnce you become king, you can directly influence how your kingdom is run and how much it prospers directly through your actions. You go to Court everyday and your decisions set precedents which reverberate throughout your kingdom. You can fund and support different institutions with different consequences like the Church, different guilds, knights, sorcerers, stuff like that. As you raise gold, you can build upgrades around your castle and kingdom, like better farms, walls, blacksmith, feast hall, hound pits (for hunting trips), whatever.\n\nEverything is in real time. If you decide to go hunting, you literally walk to a location and ride out with some of your people while the day goes on. The King needs to sleep every night, but when and for how long is up to you, with direct effects. You access different aspects of the game by literally walking around and talking to different people in your castle. If you decide to go to war, you ride out with your men and attack, but you leave yourself vulnerable at home to usurpers and treachery.\n\nThere will be the whole game of arranged marriages and alliances and "scandals" can break these. You fund your own bodyguards as little or as much as you want, but if you're reviled or seen as vulnerable, you'll deal with more real time assassination attempts as you walk about your kingdom.\n\nFormatting could be tricky. Not sure if it'd be single-player only or if it could be multiplayer. I see it as having game "neighborhoods" where you're the king of a kingdom that is close to 1, 2, 3, or more other kingdoms. They can be handled automatically by computers or other players would fill their thrones. They'd be assigned randomly, given a random kingdom with a random history in a random geographic location. Most points/most land conquered wins. Something like that.\nCan someone make this? Please? A game about ruling a kingdom where every action actually has a discernible effect that you must deal with as King. If your line dies out, your story ends. You continue indefinitely as long as your blood survives, even if it's in exile.\n\nAny thoughts? Similar games out there I should try or keep up with in the news? Am I the only one who finds this kind of game incredibly enticing?
1353016715|139gqe|Cowboy MMORPG|You would be able to customize your cowboy, with clothes, and body features, as well as your horse and cart (if you choose to buy a cart). It would be kind of be like APB., with the sense of decision, in whether you wanted to be an Outlaw, A Lawman, A Bounty Hunter, or A Scavenger. The Outlaw is willing to kill just about everyone and everything to get what he wants, even if just a couple dollars. The Lawman gets money if he catches an Outlaw alive, but he gets no money killing one, and has a chance to be suspended for and indefinite amount of time. The Bounty Hunter kills and captures Outlaws to save innocent peoples lives, and also to make a little money out of it. Finally, The Scavenger is a passive Cowboy, that explores the landscape, looking for ambushed carts and horses, taking whatever is left. If he kills someone(not being self defense), he loses a significant amount of stats, for an indefinite period of time. Like in Guild Wars 2, you can start Gangs, as well as Posses. You can Hire other players to be members. Members of Gangs and Posses, can be promoted. Gangs and Posses can also build settlements, with mechanics the likes of The Sims 3. In the Settlements, there can be a Jail(for posses), Restaurants, Gambling Dens, Inns, Bars, Homes, and other small businesses. You Hire Randomly Generated NPC's to be employees, you collect the rent from Businesses and Homes, and you pay a small portion of the profit to the employees. There's always the chance of your settlement being taken over by members of the opposite faction. Just thought it sounded cool.\n\ntl;dr: Cowboy MMORPG where you can have Gangs and Posses, and has similar mechanics to APB, and The Sims.
1353372111|13hbqh|Just had a thought, what do you think?|Posted this in /r/gamedev but they bounced me over here:\n\nI'm just putting this out there - I really doubt I'll be doing anything with it but I wondered what the game dev community would think about it.\nPlus, I have no idea if it's been done before.\nSo, The idea is to have a common back end for multiple platforms where gamer A might be playing a space multiplayer game and gamer B is playing a fantasy game. They can interact with each other through attack, trade or quest, but in each realm there's equivalent resources, hp, and quest-systems.\nThis way, one can develop a multiplayer game and immediately have players to interact with.\nUnfortunately, chatting could be problematic.\nAnyway, just a though. I'd like if people could comment if this is an interesting idea or not. Secretly, I'd like someone to be über-inspired and run with it, but whatever.

1349300013|10wc4t|Escapade: Waking Nightmare|In a nutshell: [Journey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game) and [Yume Nikki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yume_Nikki), with the Art Style of [Zdzislaw Beksinski](http://www.beksinski.pl/)\n\n\n\nIt would be the story of a man living alone. He is content in life, with a stable job and healthy routine, but throughout the days, his life blurs past faster every day. And yet, he pays it no mind. That is, until the day that he begins to have vivid and recurring nightmares.\n\n\nThey are not ordinary nightmares. No endless falling, or murderers chasing him through the streets, but strange, intricate imagery that eludes true definition. At first, he is only an observer to the strange events he witnesses, but as the dreams recur more often, his interest grows, and through applying lucid dreaming methods, he explores his own twisted mindscape every night.\n\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, it would be relatively simple: free range exploration of a gargantuan, surreal dream world. Both walking and flight would be available to the player, in order to better find every nook and cranny of the world, and the controls would be as smooth as they are in Journey.\n\nThere would have to be an element of randomness to keep the game fresh. The player should never see the same area twice. There would be no inherent action, and any NPCs would be more or less un-interactable. Even as they explore the dreamscape, the players are detached, merely observers. The goal would not be the completion of the story, if there even was one, but to sort of jaunt into this uncanny otherworld that this wonderful artist has created.\n\nThe player could [climb over a hill made of open coffins,](http://gnosis.art.pl/iluminatornia/sztuka_o_inspiracji/zdzislaw_beksinski/zdzislaw_beksinski_1971.htm) to reach a [precipice of broken buildings](http://gnosis.art.pl/iluminatornia/sztuka_o_inspiracji/zdzislaw_beksinski/zdzislaw_beksinski_1972_2.htm), whose floating forms lead to a [monstrously huge city-giant who happens to be on fire.](http://gnosis.art.pl/iluminatornia/sztuka_o_inspiracji/zdzislaw_beksinski/zdzislaw_beksinski_1980_2.htm) The player could explore the inside, which could lead to [all](http://gnosis.art.pl/iluminatornia/sztuka_o_inspiracji/zdzislaw_beksinski/zdzislaw_beksinski_1980_3.htm) manner of [hidden cities](http://gnosis.art.pl/iluminatornia/sztuka_o_inspiracji/zdzislaw_beksinski/zdzislaw_beksinski_1972_3.htm), or they could cling to the side of the giant, and watch as it strides over [endless spires of campfires, some extinguished, the lives of their sentries along with them.](http://gnosis.art.pl/iluminatornia/sztuka_o_inspiracji/zdzislaw_beksinski/zdzislaw_beksinski_006.htm)\n\nI consider Zdzislaw's work to be a sort of Beautiful Nightmare, which is something not normally seen, well, anywhere. But while this is well represented in his art, if such a thing could come alive in a game, where you could touch it, it might just be the finest non-action game out there. \n\n\nMany games feature exploration, but not many focus on it exclusively, and therefore it is underestimated. But I'm sure I'm not the only one who is saddened when we reach the edge of the map, and are stopped by some invisible wall. To break that wall would be to give the player absolute freedom.

1323902606|ncyus|Who wants their ideas implemented?|Hello. I'm making a game. The idea of the game was making an easily-adjustable engine, then trying out a bunch of systems, and find one with the best feedback.\n\nTo this end, I need ideas. A lot of people have plenty of ideas and but can't code: this is for them.\n\nSome notes about the ideas: \n1) This is a turn based game\n2) I'm not going to do anything grid-based (although things like Kongai's ranges are acceptable)\n3) Nothing about aesthetics, graphics, non-battle systems. I am asking specifically about battle systems that require strategic thinking\n4) The limb-based system I currently have is available here: http://mrizen.com/flashy/WWHM.swf\n\nSo go on! Complex realistic limb-based systems? Weird magic rules? Huge damage calculations? It's up to you. Good ideas will be implemented within the week (Implemented being proof-of-concept things, not actually fully fleshed out games). Also, if you submit an idea, expect to playtest it (and the ideas of others), and give /constructive/ critique.\n

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

1351468475|128udr|Reincarnation|An RPG where throughout the game you recieve good/bad karma based on your actions. It never tells you what the karma is for but most gamers will assume the obvious- good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. But this won't be the case. Many of the same problems will occur no matter how you play. The catch comes when you first die. That's when the game explains what the karma points were for. You don't respawn but instead you play as an intirely new character who's life depends on the karma received in this last play through. Everytime you die this happens until you can achieve a perfect playthrough were you only do good and you die old, rich, and well loved by almost all characters you come in contact with.
1332781978|refot|Game Idea: FPS (Hitman style) and/or top-down  game based on the movie "The Conversation" where the goal is to bug, video, and otherwise steal the information your clients demand. (Private Investigation Game)|For those who haven't seen [The Conversation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), it's a fantastic movie  based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\n\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same.  Sometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional mikes/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to.  All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them.  You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play.  And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n\nOK...now to check Steam's daily sale ;)\n\nedit: I'd personally love the same gritty, dirty, feeling of real life portrayed in that movie...

1352001301|12ljc2|My Game Idea|Okay reddit. My idea for a game is as follows. Basically the game starts out with the big bang, then proceeds to go through all of the ages, ex. stone age, medieval times, etc.. up until the present day and into the future. You would have to build a kingdom and rule the lands. As for the POV it would be similar to Skyrim. But also, it would have a multiplayer option where you could attack other people's kingdoms. The goal is to survive up until the year 5000 where the world will end and you will win. This will be quite a long game and it will take a very long time to complete. This is the idea. I was tired of games that only took 3 days to beat. This game is the solution. Please don't be to harsh.
1351844044|12i85p|John-117 History Game Idea|Right, so hear me out. I just thought of this, so it isn't fully fleshed out.\n\nSo what if we played as John as a kid/teen, working his way up to Master Chief? Like you have to do all the training missions, and there could be some level up system where every time you level up or as the game passes you grow older and stronger and stuff. So, you have more energy as a kid, but less strength. Then more stamina or something as a teen. Then as an early adult, you have the most strength. They could easily tie in a lot from the books. You could have the full training place to explore, and maybe some mini games to play in it. Maybe the 'currency' is trust.. You gain more trust from the testers as you play and do well, which you can trade for better weapons or something. But then, if you do horribly bad on something, you lose some of the trust they have in you.\n\nThis isn't fully fleshed out yet, but what do you guys think?
1338746479|uitpt|A Homeless simulator. A Lemonade Stand Style Game, maybe a programer can help me make this?|I always thought there should be a game in which you have to survive the busy city streets as a homeless man. The game would go on a day counter, and each day consists of one cycle. The cycle starts with a visit to the thrift store, where the player can purchase items needed for survival as well as items that will help generate money from panhandling. Cycle 2 is panhandling, much like lemonade stand, you decide what to do and how to make money, depending on your method and appearance you will make more or less money. The third part of the cycle the player visits a walmart type location and needs to buy food to survive, the player can also purchase different survival items here. Finally the player has the choice of where to sleep, all of which have different effects on gameplay (I.E. sleeping in the alley can get you robbed while sleeping at the church homeless shelter forbids you to lie while panhandling). The game can get more advanced from there. Drugs could become an element of gameplay (I like the idea of them being mini-games so players have an actual temptation to use them). I have a lot more ideas for this game, comment if you want me to go on, or help me out with some ideas of your own. A programmer interested in making this game would be a dream come true. 
1355972336|155a34|IDEA FOR AN INDIE GAME: "The Depths of Sanity"|In games, you're expected to get from point A to point B a lot without losing health or running out of time, correct? What about a game focused on keeping you character sane?\n\nThe game takes place as a 2D platformer. Your character (designed by the creator) is trying to find light. You are in a large warehouse-type industrial building. Going through the levels, you are trying to dodge enemies entirely. The character has no weapons, but has a flashlight. The flashlight allows you to see through the shadows. If attacked, you lose no health, but your character drains sanity. The monster will dissolve on impact with you. Your sanity has to be replenished by finding lightbulbs scattered through the levels. You can find supply crates too, that have batteries in them. The levels would also be entirely random, like the Binding of Issac.\n\nThe enemies would include:\n\n* Blobs: Simple enemies found earlier in the game. Have a creepy smiling face on a blob of goo. No special attack.\n\n* Walkers: Identical to blobs, except with legs, and arms. Walking spped would be about 1.5 times a blob. No special attack.\n\n* Shader: Humanoid figures found from 1/4 of the game throughout, and they have just 2 white eyes. The Humanoids mirror your actions if they catch sight of you. Their walking speed is slower than the players, thus making the player able to outrun the monster. \n\n* Lucids: Humanoid figures with arms protruding from parts of the body the special attack of this monster would be them grabbing you, and holding until you tap A and D rapidly. Walk speed would be moderate. \n\n\nITEMS:\n\n* Batteries: Self explanatory. Renews  your flashlight power. Flashlight power decreases pretty damn slow, so it won't have much of an effect.\n\n* Lenses (for the flashlight): Decreases battery negation. \n\n* Sneakers (Red, Blue, and Green): Each color sneaker is faster than the other. Increases run speed.\n\n* Gloves (Red, Blue, and Green): Each color glove decreases sanity loss faster than the other.\n\nPlease, tell me what you think :D! I want some feedback on this. If you do decide to take the idea, please credit me and keep me updated on it!
1355836350|151tbo|Other World MMO (Kelley Armstrong Fantasy World novels)|Witches **Female Only** – Coven Witch (Strong Healer, Limited DPS), Independent (Balanced healing/Damage) Dark (Strong DPS, limited healing)\nSorcerors **Male Only** – Cabal (DPS only), Independent (Balanced DPS/Healing)\nWerewolfs **Male Only** – Pack Wolf (Tank/DPS), Runt (DPS)\nVampires – (DPS/Tank)\nShaman – (Healers/Support)\nNecromancer – (Support/DPS)\nVoodoo Priest – (DOTS)\n\n\nThere is one ruling body called the Interracial Council (which represents all supernatural beings) and when you start your character you have to pick one of the supernatural’s available so Werewolf, Vampire, Witch, Sorcerer, Vodoun Priest, Shaman and Half Demon. Same levelling system as other MMO’s (lvl1 then till current cap) but the interracial council provide quests in the form of Cases (PVE) or Bounties (PVP). The cases will be where a (insert random supernatural) has gone rogue and threatens to expose the entire supernatural community and the quests start with clue hunting, then assigning a suspect and eventual capture/execution. The Bounties will basically be the same thing except the game system will have a series of crimes happen and then assign a random supernatural race as the murderer and then from the list of Players of that race denote that they are responsible and every other supernatural will be notified that the designated player must die. Once that player has been found and killed (which will have a twist to it) that player can’t be nominated for at least 3 months. It’s a one time quest so first one to find and kill the player gets the reward. There will be a level cap in place to stop High level players constently squishing low level bounties. There will be designated PVP zones where much like Gurbashi anyone can attack anyone.\n\nThere would be lots of restrictions and filters in place so for example they would have to have been logged in consecutively for the last 7 days etc before they can be picked and if that player is not logged in for more than two days the bounty switches. Also if you die instead coming back to life straight away you actually get quests from the Fates as they are known in the book to earn you way back to life, so you still level but it gives you access to other loot and rewards but just like WOW there is a penalty for dying so the more you die the more you have to do before you can return to the land of the living etc. Plus the higher level you get the better the rewards but the longer you stay dead (so you might have players who need a particular bit of gear but they know they have to die in order to get it and have to look at how quick can they get back to the land of the living). Bounties can kill themselves (ie fall damage) they can hide where the fates are and then the players on the bounty quest perform quests to bring them back to the real world to allow them to be killed (like the necro/voodoo class that can with the aid of others summon them back to the real world) and player who is the bounty receives a reward for staying unkilled by a player the longer the bounty is logged on the better the reward encouraging them to log on more and if they are they bounty for a set time (maybe a week) they get like a wicked title and mount as well\n

1343502506|xb3ye|I need to come up with a name...|I had an idea for a game, no matter how unlikely it is that ill be able to make it. It'd be an MMO, with a constantly changing world. It'd be the runescape-esque type of mmo, resource gathering, crafting, ect. The key difference being that the beginning world has no buildings, NPC's, quests, or really rules. People could cut down a tree to get logs and hand-build a house (no conforming to a single house design here!) People could form groups, build cities, roads, trade routes, make weapons and war, pretty much do whatever they wanted. All I need is a name... and then to spend a year (or three) making v1.0...
1344230045|xr0gm|Fallout had you pick "Perks"; a game needs to have you pick perks with the cost of a disadvantage. |I'm thinking this is perfect for a Fallout kind of game, the idea basically has it so that a advantage comes with the price of an disadvantage, it makes your character more unique and makes you think twice before picking your "perk". Your character has 10% increased speed, but it comes with the price of limited inventory. Your character has 15% increase in melee strength, but it comes with the price of poor accuracy.   
1342569921|wqbon|A Multiplayer Sanbox Game Where Players Assume the Roles of Individual Ants in a Colony|"Co-Op" in games is usually confined to combat or simple puzzle solving. I've been pondering a game that requires a team of players to coexist on a complex level to achieve success. I devised an idea today in which a large team of players take on the roles of various ants in a colony in some suburban backyard. The world is generated randomly and terrain is destructible (in the vein of Minecraft and/or Spelunky.) Each player can choose from a variety of "classes" of ants, each with different gameplay aspects and different ways to benefit the colony. You could choose to be a tunneler ant and dig deep into the earth to provide better protection of the Ant queen and colony resources, all the while gathering subterranean treasure. Meanwhile, your friend could be a soldier ant, following a scout to prey or guarding a group of forager ants carrying a surplus of food back to the home base from rival ants. \n\nRival colonies could allow for PVP, in which Black and Red ants contend to collect the most resources, capture each other's queens, etc...\n\nMany different games inspired this idea, including SimAnt, Pikmin, Minecraft, any MMO, and Tribes. Also, I've been playing waaaaay too much Spelunky lately, so I imagine the game as a massive 2D platformer with adorable, anthropomorphic ants.   
1341934249|wbxnz|Game of life through history|Does anyone think an historical game of life would be amazing?\nDoes such a thing exist?\n\nhat i'm talking about is an almost spore like game where you start with tribes of the most basic neanderthals. Evolving into stone age cave-men style people. Making tools, metals, hunting, then to more settled lifestyles.\n all the way through to modern times and possibly beyond, with the style of gameplay changing to match the hardships involved with life in whatever era is occuring.
1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1338275730|ua0eq|Necromancer: Dead Army Rising|Basically it would be a combination of tower defense and pvp. Leaderboards, Largest army of the day, etc. There would be different wizard classes that you could choose. Each one would have their own kingdom to protect. You lose your land if your king is killed. The different wizard classes would control different aspects of the dead. \n    \n    * Ethereal class would be able to command banshees and poltergeist. \n\n    * Elemental class would control the 4 spirits of nature.\n    \n    * Demon class would summon the defeated swarms of hellbeasts from previous wars. \n\n    * Dishonored class would force fallen soliders to rise from their graves and attack their former allies. \n\n\nJust some of the ideas I got off the top of my head. I don't have the coding skills / knowledge to pull it together. But it was a interesting idea that I thought I should write down.
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.

1323902606|ncyus|Who wants their ideas implemented?|Hello. I'm making a game. The idea of the game was making an easily-adjustable engine, then trying out a bunch of systems, and find one with the best feedback.\n\nTo this end, I need ideas. A lot of people have plenty of ideas and but can't code: this is for them.\n\nSome notes about the ideas: \n1) This is a turn based game\n2) I'm not going to do anything grid-based (although things like Kongai's ranges are acceptable)\n3) Nothing about aesthetics, graphics, non-battle systems. I am asking specifically about battle systems that require strategic thinking\n4) The limb-based system I currently have is available here: http://mrizen.com/flashy/WWHM.swf\n\nSo go on! Complex realistic limb-based systems? Weird magic rules? Huge damage calculations? It's up to you. Good ideas will be implemented within the week (Implemented being proof-of-concept things, not actually fully fleshed out games). Also, if you submit an idea, expect to playtest it (and the ideas of others), and give /constructive/ critique.\n

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

1332781978|refot|Game Idea: FPS (Hitman style) and/or top-down  game based on the movie "The Conversation" where the goal is to bug, video, and otherwise steal the information your clients demand. (Private Investigation Game)|For those who haven't seen [The Conversation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), it's a fantastic movie  based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\n\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same.  Sometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional mikes/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to.  All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them.  You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play.  And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n\nOK...now to check Steam's daily sale ;)\n\nedit: I'd personally love the same gritty, dirty, feeling of real life portrayed in that movie...
1333720700|rw98a|A game that takes google maps and let's you play them like fortis / pac man / other variation.|This game could\n\na) Access live/store-for-later-use sections of google maps (or similar) / your own imagery\n\nb) Interpret map, outlining blocks/houses/etc.\n\nc) Play the game (within boundaries you set) like Fortis, with paths only being between blocks (and some sort of map-suitable enemies added), points gained for 'businesses' captured, etc   OR Play a game of Pacman with dots placed along all roads/trails/paths/etc. (If multiplayer doable, allow you to race against friend, blockus style)\n\nd) If GPS data is available/3GS/etc, allow people to play 'pacman' or 'Fortis' live by walking/riding/driving to collect all the dots, etc. Perhaps an alternate to a scavenger-hunt race?  A way to encourage kids to exercise (and adults) - at least for those parents not scared by media to not let their children out of their sight :D; If multiplayer is possible, allow them to recapture their friend's areas, or battle their friends, as above.\n\nSUPER BONUS ALTERNATIVES (all based on the same image/map import/life-use):\n\n* Allow people to play RISK-style games (WarLight?), \n* Monopoly (buy various blocks/buildings), \n* Tower Defense (place weapons, each round, choose to release pedestrians/cars to reach enemy, who's towers attack your minions as yours attack his),\n* The Dots game (where you try to connect four dots in a square while your friend does the same)\n* Top down Tank game ala old Apple II Blockus game or the one in Tron\n\nThink of me if you make one of these or close variation :D  I'd love to be involved in some (non programming way).\n
1338746479|uitpt|A Homeless simulator. A Lemonade Stand Style Game, maybe a programer can help me make this?|I always thought there should be a game in which you have to survive the busy city streets as a homeless man. The game would go on a day counter, and each day consists of one cycle. The cycle starts with a visit to the thrift store, where the player can purchase items needed for survival as well as items that will help generate money from panhandling. Cycle 2 is panhandling, much like lemonade stand, you decide what to do and how to make money, depending on your method and appearance you will make more or less money. The third part of the cycle the player visits a walmart type location and needs to buy food to survive, the player can also purchase different survival items here. Finally the player has the choice of where to sleep, all of which have different effects on gameplay (I.E. sleeping in the alley can get you robbed while sleeping at the church homeless shelter forbids you to lie while panhandling). The game can get more advanced from there. Drugs could become an element of gameplay (I like the idea of them being mini-games so players have an actual temptation to use them). I have a lot more ideas for this game, comment if you want me to go on, or help me out with some ideas of your own. A programmer interested in making this game would be a dream come true. 
1322148286|mnxpp|game idea: 1% riot defence|Quite similar to the tower defence games that we all know and love I present you my idea:\n1% riot defence puts you in the role of Monty McRich to regain Zuccotti Park. With endless (seriously!) resources you deploy cops in normal or riot gear, equip them with the latest gummi ammo or pepper sprays. But be careful, the 99% tend to build towers, march hand in hand and throw flowers on your mercenaries.\nBonus levels might include Fun(d)racers where you collect unattended money bag and book piles on a harsh race course through the dump formerly know as Zuccotti Park.
1314302904|judck|Abandoned: An adventure game|The game opens to a pixel art scene of a Regular-Joe office worker, the protagonist, exiting a bus and walking into an office building. He plods over to the elevator and starts to take it up. Another man in a suit is in the elevator, who, after a few seconds, stabs our hero right in the heart with a knife.\n\nThe screen fades to black, and then fades in to show our hero lying down in the middle of an underground cavern. A few dry bushes lie here or there but it is mostly empty.\n\nSuddenly, the man who stabbed you reappears, floating above your head. He explains very little, but mentions to "watch out for the natives." At his words, a man hiding behind one of the bushes, previously unseen, throws a dart at the floating man. With a wave of his hand, the dart stops, turns around, and shoots back towards the bush, which bursts into flames.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D MetroidVania adventure open world game. You eventually find that the complex cave system is inhabited by two warring tribes, designated by their red and blue colors. It turns out that the man who sent you here has been forcing people into the caves for years, and now there are over a hundred inhabitants.\n\nYou are given the option to choose whether you want to join the Red side or the Blue side early in the game. Each will allow you to get unique equipment.\n\nThe equipment is another large feature of the game: the relatively simply gameplay mechanics are paired with a very in-depth leveling system and equipment.\n\nMultiplayer is a large part, and at any point you can enter Battlefields, which are cave systems that are being fought over constantly. You can choose varying levels of risk-in certain Battlefields, you lose all of your items and money if you die, and in some you keep everything.\n\nThat's the basic outline-I would love to get the opportunity to make the game, but I'm not sure how I would really start; I have basically no coding experience, and I am in no way an artist :p

1319044519|lho12|MY idea for a new form of competitive gaming that can revolutionize the current e-sports market.|What I propose is a revolutionary way to make e-sports more main stream, more hardcore. My idea is just the competitive and outlet part, whomever can provide the game though, would make a killing.\n\nThe idea:\nThe game has a hardcore mode (think Diablo 2 hardcore). But you have to call it something awesome like, Champion mode, or Pro League, or something to that extent. Something to entice players who are really into competitive gaming.\n\nIn this mode, you raise a character (however the game determines) and battle them through rank style match making. If your character dies, that's it, they're dead and done and the player will be have to make a new one. The game will benefit MORE, if there are kill or injury damages and execution. This way, players can decide either through skillful playing or what not if their opponent can get another chance by not killing them. If there are spectator and live events, they can do the whole gladiator style where the spectators are yelling out "LIVE" or "DEATH". Now that'd make for some awesome live streaming events. The world can even embrace player honour and respect when a compassionate gamer decides to let his opponent live. Or be all douche bag and just rip their heads off. Whatever the choice, it'll still make for a great weekly story.\n\nThe next important step, is that the upper ranking matches should be recorded and streamed live and/or re-played on a youtube channel. This way, spectators can have an avenue to view these top level fights and see the progression of this e-sport.\n\nThe game that benefits most from this system?\nIt would have to be a spectator friendly game. 1v1 or team won't matter. It'll also have to be a game where true competitive skills determine the winner, where commentators can really break down the fight and describe or explain it from a very technical point of view. I'm thinking street fighter type of pace. A game where it takes multiple moves to get the killing or damaging blow unlike shooters where one shot can end a player.\n\nGreat money opportunity in my mind. I even have a great game idea to implement this, but I'd rather keep that to myself for now.\n\nYou can make money on advertisements through streaming/youtube.\nAnd as all sports, when it gets big enough, have open cash tournaments, etc etc.\n\nyou can also go the rich boy route (which I am personally against) and use money to buy better equipment, or buy an already levelled up character or something to this sort, again, game dependent.  I mean, LoL makes money by selling you skins. I can't imagine this to not work.\n\nAnyways, that is my idea, if you want to talk to me more about it, please, leave a comment, msg or email me.\n

1338747083|uiu6r|David Lynch meets Grand Theft Auto|I always thought there should be a rockstar type title that played out like a David Lynch film (The weirder the better). Just hear me out. \nYou would play as a smalltime criminal or a park ranger or a hunter (somebody who carries a gun for their job). After a vacation they return to their small town home to discover everything is different and the folks around town are all talking about some incident that happened while you were gone. . . Like A grand theft auto game you'd go exploring in this small town and drive around and shoot shit up but the main plot is convoluted, and never really comes to the surface. There are men in black, mysterious missions, cults, covert military operations. But more than anything this game has tons upon tons of easter eggs to keep that mysterious nature about. It would all be about creating a game universe where you have no idea what's going on, and internet buzz will generate lots of legends about what easter eggs are true and which are not. Dumb idea?

1341756422|w7z3j|Lord and Questgiver Concept|Lately my hard drive has been graced with a 90s classic -- Majesty. The game is an RTS in function, and it places you as a sovereign over a randomized map of dark castles, caverns and the monsters you would associate with them. Instead of directing your heroes, you can only set values of a quest with a marker, such as "Exploring this Wasteland will net you 100 gold." or "Destroying this Dark Citadel will yield split evenly among those who damage or support in the damage of it a sum of 1000 divided amongst them."\n\nThe game only lets you what kinds of heroes you can hire though you can research their abilities and unlock different kinds of heroes as you go.\n\nMy game idea is thus -- revitalize this spin on the traditional RPG paradigm in placing you as the Lord or Sovereign of a domain and allow the recruitment of random heroes of random properties... some excellent... some bad... and allow them to either fail or succeed at the quests you give them.\n\nI'm not sure how you can frame this but I can imagine it could even work on a iOS / Android platform.
1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1338275730|ua0eq|Necromancer: Dead Army Rising|Basically it would be a combination of tower defense and pvp. Leaderboards, Largest army of the day, etc. There would be different wizard classes that you could choose. Each one would have their own kingdom to protect. You lose your land if your king is killed. The different wizard classes would control different aspects of the dead. \n    \n    * Ethereal class would be able to command banshees and poltergeist. \n\n    * Elemental class would control the 4 spirits of nature.\n    \n    * Demon class would summon the defeated swarms of hellbeasts from previous wars. \n\n    * Dishonored class would force fallen soliders to rise from their graves and attack their former allies. \n\n\nJust some of the ideas I got off the top of my head. I don't have the coding skills / knowledge to pull it together. But it was a interesting idea that I thought I should write down.
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.
1265008919|awkjk|A RTS idea of huge(-ships/bases) war|[deleted]
1289497130|e4oho|X post from /r/gamedev - TSA game|
1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.

Nintendo themed [MOBA](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=MOBA): With so many abilities/characters that you could simply carry over from Smash Brosh and Pokemon games, as well as the never-ending themes you could have in terms of levels to play on, this would be awesome. Just aim to make the game easy to play and hard to master.
1323902606|ncyus|Who wants their ideas implemented?|Hello. I'm making a game. The idea of the game was making an easily-adjustable engine, then trying out a bunch of systems, and find one with the best feedback.\n\nTo this end, I need ideas. A lot of people have plenty of ideas and but can't code: this is for them.\n\nSome notes about the ideas: \n1) This is a turn based game\n2) I'm not going to do anything grid-based (although things like Kongai's ranges are acceptable)\n3) Nothing about aesthetics, graphics, non-battle systems. I am asking specifically about battle systems that require strategic thinking\n4) The limb-based system I currently have is available here: http://mrizen.com/flashy/WWHM.swf\n\nSo go on! Complex realistic limb-based systems? Weird magic rules? Huge damage calculations? It's up to you. Good ideas will be implemented within the week (Implemented being proof-of-concept things, not actually fully fleshed out games). Also, if you submit an idea, expect to playtest it (and the ideas of others), and give /constructive/ critique.\n

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

1332781978|refot|Game Idea: FPS (Hitman style) and/or top-down  game based on the movie "The Conversation" where the goal is to bug, video, and otherwise steal the information your clients demand. (Private Investigation Game)|For those who haven't seen [The Conversation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), it's a fantastic movie  based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\n\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same.  Sometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional mikes/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to.  All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them.  You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play.  And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n\nOK...now to check Steam's daily sale ;)\n\nedit: I'd personally love the same gritty, dirty, feeling of real life portrayed in that movie...
1333720700|rw98a|A game that takes google maps and let's you play them like fortis / pac man / other variation.|This game could\n\na) Access live/store-for-later-use sections of google maps (or similar) / your own imagery\n\nb) Interpret map, outlining blocks/houses/etc.\n\nc) Play the game (within boundaries you set) like Fortis, with paths only being between blocks (and some sort of map-suitable enemies added), points gained for 'businesses' captured, etc   OR Play a game of Pacman with dots placed along all roads/trails/paths/etc. (If multiplayer doable, allow you to race against friend, blockus style)\n\nd) If GPS data is available/3GS/etc, allow people to play 'pacman' or 'Fortis' live by walking/riding/driving to collect all the dots, etc. Perhaps an alternate to a scavenger-hunt race?  A way to encourage kids to exercise (and adults) - at least for those parents not scared by media to not let their children out of their sight :D; If multiplayer is possible, allow them to recapture their friend's areas, or battle their friends, as above.\n\nSUPER BONUS ALTERNATIVES (all based on the same image/map import/life-use):\n\n* Allow people to play RISK-style games (WarLight?), \n* Monopoly (buy various blocks/buildings), \n* Tower Defense (place weapons, each round, choose to release pedestrians/cars to reach enemy, who's towers attack your minions as yours attack his),\n* The Dots game (where you try to connect four dots in a square while your friend does the same)\n* Top down Tank game ala old Apple II Blockus game or the one in Tron\n\nThink of me if you make one of these or close variation :D  I'd love to be involved in some (non programming way).\n
1338746479|uitpt|A Homeless simulator. A Lemonade Stand Style Game, maybe a programer can help me make this?|I always thought there should be a game in which you have to survive the busy city streets as a homeless man. The game would go on a day counter, and each day consists of one cycle. The cycle starts with a visit to the thrift store, where the player can purchase items needed for survival as well as items that will help generate money from panhandling. Cycle 2 is panhandling, much like lemonade stand, you decide what to do and how to make money, depending on your method and appearance you will make more or less money. The third part of the cycle the player visits a walmart type location and needs to buy food to survive, the player can also purchase different survival items here. Finally the player has the choice of where to sleep, all of which have different effects on gameplay (I.E. sleeping in the alley can get you robbed while sleeping at the church homeless shelter forbids you to lie while panhandling). The game can get more advanced from there. Drugs could become an element of gameplay (I like the idea of them being mini-games so players have an actual temptation to use them). I have a lot more ideas for this game, comment if you want me to go on, or help me out with some ideas of your own. A programmer interested in making this game would be a dream come true. 
1322148286|mnxpp|game idea: 1% riot defence|Quite similar to the tower defence games that we all know and love I present you my idea:\n1% riot defence puts you in the role of Monty McRich to regain Zuccotti Park. With endless (seriously!) resources you deploy cops in normal or riot gear, equip them with the latest gummi ammo or pepper sprays. But be careful, the 99% tend to build towers, march hand in hand and throw flowers on your mercenaries.\nBonus levels might include Fun(d)racers where you collect unattended money bag and book piles on a harsh race course through the dump formerly know as Zuccotti Park.
1314302904|judck|Abandoned: An adventure game|The game opens to a pixel art scene of a Regular-Joe office worker, the protagonist, exiting a bus and walking into an office building. He plods over to the elevator and starts to take it up. Another man in a suit is in the elevator, who, after a few seconds, stabs our hero right in the heart with a knife.\n\nThe screen fades to black, and then fades in to show our hero lying down in the middle of an underground cavern. A few dry bushes lie here or there but it is mostly empty.\n\nSuddenly, the man who stabbed you reappears, floating above your head. He explains very little, but mentions to "watch out for the natives." At his words, a man hiding behind one of the bushes, previously unseen, throws a dart at the floating man. With a wave of his hand, the dart stops, turns around, and shoots back towards the bush, which bursts into flames.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D MetroidVania adventure open world game. You eventually find that the complex cave system is inhabited by two warring tribes, designated by their red and blue colors. It turns out that the man who sent you here has been forcing people into the caves for years, and now there are over a hundred inhabitants.\n\nYou are given the option to choose whether you want to join the Red side or the Blue side early in the game. Each will allow you to get unique equipment.\n\nThe equipment is another large feature of the game: the relatively simply gameplay mechanics are paired with a very in-depth leveling system and equipment.\n\nMultiplayer is a large part, and at any point you can enter Battlefields, which are cave systems that are being fought over constantly. You can choose varying levels of risk-in certain Battlefields, you lose all of your items and money if you die, and in some you keep everything.\n\nThat's the basic outline-I would love to get the opportunity to make the game, but I'm not sure how I would really start; I have basically no coding experience, and I am in no way an artist :p

never-to-be-actually-made AAA game concepts": 
Invisible Protagonist|
1319044519|lho12|MY idea for a new form of competitive gaming that can revolutionize the current e-sports market.|What I propose is a revolutionary way to make e-sports more main stream, more hardcore. My idea is just the competitive and outlet part, whomever can provide the game though, would make a killing.\n\nThe idea:\nThe game has a hardcore mode (think Diablo 2 hardcore). But you have to call it something awesome like, Champion mode, or Pro League, or something to that extent. Something to entice players who are really into competitive gaming.\n\nIn this mode, you raise a character (however the game determines) and battle them through rank style match making. If your character dies, that's it, they're dead and done and the player will be have to make a new one. The game will benefit MORE, if there are kill or injury damages and execution. This way, players can decide either through skillful playing or what not if their opponent can get another chance by not killing them. If there are spectator and live events, they can do the whole gladiator style where the spectators are yelling out "LIVE" or "DEATH". Now that'd make for some awesome live streaming events. The world can even embrace player honour and respect when a compassionate gamer decides to let his opponent live. Or be all douche bag and just rip their heads off. Whatever the choice, it'll still make for a great weekly story.\n\nThe next important step, is that the upper ranking matches should be recorded and streamed live and/or re-played on a youtube channel. This way, spectators can have an avenue to view these top level fights and see the progression of this e-sport.\n\nThe game that benefits most from this system?\nIt would have to be a spectator friendly game. 1v1 or team won't matter. It'll also have to be a game where true competitive skills determine the winner, where commentators can really break down the fight and describe or explain it from a very technical point of view. I'm thinking street fighter type of pace. A game where it takes multiple moves to get the killing or damaging blow unlike shooters where one shot can end a player.\n\nGreat money opportunity in my mind. I even have a great game idea to implement this, but I'd rather keep that to myself for now.\n\nYou can make money on advertisements through streaming/youtube.\nAnd as all sports, when it gets big enough, have open cash tournaments, etc etc.\n\nyou can also go the rich boy route (which I am personally against) and use money to buy better equipment, or buy an already levelled up character or something to this sort, again, game dependent.  I mean, LoL makes money by selling you skins. I can't imagine this to not work.\n\nAnyways, that is my idea, if you want to talk to me more about it, please, leave a comment, msg or email me.\n

1338747083|uiu6r|David Lynch meets Grand Theft Auto|I always thought there should be a rockstar type title that played out like a David Lynch film (The weirder the better). Just hear me out. \nYou would play as a smalltime criminal or a park ranger or a hunter (somebody who carries a gun for their job). After a vacation they return to their small town home to discover everything is different and the folks around town are all talking about some incident that happened while you were gone. . . Like A grand theft auto game you'd go exploring in this small town and drive around and shoot shit up but the main plot is convoluted, and never really comes to the surface. There are men in black, mysterious missions, cults, covert military operations. But more than anything this game has tons upon tons of easter eggs to keep that mysterious nature about. It would all be about creating a game universe where you have no idea what's going on, and internet buzz will generate lots of legends about what easter eggs are true and which are not. Dumb idea?

1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1338275730|ua0eq|Necromancer: Dead Army Rising|Basically it would be a combination of tower defense and pvp. Leaderboards, Largest army of the day, etc. There would be different wizard classes that you could choose. Each one would have their own kingdom to protect. You lose your land if your king is killed. The different wizard classes would control different aspects of the dead. \n    \n    * Ethereal class would be able to command banshees and poltergeist. \n\n    * Elemental class would control the 4 spirits of nature.\n    \n    * Demon class would summon the defeated swarms of hellbeasts from previous wars. \n\n    * Dishonored class would force fallen soliders to rise from their graves and attack their former allies. \n\n\nJust some of the ideas I got off the top of my head. I don't have the coding skills / knowledge to pull it together. But it was a interesting idea that I thought I should write down.
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1289497130|e4oho|X post from /r/gamedev - TSA game|
1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.

1323902606|ncyus|Who wants their ideas implemented?|Hello. I'm making a game. The idea of the game was making an easily-adjustable engine, then trying out a bunch of systems, and find one with the best feedback.\n\nTo this end, I need ideas. A lot of people have plenty of ideas and but can't code: this is for them.\n\nSome notes about the ideas: \n1) This is a turn based game\n2) I'm not going to do anything grid-based (although things like Kongai's ranges are acceptable)\n3) Nothing about aesthetics, graphics, non-battle systems. I am asking specifically about battle systems that require strategic thinking\n4) The limb-based system I currently have is available here: http://mrizen.com/flashy/WWHM.swf\n\nSo go on! Complex realistic limb-based systems? Weird magic rules? Huge damage calculations? It's up to you. Good ideas will be implemented within the week (Implemented being proof-of-concept things, not actually fully fleshed out games). Also, if you submit an idea, expect to playtest it (and the ideas of others), and give /constructive/ critique.\n

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

1332781978|refot|Game Idea: FPS (Hitman style) and/or top-down  game based on the movie "The Conversation" where the goal is to bug, video, and otherwise steal the information your clients demand. (Private Investigation Game)|For those who haven't seen [The Conversation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), it's a fantastic movie  based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\n\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same.  Sometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional mikes/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to.  All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them.  You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play.  And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n\nOK...now to check Steam's daily sale ;)\n\nedit: I'd personally love the same gritty, dirty, feeling of real life portrayed in that movie...

1338746479|uitpt|A Homeless simulator. A Lemonade Stand Style Game, maybe a programer can help me make this?|I always thought there should be a game in which you have to survive the busy city streets as a homeless man. The game would go on a day counter, and each day consists of one cycle. The cycle starts with a visit to the thrift store, where the player can purchase items needed for survival as well as items that will help generate money from panhandling. Cycle 2 is panhandling, much like lemonade stand, you decide what to do and how to make money, depending on your method and appearance you will make more or less money. The third part of the cycle the player visits a walmart type location and needs to buy food to survive, the player can also purchase different survival items here. Finally the player has the choice of where to sleep, all of which have different effects on gameplay (I.E. sleeping in the alley can get you robbed while sleeping at the church homeless shelter forbids you to lie while panhandling). The game can get more advanced from there. Drugs could become an element of gameplay (I like the idea of them being mini-games so players have an actual temptation to use them). I have a lot more ideas for this game, comment if you want me to go on, or help me out with some ideas of your own. A programmer interested in making this game would be a dream come true.

But be careful, the 99% tend to build towers, march hand in hand and throw flowers on your mercenaries.\nBonus levels might include Fun(d)racers where you collect unattended money bag and book piles on a harsh race course through the dump formerly know as Zuccotti Park.
1314302904|judck|Abandoned: An adventure game|The game opens to a pixel art scene of a Regular-Joe office worker, the protagonist, exiting a bus and walking into an office building. He plods over to the elevator and starts to take it up. Another man in a suit is in the elevator, who, after a few seconds, stabs our hero right in the heart with a knife.\n\nThe screen fades to black, and then fades in to show our hero lying down in the middle of an underground cavern. A few dry bushes lie here or there but it is mostly empty.\n\nSuddenly, the man who stabbed you reappears, floating above your head. He explains very little, but mentions to "watch out for the natives." At his words, a man hiding behind one of the bushes, previously unseen, throws a dart at the floating man. With a wave of his hand, the dart stops, turns around, and shoots back towards the bush, which bursts into flames.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D MetroidVania adventure open world game. You eventually find that the complex cave system is inhabited by two warring tribes, designated by their red and blue colors. It turns out that the man who sent you here has been forcing people into the caves for years, and now there are over a hundred inhabitants.\n\nYou are given the option to choose whether you want to join the Red side or the Blue side early in the game. Each will allow you to get unique equipment.\n\nThe equipment is another large feature of the game: the relatively simply gameplay mechanics are paired with a very in-depth leveling system and equipment.\n\nMultiplayer is a large part, and at any point you can enter Battlefields, which are cave systems that are being fought over constantly. You can choose varying levels of risk-in certain Battlefields, you lose all of your items and money if you die, and in some you keep everything.\n\nThat's the basic outline-I would love to get the opportunity to make the game, but I'm not sure how I would really start; I have basically no coding experience, and I am in no way an artist :p

1319044519|lho12|MY idea for a new form of competitive gaming that can revolutionize the current e-sports market.|What I propose is a revolutionary way to make e-sports more main stream, more hardcore. My idea is just the competitive and outlet part, whomever can provide the game though, would make a killing.\n\nThe idea:\nThe game has a hardcore mode (think Diablo 2 hardcore). But you have to call it something awesome like, Champion mode, or Pro League, or something to that extent. Something to entice players who are really into competitive gaming.\n\nIn this mode, you raise a character (however the game determines) and battle them through rank style match making. If your character dies, that's it, they're dead and done and the player will be have to make a new one. The game will benefit MORE, if there are kill or injury damages and execution. This way, players can decide either through skillful playing or what not if their opponent can get another chance by not killing them. If there are spectator and live events, they can do the whole gladiator style where the spectators are yelling out "LIVE" or "DEATH". Now that'd make for some awesome live streaming events. The world can even embrace player honour and respect when a compassionate gamer decides to let his opponent live. Or be all douche bag and just rip their heads off. Whatever the choice, it'll still make for a great weekly story.\n\nThe next important step, is that the upper ranking matches should be recorded and streamed live and/or re-played on a youtube channel. This way, spectators can have an avenue to view these top level fights and see the progression of this e-sport.\n\nThe game that benefits most from this system?\nIt would have to be a spectator friendly game. 1v1 or team won't matter. It'll also have to be a game where true competitive skills determine the winner, where commentators can really break down the fight and describe or explain it from a very technical point of view. I'm thinking street fighter type of pace. A game where it takes multiple moves to get the killing or damaging blow unlike shooters where one shot can end a player.\n\nGreat money opportunity in my mind. I even have a great game idea to implement this, but I'd rather keep that to myself for now.\n\nYou can make money on advertisements through streaming/youtube.\nAnd as all sports, when it gets big enough, have open cash tournaments, etc etc.\n\nyou can also go the rich boy route (which I am personally against) and use money to buy better equipment, or buy an already levelled up character or something to this sort, again, game dependent.  I mean, LoL makes money by selling you skins. I can't imagine this to not work.\n\nAnyways, that is my idea, if you want to talk to me more about it, please, leave a comment, msg or email me.\n

1338747083|uiu6r|David Lynch meets Grand Theft Auto|I always thought there should be a rockstar type title that played out like a David Lynch film (The weirder the better). Just hear me out. \nYou would play as a smalltime criminal or a park ranger or a hunter (somebody who carries a gun for their job). After a vacation they return to their small town home to discover everything is different and the folks around town are all talking about some incident that happened while you were gone. . . Like A grand theft auto game you'd go exploring in this small town and drive around and shoot shit up but the main plot is convoluted, and never really comes to the surface. There are men in black, mysterious missions, cults, covert military operations. But more than anything this game has tons upon tons of easter eggs to keep that mysterious nature about. It would all be about creating a game universe where you have no idea what's going on, and internet buzz will generate lots of legends about what easter eggs are true and which are not. Dumb idea?
1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1338275730|ua0eq|Necromancer: Dead Army Rising|Basically it would be a combination of tower defense and pvp. Leaderboards, Largest army of the day, etc. There would be different wizard classes that you could choose. Each one would have their own kingdom to protect. You lose your land if your king is killed. The different wizard classes would control different aspects of the dead. \n    \n    * Ethereal class would be able to command banshees and poltergeist. \n\n    * Elemental class would control the 4 spirits of nature.\n    \n    * Demon class would summon the defeated swarms of hellbeasts from previous wars. \n\n    * Dishonored class would force fallen soliders to rise from their graves and attack their former allies. \n\n\nJust some of the ideas I got off the top of my head. I don't have the coding skills / knowledge to pull it together. But it was a interesting idea that I thought I should write down.
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.

A lot of people have plenty of ideas and but can't code: this is for them.\n\nSome notes about the ideas: \n1) This is a turn based game\n2) I'm not going to do anything grid-based (although things like Kongai's ranges are acceptable)\n3) Nothing about aesthetics, graphics, non-battle systems. I am asking specifically about battle systems that require strategic thinking\n4) The limb-based system I currently have is available here: http://mrizen.com/flashy/WWHM.swf\n\nSo go on! Complex realistic limb-based systems? Weird magic rules? Huge damage calculations? It's up to you. Good ideas will be implemented within the week (Implemented being proof-of-concept things, not actually fully fleshed out games). Also, if you submit an idea, expect to playtest it (and the ideas of others), and give /constructive/ critique.\n

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

1332781978|refot|Game Idea: FPS (Hitman style) and/or top-down  game based on the movie "The Conversation" where the goal is to bug, video, and otherwise steal the information your clients demand. (Private Investigation Game)|For those who haven't seen [The Conversation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), it's a fantastic movie  based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\n\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same.  Sometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional mikes/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to.  All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them.  You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play.  And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n\nOK...now to check Steam's daily sale ;)\n\nedit: I'd personally love the same gritty, dirty, feeling of real life portrayed in that movie...

A way to encourage kids to exercise (and adults) - at least for those parents not scared by media to not let their children out of their sight :D; If multiplayer is possible, allow them to recapture their friend's areas, or battle their friends, as above.\n\nSUPER BONUS ALTERNATIVES (all based on the same image/map import/life-use):\n\n* Allow people to play RISK-style games (WarLight?), \n* Monopoly (buy various blocks/buildings), \n* Tower Defense (place weapons, each round, choose to release pedestrians/cars to reach enemy, who's towers attack your minions as yours attack his),\n* The Dots game (where you try to connect four dots in a square while your friend does the same)\n* Top down Tank game ala old Apple II Blockus game or the one in Tron\n\nThink of me if you make one of these or close variation :D  I'd love to be involved in some (non programming way).\n
1338746479|uitpt|A Homeless simulator. A Lemonade Stand Style Game, maybe a programer can help me make this?|I always thought there should be a game in which you have to survive the busy city streets as a homeless man. The game would go on a day counter, and each day consists of one cycle. The cycle starts with a visit to the thrift store, where the player can purchase items needed for survival as well as items that will help generate money from panhandling. Cycle 2 is panhandling, much like lemonade stand, you decide what to do and how to make money, depending on your method and appearance you will make more or less money. The third part of the cycle the player visits a walmart type location and needs to buy food to survive, the player can also purchase different survival items here. Finally the player has the choice of where to sleep, all of which have different effects on gameplay (I.E. sleeping in the alley can get you robbed while sleeping at the church homeless shelter forbids you to lie while panhandling). The game can get more advanced from there. Drugs could become an element of gameplay (I like the idea of them being mini-games so players have an actual temptation to use them). I have a lot more ideas for this game, comment if you want me to go on, or help me out with some ideas of your own. A programmer interested in making this game would be a dream come true. 
1322148286|mnxpp|game idea: 1% riot defence|Quite similar to the tower defence games that we all know and love I present you my idea:\n1% riot defence puts you in the role of Monty McRich to regain Zuccotti Park. With endless (seriously!) resources you deploy cops in normal or riot gear, equip them with the latest gummi ammo or pepper sprays. But be careful, the 99% tend to build towers, march hand in hand and throw flowers on your mercenaries.\nBonus levels might include Fun(d)racers where you collect unattended money bag and book piles on a harsh race course through the dump formerly know as Zuccotti Park.
1314302904|judck|Abandoned: An adventure game|The game opens to a pixel art scene of a Regular-Joe office worker, the protagonist, exiting a bus and walking into an office building. He plods over to the elevator and starts to take it up. Another man in a suit is in the elevator, who, after a few seconds, stabs our hero right in the heart with a knife.\n\nThe screen fades to black, and then fades in to show our hero lying down in the middle of an underground cavern. A few dry bushes lie here or there but it is mostly empty.\n\nSuddenly, the man who stabbed you reappears, floating above your head. He explains very little, but mentions to "watch out for the natives." At his words, a man hiding behind one of the bushes, previously unseen, throws a dart at the floating man. With a wave of his hand, the dart stops, turns around, and shoots back towards the bush, which bursts into flames.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D MetroidVania adventure open world game. You eventually find that the complex cave system is inhabited by two warring tribes, designated by their red and blue colors. It turns out that the man who sent you here has been forcing people into the caves for years, and now there are over a hundred inhabitants.\n\nYou are given the option to choose whether you want to join the Red side or the Blue side early in the game. Each will allow you to get unique equipment.\n\nThe equipment is another large feature of the game: the relatively simply gameplay mechanics are paired with a very in-depth leveling system and equipment.\n\nMultiplayer is a large part, and at any point you can enter Battlefields, which are cave systems that are being fought over constantly. You can choose varying levels of risk-in certain Battlefields, you lose all of your items and money if you die, and in some you keep everything.\n\nThat's the basic outline-I would love to get the opportunity to make the game, but I'm not sure how I would really start; I have basically no coding experience, and I am in no way an artist :p

never-to-be-actually-made AAA game concepts": 
Invisible Protagonist|
1319044519|lho12|MY idea for a new form of competitive gaming that can revolutionize the current e-sports market.|What I propose is a revolutionary way to make e-sports more main stream, more hardcore. My idea is just the competitive and outlet part, whomever can provide the game though, would make a killing.\n\nThe idea:\nThe game has a hardcore mode (think Diablo 2 hardcore). But you have to call it something awesome like, Champion mode, or Pro League, or something to that extent. Something to entice players who are really into competitive gaming.\n\nIn this mode, you raise a character (however the game determines) and battle them through rank style match making. If your character dies, that's it, they're dead and done and the player will be have to make a new one. The game will benefit MORE, if there are kill or injury damages and execution. This way, players can decide either through skillful playing or what not if their opponent can get another chance by not killing them. If there are spectator and live events, they can do the whole gladiator style where the spectators are yelling out "LIVE" or "DEATH". Now that'd make for some awesome live streaming events. The world can even embrace player honour and respect when a compassionate gamer decides to let his opponent live. Or be all douche bag and just rip their heads off. Whatever the choice, it'll still make for a great weekly story.\n\nThe next important step, is that the upper ranking matches should be recorded and streamed live and/or re-played on a youtube channel. This way, spectators can have an avenue to view these top level fights and see the progression of this e-sport.\n\nThe game that benefits most from this system?\nIt would have to be a spectator friendly game. 1v1 or team won't matter. It'll also have to be a game where true competitive skills determine the winner, where commentators can really break down the fight and describe or explain it from a very technical point of view. I'm thinking street fighter type of pace. A game where it takes multiple moves to get the killing or damaging blow unlike shooters where one shot can end a player.\n\nGreat money opportunity in my mind. I even have a great game idea to implement this, but I'd rather keep that to myself for now.\n\nYou can make money on advertisements through streaming/youtube.\nAnd as all sports, when it gets big enough, have open cash tournaments, etc etc.\n\nyou can also go the rich boy route (which I am personally against) and use money to buy better equipment, or buy an already levelled up character or something to this sort, again, game dependent.  I mean, LoL makes money by selling you skins. I can't imagine this to not work.\n\nAnyways, that is my idea, if you want to talk to me more about it, please, leave a comment, msg or email me.\n
1334198875|s5ixw|Battle Swarm: Field of Honour|So this game was freaking AMAZING.... buuuuut shitty player base and shitty Reality Gap screwed it over and its been shut down. qq.  you guys should check out some game play on youtube and maybe send some game companies an e-mail to buy the rights off of RG.  Basically this game was too intense for my brain so my head exploded....
1328448877|pbt29|Existence (definitely more an exploration of art in games)|Basically, the goal of the game would be to make interesting things happen.  Ever played adventure games (a la Monkey Island et al) where you're just trying to make SOMETHING happen, because it'll be hilarious?  Well, this. \n\nOnly, really frigging depressing.  The world is 99% greyscale and stylized so that everything looks really similar to everything else.  People don't actually have faces.  So on and so forth.\n\nThe player controls some desk jockey whose life is completely schedule-run.  A bit of overlay explaining the situation, and the only time you get to "play" at first is your lunch break.   Don't make something interesting happen in time, and you go to the next day's lunch break.  Some examples of what you could do include stealing other people's lunches and leaving the garbage in other people's cubicles (getting them fired), or finding ways to break company equipment (ie the fridge / microwave / coffee maker) and watch as other people's routines need to be adjusted opening new opportunities for you, or if you were particularly adventurous, walking around outside  and finding either dog feces or drugs.  Put the feces in a vent, watch the building get condemned after a week or so.  Major switch in the routine.  Plant the drugs on your boss, call the cops, watch him get fired, get promoted...\n\nBasically, become a total sociopath.  Use your ever-increasing (social / economic) powers to screw over other people, which inevitably results in you getting more powerful.  Lock your wife and kids in their rooms and burn the house down - hit on the secretary with red hair.  \n\nOf course there'd be a number of "mini-games" as well.  Get ahold of more money and start buying fancier houses / cars, which, of course, don't actually do anything.  Long "quests" with no real tangible reward, just some stupid aesthetic change you'll barely notice.\n\nBecome a counter-cultural icon and change the way pop music plays based on utterly meaningless choices you make.  Become the most successful businessman and drive to work in a Boeng 747 on the highway, just because you can.  Continually backstab and doublecross everyone you meet in order to meet new people with new and exciting ways to backstab and doublecross them.\n\nThe only way to "win" the game would be to get yourself elected as the head of the country, and pass a bunch of absolutely ridiculous and harmful laws.  Get yourself assassinated.  Otherwise, you keep playing the game until you run out of "interesting things to do" and stop playing.\n\nMy friend and I were going to make this in flash years ago, but then we lost the notes (long story).  Just thought someone else might get a kick out of the idea, even though it'll never be made.  Still have the theme song to it I recorded, though.
1329884546|q0g0r|Roguelike Revival: Roguelike platformer. Thoughts?|For those unfamiliar, a "roguelike" follows a few set standards: permadeath, randomly generated levels, randomly generated treasures (with notable exceptions), an enemy spawner based on the current level of the player, and a "high score" mechanic. The genre has led to the rise of such games as Skyrim and Neverwinter Nights, but these games have lost the focus of "roguelike" which put a heavy emphasis on exploration of the unknown, the thrill of not knowing what a treasure will be, or what an enemy will drop. I certainly miss the mechanic, but I understand that the gigantic worlds and DLC-ridden nature of these types of games would be rendered impossible with randomly generated treasures and landscapes.\n\nHere's my idea: why not mix this element with the old style platformers, a la Megaman X? The thrill of finding randomly generated items could be complemented by the speed and technique of the platformer genre.\n\nLet me just try and sell this to you for a bit. Imagine that your character generation consists of a stats-based roller. This determines your jump height, your health, your attack, your skill with certain weapons, etc. The only point of the game is defeating your "nemesis", at the bottom of the dungeon (let's say, 3000 feet for nostalgia's sake). Every time you go down the stairs, you get closer to this goal, while the enemies that spawn are increasingly tougher. Items you find are randomly generated, giving you increases to attack, accuracy, speed, jump height, etc. Some special "artifacts" would give you more abilities, like a wall-climb or a Portal-style gun. Certain enemies would be more affected by different attacks (melee, fire, ice, etc.). Overall, the only thing keeping you from going down and fighting your "nemesis" is simply surviving the 50 or so randomly generated levels between you and your goal.\n\nNaturally, certain "bosses" would stop you along the way, but they would never be in the same place, or even on the same level, at any time. They will move, they will try and sneak up on you. Perhaps they will call for help, or set a trap for you. These bosses would have a very high chance to "drop" valuable items, but again, the items dropped are randomly generated.\n\ntl;dr Platformer based entirely on roguelike elements. Thoughts?
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)

1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.

1323902606|ncyus|Who wants their ideas implemented?|Hello. I'm making a game. The idea of the game was making an easily-adjustable engine, then trying out a bunch of systems, and find one with the best feedback.\n\nTo this end, I need ideas. A lot of people have plenty of ideas and but can't code: this is for them.\n\nSome notes about the ideas: \n1) This is a turn based game\n2) I'm not going to do anything grid-based (although things like Kongai's ranges are acceptable)\n3) Nothing about aesthetics, graphics, non-battle systems. I am asking specifically about battle systems that require strategic thinking\n4) The limb-based system I currently have is available here: http://mrizen.com/flashy/WWHM.swf\n\nSo go on! Complex realistic limb-based systems? Weird magic rules? Huge damage calculations? It's up to you. Good ideas will be implemented within the week (Implemented being proof-of-concept things, not actually fully fleshed out games). Also, if you submit an idea, expect to playtest it (and the ideas of others), and give /constructive/ critique.\n

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

1332781978|refot|Game Idea: FPS (Hitman style) and/or top-down  game based on the movie "The Conversation" where the goal is to bug, video, and otherwise steal the information your clients demand. (Private Investigation Game)|For those who haven't seen [The Conversation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), it's a fantastic movie  based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\n\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same.  Sometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional mikes/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to.  All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them.  You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play.  And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n\nOK...now to check Steam's daily sale ;)\n\nedit: I'd personally love the same gritty, dirty, feeling of real life portrayed in that movie...
1333720700|rw98a|A game that takes google maps and let's you play them like fortis / pac man / other variation.|This game could\n\na) Access live/store-for-later-use sections of google maps (or similar) / your own imagery\n\nb) Interpret map, outlining blocks/houses/etc.\n\nc) Play the game (within boundaries you set) like Fortis, with paths only being between blocks (and some sort of map-suitable enemies added), points gained for 'businesses' captured, etc   OR Play a game of Pacman with dots placed along all roads/trails/paths/etc. (If multiplayer doable, allow you to race against friend, blockus style)\n\nd) If GPS data is available/3GS/etc, allow people to play 'pacman' or 'Fortis' live by walking/riding/driving to collect all the dots, etc. Perhaps an alternate to a scavenger-hunt race?  A way to encourage kids to exercise (and adults) - at least for those parents not scared by media to not let their children out of their sight :D; If multiplayer is possible, allow them to recapture their friend's areas, or battle their friends, as above.\n\nSUPER BONUS ALTERNATIVES (all based on the same image/map import/life-use):\n\n* Allow people to play RISK-style games (WarLight?), \n* Monopoly (buy various blocks/buildings), \n* Tower Defense (place weapons, each round, choose to release pedestrians/cars to reach enemy, who's towers attack your minions as yours attack his),\n* The Dots game (where you try to connect four dots in a square while your friend does the same)\n* Top down Tank game ala old Apple II Blockus game or the one in Tron\n\nThink of me if you make one of these or close variation :D  I'd love to be involved in some (non programming way).\n
1322148286|mnxpp|game idea: 1% riot defence|Quite similar to the tower defence games that we all know and love I present you my idea:\n1% riot defence puts you in the role of Monty McRich to regain Zuccotti Park. With endless (seriously!) resources you deploy cops in normal or riot gear, equip them with the latest gummi ammo or pepper sprays. But be careful, the 99% tend to build towers, march hand in hand and throw flowers on your mercenaries.\nBonus levels might include Fun(d)racers where you collect unattended money bag and book piles on a harsh race course through the dump formerly know as Zuccotti Park.
1314302904|judck|Abandoned: An adventure game|The game opens to a pixel art scene of a Regular-Joe office worker, the protagonist, exiting a bus and walking into an office building. He plods over to the elevator and starts to take it up. Another man in a suit is in the elevator, who, after a few seconds, stabs our hero right in the heart with a knife.\n\nThe screen fades to black, and then fades in to show our hero lying down in the middle of an underground cavern. A few dry bushes lie here or there but it is mostly empty.\n\nSuddenly, the man who stabbed you reappears, floating above your head. He explains very little, but mentions to "watch out for the natives." At his words, a man hiding behind one of the bushes, previously unseen, throws a dart at the floating man. With a wave of his hand, the dart stops, turns around, and shoots back towards the bush, which bursts into flames.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D MetroidVania adventure open world game. You eventually find that the complex cave system is inhabited by two warring tribes, designated by their red and blue colors. It turns out that the man who sent you here has been forcing people into the caves for years, and now there are over a hundred inhabitants.\n\nYou are given the option to choose whether you want to join the Red side or the Blue side early in the game. Each will allow you to get unique equipment.\n\nThe equipment is another large feature of the game: the relatively simply gameplay mechanics are paired with a very in-depth leveling system and equipment.\n\nMultiplayer is a large part, and at any point you can enter Battlefields, which are cave systems that are being fought over constantly. You can choose varying levels of risk-in certain Battlefields, you lose all of your items and money if you die, and in some you keep everything.\n\nThat's the basic outline-I would love to get the opportunity to make the game, but I'm not sure how I would really start; I have basically no coding experience, and I am in no way an artist :p

1319044519|lho12|MY idea for a new form of competitive gaming that can revolutionize the current e-sports market.|What I propose is a revolutionary way to make e-sports more main stream, more hardcore. My idea is just the competitive and outlet part, whomever can provide the game though, would make a killing.\n\nThe idea:\nThe game has a hardcore mode (think Diablo 2 hardcore). But you have to call it something awesome like, Champion mode, or Pro League, or something to that extent. Something to entice players who are really into competitive gaming.\n\nIn this mode, you raise a character (however the game determines) and battle them through rank style match making. If your character dies, that's it, they're dead and done and the player will be have to make a new one. The game will benefit MORE, if there are kill or injury damages and execution. This way, players can decide either through skillful playing or what not if their opponent can get another chance by not killing them. If there are spectator and live events, they can do the whole gladiator style where the spectators are yelling out "LIVE" or "DEATH". Now that'd make for some awesome live streaming events. The world can even embrace player honour and respect when a compassionate gamer decides to let his opponent live. Or be all douche bag and just rip their heads off. Whatever the choice, it'll still make for a great weekly story.\n\nThe next important step, is that the upper ranking matches should be recorded and streamed live and/or re-played on a youtube channel. This way, spectators can have an avenue to view these top level fights and see the progression of this e-sport.\n\nThe game that benefits most from this system?\nIt would have to be a spectator friendly game. 1v1 or team won't matter. It'll also have to be a game where true competitive skills determine the winner, where commentators can really break down the fight and describe or explain it from a very technical point of view. I'm thinking street fighter type of pace. A game where it takes multiple moves to get the killing or damaging blow unlike shooters where one shot can end a player.\n\nGreat money opportunity in my mind. I even have a great game idea to implement this, but I'd rather keep that to myself for now.\n\nYou can make money on advertisements through streaming/youtube.\nAnd as all sports, when it gets big enough, have open cash tournaments, etc etc.\n\nyou can also go the rich boy route (which I am personally against) and use money to buy better equipment, or buy an already levelled up character or something to this sort, again, game dependent.  I mean, LoL makes money by selling you skins. I can't imagine this to not work.\n\nAnyways, that is my idea, if you want to talk to me more about it, please, leave a comment, msg or email me.\n
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)
1314942734|k26hh|Survivor|So this isn't exactly a new idea. Elements of this already exist in games like Fallout NV, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and Minecraft. I'm hoping that Dead Island will also fit into this list.\n\nThe basic premise is "what if there was a game where the environment is more dangerous than the actual enemies?"\n\nThe setting would be something post-apocalyptic. It'd work well with zombies, in the style of Walking Dead, or it could be after a nuclear holocaust, or just about any of the other ways the world might come to an "end": deadly pandemic, climate change, asteroid strike, alien invasion... The common factor is that our cosy world where everything is provided for us in shrink-wrap has gone, and replaced by a world that is hostile to our very existence.\n\nIt's be an open-world game, where the only goal is staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nNow, even in hardcore mode, many people have observed how easy it is to find enough food and water to survive in Fallout: New Vegas. This makes sense when it's only a secondary game mechanic, but for Survivor it needs to be much tougher. Hunting animals should be a real challenge. They should run *away* from you, and try to hide from you, instead of attacking you. If an animal really does want to eat you, it should have a real chance of succeeding, otherwise it's basically a meat care package. You should have to stalk or trap your prey, (all the while avoiding being stalked yourself.)\n\nShelter would be another major consideration. This is where the Minecraft comparison comes in. There should be serious penalties for spending all your time exposed to the elements, and if you try going to sleep out in the open, there should be a serious chance of getting eaten. So you need to be able to build some kind of shelter, starting with something basic to keep the elements off you, and building to something that will actually keep you safe from all the creatures that want you dead. Or you could find some structure still standing from before the apocalypse and fortify it... providing someone doesn't already live there.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this idea, but I'd like to continue this in the comments, if that's OK. I'm starting to feel this is a bit of a write-only subreddit - maybe one of you other 22 subscribers could throw in some suggestions so I don't just feel like I'm talking to myself here! If so, I have a lot more to say about this game idea, the above a really very general thoughts.

1314296048|ju99h|"Realistic" shooter|I think there is an extremely long-standing problem in the genre of action games, going all the way back to the begining: The health bar. It's a useful gameplay mechanic to be sure, but I've always found it to be immersion breaking. I remember a big deal was made of Soldier of Fortune (and rightly so) because every enemy had a realistic damage model. You could shoot them in the foot and give them a limp, or even shoot the guns right out of their hands. But the health bar was still lurking: you could make a guy drop down dead by shooting him once in each foot and a third in the hand. And the player still had the old bog standard red bar for health, blue for armour with powerups to replenish them.\n\nNow, in the movies, the hero(ine) can take on a whole roomful of bad guys and survive because he's faster, more skilful; better at shooting people without getting shot. I'm thinking about The Matrix, Equilibrium, even Rambo. In games, the hero wins because he can survive multiple shotgun blasts to the chest without flinching. And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.

1317063018|ks2ta|My game idea for a strategy shooter|My idea for a game is a FPS war game that changes as you play. Instead of having one character you follow the unit you are with for each mission. When you die on a level that character is dead for the rest of the game and you respawn as another member of the unit. If all the soldiers on from your side die on the mission then your side has lost that mission and your situation in the war has changed. The game progresses and changes with each mission. Each mission has different objectives and consequences depending on the out come. If you have a defense mission where you are defending one of your bases and you lose then the enemy forces gain that base and can use it to launch other forays into your territory or you can recapture it later in the campaign. Alternately you could launch a raid on an enemy supply line and missions in areas that line serviced will be easier. The main goal of this game is to put the player at the head of a global campaign and to also give them the opportunity to change the tide of battle depending on their personal skills as a player.\nThoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n

And then afterwards, either pick up an handy first-aid kit (all first aid kits contain equipment to perform major surgery, right?) or lean against a wall for a few moments to get his breath back.\n\nSo here are some gameplay mechanics that I think would be more "realistic" (in the sense of not being immersion breaking or jarringly impossible) that would still allow the player character to be totally badass and mow down dozens of mooks at a time.\n\nOption 1: **Change nothing but the animation**. I remember reading in an old AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide that Hit Points are more a measure of someone's ability to avoid or minimise damage, rather than to survive wounds that would kill a horse. Video games could learn a trick here: when the game calculates that a bullet is about to make a red mist out of your skull, show a cool animation of the character somehow dodging the bullet at the last second. Reduce the "health bar" (which now represents something like luck) as if the shot had hit, until it's empty, at which point the next shot will actually hit and the player will actually die.\n\nOption 2: **Bullet Time!**. Give the player a realistic, fragile human frame, with realistic damage effects. Getting shot should have just as much effect on the player as it does on the enemies. *But*, make the player much harder to hit. Give him a bullet time gauge, *ala* F.E.A.R. that he can use to avoid getting hit. Maybe make bullet time auto-activate when an enemy has him dead-to-rights, maybe throw in some "spidey sense" to indicate which direction the danger is.\n\nOption 3: **Replace health packs or regeneration with actual medicine**: *This would work well together with option 2.* One of this things I loved about Far Cry 2 was when you'd get injured and have to dig out bullets with your combat knife, or snap bones back into place. But I think the basic idea could stand to have a little more complexity added without becoming tedious. What if instead of just picking up "medpacks" you needed morphine, bandages, needle and thread, antiseptic? How about making treating your injuries into a minigame? You'd need to apply the right medical supplies in the right order and in the right places (depending on the nature of your injuries) to restore yourself to fighting shape. And you wouldn't be able to do it under fire, you'd have to wait till the fight was over. Which scenario is more impressive: to get shot in the shoulder, pull the bullet out with tweezers and a mirror, pour scotch over the wound then close it up with a hot poker and bandages made of torn clothing then get up and kill some more **or** have the wound magically disappear because you drank a magic potion? And make no mistake, "medkit" in gaming is just a euphemism for magic potion.
1289633034|e5ihv|Magician's playing pool|I was out having some drinks and playing pool with friends. My friend made a shot which just got the the pocket but not quite, so jokingly I blew the ball into the pocket, and he goes, "It looked like you were trying to blow fire."\n\nAnd then, like a popcorn seed explodes immediately into form, a hilarious little game idea popped into my head. I doubt I'll ever make it myself, but I thought I'd share lest I at least amuse somebody.\n\nMagicians. Playing pool. \n\nTwo stereotypical 2d magicians pounce about a table. You go to take a shot, and just as your stick hits the cue ball time slows. Now you and the other magician navigate the table in a battle of wits. He casts an ice barrier, but you knew he'd do that, that's what they always do, so you prepared your ball with fire properties. It rolls through his ice, but the table is left with a slick property and your ball slides slightly off path. It's going toward a pocket, but now there's another ball in the way. You levitate the ball but miscalculate how long you can levitate a ball for and it plops back down into its way. The balls collide and as both magicians have run out of magic, time resumes speed and the ball takes its motion until it rests. \n\nHopefully I was able to give you a little fun mental image. A lot of details are left out, because my idea took more toward the form of inspiration than technical details, but I digress. :)
