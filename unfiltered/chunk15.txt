gdl6yp,Collecting colors,"Kinda like MegaMan but instead of getting the previous boss' powers you unlock more and more color scales. Every Sprite would be 1 bit in the beginning being made up of black and white only. When you continue to collect more color and the sprites would update and show your progress. Could make it so certain paths can't be seen without new colors and that's how it opens up. I'd picture it being a Metroidvania, but multiple games would fit this idea."
gdj1kt,Looking for mechanic ideas for 3D Top Down Shooter game idea I'm working on,"I started working on this game like a 50 days ago, just thought the idea after playing Hotline Miami, thought it would be cool to make a game like this and went along with it. \n\nThe player enters an endless building, has a minute to kill all enemies on the floor and has to get on the elevator, which takes him to the next floor, which is procedurally generated and player has to find the elevator, then next floor and so on, the game does not end as long as the player is alive.\n\nSo the player doesn't have enough time to make plans but needs to act and kill quickly, and with each floor there are bigger random levels, more enemies and more weapons for the player. But the levels are very basic, like a random shape for a level, some obstacles in the environment and 2 elevators (one which the player comes in, one player goes out with). If player can't complete a level in time, the Blackout begins and all lights are off until the floor is completed.\n\nAfter making a prototype I realized that there is not enough variety in the environment and enemies for a player to play this for maybe than 20 minutes, because each level goes like this: you get out of the elevator, shoot enemies whenever you see them and if you are going to die cover behind a wall and shoot enemies trying to aim behind the wall. I haven't much thought about environment just spawned some obstacle cubes to not die in the open areas. Maybe I could procedurally spawn rooms as similar to Hotline Miami.\n\nAnyway I like to hear your thoughts, I could also share a demo in here but its very early yet, so let me know what you think I appreciate your ideas :)"
gdhgy3,Fairytales: Covert Affairs,"This is an unpolished, basic idea I had for a game, so remarks and constructive critique are welcome!\n\nIn this game, you are cursed by a witch (you refer to her as evil witch) after you broke into her bookstore and trashed the place while being wasted! As a punishment, the witch sends you to the world of classic fairytales, because some fairytales in her store took a life on their own and deviated from the original story. Your quest is to use an assigned role (Huntsman, Good Fairy, Prince Charming) to find the deviants and correct them. However, discretion is of upmost importance to keep the fairytale world from collapsing even further!"

gdfa61,The Lonely Woodsman,"I've had a few sleepless nights lately and being off work has given me some time to come up with a few ideas. Im glad I've found somewhere to share them. I've fleshed it out somewhat so this post is huge, to get the concept across. I hope someone here finds this as inspiration! \n\nArt style: pixel art or low poly. \nGenre: Action RPG/ horror\nInspiration: Legend of Zelda/Soulsbourne/Titan Souls\n\nStory design/arch: You control a resident of a small town who is a logger. Your story starts in the woods, chopping trees when a storm hits and lightening strikes a tree. You investigate and hear voices, telling of the corruption within your village, the return of an vengeful spirit who wrecks havoc on people to feed off of their despair. The spirit grows stronger with suffering and you are sent to fight it, by alleviating the towns folk of their problems. Within the tree is an axe, left by another logger, now infused with the tree's spirit and power of the lightning strike. \n\nMechanics: along the lines of the original Zelda games, so essentially top down, perhaps the titan Souls perspective. This should make your character look small in a vast environment. \n\nYour only tool is an axe which is used as a weapon and for some utility. \n\nThe enemies in the game are only bosses, with multiple options to kill them (more on this later). \n\nYour character can swing the axe, as well as dodge in an inputted direction. Axe swings can be light or heavy with damage increasing accordingly, along with wind up time. \n\nYou don't level up, but there are multiple axes throughout the game with different stats. These are given for killing the bosses in certain ways, or completing quests in certain ways. \n\nI think to conceptualise the game properly it may be easier to give an example of a quest. \n\nQuest 1: Upon returning to the village you are met with multiple buildings which you can enter and some NPCs scattered around. (Think Pokémon red/blue style town). You enter a small building with a sign outside that reads ""Father Creedy"". Within the building you find a priest standing at an alter. He tells you that church has had to close, an evil presence has driven away his worshippers and the people of the village are losing faith. He asks if you can help and return he will offer you a blessing. \n\nWithin his house are some notes on a table, which explain that the church worships the spirit of nature, and a giant tree within the church is what the congregation pray to, as well as a note on the church bell which sits above the alter. These notes are designed as a clue (see boss battle later). \n\nYou make your way to the church (single exit from town with multiple routes on next tile, sign posts for different areas eg Church on sign of route 1). \n\nYou approach the doors to a huge church, but the door is locked. You search around for a way in. To get you must enter a crypt round the side, breaking a door with your axe. You follow a passage in the underground tomb, with incense burning and disturbing noises. As you approach the end of the corridor you hear ""Leave now!"" The background noise turns to silence and incense candles flicker dramatically. \n\nYou make your way inside the church and find a single woman praying at the alter. As you approach the screen flashes and the woman turns into a demon, with the appearance of tree roots wrapped around her, red glowing eyes. \n\nThe fight begins with the boss pushing you back with her root like arms, to the bottom of the arena and bottom of the screen. The screen is layed out as two sets of rows of pews, on the left and right. The demon appears at the top of the screen, behind which is the large tree from the notes earlier. On the tree is a red streak, indicating that it can be chopped. \n\nThe boss attacks by extending its arms down the centre of the two rows of pews. The character must avoid these attacks by moving up each row between attacks. Once at the boss it can be attacked. You can chop down the tree to inflict massive damage (but with consequences - see later). This begins phase 2 of attacks where the demon mixes attacks which go down the centre as before, but also a root attack that will run horizontally through the pews. The player must once again use the pews as cover as before, making their way to the boss. \n\nAfter a few phases a rope is seen beside the boss, which can be cut to the release the bell and destroy the boss. \n\nSo now you have three elements to the boss fight and a few ways that it could be killed. 1) you can cut down the tree, 2) you can kill it just with the axe, 3) you can kill it with the church bell. \n\nEach will have a separate consequence and effect the ending: 1) the priest is horrified that you cut down the tree which they pray to. You are vilified by the church and the priest curses your axe, it now deals half damage. 2) the priest thanks you and blesses your weapon, it glows blue and now has a short range aoe on swinging, 3) the priest thanks you and tells you that the old church bell had stopped ringing a long time ago. He blesses your weapon, it's glows bright blue and has a slightly large aoe range attack. \n\nOption 1 affects the ending, the others are neutral/good endings. \n\nFurther quest ideas/areas: the quests are linked to certain areas of the map, as will become evident. \n\ni. A farmer's cattle are being killed by the beast in the woods. Before boss fight you find a sheep that you have to protect and return to the farmer. Sheep dies = bad ending, sheep lives = good ending. \n\nii. A fisherman lost his son at sea, pulled in by a great sea monster. Once monster is killed, sons remains can be fished out of the sea. Bring back remains = good ending, don't = bad ending. \n\niii. A Smith's forge has been attacked and it's fire put out. Relight fire = good ending, don't = bad ending. \n\nYou get the picture. The idea is that you're not explicitly told about these good endings, there are hints that guide you to perform an action. \n\nEnding: to get the true ending you must complete all quests with the good conclusions. You will save the villagers and upon returning to the woods it will be spring. \n\nThe bad ending will see the village in ruins, with dark symbols around, and persistent storm. You return to the woods and see the tree from the start, now turned black with decay. Upon approach it tells you it can fight can repel the spirit for now but you must strike the tree's heart. You swing your axe into the tree and awake back in your own cabin. You get up to begin work once again, go to the woods and the cycle starts again. \n\nOverall theme: it's always a trope in video games where we are asked to help someone and end up destroying everything in our path without consequences. To complete the game you have to consider what the NPCs need in order to solve their problems, without damaging their entire world, or by helping them in some way. \n\nIn a game like dark souls for example, the NPC questlines are very well hidden and require you to really listen to them and also read lore in other places. You don't get anything from them by just ploughing through the game."
gdf0xq,Character naming idea : a banshee in a game made of irish mytholgy,"Hi all!\n\nI'm writing a story, that I'd like to adapt into a game later, if I ever manage to create my own studio.\n\nIt's about a teenage orphan girl discovering she's a banshee, allowing her to go to the Sidh (the world of the dead) which is a problem because long ago, humans and god thought. Humans won, got the real world, and gods got the Sidh, where they are forced to live now. But that banshee can cross between them, so she could bring gods back. The secret society of humans that know that is not happy and go after her.\n\nThat banshee is named Asna (that comes from Easnadh which mean something like ""musical sound"", and yes she's a banshee, she makes sound but nothing musical but whatever)\n\nBut I'd like to give her a family name and I don't know what.\n\nSo far I have Asna Kian, Cahill, Fionuir or Covley but they don't really sound good. If you have some ideas, then why not I'll see"
gdevvp,Horror game similar to Little Nightmares in terms of graphism and gameplay,"I had an idea of an horror game where you must evolve in a shop, but you are very tiny so the shop appears to be big. You have to find objects and combine them together in order to evolve in the story. All that while avoiding the monster.\n\nNow, details.\n\nPlot :\n\nYou are a detectice investigating missing childrens. Your evidences lead you to a shop and when entering it, you find a very empty shop with an old man at the counter. Upon talking to him, he explains you that his shop is not as glorious as it was and will soon close. As he doesn't want to lose everything for nothing, he propose you to take a selection of objects among the ones he till has. After your selection, you hear a noise, look behing you, and right before your eyes, you see a child running to hide in a little box. Suspicious, you look back at the old man, who appears a bit taller, more slender and with a large grin on his face, saying that you shouldn't have done that. Then he slaps you and you wake up in a cage, but you have the size of a child and the old man now in full monster mode, invites you to complete his game. If you want to stop him, you're gonna have to find a way to be adult again... \n\nMechanics :\n\nYou choose some objects among the ones the old man propose at the beginning, and you must use them, combine them to progress, unlock new locations etc...\nYou can only carry a limited number of items so you have to be careful.\nYou have to explore the shop from a tiny person perspective in order to find clues to know where to go and what to do to win, but the old man roams around and he'd better not catch you.\nIf he does catch you, he put you back in the cage and confiscate all your items, BUT there are places where you can hide items and retrieve them later. These places will never be touched by the old man, but you can only place a limited number of items there.\nWhat the old man confiscate can be retrieved but it's hard, you have to go to a room far away, that is well guarded.\nIf the old man catches you too many times, he considers you too dumb and eats you.\n\nGraphisms :\n\nI was thinking about something like Little Nightmares, 3D, not super realistic, but creepy, but I guess it could be done in 2D like in Fran Bow (I think of this game as it is creepy and has a item combination mechanics too)\nMost of the game would be made of still objects, only you and the old man would be animated.\nThe world has to be big, but not crazy big, the playing area is a shop after all.\n\nOther stuff :\n\nThere could be other children, mostly dead or crazy, but some of them could be sane and help you by giving you extra items. You could some crazy children commiting suicide to add to the sinister atmosphere and give a feeling that you're never gonna escape.\n\nOne more thing : you're a child so you can't run, can't to athletic stuff, so basically, if the old man is coming your way, hiding is your best bet"
gddohi,Paleoneos - Genre mashed game WIP,"I'll be updating this post occasionally. This is an attempt to organize a rather large and intensive game idea. I want to post here to drive discussion and prevent myself from creating in a vacuum. Warning, things are going to be VERY unorganized for a while as I add.\n\nInspiration from a lot of games. Just trying to fit the puzzle pieces.\n\nVERY VERY ROUGH, not even close to the whole idea. Compiling my notes but this may take a few weeks to fully flesh out or organize. I'm also very serious about this idea. I at the very least want to have it on paper even if it never gets finished. I take into account balance, aesthetic, gameplay, features etc. \n\n\---------------------\n\nMy Questions for the Community\n\nQ: I want a way for players to ""display"" certain things like fish in an aquarium but there also needs to be a reward for the player for doing so. \n\n\-----------------------\n\nGame Codename : Paleoneos\n\nNPCs and Characters\n\n* Monsters (Stats, Types, Abilities, etc)\n\nStats\n\nAuto Attacks and Auto Attack Speed/Cooldowns\n\nStamina/Mana (each move consumes a set amount of stamina/mana and may have cooldowns)\n\nStrength - increases atk, health, crit chance\n\nendurance - increases def, health\n\nluck - increases crit chance, drop rate\n\nWisdom increases m. def m. atk\n\nIntelligence increases m. atk, crit dmg\n\nFocus - increases Atk, crit dmg\n\nDexterity - increases spd and crit chance\n\nMoves - (Monsters may learn moves upon level up, observing other monsters, being taught a technique or training, increasing certain stats etc.)\n\nAbilities - (May be passive, may be activated via certain conditions or may provide utility outside of battle)\n\nTyping (A specific elemental base type that grants the creature certain buffs and nerfs depending on a myriad of factors)\n\nAffinity (Factors in buffs and nerfs based on its elemental typing, species type and current biome the creature is in. Ex: An amphibious water creature may have more damage, speed, etc in a lake or ocean or rain and even has a type advantage against fire monsters however they receive nerfed stats when in a hot desert or volcanic biome. Sort of a home field advantage thing.)\n\nHappiness (A factor that may change the adaptive route a monster chooses to undergo)\n\nStatus Effects (Burn, Poison, Paralysis, Blindness, Charm, Fatigue, Fear, Snare, Stun, Slow, Prone, Invisible, Intangible and perhaps more but these are the hard thought ones at the moment)\n\nWeight (A factor that may change the adaptive route a monster chooses to undergo)\n\nDiet (some monsters may have specific food preferences. what you feed them may have an effect on how they change over time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Villagers\n* Player\n* Camera and Controls (The camera is what I'm calling the player view. I like top down view at an angle but as the default. I think the player should have full range of motion and control of the camera but in specific areas limit that freedom should it be necessary.\n\n\-----------------------\n\nFeatures and Mechanics\n\n* Taming\n* Combat (upgradable weapons and tools? I'm thinking something like Ratchet and clank's weapon system. Cuts down on the novelty and really focuses on the utility)\n* Farming\n* Fishing \n* Crafting (may include voxel based world or simply more like the sims)\n* Cooking\n* Collection (Libraries, Museums, Community Centers, Aquariums, Zoos, fill it all up with the things that you found, bred for, captured, etc in order to unlock things. I quite like how animal crossing does its collection)\n* Breeding (currently compiling taxonomic tree. breeding will be complex allowing players to obtain monsters they may have a hard time taming in the wild or a new variant never before seen)\n* Multiplayer (will consist of a League of Legends style battle royal with monsters you've raised)\n* Life Skills\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\n\------------------------\n\nWorld\n\n* Towns and Cities (places of interest... yeah, that's all I got so far. Each town and city will be complex unless procedural generation makes it a bit more synergistic with the player experience). \n* Routes and Natural Landmarks (route paths connect linearly to towns, landmarks and other notable places of interest to make travel a little easier to navigate even if there is map. I want to emphasize exploration)\n* Wilds (The wilds are anywhere off the beaten path. Monsters appear here most frequently and the wilds may hide secrets and treasures)\n* Biomes (Each biome may have different weather effects or effect monsters' stats or may even present new hazards)\n* Day, Night - mostly to create times of day for different monsters to appear and \n* Seasons and Weather - affect a myriad of things like crop growth, monster adaptation, buffs and nerfs. \n* Terrain generation may take inspiration from Cube World's original terrain gen. Heavy interactivity. The player may mine, chop down trees, plant crops out here even. \n\nThe player will start in a blank area spawn point where the story loosly begins. From there the player can exit the expandable starting area which will eventually become a town, base etc and explore the wilds in a minecraft like fashion. Building is similar but more streamlined with more tools, ingame custom blueprints as well. The starting town is infinately expandable. This means paths may not be a thing. \n\n\---------------------------\n\nItems\n\n* Weapons\n* Armor\n* Tools\n* Seeds\n* Crops (player hunger, monster hunger, selling them, utilization for other things)\n* Fish ( you can breed fish and capture them via fishing rod and a minigame. you can also donate fish to the aquarium, feed them to your monsters, or sell them) \n* Materials\n\nEdit: Taking a break.. lol. Will be back later on tonight."
gddd2r,River Monster Fishing,"We've all seen the show ""River Monsters"" and it's awesome! Why not a fishing game where you have to go catch them? Who doesn't want to catch a River Monster that actually exist somewhere?\n\nFishing games are usually rather blah. I believe they can easily be spiced up. In a few easy ways.\n\n1. You can die in this game. These fish are.. monsters. They could pull you into the water and you could be drowned or eaten by piranhas or catch hypothermia. Alligators could run up on land you and eat you. Natives could come out the woods and eat you. (Just for the nostalgia you could die from dysentery)\n\n2. Too many fishing games try to make the experience authentic by overcomplicating the shit out of the gear items in an attempt to make it realistic (they have too many rods, reels, string, hooks, sinkers etc.) The hardest part of those game is picking the right gear. Fuck that.\nThat's over, River Monster Fishing is not about an authentic fishing experience, it's about having fun.\n\n3. This game is hard as the fuck. Hooking the fish isn't the hard part. The hard part is reeling it in and not dieing in the process. Also these fish are monsters so they take a long time to reel in. We're talking 15 minutes for the first fish, 2+hours for the final fish. (Maybe the game is in real-time so you can't pause it and take a break) Also on the last fish just to be an asshole you can program the game so that the first 2 times you try to catch the you're guaranteed to die. If you really want to go wild make this game reset to the first fish every time you die.\n\n4. Fishing games are underrated. Next time you have company over at your house turn on a fishing game and I'll bet you that everyone wants to try and catch a fish. Even people who don't play video games will want to catch a fish... but they likely won't because they will die from dysentery.\n\n5. Graphics don't have to be amazing, almost better to have more basic graphics. Does not need to be open world, all fishing could be done on the bank of the water or on fishing piers.\n\n6. I know fuck all about making video games. I never expect this to become a game. This is just a drunk idea I had and if you could actually help someone with any kind of idea for any kid of game that would be awesome.\n\nTldr: You died from dysentery."
gdcoc7,Horror Game Idea,"Sorry guys if this is the wrong flair but I don't know how these ones work so I chose this one.\n\nSo, my idea: What about a video game where you can control an iconic horror movie character and haunt/kill people? It would be a First-Person shooter sort of game, but you'd be able to choose first or third person view like in skyrim. You could choose several Maps from cities to farms to a single house, and enemy humans would spawn around the map.\n\nThey'd be worth points of course. Children would be worth 1, teens 2, adults 3, cops 4, and military 5. Elderly would also be worth 1.\n\nYou could hide in shadows, and under beds and in closets.\n\nCharacters would include Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Kayako Saeki, Samara Morgan, Predator, Alien, IT, Imhotep, and a bunch of others. Horror characters have a health bar, and can heal by taking souls.\n\nYou could also play as a human to try and stop the characters. They'd have a health bar, a fear bar, and a hunger bar.\n\nI think a game like this would be dapper."
gdcd1f,A game where you murder people using food - and try to clean the evidence by cooking it.,"  This is a simple idea in theory, not so much in execution.\n\n In this game, the player would have a target to murder using food. They might start with a baguette or a chicken leg, and due to the player's **W I L D  P O W E R**, it instantly kills the target.\n\n However, the police will be on the scene in 5 - 10 minutes. You have that amount of time to clean up the house and cook the food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid you kill with a baguette? Find a way to make French Cuisine!\n\nThe fun in this game comes from the creativity required, as it's more like a Puzzle in a sense.\n\nThe Baguette kill? You take the snails from the windowsill and cook them to make Escargot, and you take from the target's fridge to create a side-dish.\n\nThe game has almost no combat mechanics (You just need to hit the target to kill them), but has complex cooking mechanics.\n\nI'd expect this type of game to be in VR or a Job Simulator type of style, as it should only take place between at most 2 - 4 rooms. The walking mechanic would not be teleportation, but just normal walking."
gdb8qf,We're searching for a villain for our Story,"Me + 2 people in our team planing to do a 2D adventure platformer for a project at our University.\n\nOne of our ideas is:\nImagine a world where something or someone destroyed the colors of the sunlight/a prisma that is spreading the colors across the world and everything is black and white and sad now.\n\n-&gt; What or who could be the villain?\n\n- We don't wanna have a classic Mario and Bowser Story\n- The story could be funny and silly or deep and serious\n- Maybe something that is a reference to physics (since a prisma is a key element) would be nice? Maybe someone does know more about physics than we do. \n\nWe already got the idea of the player themself could be the one who destroyed the sunlight/prisma and now tries to repair it, but we're unsure. Another Reddit user had the idea for a zebra which is jealous of all the colorful animals and being the villain. We're thinking about combining these idea to the player themself being the zebra and learned to love themself and that destroying the colors didn't help them being happy. But we're not sure yet. \n\nAny ideas oder tips are welcome! :)"
gdaoov,3D Soccer Hooligan Beat em Up,"My favorite game of all time is The Warriors. I love hand-to-hand combat and beat em up games! But there’s not a lot of brutal, more grounded beat em ups any more. Batman games are the closest but they have you leaping and flying all over the place, or Yakuza which is still over the top. I thought it would be cool to have a beat em up that felt more real and weighted, like some combination of The Last of Us/The Warriors/Fight Night Champion. The story you play as a soccer hooligan, starting out by earning your rep with a firm, and slowly grow in respect and rank over time. You help build up your home base pub and recruit members, maybe there could by some kind of system where your buddies fight better when moral is up, so it’s good to party with them, lift wights, practice fighting techniques, and take take them on missions. You can commit petty crimes and bet on soccer games to earn more money. The primary mechanic though, is huge brawls with other firms. Up to 20 vs 20 at a time. You can set them up before hand, or ambush rivals in the streets. There’s a huge focus on brutal punching, kicking, and grappling. You can also use the environment and improvised weapons like bottles, cans, bricks, trash can lids, metal pipes, florescent light bulbs, small knives, brass knuckles, batons, and any random trash you find. Getting drunk is a huge part of the game also, getting drunk makes you stronger and take less damage, but it slows you down and maybe makes punches less accurate."

gd6amv,Wonder Woman open-world action-adventure fantasy RPG,"**I'd love an open-world Wonder Woman action-adventure fantasy RPG inspired mainly by Assassin's Creed, Batman: Arkham, and God of War. Here's an idea, feedback is welcome:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**All Inspirations:** *Assassin's Creed: Odyssey* (2018), *Marvel's Avengers* (2020), *Batman: Arkham* series (2009-2015), *Devil May Cry* series (2001-2019), *Doom* reboot series (2016-2020), *Dying Light* (2015), *God of War* series (2005-2018), *Iron Man 2: The Game* (2010), *Mass Effect 3* (2012), *Remember Me* (2013), *Marvel's Spider-Man* (2018), *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* (2006), *Tomb Raider* reboot series (2013-2018)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Concept:** When an otherworldly invasion unleashed upon Themyscira threatens to consume the Earth, a young, inexperienced Diana must become Wonder Woman to save her people &amp; humanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Setting-** Themyscira, while an island, would be the size of a small continent with varying regions (cities, villages, forests, beaches &amp; surrounding ocean, caves, rivers, waterfalls, ruins, mountains, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot-** Set in its own universe like *Arkham* (or possibly centuries in the *Arkham* universe's past, before Diana became Wonder Woman), young Diana is a princess in training but not yet officially a warrior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch like her New 52 source material, Diana was born ""gifted"". All of Themyscira attended at the palace to celebrate the birth of the Queen's child, whom Hippolyta deemed a treasure from the gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn this night, she decreed that every Amazon's sacred duty was to help ensure the princess' well being. Someday, Diana would lead her people. Until then, she was to be protected at all costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe would go nowhere outside the palace premises unsupervised and receive no unapproved visitors. Above all, no Amazon would ever tell her of her true heritage or the Queen's decree after her birth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe spent much of her time playing, doing arts &amp; crafts, helping her mom garden, playing hide &amp; seek, picking flowers, frolicking with butterflies and feeding animals (This was how Hippolyta raised her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese activities and occasional mischief, though mundane in appearance, serve as your first gameplay tutorials (movement, crafting, looting, item management, trading, demi-god senses, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA spoiled, sheltered girl overall, the princess boasted a curious mind, naive optimism, profound innocence, and enormous heart. Her favorite thing of all, however, was her mother's bedtime stories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiana absolutely adored her mother, respected her, idolized her, did anything she asked (except stay out of trouble), and saw her as everything she wanted to be when her day came to wear the crown.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever Hippolyta suggested, Diana insisted on falling asleep to the ancient tales of gods, heroes and monsters, including stories of the Queen's youth on the battlefield before she took the throne.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis grew concerning, as Hippolyta feared her daughter had too much of her mom in her and the last thing she wanted her child to be was a warrior. Nonetheless, Diana's mind was set on this dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn early childhood, it was doubtful whether she had the proper mentality to ever become a fighter. Her nature was uncommonly caring, compassionate, empathetic, and kind even for an Amazon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Queen forbade her from picking up a weapon or even watching the soldiers train. Young Diana had a rebellious side though (like mother, like daughter) and snuck off to watch every chance she got.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy prepubescence, she was routinely practicing the moves she witnessed with painstakingly detailed hand-carved wooden tools (sword, spear, bow &amp; arrows, shield) on various handmade targets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay &amp; night, she secretly trained in hidden spots like a secluded cave or behind one of the palace's waterfalls, under the guise of going out for walks (These would serve as optional combat tutorials).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNaturally, Hippolyta became suspicious over time and had her best guards tail Diana, breaking her promise to her daughter that she'd be allowed freedom so long as she remained on palace grounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, of course, her secret hobby was discovered despite her best efforts. Diana was only spared her mother's fury thanks to Hippolyta's general (directly inspired from the 2017 movie's Antiope).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing a passionate talk, Hippolyta conceded that Diana must learn to control her gifts someday. It would benefit her more to train under professionals vs. being confined to the palace like a prisoner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, the princess got her chance but it was bitter work. Defying even the general's expectations, teenage Diana mastered every skill &amp; challenge at an unnatural pace until young adulthood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn spite of demonstrating her prowess time after time though, she was limited to non-lethal sparring (optional advanced combat tutorial). This quickly grew obsolete, as no soldier could match her power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, her experience stagnated. Regardless, Hippolyta felt that her daughter was not ready, for the physical abilities from her demi-goddess blood were also the source of her greatest weaknesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very compassion and willingness to help others (even at risk to herself) which made Diana beloved among her peers, combined with those superhuman abilities, made her prone to recklessness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all changes when, unbeknownst to the gods, an unknown foe somehow overthrows Hades and suddenly unleashes the Underworld's undead &amp; demons onto Themyscira via countless portals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs chaos spreads like a wildfire, bloodshed visible from afar, Hippolyta orders Diana to stay safe and prepares her armies for the Amazons' first war in centuries. Units spread out to fight the creatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, it quickly becomes apparent that this is a losing battle. Like *Game of Thrones*' White Walkers, the Underworld's hordes are simply too many in number and unrelenting like a flood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorse, any Amazon killed by an undead or demon's hand soon re-animates to join their ranks. Within hours, the mayhem reaches the palace and Hippolyta is forced to aid in defense on the front line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir forces are systematically overwhelmed until a powerful assault of enemy fire brings the palace entrance down. Diana screams as both Hippolyta and the general are gravely wounded in the impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelping the Queen to her feet, the general then orders Diana to flee with her mother and survive no matter what. If she dies, the future of Themyscira is lost. Against Diana's protests, the general charges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeft with little choice, Diana obeys and carries Hippolyta away in her arms, watching her former teacher single-handedly cut down dozens of foes in a final display of Amazon glory, her roars echoing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInevitably, however, she too disappears into the flood. Diana narrowly escapes with Hippolyta to a hidden tomb of their ancestors beneath the palace, which functions as a well-supplied safe-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlacing her mother down and using medicinal herbs to help her heal, Diana waits but cannot stand the screams and cries of her people's suffering above (detectable to her demi-goddess ears).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving had enough of being protected, she takes matters into her own hands. Hippolyta attempts to forbid this, but Diana sternly argues that her mother can't tell her what to do in her current condition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll her life, she's only wanted one thing: To serve her people, after they've given so much to her. What kind of princess, let alone Queen, would she be if she hid while their people keep dying for her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides, no matter how many demons they kill, it makes no difference unless they find a way to close the portals to the Underworld. If this continues, the entirety of Themyscira will soon fall to the hordes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce that happens, it's only a matter of time before they spread out to conquer the rest of the Earth. No army or weapons in ""Man's world"" could help them defeat an enemy the Amazons couldn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only way to stop this is for Diana to journey across Themyscira to the underground vault hiding their magical treasures: Items, tools, weapons and armor bestowed upon them over eons by the gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly the worthiest are permitted to enter. It is here that she will uncover her destiny, locating the iconic magic armor and introducing herself to the world for the first time as Wonder Woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn this quest, she must close every portal, enter the Underworld, save Hades (They know he's alive. Or else, the whole cosmos would be out of balance) and confront whoever or whatever is behind this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnowing she can't stop her determined daughter, Hippolyta warns the princess to be careful and gives Diana her most powerful weapon (an enchanted sword). They then share a tearful, loving farewell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGearing up in what little armor she could scavenge from around the tomb, including an old shield, Diana promises to return for her mom once this is all over before leaving &amp; locking the safe-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, traveling on her own beyond the palace grounds for the first time, this princess must become the savior she's meant to be and join the fight to deliver her homeland from this mysterious crisis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exploration-** Diana travels to hundreds of locations to fill out the game map at the player's own pace, visiting parts of Amazon society she's never personally seen before (living as royalty at the palace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe can travel on foot, horse, small boat (only in Themyscira's surrounding waters, not open sea) or swim. She may hunt for food &amp; resources, but stealth isn't emphasized like *Arkham* or *Assassin's Creed*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong the way, she'll face a wide variety of enemies and/or environmental obstacles, help innocents, make friends and recruit potential allies to help in her quest, including assistance from even the gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGaining the Lasso of Hephaestus lets you continually swing across structures &amp; buildings similarly to *Dying Light*'s grappling hook or *Spider-Man* (PS4), albeit with only one ""rope"" instead of multiple ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the map lie hidden Underworld gateways, comparable to portals in the new *Doom* series or *TES: Oblivion*. Unlocking flight helps you reach any area far quicker, though fast travel is available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leveling &amp; Crafting-** Branching skill trees allow freedom to diversify abilities however you wish. You can wear &amp; customize nearly any Amazon outfit or armor (Ex- *Mortal Kombat 11*, *AC: Odyssey*, *Skyrim*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost regularly used items &amp; resources (weapons, armor, arrows, consumables, etc) are created via crafting, looting, or buying them. This system also allows upgrading weapons &amp; armor as you level up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Combat-** This is very similar to elements of the template for *Assassin's Creed: Odyssey*, *Batman: Arkham*, or *Marvel's Spider-Man* (attack, counter, dodge, block, etc) but with a few meaningful differences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Amazons' fighting styles are fundamentally different from Batman's martial arts. They're more brutal, gritty, direct, offensive, and obviously gory (somewhat like *Shadow of Mordor* or *The Witcher 3*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile hand-to-hand is an option from the start (upon finishing the prologue) and gains XP, Diana isn't strong enough yet to do a lot of damage that way against non-human foes in the early game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour smaller health also won't allow you to take nearly as many hits compared to late-game. You're welcome to challenge yourself, but playing that way would be a long uphill grind to progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's encouraged to place more emphasis in the early game on mastering the rhythms of different melee weapons and bows, each having their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and durability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery tool (dagger, sword, axe, hammer, throwing blade, spear, mace, lasso, shield, etc) has its own combos. The lasso in particular adds ranged attacks, disarms, and aforementioned traversal options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeveling up improves Diana's base-traits. You can switch between ground &amp; aerial combat seamlessly. A lock-on feature helps target specific enemies within free-flow movement (similarly to *Devil May Cry*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost weapons allow a lethal or non-lethal attack option once an enemy's health is low enough. Ex- Against a human opponent, you can choose to kill them in a bloody execution or just knock them out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Enemies-** Most lower foes are humanoid undead, including re-animated corpses of Diana's fallen Amazon sisters. Higher-tier enemies include demons, monsters, and even other demi-gods or deities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOccasionally, you'll be confronted by living Amazon soldiers who are uninformed of the situation and blame you &amp; Hippolyta for what's happened (Ex- Offending the gods by leaving your palace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese Amazons generally mean well, only acting out of fear or anger from how the crisis has affected them + loved ones they've lost. Nonetheless, you can't let anyone stand in the way of your mission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDialogue usually allows an option for Diana to reason with fellow Amazons or persuade them to her cause (persuasion can be upgraded with successful dialogues), but not everybody will be swayed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Underworld Gates-** These function very similarly to a combination of the *Doom* reboot series' gore nests &amp; secret encounters + *TES: Oblivion*'s portals. Getting near a gate activates a demon welcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon defeating this smaller initial party defending the gateway, you enter and navigate different Underworld levels with unique loot + resources until reaching a conduit keeping the portal open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDestroying it activates further enemy waves. These will increase over time in difficulty, group size, and eventually involve mini-boss and/or boss fights. Lastly, escape the portal before it closes and you die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith every gateway sealed off, the status of Themyscira gradually improves with noticeably less destruction, more grateful Amazons coming out of hiding, and fewer hordes of enemies roaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch like the portals' Underworld levels, however, this will also lead to more challenging foes appearing around the map to attempt claiming your life or at least hindering your progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Weapons &amp; armor-** Non-magical items (weapons, shields, armor) wear down over time with damage, needing repair to avoid breaking. Most magical powers &amp; tools lose energy until needing to recharge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink of that like *Breath of the Wild*'s Master Sword. Experimenting with different tools &amp; styles unlocks new moves for unique combos (Ex- *Remember Me*) that use up to three weapons in rapid succession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpgrading your magic skills high enough will let you craft enchanted weapons &amp; armor. Like *Assaasin's Creed: Odyssey*, you can also craft multiple arrow types (fire, poison, explosive, enchanted, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's up to you to build your own dream version of Wonder Woman. You want a Diana who specializes in  hand-to-hand brutality? Swords, shields and spears? An archer that would make Lara Croft jealous?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe you prefer a master of flight who yanks enemies into the air with her lasso (similarly to Spider-Man with his webs) for aerial combos or rains explosive arrows from above? The choices are vast!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerfecting one field (melee, archery, defense, magic, flight, etc) or building a well-rounded Diana is up to you. You won't unlock everything in one playthrough, but can continue leveling skills in New Game+.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Powers &amp; Magic-** While not having her potential maxed at the beginning, Diana starts off with several demi-goddess traits: Superhuman strength, speed, endurance, durability, reflexes, and senses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese help her fight, detect enemies like Batman's detective vision or *Assassin's Creed*'s eagle vision (This can be switched off), interact with other magical objects, or remove environmental obstacles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese may include moving trees, boulders, walls, etc. Certain obstacles are too difficult for Diana to force her way through and must either be solved with magical quest items or ancient puzzle solving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny weapon can do damage, but human foes (Ex- Undead) are generally weaker. Non-human demons require magic to do significant damage without a long grind (or breaking multiple weapons).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same goes for magical armor, to offer increased protection, enhancements to certain abilities, or resistance against specific effects. Diana starts her journey with only an older shield &amp; light armor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer first weapons are a basic bow, dagger, and one enchanted weapon (her mother's sword). You earn other items via quests &amp; XP, becoming Wonder Woman by the finale with all her iconic abilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Lasso of Hephaestus is arguably your most valuable multi-purpose tool, a wonder-weapon that functions as defense &amp; offense in one, capable of being used from close, middle or long range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnbreakable and needing no recharge time, it will grab and pull almost anything you target toward you (certain loot, key items, obstacles to remove, enemies' weapons &amp; shields, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's usable in ground or aerial combat (with upgradable moves) to trip targets up, send them flying, pull them closer, throw them into each other, or stun one and probe their mind's secrets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompelling specific enemies to tell the truth will grant you information on new map locations of interest (enemy bases, portal locations, loot, etc). You are then free to knock out or execute them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Apologies for the long length, but these are all the best ideas I can personally think of. Comment below, what do YOU think? What would you want a Wonder Woman game to be?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n✊ **#HeraGiveMeStrength** ⚔️"

The point of the game is for the hiders to defuse 3 towers which will be set up by the taggers. Any ideas on anything to add or to change about the game? Please let me know.
gd0ltk,this subreddit in a nutshell.,omg my dream game!\n\nI wonder if any lonely game developer can make this aaaaa game?.\n\nanyway I am going to flood this subreddit with games that even ea with all of itd stolen money can't dream of making.\n\n.
gczj34,A Alien game where you start as the little face huger emerging from the egg and work your way up to an alien.,"The idea being you then use that alien to kill something bigger, like a Predator, which then gets used to make an even more powerful alien which you then control. \n\nThere’d be a skill tree to change your alien (e.g. thicker plating meaning you can take more shots, smoother plating so you can sneak around faster and quieter, etc.) however some skills are unique to the alien variant (e.g. a predator alien has in-built heat vision to track down prey).\n\nThere’d also be abilities exclusive to evolving (e.g. a alien Matriarch would be impossible to kill by bullets and only weak to fire)."
gcyzny,Food Truck Driver,"A combination driving/cooking game.  You drive your truck around the city to pick up ingredients, dodging obstacles and traffic.  You're also cooking things in the back as you go and need to time things properly so you get the right dishes ready at the right time to drop off at target locations.\n\nThe goal for gameplay is looking at a map of ingredients around the city, as well as orders for different dishes at various locations, and thinking about how long different things take to cook and what ingredients they need, and trying to adapt on the fly as things (probably).  (Like slamming into a wall causes some of your ingredients to go flying away out the back)."

gcvkf4,Asymmetrical Online Multiplayer Horror game inspired by The Thing,"The game starts with a team of Scientists arriving to the Antarctica Research Facility in order to find and defeat the Alien. The game starts with one player as Alien and the rest as Scientists. Number of players who are Alien can increase or decrease as the game goes. The win condition for Scientists is either destroy the Alien completely or escape with helicopter with no Alien inside the helicopter. \n\nAliens can infect other Scientists who then switch their sides to the Aliens. After a player is infected he is in still human form but now he has intolerance to the heat (and maybe more subtle characteristics that give away they are infected). A testing kit reveals whether a human is infected by testing their blood against the heat. There are limited testing kits in the environment, so Scientists need to take risk and explore the environment in order to determine who is evil.\n\nAfter one player is confirmed to be infected (or not) other players can decide to burn him using a flamethrower. After being burnt it is revealed to everyone if the person was infected or not. If the person was not infected, the person who burnt him can not use weapons for the rest of the session.\n\nInfected humans can decide to do two things: Transform in the alien form, now they are faster and can kill humans with slashes but can no longer go back into the human form and their stealth advantage, or stay in the human form and sabotage other Scientists. \n\nSabotaging includes:\n\nBreaking snow cars, Scientists can use snow cars to travel fast between buildings, walking in the snow is slow.\n\nBreaking generators, which causes blackout. Now Scientists need to find and use Flashlights to traverse around the map.\n\nBreaking radio towers, delays helicopter rescue to the Alien has more time to infect others.\n\nThere is a lot more in my mind but I first want to hear your feedback, let me know what you think :)"
gcszgc,"An open world game where you can do whatever you want, similar to FiveM","Get me right, I know that game developers have limitations when coming to creating a game, but I feel like no developers have thought of this and I don’t get why because it could generate so much revenue similar to how GTA 5 did.\nSimilar to how that advert for “RAW” was, this game would be a large map with different terrains, and have the ability to spawn in different vehicles and objects and do what you want, similar to FiveM.\nI was looking at some developers, and I believe Ubisoft are the most likely for this and most able. They have proven that they can generate large maps, evident from “The Crew 2”, but also maybe that would be too big. The “Watch Dogs 2” map I feel would be around the right size if we want constant Player on Player interaction, but if you want it closer to a Roleplay feel, use the Crew 2 map.\nEverything else what would be in this game is already in FiveM and would just need to be transferred.\nThe way of making money in the game would just be by living and doing your job and eventually save up, but if u constantly change your job, you don’t get paid. To stop people only having jobs what pay the most, your job will limit your actions and yeh things you can buy.\nFor the developers to make money off of the game, it would be like anything else. I’d say you could have crates what give you limited loot, and also sell in game money for real life money for the people who don’t want to work for it, and it would be “pay to win” because the game isn’t competitive.\nI think I covered everything but if I haven’t I’ll comment them"

gclp4s,Game w/ bad mid-2010s scratch/stickpage artstyle and XDrandom humor that slowly progresses into an atmospheric horror game,"   You know that artstyle that looks like ASDFmovie that ran rampant throughout youtube of the mid 2010s? What if there was a game where you exist in a world with that artstyle and shitty ~random~ humor from that era and as soon as you spawn in, you explore this pretty small but open world with no tutorial or anything and eventually, the more you progress, things get slightly stranger and stranger, like somethimes the characters are just missing a couple fingers or their dialogue is kinda uncanny. These little occurrences happen more and more often as you explore until it eventually devolves into pure chaos. There’s no way to die, but you can pick up and throw things using the opensource Unity gravity engine. There are no jumpscares, and all the horror comes from the atomsphere alone."
gckz3f,Survival first person shooter with some other game elements.,"First person shooter game.\nSimilar Codzombies vibe\nSimilar codExtinction vibe\n\nRefined to a standalone game, and more improved.\nA survival game where you have maps that are large, filled with quests and to do stuff, to survive longer, with the main objective being to Finish the map (each map is different)\n\nYou have Perks scattered around the map, sinilar to cod zombies, if you purchase it, you get perks like more health, faster fire rate, etc.\n\nYou have unlock skill tree, every match you start with 3 skillpoints, and after every certain ‘wave’ or special zombies kill you gain skillpoints to spend on the tree.\n\nThe tree has many upgrades to your soldier as a ‘player’\n\nYou can choose path between dealing more damage, doing objectives slightly faster, earning cash slightly faster, and so on.\n\nYou gain cash for killing stuff, you can spend them on random spots in the map to purchase stuff such as special type of lethals, tacticals, ‘powerfull killstreaks’ and so on.\n\nGuns are NOT purchased through choice, but also in some type of ‘mysterybox’ \n\nGame should NOT feel the same as zombies jn rerms of survival where you expect the same thing, you will be bombarded by different types of enemies and jn this game there isn’t a ‘too much’\nYou’ll pretty much get attacked by zombies first and throughout the match more dangerous stuff will head your way to kill you.\n\nMap should also feel UNIQUE.\nEach map will have its OWN itemsc buildables, objectives, etc.\nI think it would be neat to have the shiled be a buildable like it is in codzombies, where you have to gather 3 parts and put them in a crafting bench to equip.\n\nLOADS of crazy weapons, don’t forget this is a first person shooter game, we go from 1911’s to Ak47’s to a kraken themed gun that shoots out... different, more scary stuff to elimenate the zombies.\n\n\nHow does this sound to all of you?\nImo the reason how I came up with this is I asked myself why I played zombies alot back in the days and stopped playing I discussed with my friends and after thinking and giving some people this idea, they liked it alot and I think there is potential, replayability would be amazing with so much things to do."
gci1qk,Game launcher,"Hey guys, so this isn't really a game idea but I think it totally fits here. So my idea is simple, you create a laucher for games. I know what you're thinking, we have Steam and Epic and blah blah. But this could be something any developer could sign up for and with a few lines of code they give the laucher permission to see how many people are online. So I went online the other day and looked up free online multiplayer games. Some looked really good, however there were no people online. And I know people are willing to play these games because people have got parties together to play older games with few people who still play.\n\nThe whole purpose of it would be to login to the launcher and it would tell you who else is online, what games they want to play. So let us say I want to play an old COD. I could be online and when people look at the active list they will see that I have that in my wishlist. If we both have the same games or if one of us wants to try one of their games we can ask them to play with us. I think this would be a good way to get people to play nostalgic games they would have never been able to play again otherwise. You play my favorite childhood game and I'll play yours.\n\nKeep in mind that the launcher doesn't actually launch many games. It's more of a ""see who's online"" sorta thing. But I'm calling it a launcher because many of these games would probably be browser games that you could launch from within the app. This app could be on all platforms, if possible of course. There's nothing stopping you from being on your phone, noticing someone else also has Quake 3 in their wishlist, and hoping online with them. There could be a simple messaging system and an auto translation system for people who speak different languages. \n\nLet me know if there's anything like this already. Or of it's a dumb idea. But if it is please tell me why"
gchq8b,First-person MMORPG focused on skill," \n\nThese are just ideas, I would appreciate criticism as well as different class ideas that fit the premise. \n\nI have been searching for a good first-person MMO and I cannot find one. I've been thinking about something that might even be translatable to VR. I'm sure someone has come up with the idea before because of sword art online. I really want to find a first-person MMORPG that I can relax at some point and view some scenery as well, or grind in such a way that is pleasurable. Being able to relax in a game that requires skill-based combat would be pleasant for me.\n\nCooldown MMO's require good planning and genuine strategy sometimes, but a lot of them are pay to win. Though I'm not sure how much money my idea would make, I believe it would be fun. Mordhau has some incredibly intricate movements that make it way too hard to start the game. If there was some way to simplify it a little bit to make it easier for players, I think it would do well for PvE. Having more skill-based combat rather than abilities on cooldown seems pretty unique to me.\n\nThis would be way too big of a project for any studio, but either way, my imagination loves this\n\nNone of these ideas would be close to complete and need a little more brainstorming from people other than me. Different names are also welcome to these classes.\n\nClasses\n\ngauntlets?\n\nI love the idea of MMO’s because it’s nice to feel like you are working with people. I also love shooters, and by far my favorite one is overwatch. While being in first person for me, it makes me feel more like the character. It feels great to work with people, and being able to use different abilities makes for fantastic variety. Something that I think might translate over well from the game is the hero “Doomfist”. You can perform different combos based on his already provided abilities, but they require skill and some precision for the targets. This could be used as a model for a brawler, or a hero with gauntlets. An ability to approach or attach, then after approaching you can perform a combo with the other close-range abilities you would have.\n\nNecromancer\n\nThere are not many MMORPGs that make necromancer a choosable class and that is for a good reason. Necromancers are fairly difficult to balance, and the ones that I’ve seen have been criminally underpowered. I do not have a great idea on how to incorporate this into the first person skill genre, but very open to ideas. One thing I think would be kinda fun, is rather than raising the dead all the time, you could have a select number of dead you keep. You can name these dead and treat them as people if you would like. These dead would level up with you. They would take mana to keep up, and the more damage they would take, the more mana it would suck up. Translating this to skill-based combat is hard, it’s not like you can just make AI that will go up with your personal skill. It’s hard to make AI that will also understand mechanics made by players. I think you would have to keep them at a set level of understanding of the game. This could be like the chess player’s character. The movements would be easy to read and understand from a skilled player but would be difficult with the right plays. The dead wouldn’t just be one type of dead either. You might have a mage or a warrior. This would most likely be the hardest character to incorporate as well as make animations for. This character’s movement ability could be switching places with one of the dead with a large mana usage. \n\nSwordsman\n\nThis would be a character who could choose what kind of sword they might want to wield. Longsword, shortsword, and dual wield. Those are only the different types of stances or holds on swords. There would be many different types of swords with slightly different abilities or maybe just different skins for the sword This choice would give some freedom to the player for how they want the game to play. They could be a tank with a longsword, or if they wanted they could be a pirate with a scimitar skin/sword. The swordsman movement ability could be a dash forward stopping at their target, then as they level up it upgrades to one that can slice through more than one. This could make it so that if they were surrounded and needed to flee, they could go through targets. Another ability could be a slide. After sprinting, these guys could execute a slide and go into an attack. They could just slide as a form of movement ability, help them become close to the enemy, or an extra form of evasion. Strong hit and weak hit can be the base for most of the combos.\n\nHealer/support\n\nWhen playing in a party setting, sometimes it is quite fun to heal or support. People rely on you to perform your duty. Though it may seem like you are doing the most as far as killing a boss, you are still useful to the team. The healer would have abilities to help them run away as well as buffs they could apply to their team. Buffs could be an increase in mana, damage, etc. Running away is very important for this class. This class would not do greatly in duels or 1v1s, but detrimental during a “raid” or boss fight. \n\nthere are a lot of classes that are hard for me to think of ways to translate them into first-person skill-based combat. very open to suggestions.\n\nMovement and dodging\n\nAs far as swordplay and dodging go, I think to simplify some of the movements from mordhau to buttons rather than advanced mouse movements. I do enjoy some of the techniques such as “dragging” from the game, and I believe it would be cool to see some players come up with tech like that. Of course the developers cant find all the techniques and balance patches would need to be put out for something that would be too unpredictable or overpowered. Using game sense as well as prior knowledge, players can come up with their own efficient ways of fighting. \n\nManeuverability in games is a must-have. Each character class should have some sort of movement ability, and close combat types must have more than one. The ability to approach a class that is long-range would be essential for short-range classes."
gcgxtm,Rules?,"can we reference mechanics in other games to aid in imagery, and include similar ones in our own?"
gce0du,Gta like game but you can do anything,"So I have the dream of a game like this from when I was a kid, I always wanted a game where  you can do literally anything. For example gta combined with a hotel builder simulator like you need to make money working at a bad job then going to build a hotel for example, or being born in a wealthy family and go shopping or anything. This would be a combination of multiple games like sims, tycoons and gta. I think you get my idea, or travel by plane in big cities of big countries. I don’t know if it’s just me but I’m waiting to play a game like this for at least a decade and I’m hoping I will get to play one like this at least until I die :)) A real life simulator created by a company with a big budget like rockstar."

gcbzxm,Hivemind - (Starcraft meets Battleship),"Two players get a fairly large grid to play on, overlaid on appropriate scenery, and the main objective is to take down your opponent by interacting with their grid.\n\nEach player has a 'Mother' that they place anywhere on their own grid. The bigger they make it, the more bonuses they start out with--because the bigger it is, the more they are at a disadvantage. If the mother is hit by other player, they win (practically).\n\nTL;DR -- (battle-ship style) uncover enemy buildings, find resources and research eggs that hatch creatures and attack the other player when hit. \n\nOf course, you can't see the mother, nor can you see other things you build. You build other buildings that bring more advantages. \*\*\*Basically its like if Battleship was played progressively-- you start out with one tiny boat, then you collect resources to build the other boats. All while taking shots (in this case, uncovering things) on the other grid in a non-turn-based mechanic (you can shoot the other side as long as you have energy to do so).\*\*\*\n\nEnergy is built up through buildings that generate it and by finding resources on the other player's grid. Each grid has crystals (or something)-- visible to only the player of that grid-- that can't be built on and are there for the purpose of the other player shooting them and harvesting them.\n\nAnother important feature is the egg. You research and build eggs that you place around on your grid. If the other player attacks that area (which they wouldn't do on purpose of course, they just can't see them), they hatch and attack their own grid. \n\nThere's many different opportunities for this type of game. I only listed a few ideas that will be implemented."
gc9i2m,A Souls-Civ adventure,"A game based around the idea of a small invading ""army"" (Viking-esque) invading and attempting to conquer other lands. The added mechanic being that the ""level"" progression of the game would logically correspond to the land's expected reaction to them being invaded. (e.g. First contact level, you and your tribe descend on a small village under the jurisdiction of country X. -&gt; level 15, you encounter country X's proper military for the first time after 3 towns have been invaded, etc.) Previously concurred villages/towns can have attributes associated with them concerning how easily you're able to recruit new soldiers from them. \n\nThe game could start in a type of Souls-style combat where you're likely the head of a small band of soldiers but gradually evolve into a more Civ gameplay style depending on a mix of NPC interactions and character stat upgrades."
gc6cl4,New explanation to zombies (and superpowers),"The explanation ?  intelligent bacteria.  \nKnow how a brain works ? there's  neurons, there's  nerve impulses and synapses, this bacteria works like that, a bunch of bacteria stays connected, stores information, and communicates, the bigger the blob, the smartest it is.  \nOur brain receive information from our senses, the bacteria has some microscopic senses, the knowledge it holds usualy has to do with microscopic stuff, like physics, chemistry, biology.  \nSometimes a single bacteria separates from the rest, live for some seconds (or minutes idk) on the air and die, or it lands on organic material and starts a blob from scratch, or it lands on a living being, be confused with the nerve impulses it have (the nerve impulses the bacteria use ARE identical to the ones from brains) and after some time it works along the live being.  \nNow, about superpowers, if the single bacteria had knowledge on fire when it was on a blob, and connects with a live being, it will pass knowledge about fire, and will attract other bacteria with fire knowledge, eventually the live being will consciously KNOW how fire works microscopicaly, and he will start fires with his mind (with the bacteria) or will touch fire without hurting and so on. The same can be said about air, water, super strenght, regenerative powers, and others, all connected with knowledge and control of microscopic stuff. Normally the body's defenses of the live being kills the bacteria, so this connection is pretty rare.  \nNow, about zombies, first, every animal who becomes too much deformed because of the bacteria acts like a zombie, he loses sanity and instinct, don't recognize animals from the same species, the bacteria controls the brain. second, a lot of people who had regenerative powers or other biology related powers will revive like zombies, that's the bacteria taking control.  \n\n\nWell, i see this intelligent bacteria idea as a great oportunity to make magic more based on science, in my mind the game will be a hack and slash, the protagonist have wind powers, and a really big and really slim sword, like a metal sheet, but not so thin, who will cut things with ease, and also will block/deflect atacks"

gc2flz,"Strategy game: start with end game tech, end with early game tech","In every strategy game I can think of, as the game progresses you get more powerful. Your troops improve, your tech improves, and your resources increase. Take the total war games, you start with one or two provinces and basic militia troops and by the end of the game you control most of the map and you’re rolling out the most elite troops available to you.\n\nWhat if you decided to flip that on its head, would it be fun? At the beginning of the game every faction starts at their peak tech level, with their best troops, and seemingly limitless resources. As the game progresses your factions tech level goes down, the quality of your troops decreases, and your resources become increasingly limited. As the game progresses you’re being forced to learn to do more with less. This seems to make sense. The longer someone plays a game, the better they get at it. By the end of a campaign, you’re probably pretty good at the game. Meanwhile, the game, through regular tech progression has also supplied you with the best tools to beat the AI. Maybe at this point some of these games become too easy. Starting out with the best tools available to you and having them slowly stripped away could be a more natural progression to late game gameplay and could maintain the level of difficulty better.\n\nWhy is the tech is your strategy game getting worse? Not sure it really matters but it could be any number of reasons. Maybe the world your fighting over is simply running out of supplies. Maybe the sides can sabotage each other to set their technology back. Maybe natural disasters or constant war and draining the game of the intelligence minds to produce the high tech weapons and troops that you began the game with.\n\nAnd it doesn’t have you follow this exact blueprint but I though the idea of flipping how we look at technology progression in strategy games could possible lead to some interesting ideas."

The game starts where The first person does this big-job where he robs a house, and it alerts the second guy. The mission for the thief is to rob all the house in the neighborhood and the objective of the detective is to stop him. After the first mission you can decided wether to control the cop or thief and the choices you make affect the actual game so if you get detected by one of the home owners but get away the home owner will describe your face and if you are seen in public the cops will come and you will have to hide. It’s a idea not a concept"

gbsjuk,Scrap merchant in and interstellar war.,"This game will be a non combat FTL like trading game where the player is a interstellar scrap merchant wandering the space lanes between warring empires. The player will start small and have the ability to upgrade their scrap recovery operation as they become more wealthy. Random encounters will give the player opportunities to get or complete quests. Quests provide money and change the player's relationship between the various competing factions in the galaxy.\n\nThe game will have a star map with jump points connecting nearby stars. The player will jump between stars and have encounters like FTL.  Each faction will claim territory visible on the star map. The player will have a relationship value with each faction based on their encounters with that faction. There will be no combat. If a faction is hostile to the player, the player will be required to pay a tax to traverse their space or jump to a destination of that the encounter's choosing. Some times the player will encounter wreckage from previous space battles. This will activate a scavenge mode:\n\nScavenge mode will involve the player flying a drone between their salvage ship and debris from a space battle. The drone will be equipped with a scanner that will identify what the debris is made out of, any interesting power signatures, or dangerous materials. Debris with dangerous materials might explode if the drone captures it or brings it back to the ship, however if the materials are stable they can be sold for greater profit. More advanced scanners that the player can buy will determine how stable the dangerous materials are. Like wise debris with power signatures are still working components from one faction or another. These components have higher resale value than scrap if the player can find the right buyer, but will take up more room in the ship's hold if they are kept in tact. Components can always be broken down for scrap, which may be more profitable if the right buyer is deep in unfriendly territory. Power signatures will activate quests like the journal of a young officer, or a crate of experimental terraforming technology.\n\nThe player collects scrap and risks damage to their ship or drone fleet in Scavenge mode to fill up their cargo hold. This space will vary per ship, but be represented as a grid of boxes ala diablo.  Components will have irregular shapes where as raw materials will take up one box. Each time the drone returns with a bit of scrap it will identify if there is a component, give a quest prompt if applicable, and identify how much raw material of the various base elements can be extracted from it. The player can then choose to place it in the hold, make room in the hold for it, or break it down for base materials.\n\nIn the map will be static ship yards that will buy base materials and some times components of the correct type. These ship yards will also fix your ship, sell you drones to replace the ones that might have been blown up in salvage, and occasionally offer you quests.\n\nOther systems will generate random encounters like:\n\nWar Fleets: may impose a tax on the player or pay for information about enemy war fleets. May also be a completion point for faction related quests\n\nWorking Merchants: May offer to trade for components or raw materials.\n\nStranded Merchants: Will give a quest to retrieve a specific component. Quest can be completed on first encounter or before a set period of days. The component will always be purchasable at a faction ship yard, but will be cheaper to find from debris."

gbihy1,A game where you are in control of clone(s) and can see that your actions in-game matter everytime you die.,"So the game would take place in a dystopian cyber-punk post apocalyptic city where you take control of clones via a vicarious type simulation machine. The world was destroyed by an asteroid in 1990 and the current year is 3106. \n\nHumans have since been living on Mars and the moon safe from the wastes of the earth.. They have been sending in expidition teams that rarely come back. Within this universe the company you're working for created  these clones to go to earth and salvage technology, locate and save expedition teams as well as study other forms of life. The gameplay would consist of a lot of exploration, combat and talking to characters. Everytime you die you wake up as another clone in one of many pods that the company has set up on earth. You can choose what pod you want to wake up in and what kind of clone you'd want to be. Weather you'd want to be one more akin to combat or research etc.. \n\nEvery time you die you can go and see what other clones have done like making particular tribes or colonies happy, pissed them off, what buildings have been destroyed or looted and even finding your own clones dead bodies with whatever they had collected during their life. \n\nThere will be tribal humans, rogue expedition colonies, old buildings to savage tech and weapons from and animals to study. \n\nAnd feedback would be appreciated and thanks for reading."

gb9c5d,A Souls-like Spectacle Fighter,"Basically a genre mashup of games like Dark Souls with spectacle fighters or 'character action games' like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. \n\nWhile the core loop of Dark Souls and Spectacle fighters both ask you to explore the world, fight foes and learn how to defeat bosses, Spectacle fighters typically allow even the most novice players to experience most the games content with ease, albeit with a poor score, whereas Dark Souls demands you to master its fighting mechanics in order to make any progress. In this genre mashup, not only must the player survive enemy encounters, they gotta look good while doing it. \n\nDark Souls combat asks you to watch your enemies moves and respond appropriately by either dodge rolling away, blocking the strike, parrying their attack, interrupting their attack with a quick strike or seize an opportunity to inflict a devastating heavy attack.\n\nSpectacle fighter combat however, asks you to build and maintain a combo or style meter by attacking foes stylishly without taking damage.\n\nIn this genre mashup, you can increase the rate at which you regen stamina by building and maintaining a combo. The higher the combo, the more damage a heavy attack will inflict at the cost of more stamina than usual. You can build the combo with successful strikes, blocks, parries and dodge rolls against enemies, however the greater your combo, the more aggressive your enemies will become. Defeating enemies with a higher combo will yield more souls but enemies who break your combo will also be able to regen their stamina more quickly. Enemies who kill you will collect all the souls you drop and will hold onto them until they are defeated. \n\nMaybe if someone with the knowhow wanted to mod these mechanics into a souls games as a proof of concept, that might be cool. If they already have, please post a link to it. Thank you 👍"
flknkm,How about a game about you fighting with multiple characters against an overpowered enemy,"Ok so I just watched john wick 3 and I was thinking ""how shit must it be to be a cop in this universe"" and then it came to me. A game where you are some form of authority and then a Jhon wick kinda guy comes along and fucks everything up now you have to stop him. \n\nStory:\nThe story will go along the lines of those story game, such as ""heavy rain"". You have multiple characters that try to get a guy who has done something to anger them, or something completely different.\n\nLet's take further inspiration from John Wick. Let's say there is this massive Assasin organization and there is this assassin that is supposed to kill someone, he succeeded but now he has a bounty on his head. Now you don't play that guy. You play the people who either want to get him for money, justice, or just personal reasons. \n\nYou can play as a cop who was there during the assassination and now has an obsession with the assassin. You are the son of the one who the assassin killed and now you want revenge. You are an older man who wants to kill the Assasin because he killed someone you loved. Ect. In some parts, you trace the chaos the assassin has left behind much like John Wick would and you constantly cross paths with him. In some parts, you are trying to figure out more about the assassin to find out what his next move could be. And in some parts, you will be with an entire swat team trying to kill the assassin in one of his many hideouts. \n\nGameplay: \nThis idea mostly borrows from other games. I was mostly inspired by games such as ""watch_dogs"" ""sleeping dogs"" ""yakuza"" ""heavy rain"" ""resident evil 3"" and more. So it's pretty much a mishmash of things. All I know is that I want the assassin or whatever you put in place of it to be OP and practically unbeatable until the end and even then I want it to be hard as balls. \n\nThe ""Assasin"" behaves very much behaves a lot you would play with an action hero, you know super badass, Nathen drake, Max Payne, solid snake, Sam Fisher, agent 47, etc. he can just do about anything, he is a marksman, parkour genius, smooth talker, stealth master, etc. \n\nThis doesn't mean he can't die though he is still human and he also makes mistakes. But this all depends on your characters. Let's say one of your characters (let's say a mafia member) shoots the assassin but only hits the back of his feat, boom there is now a trail of blood one of the other characters (a detective) finds or some DNA. \n\nBtw your characters have only one life, so if one of them dies you can't use them again and it will affect the story. The game is basically supposed to feel like you are playing chess, however, most of your pieces are just pawns and your opponent has nothing but a queen and your playing against ""deep blue"". \n\nConclusion:\nI am not expecting anyone to make a game anything like this it just seemed like a fun idea and I liked writing it. If you have any additions to the idea please comment I would love to write a book about it and more inspiration is always better. \n\nIf there is a game like this, please tell me what it Is so I can play it."

Fight with other political parties with better ideals and other things.\n\nThe main buildings persist from the Revolution Imminent, but with different attributes:\n\nCities - \n\n**Capitol** \- Your building. If this is captured or influenced, you will lose.\n\nForce Power - You have a relatively weak military, but you can train more easily with enough money or resources.\n\nInfluence Power - Very high.\n\n**Foundation City -** A powerful city. Sort of like Chicago.\n\nForce Power - Strong military, don’t let these be taken over. You can call reinforcements from these.\n\nInfluence Power - Weaker Influence, and you can use them to produce resources and Influence.\n\n**Port City -** A weaker city, like New Orleans.\n\nForce Power - Weak, you have to constantly arm them. Port Cities are raided by enemy countries oftenly.\n\nInfluence Power - Very strong, not converted easily.\n\nBuildings - \n\n**Farm** \- Farms are the backbone of your country - they increase your influence, but if converted, they start sapping your influence away. Creates resources.\n\nForce Power - Either Very Weak or Very Strong. \n\nInfluence Power - Will either be Pro-Revolution or Anti-Revolution - if they’re very weak they will be Pro-Revolution, if Very strong Anti-Revolution.\n\n**Church** \- They are against revolution unless you commit actions that they do not support, such as genocide. If they turn, they sap you quickly.\n\nForce Power - Weak, but can call reinforcements from enemy countries.\n\nInfluence Power - Strong\n\n**Village** \- These you should pay attention to. They will usually cause nearby buildings to turn against you and house units. Creates money.\n\nForce Power - Decent, cannot call reinforcements.\n\nInfluence Power - Very strong. Influence all nearby Buildings.\n\nThere are several Governors you can try to start as:  \n\n\n**Captain** \- The Captain is now the commander of an Autocracy. All of the large cities are under your influence and you have extra troops. You need to win via removing the enemy countries from the existing buildings, who will fight for you over your cities. The revolutionaries will act as a minor threat.\n\n**Scribe -** A wonderful writer who wrote many strong and persuasive essays as a Revolutionary now acts as an anti-revolutionary. You’re fairly weak but can influence cities easily by spending Influence. The Revolutionaries will attack you fairly oftenly and are the main threat.\n\n**Liberators -** You’re an outside country who managed to invade inside of the Revolution.\n\nBoth other countries and revolutionaries will attack you from all sides, but you have a lot of resources and money. You need to claim the entire country who is against you.\n\n**Medicharchy -** A group of doctors, there is an ongoing plague, which creates anti-government sentiments. You can’t stop the revolution, but you *can* cure the right strategic cities in order to slow it down long enough for a large amount of reinforcements to come in."

Players can either control toddlers or a baby sitter. Minimum number of toddlers there can be is three. This will be separated into levels of easy, medium and hard. For easy =3, medium= 4 and hard=5 toddlers\n\n**Objectives:**  \n\n`babysitter`   give toddlers tasks to do, deal with whatever ridiculous stuff they do, and above all else prevent them from disturbing their parent's nap. The baby sitter win if all toddlers are busy, or if all toddlers are in cradles. \n\n`toddlers` Toddlers have their objectives to complete like make a mess in living room, flood the toilet, crack plates in the kitchen and etc. When given a task by babysitter they have to do it for a certain amount time before moving on.They will win if they complete more than half their objective in a given time. \n\ntasks given by by babysitter include: giving toddlers toy blocks, putting on music (on cassette), turning on TV, and putting them in cradles. Some tasks like TV and cradles are like hooks in Dead By Daylight or rocket chairs in Identity V. TV can be destroyed by toddlers.\n\n**Art and idea size**: \n\nit will be 3D with first/ third person view. Toddlers will have third person view and babysitter will have first person view. Design will be similar to Granny simulator, Who's your daddy and Hogwash. \n\nI want it to be on mobile as file size will be small and it will be easier to access to. I don't mind if it is on console or PC."
fl91xw,You vs Corona,"As we in Germany have a Hackathon Challenge in one day, I got an Idea on how to make a Game that could make the population more familiar with the corona situation. I'm sorry if this is not the correct thread for this, but since its a game idea and I would like to know from game developers and interested people if it's good, I will post it here.\n\nYou vs. Corona: The game that acts like a Simulation, where you are on the Populations side. Should raise awareness to what big differences emerge from small changes in Population behaviour.\n\nCore mechanic: Observe the simulation, collect virus germs, level up skilltree strategically.\n\nConcept:  \nYou have an overview on a modern city, just smaller (like in Anno, one Island). The Population is moving based on propabilities, infecting each other. Sometimes you can see the virus, when its spreading to a building / person. You can click on it, it will disappear and you get skillspoints. With those skillpoints, you can skill up a Skilltree. In this skilltree, there are measures that you can unlock (give money to the market, close schools, close borders etc.), or population attributes that you can level up (more washing hands, less touching face, not buying more stuff than you need) that have an influence on the simulation. The Player can look at what happens, how the virus spreads, and how the measures influence the spreading.\n\nAlso, statistics about the infect count, the current population attributes, infect rate and other such metrics should be observable during or after simulation.\n\nGoal: The goal is to stay below a certain death count for the simulation time. The Player has to choose the measures strategically, as only a limited amount of skillpoints is provided.  \n\n\nI know this probably is a very complicated idea, but I think it could really help populating knowledge about how spreading of viruses works. But i'm also not sure about that. Therefore I would be very happy to know what you think about this."
fl42o1,Mr. Arasaki's Detective Defrag,"rough puzzle game idea I came up with (based off a tech demo for Quest I saw and a show that's had me really intrigued lately)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nA VR mystery game about detectives in the future. in the game, Detectives solve puzzles and find clues in what's called the ""Kowarazo"" or "" Shattered Mystery"". The Kowarazo, shortened to Kazo colloquially, is a VR world created by scanning the memories of murder victims. Using all 5 senses, the Kazo is able to accurately reconstruct most of the immediate world around the victim form before the murder. However, due to being a post-mortem scan, parts of the world are corrupted, causing pieces of the world to appear ""shattered"". The player enters each Kazo through a VR system known as the ""daiba"" or ""diver"", a coffin-like machine that can emulate all 5 senses. When they enter the Kazo through the diver, they become the Defrag Detective. His purpose is to reconnect the shattered parts of the world and solve the mystery of each murder so the perpetraitor can be arrested. Being a part of the Kazo himself, each Detective's body is fragmented, which, aside from his brilliant mind, is his main strength. The Detective can detach his right and left hands and leave them in strategic spots across the world to help him solve puzzles. He can do this while holding various items, such as mirrors, guns, and other objects, to help him solve the mystery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

fkwb0h,Revolution Imminent - A game where you start a government revolution.," \n\nTurn Based Strategy Game based on Hex Tiles.\n\nMaps are 100 x 100 tiles, easily generated because there are no actual features other than some water sources and cities. Buildings are a little more sparse in size.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCities occupy 5 tiles.\n\nBuildings occupy 1 - 2 tiles.\n\nYou start as a Revolutionary who must overthrow the government in different settings in a randomly generated map.\n\nThere are 15 cities and 25 buildings.\n\nYou start with 1 city normally, but revolutionaries may have you start with other things.\n\nYou can capture cities and buildings by Force or Influence - Force requires combat, Influence requires you to pressure them via political strategy or starvation.\n\nAfter a long time, external forces may visit unless you are playing certain Revolutionaries.\n\nCities - \n\n**Capitol** \- The main influence. Capturing one of these means you instantly force all nearby cities to become Revolutionary. \n\nForce Power - Very strong military, nearby cities will be defended by Capitol troops.\n\nInfluence Power - Nearby cities will side with the Capitol.\n\n**Foundation City -** A powerful city. Sort of like Chicago.\n\nForce Power - Decent military, but easily armed with reinforcements.\n\nInfluence Power - Weaker influence, converted a little easier.\n\n**Port City -** A weaker city, like New Orleans.\n\nForce Power - Weak, but after a certain period of time reinforcements arive.\n\nInfluence Power - Very strong. They aren’t starved easily.\n\nBuildings - \n\n**Farm** \- Weak, but they provide Anti-Revolutionary sentiments to the City they are connected to. You can starve cities by converting or destroying farms in the general map.\n\nForce Power - Either Very Weak or Very Strong. \n\nInfluence Power - Will either be Pro-Revolution or Anti-Revolution - if they’re very weak they will be Pro-Revolution, if Very strong Anti-Revolution\n\n**Church** \- Strong. They provide Anti-Revolutionary sentiments to themselves and will alert all nearby cities to extreme anti-revolutionary sentiments if one is destroyed instead of converted.\n\nForce Power - Weak, but can call reinforcements\n\nInfluence Power - Strong\n\n**Village** \- Stronger, but only influence Buildings and not Cities.\n\nForce Power - Decent, cannot call reinforcements.\n\nInfluence Power - Very strong. Influence all nearby Buildings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are several Revolutionaries you can try to start as:  \n\n\n**Captain** \n\nWin Condition - Coup d’etat (Military seizure of power) - You start in the Capitol with all cities on your side, but ALL buildings will be against you. Enemy powers constantly arrive in Port Cities and you need to defend your existing regime for a while.\n\n**Union** \n\nWin Condition - Rural Revolution - You start with 3 farms. No one notices you until you starve a city until they convert to the Revolution. However, it will snowball in anger against you.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\nWin Condition - Revolt - Starts in Port Cities or Villages. You can steal enemy power easily. Your main choice to spread your ideology while taking down stronger opponents.\n\n**Enlightenment**\n\nWin Condition - Great Revolution - You are a strong political leader, starting with a city and several churches. You have to execute the higher cities as they will not listen to you."

fkk5i9,A turn-based strategy game except the moves your character can do are based entirely off of cards.,"The core game is the players are placed on a grid-based map and they can move around it and damage the other player. The thing is, every round you have 5 randomized cards and you must pick out 3 to execute in a sequence. You don’t have a “shoot gun” card? Too bad, wait till next turn. The extra 2 cards you didn’t pick for your sequence are recycled and left in your hand the next turn. To give the player a sense of control (and RNG in strategy games is normally bad in general), the player’s chosen cards are from a customized deck he or she designs. This may not be a great idea in everybody’s eyes but I personally believe that it promotes careful planning while also encouraging brave moves and making the best of the situation."

fkfeet,A game where you have to keep toddlers with a short attention span busy and stop them from disturbing their parents,"So basically 1-4 children with possible ages ranging 2-7 are left in a household and you have to entertain them in various ways, deal with whatever ridiculous stuff they do, and above all else prevent them from disturbing their parent's nap.\n\nThis is inspired by my real-life babysitting advice with my sisters. A babysitting sim might not sound interesting, but I think it'd be really hard, and for added fun it could be absurdist and have the children do crazy shit and possibly destroy things such as the house or each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would probably be best as a mobile game."
fkcu9w,A game about mental health,"**Concept:** A 2D platformer where the character runs around trying to defeat the boss on each level. Each boss will represent a mental health condition that the character suffers from.\n\n**Story:** You play a character called ""insert generic boy's name here"" around age 12. You witness your father murdering your mother, he is then arrested and you are placed in a care home. You are very depressed and anxious and lonely, so you go on a mental journey to conquer your demons and hopefully emerge in a better state than you entered. \n\n**Art style:** Simplistic and not overly colourful. \n\nI was thinking that the setting could be very dark and dingy as the game is played inside the characters damaged mind, and after each level it gets slightly brighter. Possible incorporation of some more biological artwork such as a wall may be styled to have a similar colour and pattern as a brain or hearts.\n\n**Character design:** Ill fitting clothes, messy hair, maybe the appearance of being a bit dirty or shabby.\n\n**Possible features:** Different medications may be available to take throughout the game, but as many medication often do, there are side effects. An example could be that ADD medication makes your character run and jump faster, but the boss representing anxiety could get larger as anxiety is often a side effect of these medications.\n\nMaybe a buddy system. As your mental health improves and you start to be more outgoing and trusting of your peers, maybe they become friends who can help you with certain boss fights.\n\n**Inspiration for the idea:** I suffer from some mental health problems, as do many other men. However, there is still a stigma around men having these thoughts and feelings, and as males make up the largest group of gamers, having a game overtly about mental health might be cathartic to play and may encourage them to be open and seek help."

fk8gy3,What I feel is missing from life simulator games.,"Doesn’t matter the job or simulation, your doing it and experiencing it. However, in your mind, there may be other side goals that you play with ever once in a while. ( like at work today, you may take a moment to fantasize about doing another activity ) \n\nThese can be day dreaming quests, things that linger on he mind and can even distract from work. A take away during the simulation when performing repetitive tasks in the game verse. ( something to experience as while the character carries out these tasks in the background ) \n\nIf you can incorporate these desires of “side quest “ you can also have it in a way where the character in the game ( you ) experience an illusion ( day dream), an imaginary state in the game where your playing in your mind about these goals etc. and then in the game the character SNAPS out of it. ( pulled out of dream) \n\nTo a boss catching your attention day dreaming at the desk to snapping out to the sound of cars honking while almost causing a wreck on the road when driving. \n\nI think it would make a far more, elaborate game that’s not just a simulator but a relatable experience as you choose which goals you want to pursue ( in the game choose hobbies for example ) ( grinding typically has a goal that festers on the mind ) and then you have these aspects of the game where you have a more fantasy aspect where everything is nice with the freedoms in gameplay that daydreaming themes can cater to outside of the realism of the simulation. So where horror may have a comic relief, a life simulator can have a fantasy relief. \n\nSo you get more then just simulation, you also get imagination. Something we can relate to and experience in the game while allowing you to put in twists and surprises. Moments of suspense etc. \n\nYou can make it more engaging this way.\n\nAs when you snap out of a daydream quest, you may be also be interrupted and not know the ending... \n\nHoping to return to that state, possibly another time. \n\nLike trying to return to a nice dream you’ve been \nwoken up from."
fk7icj,Idea for additional gamepad buttons.,A think a neat new controller idea would be to add a rotating ring bezel control at the base of the gamepad sticks. \n\nYou’d be able to twist them with your thumb L/R and they go back to center. That’s 4 more variable keys.\n\nYou’d even be able to touch them with the middle of your thumb to turn them around the base of the stick while still using the tip of your thumb to move the stick. \n\nThis would add 4 more variable sensitivity inputs.

fk4482,"Office job simulator, where you also live your life outside of work","As of writing this, I am playing multiple job related games, like \[Cook, Serve, Delicious!\] and etc.\n\nWhile all of these games are fun, there's something that all these games lack, a after work life aspects. I know that there are life simulators and such, but all of those focus generally on life. But what I want, is a game that focuses on the work aspect as well as life and routine.\n\nWhat I want, is a work simulator, where you grow old, hang out with friends outside of work and etc.\n\nI take inspiration of the office job idea from aggretsuko, an anime with animals as people.\n\nThe game:\n\nYou start the game as a male or female 21 year old, who has just graduated from college. The degree you have is based off of the major you chose, before starting, which are: accounting, computer science, administration etc. The degree you chose, is the job you'll get and what type of things you have to do in that job (Occasional minigames, fetch ""quests"" and such).\n\nYou have also just moved to the city to get a job with said degree. The company you go to deals with all those topics, so now matter what degree you chose, you'll go to the same company. Before applying to the company for a position, you rent a small, cheap apartment in the city.\n\nYour actual game starts in that apartment, a few days later from moving and setting everything up. The very first day in game sense, is the tutorial, where you learn to take care of yourself in the morning. Then you go to company by bus, cuz you don't have your own vehicle yet (Bike, moped, car etc.). You apply for a position and you get the job (There is NO rejection or otherwise the game wouldn't be possible).\n\nYou start your first day as an intern, of course, and are shown the ropes aka what you have to do. After your first day is complete under the guidance of your supervisor, you are given the continued tutorial of some of the thing you can to after work in the city. These are going to the cinema, going shopping, walking in the park etc. The rest you'd have to figure out yourself.\n\nIn this game, there are also friendships and relationships. Friends make your experience more fun and relationships too, but they also allow more, like finaly marriage and starting a family.\n\nAfter your first day is complete and hence the tutorial too, you start your game.\n\nBut what about the life aspect? Well, this is what makes this game special.\n\nEvery year has 7 days for time sake for this game, where there's 5 workdays and 2 weekend days, obviously.\n\nReason for this, is because you also age aka after every ""week"" you're one year older. every 10 years your anniversary is celebrated on Sundays, where most of your friend and family join. Oh, you still have family even though you're in the city, so keep touch with them :)\n\nThe game ends, once you reach your 65th year and decide to retire. On your last day of work, you are given goodbyes from your co-workers: young, old, your superiors and your own employees. The end screen will then tell you, what kind of life you'll have afterwards and then all your scores tallied up.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSome thing I didn't mention, that I wanted, are here.\n\nYou can buy and upgrade your assets: you can buy vehicles, bigger apartments and if you want, maybe because you have enough money or because you have a family, even houses of varying sizes.\n\nAs you get promoted to different positions in your job, you'll have to also supervise aka you'll have your won employees. You can choose, how you'll supervise them, forcefully or kindly? Just keep in mind, there can be consequences, if your relationship with you employees is bad.\n\nAs you get older, your character also ages and changes in appearance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can submit your ideas on what to add, what to remove and if you want, have a discussion."
fk1rza,Royale Never Happens,Set in an urban environment that is actually habitated - you need to get resources to make yourself stronger. You can even get jobs to earn money to buy weapons.\n\nBut then the match ends saying the final royal confrontation was avoided this time.\n\nAnd it keeps doing that. Kind of like that old doom level called 'Alien' but it doesn't have any aliens in it.\n\nIt's just a life sim/joke game.

fjyo1d,Time travelling VR puzzle solver,"I'm an experienced developer who uses game engines to create non-game applications - specifically VR training sims. I'm really interested in developing a VR game, but I need help refining my (usually not that good) game ideas! Here is my latest:\n\nA puzzle solving/escape room style game, where you play as a time traveler. In each level, your task is to manipulate the scene and the situation in order to make an event occur or prevent an event from happening, for example prevent an assassination from happening.\n\nYou start off the mission with time completely frozen, each time you teleport or interact with an object time advances a small amount, if you make too many moves, you run out of time and fail the mission. \n\nSo using the assassination example, you might have to find some way of making John Wilkes Booth trip over before he reaches Lincoln, or make the chandelier fall down right before he takes his shot - deflecting the bullet.\n\nNow that I've written all that out, the time advancing mechanism sounds an awful lot like Superhot - which wasn't my intention. I was actually envisioning something more like the Hitman Go or Laracroft Go style games - so more of a turn based idea.\n\nAnyway, critiques and ideas are welcome..."

fjuniz,Open-World Action Horror,"Hi, I am game making hobbyist and I am just starting out to make games. I am planning to make this in the future once I have enough experience. If anyone would like to add to this idea, that would be great. \n\nConcept:\nA 3d action horror with an open world to explore and cache with weapons and cool collectibles. There will the main story, and different side stories the player has the option to explore. For example, there might be a crime scene and you must solve the case. There will be a monster at the end with loot and a nice upgrade to your general character that isn't just the stats. \n\nMain Story: \nThe basic story is this. For summer vacation, the character decides to go visit his uncle, who lives in a cabin in the woods. You explore the forest and find weird marks and clues. Your uncle tells you about the legend he heard from his parents about the monster. The character then explores the area for clues and hints. He will encounter monsters within the forest, which is the action part of the game. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a game designer and this is a very rough idea of the game. I am hoping to make my scope small with just the main storyline then the open world and then the separate quests. I am hoping I can add a skill tree to give the player more control over how they want to play."

(Possible multiplayer aspect)\nLevel ups where you give offerings/sacrifices to different Norse gods to give you different advantages for builds (e.g Tyr gives combat bonuses for warrior class, Loki gives stealth advantages for stealth class).\nNo magic whatsoever but there are chances for the protagonist to gain the gods favour through sacrifices/offerings etc.\nThe ultimate goal is survival."
fjpnoh,VR Martial Arts Combat Simulator,"It’s a VR hand-to-hand combat simulator. You would take control of a fighter and your opponent would be a computer AI, maybe another player later on. I don’t have just one martial art in mind, but i think it would be cool to include all sorts of styles.\n\nI don’t have a VR set but I think the way most of them work is you have the headset and two controllers. The controllers would be used for both arm and leg movements. A button on the controller indicates whether you are swinging with your leg or your arm, and animate accordingly.\n\nThis would take a lot more money, but I was thinking of ankle straps that could be used to animate kicks, and also your foot positioning on the floor.\n\nThe AI would need to be intelligent enough to be able to catch you swinging and counter attack. The AI should also scale in difficulty with the player.\n\nThis is just an idea for a simulator. Could be used to train fighters or soldiers. Probably wouldn’t be much fun if you’re not super into martial arts."

fjl1m0,A game comprehensible only for people under the influence of particular psychedelic,"The (admittedly broad) idea is from the title comes from an [article](https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/05/22/how-to-secretly-communicate-with-people-on-lsd/) on Qualia Computing:\n\n&gt; What if we could communicate with people who are high on LSD in such a way that sober people can’t understand?* I call this idea psychedelic cryptography (PsyCrypto for short).\n\n&gt; * LSD here is a shorthand for psychedelics in general\n\n&gt; **a video-game that only people on psychedelics can understand and play. For a sober person the game would look like an incomprehensible bundle of dots, edges, colors, sounds, etc. But a person sufficiently zonked would perceive crystal-clear images and easy-to-infer objectives. Only a sufficient amount of LSD would allow you to score a single point in this game.**\n\n&gt; The following are some of the most important questions that we need to answer before we can go wild and build the psychedelic video-game:\n&gt; 1. What is the dose-dependent decay function of tracers’ brightness?\n&gt; 2. What is the additive function? Do similar colors average out? Do opposite colors cancel out?\n&gt; 3. What is the range of features that remain in one’s experiential field? Is this dose-dependent?\n&gt; 4. Do lingering features interact with one another? Do they achieve after-the-fact local phenomenal binding?\n&gt; 5. What is the role of synesthesia in tracers?\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if a similar idea (assuming it is realizable) has been at least prototyped on some game jam."

Player can choose from many modern human weapons. Player can also choose weapons from the faction and other places in the games universe.  Same case for armor and clothing. \n\nStory:\nThis story is about a solar system far away from ours.  Basically it's about interplanetary war. There are a few planets and civilizations. They are going to be like factions the player can choose from and support and fight for them. Though the main character is human. I haven't got the name for the factions yet but general info about them is down below:\n\n&gt;Factions:\n1. United Nations\nBasically the humans arrive into the solar system and trade with them. The humans also have a army. They wish to unify all planets and states under a single confederation.(more detailed story message me)\n\n2. White humanoid people #1\nAs I said I haven't decided on a name yet. These are pale humanoids. Almost humanlike but extremely white. With few Grays and blacks. They own a few planets. Have one of the best military commanders \nAnd the best equipment. And a force dedicated for purely  combat outside the atmosphere. They had an empire. But due to fights over succession their massive empire got split into two with many smaller planets declaring independence.(they have a more complex story just message me for more details\n\n3. White humanoids #2\nThe other half of the empire. After the war over succession this half got a massive planet with a few prosperous towns and almost no outer atmosphere ships. This half was supported only by the emperor's guard . So they don't have a large military and no territory outside their own planet\n\n4. A cultist planet\nLong before civilization by the people in the system there existed large lizards . These large lizards existed  until their home planet was nuked to the ground by the white humanoid empire(when they were united). Due to the lizards having no intelligence and their refusal to help the empire. One of them survived. A few travellers found the survivor sitting in a tree thought he was god for surviving all that. Started inspecting him. The lizard showed some of its powers like spraying acid out of it and growling. Now they really thought it was god. Fast forward 10 years the cultists form a elite military out of their worshippers and vow to take revenge on the whites and spread their god\n\n5. The savage Orks\nThis is again not their name these Orks have a extremely powerful military force with some of the best trained soliders and tacticians . Their chief (equivalent to king) has a dream that one day he will be the white humanoids emperor and emperor of the  Sivian empire due to the amount of respect both the empires have.\n\n6. Sivian empire\nI don't know where I got the word Sivian but it's cool. This is the empire formed by many small planets and a large planet(about earth size). They united so as not to be destroyed by other much larger empires. Overtime they grew powerful and owned many planets and even a island in the Orks planet.\n\n7. Brotherhood of freedom\nRather than a proper faction it is a quest for white humanoids #1. Where the white humanoid #1's commander in chief of the army stages a coup against the emperor and places himself in charge.. This event is essential to the story and happens no matter what as this happens before the choice of which faction to join is available. So the player can't side with the emperor. \n\nStory:Cause of war\n&gt;After the coup by commander in chief the other half of the empire makes claims on the old emperor's throne.  Commander simply declines saying there is no position of Emperor. From that point on many major factions get involved it depends on player the story from that point
fjjf92,Racing games without vehicles,"\nI feel like their should be running games like racing games. [similar to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/fhw6v7/battle_royale_ideas/fkim2ri/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n\nConcept \n\nWhat I had in mind is a game like running Fred but will have multiplayer and boosts, traps to deploy, power ups in Mario racing game. \n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is 3D, third person just like in running Fred.

fjj68i,Top down racer with puzzle elements,"Premise:\nWell, it's really simple. Get from A to B without crashing or getting caught. The problem is, you'd have to deal with traffic and it's rules. So flooring it down the main road of the map is probably not going to work, because you're gonna get caught by the police or total your vehicle.\n\nLevels:\nThe maps (or levels) would be action bubbles. So you have a clearly defined start, end and time goal, but after that it's up to you. And here is where the puzzle elements come in, because the maps are designed in such a way that you have to find little short cuts to actually finish in time. At the start, you get shown just a rough sketch of the biggest roads on the map, but after each attempt the areas that you've been to get added.\n\nMechanics:\n-a few traffic rules that, if broken within line of sight of someone, get you chased by police\n-police and/or other baddies independent of them\n-crashing\n\nSome notes:\n-simple vehicles could help break up the very similar gameplay (so offroads, motorcycles, etc.)\n-a level editor could increase longevity\n-i had a look similar to the very old GTAs in mind\n-a few extra mechanics like vehicle swapping or AIs also being able to crash could really shake up later levels\n-i would make it so that you just have to finish out of sight of the police, so that you can pull their ""aggro"" and still finish if you know what you are doing\n-online leaderboards would be nice\n-a demo/replay system would be as well"
fjhv8j,Vietnam Strategy Game,"Been thinking abt this for a while and it’s huge.\n\nSo Strategy Game based in The Vietnam war.\n\nYou start during the first years of the war and with ww2 equipment, and politics play a huge part. If you have support from home, tech advancements (like flak jackets, jetplanes, napalm, WP and new weapons etc.) would take less time and be cheaper. However, if you commit warcrimes (like killing civilians) or waste troops and so on, you get less support from home. Implementing new tech takes a while too, so theres a balance in that.\n\nCore gameplay: So you spawn squads and not individual units; Rifleman squad (cheap, effective but lack some things), Pioneer/Sapper Squad (Less firepower, can spot and disarm traps, and destroy armor/bunkers), Radio-link Squad (Call in active, more accurate firesupport, almost no firepower and expensive), and Pointman Squad (Good firepower and carry WP grenades, almost no “armor” however, also spots mines/traps but further). More can be “bought” through the tech tree. These all play a function, like without pointmen your men get killed by traps and mines, and so on.\n\nBefore a battle, depending on support and resources, you can call in support. For example, Agent Orange on the trees so the enemy cant hide as well, napalm to rid the forest entirely but miss out in that perticular support feature during the battle (but then active fire wont be a problem instead) or arty to clear the map.\n\nYou also have to manage land mass and sections so of the map (the entirety of Vietnam) so you can have airfields and arty fields for support. Its constant balancing and managing.\nIf you have airfields set up, you can call in heli support or Spooky support more frequently, than if you dont have active airfields. Airfields or hangar ships are necessary for the use of Spooky/Napalm/WP support from airplanes.\n\nThere are more ideas so just ask!"
fjhdkv,1776 FPS/RTS,"  So this would be a huge undertaking, so I know it would probably never happen, but I figured y’all might be interested in hearing it anyway. It would be an open world combination FPS tactical RTS set during the American Revolution, maybe with a bit of super basic base building but that wouldn’t be a super integral part of the game.\n\n  You start as just a regular old Minuteman, and you progress through the ranks, can buy a commission if you want to play the RTS part or stay enlisted if you want to just play as a FPS, giving you a lot of freedom of choice.\n\n  You can recruit troops and buy equipment for them if you’re an officer or just your own if you’re enlisted. Travel around and set up camps at the site of battles and have your troops move there, preform skirmishes against patrols, or just show up at the battle alone and join a line to fight alone side regular troops.\n\n  Troop movements would be dynamic, so you could be traveling on the road and come across a column of soldiers marching to a battle, and if columns from both sides meet there’d be skirmishes. Your own troops would do the same, march from your fort (where the base building comes in) to the camp you set up, be it in the wilderness, outside an enemy outpost, or at a battlefield. The map could be broken up into counties with outposts and ownership would be dynamic, with each side taking control of the county by taking control of the outpost or major city. End game would be pushing the British out, taking all their land.\n\n  Idk, like I said, it would be a huge project but I thought it was a cool idea and figured I’d share."
fjd7p7,Fruit &amp; Vegetable Game," Ok, I had a dream about this fruits and veggies being the playable characters in a battle royal and the following paragraphs describes roughly how I think it would work.\n\n So you pick from different fruits and vegetables to play as in this 2d battle royal/survival game with a top down view similar to that of *Don't Starve.*\n\n Battle Royal: You start off each round by picking a fruit/vegetable and then slingshotting yourself to a point in a randomly generated backyard in this back yard you will use your craftiness and fruit's/vegetable's abilities to be the last man standing, and of course you will be pushed to the center of  the map by a decay mechanic. You will use scraps from fruits/vegetables to make compost to heal yourself, and use twigs and leaves to make equipment.\n\n Survival: You rise from the earth in a randomly generated backyard in this yard you will face bugs, molds and terrors of all sorts as you try to survive. In this game mode you will be able to settle down without the fear of decay pushing you to the center of the map. \n\nBoth: Both modes will have all the same items and placeables. Survival maps will be bigger than Battle Royal maps."
fjb93t,Online rpg where the bosses are just players,"Think of a souls game, but online, where players get to be the bosses. They don't get to play as some super op monster, their character gets to be the boss.\n\nIt would begin like a normal game, where you start off by choosing your class and stats and stuff. There would be normal enemies around to fight to lvl up with. There would be places that need guarding, like a passages or valuable items, and anyone would have the opportunity to guard that area, as long as nobody else is already. The person guarding that area would get special armor weapons and an ability that they could use if they wanted, and they'd be the boss of that area. Other players would have to beat them to move ahead or get the item they were guarding, like a normal boss, but the player who beat the boss would have the option of becoming the boss, or just moving on.\n\nIf a boss does well enough for long enough they'd get promoted to a higher level area, to prevent highly skilled players from being the first boss for a long time and kicking everyone's butt. They'd get to keep their boss armor and stuff, and the ability they had if they get promoted. They can quit being the boss at any time, but they don't move on and they don't get to keep their boss stuff.\n\n\nWhat do you think? What are some things you'd add or change?"
fj3tyb,A Poker Game With a Deadline,"\[How I got the idea\]\n\nSo recently a friend of mine introduced me to a interesting indie game called ""Gunpoint"". The Game has a pixel art style and I thought it was pretty neato. Later on I remembered a game called ""Poker Night 2"" and I went to look the game up only to find that it was taken off the Steam market because of license agreements. I was pretty disappointed so I went to go look up videos of it to find that I also really like how the game is. So one day I was sitting in my room listening to music and daydreaming of being someone who isn't just sitting in his room alone listening to music and I thought of an idea (I know crazy huh). I thought of an idea of a game that had the same pixel art style as Gunpoint and mashed it together with Poker Night 2.\n\n\[Gameplay\]\n\nThe game would be about a man who is needs money and needs it fast (For reasons I have not thought of, could be debt owed to a dangerous man or could be he needs money for his ill mother I don't know yet). He decides the only way to earn this great sum of money is at poker tournaments. The poker game in question would be Texas Hold'em. The player would then be on a time schedule. The player will need earn the money before the deadline or get a bad ending. The player should be able to lose some games and still be able to earn the amount of money required to win the game and be rewarded with a good ending. Before the player goes to a poker tournament, the player should be able to have time to talk to certain NPCs. These NPCs are important to the story and game. By befriending (or by antagonizing) a NPC, the player will be awarded with certain bonuses during poker matches or lead into a different ending. For example maybe you befriend a man at one of the your poker games who you later tell him about your situation and he help out by giving the player tid bits of money ever now and then. Another example could be the player meets a women at a bar, who after befriending and spending time with, could teach you how to read body language which in gameplay would give the player the ability to look at one players cards once per match or tell if someone is nervous or confident etc. This will continue until the end of the deadline (or early depending on decisions made by the player) where there will be different endings. The basic one would be if you have the money then good job kiddo here's a cookie. While if you don't have the money it is just, way to go fucko now here is a depressing bad ending where you are lying dead in an alleyway. Though there are other endings depending on the choices that the player makes with handing the different side-plots. Maybe you knocked out a certain guy at a poker match which turns out to be a very powerful mob boss who threatens you to not go to the next high stakes poker game or there will be lethal consequences and the player then has to decide whether or not to play it safe and skip out on the next poker game and lose time. Or risk it and go to the next poker game and risk getting you or one of your friends killed. Another example, maybe the main character develops feelings for that women at the bar and picked the correct choices to get in a relationship with her (yeah this game has romance options why not). Then when you get a good ending you can share that cookie with somebody or when you fail to get the money you can share that cold hard alleyway ground with her as you both succumb to your lovely bullet shot wounds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all I got for now, I just thought the idea of a poker game with a timed deadline with different ending depending on how well you can play and the different choices you make to be interesting."

The harder banks make more money but are more challenging. You can hire three other members to help you rob them.

fj1xei,Any multiplayer game ideas for beginners?,
fj0o1i,Jedi:Knights of the Clone Wars - A New Star Wars Game Ive been creating in my mind and spare time. This is a combination of everything I have on paper at the moment. Let know if you would play and any other ideas you have to make it better.,"A new game where you create a play as your own Jedi Character and fight in some of the most epic battles from the movies and TV shows. \n\nOverall Gameplay: The story would start at the Battle of Geonosis and then progress to 7 different planets, each with about 10/12 missions on each, much the same as Destiny. Each planet would feature a boss fight in the form of a Sith/Bounty Hunter/etc. With also a Count Douku raid being available after the game is completed. \n\nThe Planets would be locked by locked by level with the 7th plenet being locked to level 70 and a max level of 80. Each level would come with a damage increase and health increase. Scenario: If you were level 60 going to a level 50 planet and your friend wanted to play but he was only level 20 you can put the Padwan Machanic into effect which would boot their level to 49 meaning it would be difficult, but they'd survive. \n\nAll, with the exception of the first mission, will be co-op (the first mission would be available to co-op after its completion) up to 3 Jedi. More than that the game wouldnt be worth playing because you'd be over powered. \n\nThe real hook for this game would be the classing system. You start the game as a Jedi Clone Commander with 4 other classes becoming available at regular intervals, levels 20, 30 and so on. Unlike Destiny however, the class you select will not dictate your overall level, if you change class only your abilities will change, so any upgrades to your saber, health and damage will be the same. Each Class has its own 4 abilities; left, right, class and ultimate, as well as a passive ability. Left right and class abilities can be upgraded and once you've fully upgraded each class to max you will unlock a new title called ""One with the forces"" which will give access to a White Saber, as well as the option to pick any abilities, from any class, AS WELL AS, the option to have 2 passive ability.\n\n\nSabers and Upgrades:\nLightsaber upgards will level from Level 1-10 in each of these areas. These levels will be on a skill tree, kill enemies with your saber to unlock saber points. You will be able to pick and choose how you want to upgrade it. \n\nDefection duration: much like battlefront 2's ""Stamina System"" the deflection rate is a metre which will decrease the more you deflect. While each class has its own deflection duration, you can add points to your saber to extend it further. When the Deflection Duration is max level it will unlock a Double Saber\n\nSrike Speed: the speed in which you swing your saber. Once maxed it will unlock Duel Wield Sabers \n\nStrike Zone: Strike zone is a yellow circle that sits at your waist, when an enemy is in breach of that circle it will turn red, signaling that they are in range to kill. Once maxed, it will unlock a Broad Saber - a longer Saber with a ""Ren Cross"" at the hilt, only instead of being an actual cross it's more of a V. \n\n\nJedi Classes:\nJedi Clone Commander: level 1+ \nSaber colour: Cyan. Class Passive - Clone Protection: clones follow you and fire at your enemy when your taking too much damage. Left Ability (L1) - Force Pull. Right Ability (R1) - Force Push. Class Ability (Triangle) - firing Squad: Call in 2 clones to form up behind and shoot enemies. Ult ability (R1+L1) - Artillery Strike: Call in a Clone Drop Ship and fire missiles down into the enemy \n\n\nJedi Knight: Speed class (level 10+)\nSaber colour: Blue. Class Passive: strike and run faster with your saber, rolling is replaced with a dash. Left Ability - Force Freeze. Right Ability - Disarm: pull your enemies weapons from thier hands. Class Ability - Chain Attack: Auto-lock onto 3 enemies and stroke in Rapid Succession. Ult ability - Duel Lightsaber for double damage and speed boost \n\n\nJedi Sentinel - Guardian class (lvl 25+) \nSaber Colour: Orange. Class Passive: Revive a fallen Jedi. Left Ability - Funnel Pull: pull your enemies forward to the ground, pull three straight into your saber. Right Ability - Deflection: all shots towards you will automatically be deflected back to the enemies that fired at you without needing to aim at them. Class Ability - Create a wall infront of you that absobes fire, will protect anything behind you (Slows you to a quick walking pace) Ult ability - Dome Shield: use the force to create a dome that will defect anything and anyone allowing your team and yourself to heal and recharge. \n\n\nJedi Master - Ability class (lvl 50+)\nSaber colour: Green. Class Passive: all abilities charge much faster. Left Ability - Rewire: force basic droids to attack eachother. Right Ability - Absorbe and Fire: Absobe enemy fire and then release it back at them. Class Ability - Environmental Strike: pull rocks and other objects from behind you and throw them at your enemy. Ult ability: Force Wave - a massive 180 degree force barriers that pushes and destroys anything in its path (massive range) \n\nJedi Warroir - Power Class (70+) \nSaber colour: Purple. Class passive: abilities charge quicker when taking damage. Left Ability - Lighting Strike: Kill anything with a massive lighting strike within range. Right Ability - Dismemberment: use the force to pull apart your enemies. Class Ability - Lighting push: electrify an enemy in melee range and then push them back, any enemies that come into contact with him will also be electrified. Ult ability - Crush: create a large 360 degree field of devastion as you crush all enemies to dust within it. \n\n\nGame Modes\nIt will feature 3 games modes in total, ALL, will be able to play in Co-Op. The story will take place over 7ish planets, each planet has 11/12 story missions and a Total War mode. Each Planet will also feature either a Stealth Mission, where your abilities change to ""Mind Wipe"" to keep you quite, or a Fighter Ship mission where you fight in your Space Ship along side Clone Cruiser. This is to give the player more variety, but there's only one per planet so that people that FUCKING DISPISE Stealth Mission don't have to constantly take things slow. \n\nThe Story: \nThe Story will start you off in the Padwan Trial where you are introduced to your Character ""Ensign Savik"" the trail will serve as the tutorial. After you've graduated, you and your former Master are interrupted by Mace Window saying that Kenobi has been captured. Enter Misson one where you fight in the Gladiator Arena on Geo. After that the missions continue on Geo where you destabilise what's left of the Droid Factory, the Federation Star Ships, etc...\n\nOther Planets that feature in the Story are Kasyyyk, where you focus on helping the Wookies, towards the end of the mission you report to the Jedi Council that conditions have worsened on Kasyyyk and you team up with Master Yoda to hold off a ""Normandy Styled Beach Assault"" Other Planets that are not in the movies to again add variety.\n\nThe Story will see you climb the ranks of the Jedi from Knight to Master, to Grand Master and eventually when the Story is complete you will get your own seat on the Jedi Council.\n\n\nTotal war: \nThis is a game mode that features on every planet. When selected you will go down to the planet serface to large ""Free Roam Map"" where you fight along side Clones and kill enemy droids. Dotted around this map will Clone Captain that will request Jedi Assistance. These will be very basic, but very fun little side quests such as; rescue captured Clones, take out an artillery, assist in an assault on a Droid base, etc.\n\nThis Game Mode will have a special feature in the form of a ""Tug or War"" Styled Bar, one end will be the Republic Symbol and the other side a separatist Sybol...basically, the more and more the community plays Total War, the more the Republic will ""Win the War"" and the less droids there will be on the battlefield. But if you give it a week or so where no one plays it, the bar will deplete and when you enter the battlefield, there Droids, fucking! Everywhere! You'll have to fight for a Landing Pad so that Clone Dropships can land reinforcements.\n\nMantaloe: (Third Game Mode)\nMantaloe becomes available at level 35 along with the Jedi Sentinel Class. You will receive a transmission from a Cruiser asking  for assistance because they've come under attack. After you've cleared the Enemy the Cruiser tells you that they are in dyer need of a place to land to make repairs. The closest landing pad is on Mantaloe. A moon that features a Gladiator Arena and the person in charge says that your Cruiser can land there if you defeat thier champion. After you win, Mantaloe becomes available as a Third Game Horde Mode where you can fight every known enemy in the game in wave fashion with up to 3 other Jedi. (I know it's not very ""Jedi Way"" but come in that sounds cool as fuck!)\n\n\nYour Clone Troop:\nWith the first Class of Jedi you unlock being a Clone Troop Commander, after your first mission your grated the rank of Jedi Master and you are given your own 6 Clone unit for you to take with you on your Stealth Missions, the big battle sequences and the smaller action bits, much Cody and Rex for Kenobi and Skywalker. (There will be missions that do not feature any Clone support) you will get to know these Clones and hopefully get attached to them, they will be your NPC friends, congratulate you when leveling up, when unlocking new gear etc... These clones will also assist you on the battlefield. Sinario: when taking out a droid tank you climb up on top, cut a hole with your saber, your Clone will then throw you a Sizemic Charge to drop through that hole and then you back flip off before it explodes. \n\nCustomisation: \nEverything you do in the game is all started from your fighter ship. Select mission, join your friends... It basically serves as your home screen. In your ship you have a customisation hub where you can change, well, everything...As a Jedi you have two uniforms, your Robes and your General Suit, as well as a Brown Jedi Cloak. The Cloack will be wore during Stealth missions, complete a Stealth mission without breaking Stealth to unlock a black robe. You can change the colour of your Jedi Robes between the core colours of the Jedi, white, brown, black, navy etc, then behind a pay wall you can unlock more vibrant colours like bright pink and lime green... The same for your general outfit and your ship. The general outfit will have a little more freedom, you have a primary colour - the main colour, an accent colour - this the armour on your shoulders back and ankles, and a trim colour, this is your belt, emblem and any other trim. You can also customise your troops colours, again you start off with access to the core Clone Colours and then behind a pay wall, more vibrant stuff... \n\nBUTTON LAYOUT (PS4 Console)\nR2 - Attack. L2 - Block. R1 - Right Ability. L2 - Left Ability. R1+L1 -Ultimate ability.  Triangle - Class Abilty. X - Jump (Hold for High Jump) Circle - Roll. Square - Saber on and off (Hold for Power Stance - during this stance you're abilitie will recharge quicker as well as your deflection stamina) D-Pad: Up - Attacking Ping (for playing in co-op) Down - Defending Ping. Left and right serve as your speaking lines. Press left for a pre astablished ""congratulations line"" hold for a section wheel. Press Right for a Taunt and hold for a wheel. R3 - Interaction button and L3 - Sprint. \n\nCombos:\nL3 + X + R2 (Sprint, Jump, attack) massive over head strike. \nCircle + X + R2 (Roll, jump, attack) will send you in the air doing three forward flips with your saber going forward\nAnd basically just other cool shit like that"

fiwjuo,A game where you create a creature and evolve,If you have ever played Spore it would be kinda like that but much much better with long evolution a story and pretty much everything spore is missing
fiu2uw,Game that doesn't end as it has community involvement and self crafted storylines after completion,"When I play a game and complete it, I rarely replay it so it's uninstalled/shelved then onto whatever the next one is.\n\nWhat about this. A game that has a story, after completion, that you get to make on your own. \nYou become the developer and then upload a custom mission story to a community with the ability to play other people's too.\n\nWould be a never ending game if there was a large community. \nIf AAA games did this and they enabled the player to make custom cinematics in self made missions it would be a right game. If it was possible to customise everything, the missions would be on par with what the developers made in their main story. I'm thinking that with custom dialogue, for instance, an individual story could be created using the games environment. Creating this mission story would be as if you had made your own sidequest in essence, but post game.\n\nI reckon any game, indie or AAA, would be onto a winner if it was incorporated."
firy0z,A console game that is basically sea of thieves but Battleships!!! A first person experience in ww1/ ww2 Battleships with a tech tree like World of Warships but team playing like battlefield. Each player has their own job on the ship. With full weather and gun mechanics- Boom!!,
fiodpq,How much controversy and media posts would such a game create?,"So... I have thought of a game for a very long time, a **very** long time but before you read this post, because of its content, please be aware that I'm not mentally unstable, I don't have a social, economical or political crisis with myself, my community or my country, my live so far is worth living and is very good, I have enough money, a lotta friends and I'm very popular at my college and I'm clean of any drugs, I don't have any negative history with laws and the police and I do not have any psychological issues.\n\nStill there and worried what could come next? Yeah, just read on, I'll explain the game.\n\nSo, for like all eternity (at least it feels like it) I had this idea for a game, when I came up with it I was rather young and had no idea how to create video games but because I'm currently working at a small hobby project, I got behind the ropes on how to create first-person shooters. Then the idea came back, a game, were you play as a homicidal maniac (closest translation I could find), basically an amok shooter (wow, didn't need to google). You just play minigames inbetween ""rounds"" to earn cash with which you can then buy guns etc. and choose a location to case.  \nAfter you cased a location enough (no location based on reallife locations) you can launch your shooting, shooting up everyone and everything you see, of course there would be a pretty huge-ass police response, with standard police officers, tactical units up to even the military based on your difficulty and how long you are playing, with much more diffcult mechanics being implemented over time like snipers (which actually would be implemented to be bullshit-hard), police tanks ramming through walls, tear gas in the ventilation, cops with AP rounds, heavier armor for cops etc.\n\nYou wouldn't earn any points and the police would be pretty much outgunning you, meaning you have to play smart but the police would also play smart, smarter than you. You would have to take CCTV into account, spycams, drones etc. They'll be made to be stronger than you.  \nOh and you could also kill EMS and firefighting personnel behind the police roadblocks and, of course, those stupid bystanders who just want to take photos and videos entering the crime scene and troubling police.  \nIf you die, you die, get a news report and get a statistic. There is no progression, it would basically only be for ""fun"". To let off some steam, if you only want to shoot something rather than going through a story (although the main character will have a rather deep backstory) and the news reports will be pretty satirical, satirical in a way that video games caused the shooting, not the characters dark backstory and many other things worth a parody.\n\nHow much would the media defame me? Would people get the point? How much would I get destroyed in the crossfire? Would it lead to another mayor debatte?\n\nOh and it won't be happening in the US because of the countries history of massacres and school shootings.\n\n*Would be worth mentioning that it wouldn't be over-the-top gore or anything, just some old-school looking graphics and a few blood decals, nothing more.*"

You have goals/objectoves/missions, but without too much dialogue or instruction. The setting will be a massive medieval world of villages, farms, forests, churches, camp sites, cities, castles, caravans, cults, etc. \n\nWhat the game will lack in story/lore it will have in visuals and atmosphere. Dark ambient soundscapes will play as the player stalks a farmer on a field, only to be interrupted by a torch and pitchfork-carrying mob of Christian zealots and a fast paced heavy metal track.\n\nThe evil (satanic?) protagonist has no acces to magic as such, but might have power-ups or power moves. Additionally, there might be different archetypes (fighter, stealth, specialist...) who can use all kinds of medieval weaponry to mutilate and destroy his or her opponents.\n\nAs the player sets churches ablaze and puts heads on stakes in village squares, the Archbishop sends word to his crusaders in foreign lands of a domestic threat."

fifurk,Would you be interested in a single-player casual RPG where you have some good grinding fun in a world that resembles an old school MMORPG?,"It's essentially a casual, grinding based RPG under the hood, but it takes place in a world that looks like an MMORPG - the camera control, the movement scheme, the ability usage, mount system, etc. all resembling an MMORPG. \n\n* In each playthrough, the game will generate AI-controlled players, 9 on your faction, and 10 on the enemy faction. These AIs will fight alongside of you, level up alongside you, you can party with them and fight against them in world-vs-world zones. They are there to help create a sense of companionship. You can interact with them with basic commands.\n* There will be no microtransactions, just a $5\~$10 price tag upfront. \n* Each area will be quiet small and the 3D artworks will be low poly similar to [Horde.io](https://Horde.io), so it is quite manageable to create for small teams. \n\nIf you have any idea suggestions and criticisms please let me know."
fie241,"Large scale military shooter, that mixes the wild chaos of Battlefield, with heart racing tactical gameplay.","Two large teams, 32 players each, or however big it can get, battle over a large battlefield. There are different objectives around the map with can be captured and held, blah, blah... Ok, I have to brake the rule and mention a game, just to save some time. The game is structured like a game of conquest in Battlefield. What's to come are several large variations on that game mode's basic model. The changes turn it into an entirely different game. It opens the door for so many different types of playstyles and it seems like it might be relatively easy to do. But what do I know?\n\nSo yeah, each team has a number of tickets, each death is a ticket, capture objectives, each team has a base, your team bleeds tickets if enemy holds the majority of the objectives, there's vehicles, etc.\n\n\nSo anyways...\n\nEach team has a base, which is out of bounds from the enemy team, except for their aircraft.\n\n(This bit with the NPCs can be toned down depending on the budget and isn't super important. I was thinking Battlefield when originally writing this up lol. You can skip down a little to the main concept for the game)\n\nAt the team bases there are npc soldiers. They would be scripted to do different stuff like running supplies around, giving orders to other npc soldiers, standing guard, working on the runway, etc. Basically just make it feel like a hectic base in the middle of a battle with everybody working their jobs and manning their posts. It would be so immersive. \n\nThe npc soldiers would trigger into attack mode if the base were under attack. But they'll only target someone if that person shot at the base. So if a helicopter is bombing the shit out of the base and ruining the fun, they would man an anti air gun or use a rocket launcher to try to take it down. Same with tank attacks or even just infantry.\n\nNpcs will only stay within the perimeter of the base. They can be killed for minimal xp, but will always respawn by being trucked in from behind the base or flown in by helicopter or something.\n\nIt would really help with matches when a team gets backed up into their base and cant get anywhere for the whole game. But even if that happens, it would be so intense, having soldiers screaming, ""We're fucked"" and ""Hold your ground men!"" ""There's too many of them!""\n\n\nMAIN PART/////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n\nThere are multiple npc officers on base that you could go up to, and they have different missions to pick from during the game. These optional missions, if completed, would offer xp and an xp boost, which would vary with the missions difficulty.  \n\nMissions each come with a respawn limit of three lives and a generous time limit. Die three times or run out of time, and the mission is failed and you get nothing. \n\n(Unless you're in a squad. After your third death, you can either spectate your teammates until the mission is completed, or choose to respawn back at base, with that part of the map out of bounds until the mission is over. You receive half the reward if your squad succeeds.)\n\nSome missions would be for individual players and others would be for squads. Each mission can only be played by so many players or squads at a time. Once a squad or player completes a mission, it will become available again for someone else.\n\nSome mission examples off the top of my head would be: lay mines across this bridge, or capture and hold objective for 2 minutes, destroy a tank, give tank support to the bridge, etc.\n\nThe missions could also maybe overlap. Like, if a mission has been taken by a squad to plant explosives at C and hold the position, a player can pick a mission that says give sniper cover for the team or objective (maybe enforced or tracked by counting the amount of time the scope is faced in their general direction. Idk.)\n\nSquad missions offer more xp. Squad missions force your squad to stay within a certain radius of the squad leader, excluding sniper class, which can go outside the radius. \n\nEach squad mate must stay in the radius (which is pretty large) but can spend 15 seconds outside of it  until the 10 second out of bounds timer starts.\n\nI could go on and on, but I'll stop. I just think it could allow for a game that gives the option for tense tactical gameplay, while still allowing someone to shut their brain off and relax. I dont know anything about game design so this might not work at all lol. It just seems like a game I'd love to play.\n\n\nThanks for reading."

Players can work together to barricade entrances or seal paths in order to force monsters (and other survivors unfortunately still back there) to use longer paths. The monsters come in waves, allowing survivors some breathing room to loot and break through to the next floors.\n\n####THE FINAL WAVE OF MONSTERS DOES NOT END  \nThe top floor has a panic room, but it needs five people to operate the locking system. The first five people who make it into the panic room win... plus any survivors that slid under the steel door while it was closing. If any monsters made it inside, the game won't end until either the survivors kill the monsters that made it in or all the survivors die.\n\nInspired by the trailer to A Quiet Place 2, I like the idea of running from monsters and knowing you are only alive right now because the monsters are distracted by other survivors."

fhwzs4,"BattleRoyal with skills, rpg style, and luck","Hello. I had this game concept today in my mind, and it kept me from sleeping, so I stayed awake till 8 am writing it (it kept from sleeping at 7 am though). Ok so I made an account just to post this game concept/idea. I dont even know if this is the right section to post in. I just know reddit from game guides ;) \nWell then, here goes nothing.\n\n\nGeneral idea:\n\nIt will depend on luck first (literally) then skills while having some rpg elements.\nThe graphics should be top-notch. \nFirst, you will play some sort of a game that is based on luck mostly (card game or board game), and it will give you either a huge advantage or no in the battleroyal.\nThe ""luck"" game should be simple and does not take much time, but still exciting and surprising. \nThe battleroyal will offer a number of champs, heroes, characters... based on tiers (tier 1 - 9).\nEach tier gives a huge advantage to the player.\nThe higher the tier the lower the number of champs...\nThe luck game will determine the tier you will start with in the battleroyal and you will be given a certain tier champ randomly. You can convert within the same tier or upgrade to a better tier. \nUpgrading will give you a better tier champ randomly or selectively (I'm not sure). \nUpgrading or converting will require certain materials or requirements.\nThese can be farmed/gained during the battleroyal by either killing players or doing other certain things.\nZone shrinks by land getting destroyed bit by bit. And when this starts, a huge earthquake shakes the entire map making everyone chained down for a few seconds.\nThere will be giants around the map that can be seen from afar. They are not just for look, as there is a small chance of them crossing the map causing the land on their feet to crumble and damage the surroundings. Players will also be able to climb on the giants' legs to a certain limit.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt will be a 3rd person game and will offer a variety of combat styles with long ranges to close, depending on the champs...\nThe map will be very big. Big enough to fit for 100 or 150 players. Yes, these players will all participate in the luck game. The luck game will be based on points, and these points will determine your ranking between the other players and, the ranking will determine your starting tier.\nOther things should be the same as any battleroyal game where you fight till the end, but you should try to get stronger before doing so. \nWhen falling from sky, players will have effects depending on their champion's tier, so others can avoid encountering players with high tiers... \nOverall, there will be the following:\n3 tier 9 (short, medium, long ranges)\n6 tier 8 (2s 2m 2l)\n6 tier 7 (2s 2m 2l)\n9 tier 6 (3s 3m 3l)\n9 tier 5 (same)\n12 tier 4 (4s 4m 4l)\n12 tier 3 (same)\n15 tier 2 \n15 tier 1\nTotal is 87 champ. If we fear balancing issues, we can cut the number down. We can also start with a lower pool and then add more champs little by little to avoid balancing issues. Each will be unique. Take league of legends for reference. Hence, every game will feel different depending on what you get. We can make support champs that would be useful in duos and squads... therefore, a player should take into consideration what they will get first, so they don't end up in a populated zone (high chance of fights) at the beginning of the game with a support champ. Instead, they should try to find a better spot for farming towards a better champ suitable for the player/situation.\nChamps can be leveled up to unlock their full potential and increase their stats. There will not be itemization (maybe a little bit).\nIf a player dies within the first 10 or 15 mins of the game, their souls will be sent to the underworld where they will have to win a 1v1 to return or else they are gone, unless a teammate resurrect you if you're playing duos or squads. The 1v1 should be basic with both players having the same things...\nThere will be NPCs in the game offering various things, such as shops and quests.\nThe way I imagine it, the gameplay should be a combination of GoW and overwatch. It should be huge, immersive, and fast.\n\nTherefore, it should be perfect on the next gen consoles. Of course, it will still be playable by the rest, but with lower quality.\nThe game should be free. Money sources will be from battle pass and skins. 3rd person will be very seductive ;) (not in a bad way)\n\n\n\n\nQuick math:\n\nIf there will be 100 players in the game, there should be the following at the start of the game:\n1 tier 9\n1 tier 8\n1 tier 7\n2 tier 6\n4 tier 5\n7 tier 4\n15 tier 3\n25 tier 2\n44 tier 1\n-------------\nTotal is 100.\n\n\n\nMLT:\n\nThere is a very very small chance that a MASSIVE-LEVEL threat being would appear during the match and must be taken down by teaming up. When it appears, the zone won't shrink, as if time has stopped. The MLT is basically unkillable, and everyone will be teleported 400m within its range and none can leave that range, like a small zone in a dramatic way, but still big enough for all the players. One person will hold the X sword. This sword is the only thing that would make MLT vulnerable in a way that would allow the other players capable of damaging it. Anyone killed during this event will be returned normally later if MLT is defeated. There is a time limit for defeating it. Failing to kill the being will result in destruction of the map (everyone loses). The one holding the sword will be monitored properly to avoid trolls... the being will appear within the 2nd 5 mins of the game. Players in the underworld will also be teleported and then be all revived after defeating it.\nWhen this event happens, all matches currently being played will be notified through a huge shake and scream from the skies with an announcement being broadcasted. \n\nThat's it. Tell me what you think. 😁"

What if they changed the concept of the center of the eye. \n\nWhat if the center of the eye landed on specific map like nuketown, shipment  (fan favorites, small) and the last few zones or minutes of the match could turn the game into a different mode such as sticks and stones, or the gun game, until one person is standing. \n\nI don't know, I just enjoy sticks and stones and I atleast think it should be an option for every CoD, not just Black Ops.

fh5lwf,A PREDATOR GAME THAT USES THE NEMESIS SYSTEM!!!!,"Okay Okay Okay Okay....so....imagine...\n\nAlien: Isolation, Far Cry and Shadow of Modor/War all had some kind of unholy night of passion and spawned a PREDATOR game.\n\nPITCH: A wilderness survival game where you wake up on some alien planet and it turns out that you're being hunted by a goddamn Yaujta and just like Dutch in the original movie, you hafta kill this thing before it kills you.\nThat's it. That's the story.  But that's not all...\n\nGAMEPLAY: I imagine something very similar to the Far Cry games as far as combat but with a serious focus on crafting and resource management and a lil bit of survival horror as you avoid the predator. It can also take cues from Mass Effect and other RPGS where before a playthrough you can choose a vague backstory for your player character that'll determine what perks and weaknesses you'll have during the game\n\nEx. ""Background: Survivalist gives you perks to scavenging and crafting"", ""Background: Criminal gives you resilience and a killer edge"" ,""Background: Medic gives you perks to healing and survivability"", ""Background: Solider gives you combat bonuses"" \n\nI also imagine this as a First Person game\n\nTHE PREDATOR: Okay, so like what if the Nemesis system was applied to just a single AI enemy? Like instead of thousands of combinations of simple enemies, what if all those random possibilities in abilities, stats, behavior, weapons etc. went into a single Predator that's hunting you down. \n\n Each time you start a new game you get a different Yaujta. One playthrough can something akin to the Jungle Hunter where it'll set traps and stalk you and focus more on stealth. Another can be something like the Super Predator from 'Predators' where it's a hulking bruiser that's not really about the traps and sneakiness but can kill you in a single hit if you're not careful and strong enough to knock over trees or huck boulders at you. Maybe you don't even get just one Predator. Maybe you get a team of two killers that are weaker than normal apart but when they work together they're a goddamn menace. Maybe one uses those weird Predator dogs? GOD the possibilities!\n\nAnd depending on the kind of Predator you get, your strategy changes which allows for almost unlimited replay value depending on the number of combinations you can get. AND based on how good you are these playthroughs can be anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours.\n\nThese Predators can also exhibit different personalities: some may be bloodthirsty so they'll just go for the kill as soon as they spot you, some might be sadistic so they might play with you and not kill you right away, some might be honorable so they'll only fight you on even terms etc.\n\nTHE ENVIRONMENT: Like the Predator, the environment you wake up in could be randomly generated with different biomes, climates, hazards, terrains, resources, wildlife, etc.\n\nThis game would fuckin SELL if done right, dude. \n\nMonolith, GET. ON. IT."

Welcome to Costco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesign:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst person, basically open ""world"", with climbing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a survival simulator within a huge Costco-type store.

You can also build bridges from one to another, and use anything you've thrown down, along with any other products in the store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou must store food and supplies, keep the doors protected, and begin to grow your own food. Luckily, it's a store that sells garden goods, like soil. Probably most important, you need to choose who you let in from the outside. Some have useful talents allowing them to do certain tasks for you, like gardening, or perimeter guard. Some might seem worthless, but have hidden traits that come out with experience. Some may legitimately be duds, eating all your food, and being lazy. Remember... laws are a thing of the past, for you, and for them. They should have AIs allowing them to auto set their jobs, and do them. They will level up in those jobs, allowing hidden jobs/skills to surface.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou level as well. More strength, for instance, will allow you to pull up heavier items into the ""rooms"". You level at ""fishing"" using a fishing poll off the roof, and collecting items from the swarm below. There are a few guns left from being raided, but I'd avoid too many pot shots into the crowd. It's a waste of ammo. Running will increase your speed level, but waste food, and water. You can find all sorts of containers to help you move smaller things around, like a backpack, but don't forget to put some on the roof to collect water when it rains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs this is more or less a survival simulator, there isn't really an end... assuming you live..."

fh16x6,FPS game where you play as a Viet Cong guerrilla.,"Seriously. There's a LOT of Vietnam war single player shooter games.

fgwyxm,Stealth game from largely 2nd person perspective,"For a little context, I've been replaying Driver San Francisco recently and for the uninitiated, there's a mission where you have to drive car A while looking at it from car B. It was very confusing at first but when you get the hang of it, it's quite fun.\n\n\n\nHear me out. What I have in mind is a level-based stealth game Thief-style where the guards are robotic (for ease of explanation of the following) and you look at yourself from their perspective. By Thief-style, I mean clear indication of your (in)visibility and some time between you being spotted, the alarm being sounded and the ""restart"" button being pressed. \n\n\nFor obvious reasons, while you're looking at yourself through the eyes of robot A, it cannot sound the alarm. Switching between the robots or you would work as in Driver San Francisco without stopping the time, just slowing it down a fair bit.\n\n\n To ""force"" or rather encourage the 2nd person perspective, you'd have limited time to look through your own eyes throughout the level."
fguiud,Potion brewing game,"the idea is that you are a shop keeper of a magic potion store, and you get potion request and then have to make the potion, and if you make it right you get payment. \nthe game itself is just essentially just a big ""menu"" of your work station, a few shelfs with ingredients and a few workstations like a brewing stand, potion request page etc.\nthe idea is that different ingredients will interact with one another and creating the right potion will be a puzzle. maybe after you finish the potion, there will be a generated (bare bones) combat where your costumer uses the potion, abd you will be paid according to its effectiveness.\n\nproblem is a just cant come up with ways to make ingredients interact without everything feeling scripted and too simple like in Minecraft (no offense to their potion system, but its not interesting enough for its own game)\n\nHow would you go about making it more interesting?"
fguedr,A survival game with building like Minecraft,"Instead of mining and going into caves for ores and materials, you would grow plants that have the materials you need. Different soils, waters and fertilizers could affect the plants harvest. The goal is to go through randomly generated dungeons with dungeon exclusive loot and rare materials. \n\nThat's the main idea but other little things could include animals, cooking food that works the same way as planting (methods of cooking affect food's properties), randomly generated bosses that change their attacks and drops, maybe multiple dimensions with loot and bosses exclusive to their dimensions. Maybe towns? Just something I thought of on my way home from work."

fgu4uo,Zaimar: The Lost Scientist.,"This is a story driven puzzle game played co-op with 2 players. A sister and brother find a unique looking camera in the dusty ol' attic of their new home. The sister immediately take a picture of her brother and within a few seconds the image prints. The brother points out that there's writing on the back as the sister grins at the silly picture.\n\n*~~BOY~~* *Look for Z.*\n\nThe brother takes the camera without hesitation and - CLICK - The image prints of his sister and now he's laughing at her while she points out that this one has writing on the back too.\n\n*~~GIRL~~* *You won't find me.*\n\nThey investigate the camera and In bronze letters *Zaimar* is seen on top of the camera. They look up the name Zaimar and find articles and stories about a scientist that suddenly went missing. One page links to a website that says Look for Z at the top. Upon clicking the title a list of 26 items in alphabetical order loads. The second one being crossed out, *~~BOY~~*, they scroll down to see right after F it says, *~~GIRL~~*.\n\nThe list only says the words, but the actual images themselves have a little note after the word. Each thing on the list they find has another note. Each note is a clue. The clues lead to Zaimar.\n\nWhen they take a picture of something on the list almost instantly it's printed and then crossed out on the website.\n\nIf they take a picure of something NOT on the list a simple X appears at the bottom along with *Don't get 3 or you'll NEVER find me.*\n\nThree wrong pictures and the camera self destructs and you lose the game."

fgtg0m,Escape from Tarkov &amp; Altered Carbon,"The idea sprung from one generic post that said to combine the last show I watched with the last video game I played which is tarkov and altered carbon. So for those who do not know escape from tarkov is a hyper realistic survival shooter where you enter ""raids"", which are timed instances, at the same time as other players and you go through killing other players and scavs (scavengers) and picking up loot to then take into another raid or it can be stored in the ""stash"" which no one can access to be saved for later. Altered Carbon takes place in a distant future world where the consciousness and memories are stored in a ""stack"" located at the base of your spine and your physical body is just a sleeve and there for you can upgrade your sleeve for money to get better anything from muscle memory to eye sight to toned muscles. As it is a future world there are cool future guns however it is basically mostly normal weapons with a couple cool ones.\n\nThis is where my idea starts, your character starts with a basic sleeve no augments or anything and basic low gear equipment like tarkov and working your way up to more augmented trained premium sleeves as well as better gear and future stuff at your disposal. However if you were to be too poor to afford a new sleeve from dying too often you could rent a sleeve, if you succeed your gear at the end of the raid is calculated to see the money value and then you owe 50% or so to the trader you rented it from for the slow climb out of poverty. Two cool ways to not let premium sleeves go to waste is to either the cheaper option (still moderately costly and more risky) go into raid with a hover gurney to take out your favorite of the sleeve you killed, or the more expensive option (almost guaranteed profit) is to put straps on and activate a beacon to be taken away by drone back to your stash, possibility of being shot down, maybe, I don't know i'm not making the game. Tarkov has recently introduced the hideout which can be upgraded for bigger stash sizes, testing out guns without danger, and farming bitcoins for money etc, this could be a similar option in this game for storing sleeves and equipment and passively giving sleeves more muscle mass or cloning to sell or to use. Finally if you kill an enemies sleeve you can rip out their stack like a dog tag and sold either back to them or sold to be deconstructed into raw emotion and experience and sold on the black market. Thank you for reading my ramble and I hope you watch altered carbon on netflix and watch of play tarkov to get more incite.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions I would gladly read them because this idea took me all of 10 minutes to think of."

fglqf9,A puzzle game where you explore interesting geometry,"So i came up with the idea in an art class where i was drawing some geometrical shapes which all connected together. At the end when I was done with the drawing, I thought that it looked pretty cool, and I thought how much fun you would have exploring the drawing and solving interesting puzzles. In the game you would be someone who can only travel along the vertices and lines of a shape. Due to this limitation you might be forced to come up with interesting ways of solving problems. This could be also be in 3d where the shapes are fully explorable with depth as well. I am a game developer myself but I can’t really find time to work on this one. It would be really easy to make, and if I ever gave time I’ll try to make it too. But for now I hope someone picks this one up."

fg409g,A game where you journey though the alps,"A 2.5d game where you go through the alps. Whether it’s through the thick snow or climbing the mountains. On your way you’d find stuff like trees and animals. And you could cut down the trees to craft items such as Spears that you could use to kill animals. You’d have a thirst and food counter, so you kill animals and cook them to restore your food, and you search for a river to fill up your canteen that you could drink out of. There would also be storms, which would lower your vision and make it harder to move. And when you climb the mountains, you’d have to avoid stuff like falling rocks and once you made it to the top, you would see a beautiful view. You could also find villages where you could sleep or trade stuff with people, and you’d even be able to interact with them and they’d tell you stories and tips.  The point of the game is to make it from one side to the other to visit your family."

ffl5ol,Inspired game idea,"This idea is inspired by overlord game, hanako-san anime and Despicable me movie.\nYou play as an agent like Gru. The story will be similar to Toilet bound hanako-san. For instance, a scientist made spark fragments that can materialise daily object by rumours told by the community to fulfill ppl dream and as a payback for what the society treated him.\nMinions similar to minions in despicable me and overlord will be obtain by defeating the first entity. Similar to Mokke in toilet bound hanako-san, they will follow u around.\nIt will be story driven. Task will be given by children. There will be different ways to approach the task. (Most of them will be funny like playing music to calm the entities, trapping entities, playing trampoline where it steps and etc)\nThe twist:\nThe player can be good or evil depending on solving the puzzle. For instance, after collecting balloons for a child, popping them will make u bad. Negatively perform take to be bad. The bad side will be a secret, but the end goal is to collect the sparks and defeat the scientist.\nIncentive of being good:\nEarn more money by interacting with npc  to upgrade minions(easier control). Design utilities. Get trust from towns ppl.\nIncentive of being bad:\nTake money from npc. Can use spark fragments as guards. Can take over the town. Don’t need to follow rules. An alternative storyline to see.\nGameplay:\nI would like it to be puzzle driven. Using the minions to get to higher place, making them go through vents, asking them to bake, using them to daze enemies. Enemies will not be killed as they r objects that r brought to life. Objects include crows, mansion, spiders, chairs, utensils and many crazy things."
ffguzc,"Red, Green, Refactor/Recycle puzzle","I was talking about TDD (Test-driven development) and thought that the red, green, refactor (would 'recycle' be better for a game?) cycle could play for a fun (puzzle?) game, but don't know how exactly :D\n\nHow could the red (fail) fit into a game?\n\nAny ideas?"
fff57s,Story driven abilities,"A game with multiple story paths/endings and each major decision made changes your powers. I was sorta coming up with with my own game like this for fun but I obviously never going to design it so if this sparks someone's creativity by all means us it.\n\nThe goal was to make a game with as much reply value as possible so obviously making branching story paths was the first thing that came to mind. Giving the players different powers was something I wanted to add because you can change the play style of each story to make it feel like a drastically different game.\n\nThe setting was suppose to be a post apocalyptic waste land that take place a 4 or more generations after a catastrophic event. Human begin to gain elemental abilities and it appears these powers tend to either coincide with the personality a person has or influences a person to act a specific way. Because of this groups of same element users tend to stick together and people would turn hostile toward others of a different element.\n\nThe story begins with you, a without powers because your parents also didn't have them. They were killed when you were young and you grew up fending for yourself. Until your powers start to awaken but they have no element. It's just pure energy at first. \n\nThat's until your first major decision. It's going to be something along the lines of helping a group of people escape the bad guys or attacking a the bad guys head on. Attacking will transform all your abilities into fire abilities and helping escape will give you water abilities. It's not going to be stated which one, but the ability would develop organically throughout the mission. You will start using your abilities and begin to realize instead of shooting out pure energy it's flames or instead on doing a basic dash you turn to water and become invulnerable while doing so.\n\nThere would a ton of other choices and power evolutions that happen like this throughout the game. From joining the different elemental clans, to betraying them, or just deciding to run solo the entire game.\n\nThat's the core of the game so let me describes some of what I envisioned the best version of the game would look like. It would be 3rd person. Depending on your powers/decisions made, it could be a shooter, action, or stealth, maybe even more. One path could possibly be a runner like some mirrors edge or something.\n\nA lot of the clan stories will involve climbing the ranks if not all of them. Since their personalities are different how you do so would be different to. One can might want you to help them build up their territories. Another might want you to take someone else's. And another might want you to fight someone else within the clan to take their positions.\n\nAlso the story with obviously have different side characters to begins throughout it but at some story points the side characters that were your friends in one play through might be your enemies on the next. I really wanted to make a player care about all of these characters so when the play gets into a point of conflict with them they are either like ""awww but he's best boy"" or ""man that guy was a dick, I'm happy I get to off him""\n\nAnyways I thought something like this would have been cool. So here's putting it out there to see if someone likes this idea or not."
ffeok3,Exploration game with meaning,"I have an idea. A simulation game with exploration aspect. To travel to dungeon u need to pay a fee. In dungeon, u can recuit fantasies, fight enemies and explore the dream world. Dungeon will be time based. The money is earned from a job. The more u go into dungeon, the more chaos the “real” world become. Other npc will persuade u to not go to dungeon, but u can mute them to put more alliance while playing dungeon. \nThe only way to get a good ending is by not doing the dungeon.

ffcf3y,Cloud Surfers - airship bandits who glides above the clouds to take down massive battleships,You are a group of aerial outlaws who specialize in robbing and taking down massive airships. A mission might go something like this: \n\n1. Approach the target from their blindspot in your carrier airship (or mother ship);\n2. The bandits will leave the ship for attack. The roles you can choose include:\n   1. Wranglers: who glide towards the target in their jet-boosted glider suit. They have a lasso EMP gun that they have to charge up by whirling above their heads then throw onto the target's turrets and defenders to deactivate and stun them. \n   2. Surfers: ride out in their canoe-sized mini fighters that has a machine gun attached. They will shooting at the airship as well as any defending enemy surfers from a distance\n   3. Cruisers: they float below the battlefield on large drones to support the people above by catching any members that are injured and falling down. They can also shoot upwards ammo and shields that the teammates above are requesting. Team members can also approach them to refuel. \n3. The battles will be chaotic it'll feel like playing a group of adventurers taking down a large titan or a group of WW2 fighter pilots taking down an aircraft carrier. My inspirations comes from Castle in the Sky and Midway. There will be gunfires bullets coming from every direction and large clouds and smokes blocking your vision.

ffab8x,Grid/hex based style cover shooter with gimmicks,"So imagine it similar to xcom I guess. Turn and grid/hex (whichever works best really) based shooter with lots of cover around, however, the main gimmick to the game is that bullets can ricochet off walls and certain classes can shoot through cover. \n\nThe idea would be to have one goal, defeat the enemy team, you have say 15 points to choose your team, and each class is worth X points, so you can choose between a lot of ""bad"" classes or fewer ""good"" classes. \n\nFor example, there could be a pistol only class worth 1 point, they have a standard pistol which works like every other game, a machine gunner which can ricochet bullets off walls for 6 and there could be a shotgunner with extremely high damage and able to break cover for 8 points. Obviously you'll have classes in between as well. What I'd want is absolute chaos, cover is available but not critical and that nowhere is safe. \n\nSorry if it's explained really badly, I am awful at explaining things, but I think you could get the idea of it from this."

Buildings shall be organic, and literally organic as they may be alive like how corals and polyps are. Individual buildings upgrade and transform/evolve on their own depending on their condition. A well maintained hatchery may grow/expand/branch out on vacant spaces nearby. A hatchery surviving several human attacks may develop defensive structures on its own.\n\n3. Building conditions may also involve the existence of adjacent buildings or their supply chain. Buildings may try to eat/kill each other or even eat/kill the units that operating them.\n\n4. Units may be wild as they can be. They may retaliate if not well fed or if they are burnt out in their tasks or if don't like their neighbor or their workmates. They may resource to feeding on their own or the facility they are working at. They may go aggressive and attack humans on the spot or flee and leave the colony for good. They may even do tasks the player is not giving them if left unchecked.\n\n5. Resources may vary from humans, human-eating livestocks, petrol-feeding crops, facilities that recycles plastics or metals into alien materials, facilities that filters oxygen and many more.\n\n6. Buildings and facilities may have tendency towards defense and military but there should be enough facilites for production and management. There can also be:\n\nA gigantic immovable queen that symbolizes the influence of the player to the creatures which should be frequently supplied with food/resources.\n\nStations that transfers supplies to the alien homeworld or stations for trading resources or recruiting units.\n\nDrop more ideas!\n\n\nLong post.

ff68wm,A game similar to SimCity but involving large corporations where expenses always increase,
ff5i5p,sporeish first person RTS,"basically how it goes i talk about the goal of the game then mechanics that would be in it\n\nSo you crash down from a planet with no memory of your past but all you know is how to survive so you have to build a city/base and have to research technology and you can recruit tribes to join you and you can conquer colonys/cities and make them pay taxes/food depending on how much ""taxes"" you make them pay they can eventually rebel. but here comes the kinda spore part, once you unlock certain low-mid/game  world goverments will start to notice you and start dipolmacy (will explain mechanic) or try to take you out depending on if you have violeated any of their world laws ( will explain mechanic) if thought you can attack aginst them and eventually take over their world or stay in  dipolmacy to build up army/defences peacfully until you wish to conquer them. When you start to conquer them you will either have to mass produce combat robots or use your colonists this is the RTS component the RTS gameplay will kinda be like total war games but also a mix of lego star wars 3 in your armys dont quite effect combat but mostly you in first person do but some units are stronger than others and may pose a threat to you once you have conquered everything your move on to the space part where you make space craft and and realise your in a rogue star solar system and your centuries away from any other solar systems/ galaxys and its your choice to continue in efforts to reach other solar systems or mass suicide everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstarting stage;\n\nYou land on the planet and you learn top down rts mechanics and the first person mechanics of the game, you can build in the top down part and your can for scavenge weapons/tech in ruined city tiles in first person, but you have to build defences and recruit your colonists to serve your Militia to defend aginst insect like species trying to infest your base, also you can enslave people or turn your people into cannibles when times get tough.  *(would talk about more  mechanics but im writing kinda in a hurry plus no one cares)*\n\nsecond/ mid game stage\n\nyou have gained enough tech research/pop you unlock mechanics like dipolmacy with other factions/govermants on the planet and it kinda switches to something kinda like a small slow game of civ but kinda like rimworld where each tile has a settlement you have to take care of but you can automate with robots eventually which will be unlockable tech, you can also trade with other factions and you will learn about the games factory and production mechanics where you can mass produce weapons/meds/robots/etc, how it flows/works/interpretation is up to the developer though as everything here is.\n\nCombat\n\nthe AI you have will run on their own as mentioned kinda like lego star wars but you have first person control of your character and the enemy will have a ""Hero"" character like yours which you either over power with your robot/people or you attack directly, thought this part is up to devs to figure out as i don't really have any clue\n\nend stage /space\n\ntheres a plot twist and apparently your on a rogue star solar system away from any galaxies . You have either allied with factions and destroyed your enemies or you have killed everyone your faction is the one ruleing your planet. becuase you have unlocked space ships by this time you can colonize other planets in your solar system in hopes that some day  there will be a chance to colonize other spaces or you can mass kill everyone and end your save.  kinda simularish to the forest ending \n\njust realised this is a shitty post/idea but oh well, hopefully it inspires someone"
ff49su,"3D Coloring Book Game,,. Video Demonstration and Download","I have developed a 3D coloring book game and I would like to know what you all think about the concept being officially made.  It would be amazing to have a developer or publisher contact me as well.\n\nThe game is called Colorfull.  \nI am hoping my concept t will be further developed into a much more expansive and immersive game and it would be very much appreciated if I can be included in payment and development!.  \nBy ""further developed""  I mean that I hope the concept is taken into consideration and remade into an official game.  \nThe concept of the game is to make a colorful 3D world.  \nYou start with either a natural or plain colored environment and click or tap on the environment to change the color of things in it.  \nFrom regular colors to neon, matte, metallic, and more.  \nThe game is really simple and great for all ages.\n\nIt is essentially a 3D coloring book.\n\nI can honestly say it is one of the most entertaining games I have played.\n\nMy hopes are that it would be made more professionally with definite colors and more. I would like for there to be hundreds of different maps from rainforest, to city, to futuristic city, fantasy, outer space, and more. even with a random map generator. It would be amazing to have your own map saves to colorize your own personal environment. I do have many more ideas for it.\n\nI have a video demonstration of the game available on youtube at\n\n[https://youtu.be/08dZTDgLTAI](https://youtu.be/08dZTDgLTAI)  \n\n\nI have made the game available to play and it can be downloaded from here:  \n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WJyf\_kt1jParqT4y3fJPOebBJ-1wOiTX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WJyf_kt1jParqT4y3fJPOebBJ-1wOiTX)  \n\n\n((You go to the top where it says ""Colorfull"" with a down arrows beside it,.., and you click it and at the bottom of the drop down list it says download))  \n\n\nI recommend clicking on everything quickly and making things colorful then going back and looking at what the new colorful environment looks like then play as preferred.  \n\n\nMy e-mail is [Marryenthlight@gmail.com](mailto:Marryenthlight@gmail.com) if you would like to inquire about it."

ewr34z,Why can't we have a game like 'Police Quest'?,"For those of you who don't know the jewel of a game called 'Police Quest: In Pursuit of Death Angel', here's the game in a nutshell:\n\nPolice point-and-click adventure game with a high amount of realism, directed by a real cop and made to give you an overview of the ruleset and regulations the police has to follow and, again, putting a high emphasis on realism. Did I mention that the game is highly focused on realism?\n\nI very recently played through it (the VGA remake) and I find it very sad that no modern game studio would publish this since the modern market probably isn't used anymore to such games and it would probably flop. However, I would really like a game like 'Police Quest' set in another job, like soldier, fireman, agent or whatever, preferably something that has ""some"" rules and regulations.\n\nOr a SWAT-themed game in the same style, they later made the SWAT-series but something still with point-and-click and higher realism..."
ewquru,A game I know for certain will probably never be made (Posting anyways),"I'm simply sharing what I would want in a video game. If by some miracle someone decides ""I'll do it"", I'll be shocked cause this ISN'T small at all. \n\nRPG Elements: \n\n* Choices - Not fake choices where the answers lead to the same result even they appear different but in truth are not (looking at you Telltale Games). No, I mean where you can from the start choose to be good, neutral, or evil. If you don't wanna help, then don't. If you want to join this group, see if you can (choosing to is different from being able to). And if the Villain offers you to join him/her/it, you should be allowed to choose. \n* Leveling Up &amp; Gaining Experience - Pretty self-explanatory. But personally with a level cap of 5k.\n* Attributes, Skills, Talents, etc - Basically a tree in everything. Hundreds of Talents, hundreds of skills, Attributes that affect literally everything about your character, the ability to learn new abilities, as well as levels in them to (like Elder Scrolls' Novice to Master for skills).\n* Crafting - Make potions, clothes, armor, weapons, place enhancements &amp; enchantments on stuff, and once you're good enough, to customize their design (with of course weight modifiers &amp; durability limits). \n* Ownership &amp; Management - To buy pretty much anything, even businesses, but have to manage expenses as well as know how to run them. To buy castles or build castles. To manage employees &amp; business ventures. To own &amp; manage a mine. Etc.\n* The Good &amp; The Bad - Not a lovey dovey world, a realistically harsh world. It's not easy to become a tradesman, a mercenary, or whatever. You have to keep at it to get anywhere. And if any characters die, they are gone forever. No one is protected by any ""can't attack"" or ""invulnerable"" mechanic, death exists (like Skyrim, children are protected, no one should be imo). And if evil exists, then so should illegal &amp; evil things exist in the world (like slavery &amp; forced labor).\n* Grave consequences - If you do stupid things in this world, you will pay dearly for it. A world where you shouldn't take anything lightly, a horrible surprise could be just around the corner. Plus if you're too trusting, people will take advantage. And if you go in thinking you're some hero that can't be beaten, the world may just crush you &amp; rip you apart. \n\nThere is so many things I could think of that would make for a fantastic ""I'll never go to sleep"" addicting game. Even having mounts of all different kinds, to tame or take control of monsters, to be a monster, to mind control your enemies or subdue your enemies &amp; later sell them to a slaver, to have a reputation tracker, and even when everything in the main game is over with, to still be allowed to keep going. And finally, if after that, you want a better challenge, initiate New Game Plus (with each time you do it, the game resets but you keep SOME of your stuff &amp; stats - each time making everything harder), and with that, certain things not found in the base game are unlocked in higher NG+ levels. \n\nWhat kind would this be in terms of view? 3rd Person, all the way. \n\nAnd if the game had a Survival in it, I'd personally want that as an option to choose from - like Subnautica &amp; No Man's Sky gives the options. But cannot be changed for any reason after starting (in other words, if you're up to NG+10 an now you want Survival, you'll have to start a completely new game). And an even harder option that can only be unlocked after beating Survival, ""PermaDeath"" - your character dies, the game will archive your character data (a memorial) while deleting your save. \n\nAnd in this ideal game, up to 4 people can play at once. \n\nOh, and this game would be set in a medieval dark fantasy world with cute creatures as well as nightmarish horrors. \n\nOnce again, just felt like sharing this. I think the closest we'll get right now to this is probably Cyberpunk 2077 (from what I've seen of it, plenty of gameplay options).   \nBut a game exactly like this? Highly doubt it exists or least doubt it will exist."
ewm8rb,A parkour game based around a blob.,"A blob is a creature I’m envisioning that is basically animate jello. It’s a squishy, jiggly creature that has the ability to jump really high, and temporarily stick to objects even when upside down.\n\nThis method of locomotion would be required to move through a city. Perhaps the roads turn into molten lava or something. Regardless, the player is required to do parkour while traveling through the game world.\n\nThroughout the game, the blob would eventually acquire more abilities than jumping. Spider-Man like grappling hooks, short term wing suits, and other assistive abilities would be gained; thus, the parkour would become more advanced. The controls, however, would be intuitive and crisp to where the parkour felt natural after a while.\n\nWhatever the objective of the game is, the player would need to be creative. For example, there may come a point in the game where in order to reach a tower on the opposite side of the street, the player has to launch his grappling hook onto a bird’s leg that’s flying across just before swinging across like Tarzan.\n\nThe game wouldn’t hint this, though. Instead, the player would be forced to use their own mind to come up with creative ways to reach certain regions of the world"

ewlefp,A game where you're a cursed cowboy who fights his way into hell to take back his soul.,"I've been playing a lot of Hunt Showdown lately and I absolutely love the aesthetic. I also really love guns like revolvers, shotguns, and bolt action rifles in video games.\n\nAnyways, I'm thinking along the lines of a cowboy like DOOM where you fight your way to the devil deep into hell to take your soul back by force. \n\nStory: you sold your soul in desperation to get out of a heist gone wrong and although it got you out, it also cursed you to be undying and attract monsters. Maybe the monsters wipe out your crew or something so you angrily fight through hell. \n\nGameplay: you fight through layers of hell and each layer has a boss demon. Enemies are a mix of armed damned souls who fight you (think like people in your characters situation who have to fight for the devil) and melee demons. Basically you should be in a ton of firefights and just feel like a badass who's getting pot shots with a rifle, fanning the hammer, and destroying tough melee enemies with a shotgun. Much like Hunt Showdown, some cool modified weapons are also welcome."

ew8kmf,Take SUPERHOT and apply it to other genres.,"Normally I dont like when someone just applies one game to another genre, but I think SUPERHOT is a unique case.\n\nIn SUPERHOT it is a FPS where time only moves when you move or do an action in game. if you dont click your mouse/keyboard time slows to a complete halt.\n\nMy firt thought was a RTS game like Age of Empires 2, where you could look around the map as much as you wanted, but any clicking or ""apm"" would speed up time.  This gets tricky/impossible with multiplayer, but thats true of superhot too.\n\n\n\nThis could apply to a top down bullethell game or something like breath of the wild as well."

ew6zrh,A game where you pick the best GIF for the situation,"Hi-\n\nMy friends and I love GIFs (they're the best form of self-expression!) and especially love finding the best GIF for the situation.

We have many possible directions:\n\ne.g., something like Cards Against Humanity where you get dealt a ""hand"" of 10 GIFs and have to pick the best one for the prompt\n\ne.g., something more like social media where you put up something that happened in your life as a prompt, and then other people have to pick the best GIF for how you might be feeling\n\nThanks for any thoughts!"
ew6k8r,The Four Cardinal Heroes (Anime Adaptation - Single &amp; Coop),"This idea is not 100% mine as it is directly based off the anime ""The Rising of The Shield Hero"", and I am aware of one on Steam by a company that called it ""The Rising of The Shield Hero: Relive The Animation"". However, that company is using basic RPG Maker and that company has made far better games with far better engines - the steam game feels like a Cash Grab than an actual game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, here's the idea:\n\nAccording to the Anime, there are FOUR Cardinal Heroes that must be summoned to be protected from the Cataclysmic World Ending Waves. However (If you haven't seen the anime from Episode 1 to 25 &amp; are interested - you'll understand why I'm adding Spoiler hidden text), &gt;!there apparently have been OTHER heroes before the ones in the anime, and seems to happen every couple hundred or so years that the world must summon the four heroes to battle The Waves, allowing for peace to once again enter the world (Peace from The Waves specifically).  !&lt;\n\nSo, I propose that this game be made EARLIER, not during the events of the anime, but set hundreds of years prior. On top of that, make it so that up to 4 players can play in the same game together. But if playing Single Player or there's 1 or more players not joining the same game, then those spots are taken over by the computer, and will go along a set path to become stronger. \n\nAs for how the how game will work or the engine to use, personally to keep from being too expensive to make, I think it would be a good idea to use a similar engine to Diablo 2 (Blizzard) or Divinity (Larian Studios), a diablo-esc style game, but can do pretty much everything in the anime, as well buy mounts, own slaves (it's in the anime, and plenty of AAA companies have slavery in many of their games), absorb materials to your Hero Weapon/Shield, Class Upgrades, etc. \n\nHowever, I would HIGHLY suggest that in order to Copy Weapons &amp; such, you'd have to acquire it via Loot Rewards or Buying it, cause otherwise if we went COMPLETELY with what happens in the anime, a Player Character could become OP way too fast. Plus certain Side Professions should be restricted based on Character level. \n\nHow Days, Weeks, and Months pass til the next Wave begins, that's something I'm unsure of. Maybe 1 hour of Real Time Play should equal 2 Hours in game, or more (not really sure how to make ""time remaining"" feel dire but not too difficult). Plus, there should be some Difficulty settings for the overall game, like Normal would be ""If a Character is defeated, they are dead"", whereas Easy would just make the defeated character unconscious or knocked out (unless entire party is defeated, then it's game over). \n\nI am highly against this game being a LITERAL MMO or an Rpg Maker cash grab. If MMO, there's no telling how many will choose the same character, plus the fact that there's only SUPPOSE TO BE 4 Heroes, not several thousand (just feels wrong to make it like that). And Rpg Maker won't allow extra players, plus it's too basic for this game adaptation (anyone could make a game with RPG Maker). \n\nSeriously, this game needs to be made properly, or at least close to proper. \n\nNow I'm sure there's other aspects I'm not considering. I had thought that maybe making it 3rd person like Dark Souls or Bloodborne would be more fitting, but could be more expensive and possibly more difficult to make. And I think even a 1st person would good like Elder Scrolls, but while many of the options (like the HUD in the anime) would be fit with this, it would ultimately limit the player character on what they could do (can't exactly do high level acrobatics in 1st person games, certainly would be damn hard to mimic the acrobatics from the anime). \n\nThis is the best I could come up with. Also, since this anime is of course owned, it would be a good idea to have another developer from another company to make it, basically offer up a license to make it (like how Bethesda offered Obsidian Entertainment to make Fallout New Vegas), someone (group or company) that has experience making this kind of game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSound good? Personally I wish I could send this directly to the owners of the anime or make a petition for this (no idea if I can honestly). But if you all think there's something that could make it better, please comment your ideas, thoughts, etc.  \n\nAlso I realize this may never happen, but I'm posting in case it does."
ew2q5u,"Survival game, but hear me out.","So I'm not sure if most of you, if any, have you touched The Division 2; but it's amazing in some aspects.\n\nVirtually the foundation would be the general environmental setting and look, the weather system, elongate the day and night cycle and some/most of the mechanics.\n\nIn my eyes the Division series had had the fundamentals for a phenomenal survival game, they just need to capitalize on it.\n\nMix in some of the mechanics from D1 Survival with your ""Appearance"" tab actually helping you; along side the whole food/water/component gathering aspect of D2 and personally I think they have the fundamentals for a phenomenal survival game.\n\nI can go in-depth for better explanations but here is the list of base mechanics that would need to be there:\n- D2's Food and Water gathering locations\n- D2's loot respawn on a slower restock time\n- D1's Survival mechanic for clothing and meds\n- D2's Settlements and Control Points\n- D2's Overall atmosphere mechanics and environment\n- D2's HUD style\n- D2's wildlife roaming the city in greater numbers and more frequently\n\n\nTake those mechanics and come up with a compelling backstory, or keep the same one and throw out the whole ""Division Agents"" aspect of it, the whole 1 vs All combat aspect of it and focus on the settlement/community aspect of it.\n\nYou'd have a sort of branching of choices as you survive.\nEstablish your own settlement or help out the others as a freelance, join one and help one thrive at the expense of the others?\nEach one has it's pros and cons.\nIf you decide to build your own, you wouldn't have any ""free"" building areas.\n\nYou have to choose a location in the map, whether it's a school, a government building, what have you, you choose one and upgrade that which slowly alters the way it looks.\n\nIf you're building in between apartment complexes, sort of like the Theater, you slowly gain access to more and more floors of the buildings by building additional stairways between them.\nStuff like that.\n\n\nNow, you may be asking ""Well, where's the danger?""\nThat is in the ever looming presence of the wild life, and the community standing between settlements. If you tend to favor one or two settlements over the other, that settlement will become increasingly hostile towards you and the other settlement(s). If the one you build up isnt providing much to the common good of the others, relations will slowly breakdown.\n\n\nThis would be no ordinary top down RTS game with community relations.\n\nThe gameplay would be damn near what D2 has. 3rd person, looter-shooter(to an extent), crafting, expansion, ect.\nBut survival, but not for just your own cause.\n\nBut the city(possibly a state even).\n\nTo the point where if you rally the other settlements in your city, you guys sort of form a conglomerate with you in charge and the old settlement leaders are your advisors and you can either slowly form one massive union of settlements in the state and work in efforts to make life as close to how it was; or go against diplomacy and make enemies.\n\nTL; DR: The Division Series has AMAZING mechanics and an outstanding atmosphere to bolster a survival game with a few tweaks and additions to the mechanics and story; but it will never achieve that sadly."
evvya0,"Farming sim during wartime, feed the troops and deal with people going/coming home","So another step in evolution over the typical farming sim. I’m thinking around WWI time period (but not exactly historically accurate).\n\nYour older brother leaves the farm to you to manage. His company go overseas to fight and its your job to send supplies when you can. You’ll send food initially then things like shovels, warm clothes. The men of the town that left gradually come back wounded and the community has to deal with that.\n\nI’m thinking the first season all the men are preparing to go overseas and you can get to know them and their backstories but every time you play there’s a chance some (all?) might not make it back. The chance of coming back is tied to how many supplies and of what quality you’re able to send.\n\nYou can play as male or female but there are a lot more women around initially as they’re not off fighting. Of the men that do come back, some are wounded, a bit traumatized (I want to be sensitive here).\n\nAlso this is on top of a regular farming sim. So the other townsfolk try to get along with their lives and have their own stories. Since this is around WWI ppl need ice to cool things down in the summer so there are ice caves to explore. There’s also dealing with the trouble of raising crops, making supplies etc.\n\nWorking title is Homefront Harvest\n\n\nThoughts?"

evtaxx,Fantasy Wild Nature Preservation Park - Firewatch meets Monster Hunter,"Hi there!\n\n So I had idea for a game where you are actually **Wild Nature Park Ranger** in the exclusion zone in a fantasy world after big war/catastrophe that makes only this place be the last place to magical creatures to live.   \nYou are running around park hunting poachers and invasive species guided by your biologist friend.   \n In 3rd person, you run climb and make small camps to get from goal to goal which can be hunting poachers, preparing traps, healing creatures, collecting samples. Sometimes the story would bring somethings special to do like preparing to catch one special specimen or help creatures to survive flood or forest fire.  \n**Fight with monsters would be possible but not encouraged** since you can use nonlethal options to deal with creatures (unless these are invading species)\n\n**Like in Firewatch** important part of the game would be your developing relation with your biologist friend who is fascinated with this fantasy world which is just shadow of crumbled world and is really ideological and you who is out there all the time and know that fantasy monsters are not just pretty birds and are happy that these are not running around us anymore like they used to be.  \nI am thinking about moral choices like you can actually support poachers to get better gear or more money and eventually when time is right to decide about fate of the Park. \n\n**What I am worried about is that this game would be a big fetch quest : /** wich I hope would be tolerated if story and world would be good and mechanic like healing wounds and diseases of creatures would bring something to it.  \nTell me what do you think.  \nCheers!"
evp98m,A first person horror where you need to hide you're sick,"It's the future! Plague is no more!  \n..Or so you're taught as a kid..  \n\n\nUnsure how it was even possible you wake with a horrible cough and a blistering headache. What do you do? You'd heard rumours sick people get taken away and they're never seen again. It's probably best you hide it, this will blow over quickly enough.  \n\n\nIt doesn't.  \n\n\nAs the week progresses you start having horrid hallucinations, you can barely walk straight. Luckily so far people seem to think you've recently discovered a strong passion for drinking but how long until they tip off an authority something's odd about you? You need to figure out how to get better and fast, or at least stay hidden better.  \n\n\nBy next week you've got a strong paranoia of anything moving, you decide only moving around at night is best. You even dart from alley to alley to avoid being spotted. You're hallucinations have gotten worse, everyone looks so grotesque and you're begining to beleive they're actually monsters.  \n\n\nFast forward the plot because I've written the jist of it: The entire time you thought you were in a utopia you were in a stasis cell. The world around you is filled with horrid creatures just like your visions entailed, visions which happened because somehow a part of the virus managed to get into your pod. Your pod, being alerted to your worsening condition, opens and releases you into the real world and now you need to scramble around for a cure. A cure you'll never find. The game ends with you having more hallucinations you're back in your utopia like nothing ever happened and you die trying to find a cure that never existed."
evot50,Ideas on how to spice up a multiplayer 4x game.,"I'm a fan of 4x and empire building games and have always wanted a multiplayer version, yet actually implementing this with large numbers of players runs into a variety of obvious problems.  The biggest one is how to not turn it into a pay-to-win game, while also not making it boring (you can only do so much each day) or overly mandatory (so that you don't get ruined if you don't log in for a few days).  Some ideas I had on spicing things up:\n\n1. Giant roaming monsters, who may spawn smaller monster armies, might be interesting and function as a sort of ""wild card"" against things becoming long and predictable.  Attacking a monster directly, you probably can't kill it but you could get it to change the direction it's walking in if you sacrifice enough troops.\n2. Lots of negotiation and alliance options.\n3. Some RNG in the army battles (a lot like the game Risk).\n4. A buffer of resources that can build up in case you don't log in for awhile.\n5. Some kind of guerrilla warfare or privateer layer.  This is the least well fleshed out idea but basically, small scale wars that happen over a faster pace with lower stakes.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Especially about #1 and #5."
evmwg4,Tribal African Soulslike horror-platformer with an indie touch,"While listening to a certain game's soundtrack, I had the weirdest (but coolest) idea for a game. I'm no game developer, but I brought up my ideas to a friend of mine who is an aspiring game developer. Here were our ideas, taken straight from the char we were having about the game:\n\nThe game's (working) name is ""Isihogo Nezulu: A Tale of Vengeance"" (Isihogo Nezulu meaning ""Hell And Heaven"" in Zulu, a language that'll be popping up here a lot).\n\nThe story would be set in an indigenous, tribal Africa, starring a hero with extremely questionable morals and motives, in a ruined world from a war between the underworld's demons and the gods up above. In a reckless attempt to resolve the situation, he goes to a very suspicious shaman to perform a ritual to resolve the conflict, but the shaman curses the hero instead. The gods notice what happened and tell him that the shaman was a very infamous one with a horrible history, and the gods banish him to the lowest depths of the underworld. Now, using vengeance as his motivation, he fights his way back to the top, swearing revenge on the shaman, the gods, and the demons he's trapped with.\n\nWe're going for a real tribal African aesthetic here, with characters wearing [tribal African masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_African_masks), [an art style based on African textiles / tapestries,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_textiles) music utilizing deep drums, droning flutes, and mysterious vocalizations. \n\nThe gameplay would be a Dark Souls-like combat horror platformer, with grotesque beings (even the heavenly gods) at every turn, tight, visceral combat, and tricky platforming. An upgrade system would let you upgrade certain parts of the hero, but consecutive deaths lower the effectiveness of each upgrade. \nA system we're planning to implement are ""Rage"" bars which works like Yakuza's Heat system. Performing attacks on monsters will raise the bars, and by giving up one or two filled Rage bars, you can perform monster-destroying moves that let you get upgrades better. We think of implementing a Binding of Isaac-style weapon system, where you can find weapons with their own pros and cons, respectively. We think players should experiment with their found weapons and find a favorite. Weapons break, though, so use them wisely.\n\nI'm thinking of a lives/continue system. After your life count runs dry, you're sent to an extremely ominous and unsettling Continue screen, where the hero lies dead, surrounded by a circle of dancing demons uttering a strange chant. Continuing will produce a blinding and ear-shattering flash of thunder as your character mysteriously rises from the dead. Refusing to continue has the ritual failing, the demons gruesomely dying, and your body being left for dead. ""Indaba isiqediwe"", the game over screen says. Continuing has a price, though, which I will get to.\n\nI plan on a multiple difficulty system, which is as follows: \n\nIsipikili (Daydream) - ""For those who want an easy experience.""\n\nIphupho (Dream) - ""For those who want something a little more challenging.""\n\nUbusuku (Nightmare) - ""The standard experience. For the more experienced player.""\n\nUsongo lobusuku (Night Terror) - ""An even tougher experience.""\n\nUbusuku obumangazayo (Never-ending nightmare) - ""Even the toughest players around will be crying for Umama (mother) in this ultra-tough difficulty.""\n\nNight Terror is unlocked by beating Nightmare, Never-ending Nightmare is unlocked by beating Night Terror. I plan exclusive finds and enemy types for the last two.\n\n\nMy friend suggests a branching-path story where your decisions alter the levels, enemies, and story.\n\nLet's elaborate on the Never-Ending Nightmare difficulty. We plan to make this a hardcore-style difficulty where upgrades and weapon drops are extremely randomized, you may get a very powerful weapon, but with piss-poor durability, where even striking the smallest enemy destroys the weapon you just got. Or maybe a seemingly powerful upgrade ending up being useless in the long run. Death does not give you a chance to come back from the dead, where an ominous message will be displayed in place of the continue screen, automatically sending you back to the title screen. \n\nLastly, the continue screen will have a very big importance in the story. Even beating the game on Nightmare, the so-called ""standard"" difficulty, won't be a happy end. Friend suggests that the pieces of the best possible ending should be scattered around the difficulties. Completing all of them should unlock a final difficulty which puts all your skill to the test to get your happiest ending. The circle of demons will have an importance in this happiest ending.\n\nThis is all I can write for now, please give me suggestions on how I can improve these ideas. Thanks!!"
evjrez,A Mount &amp; Blade mod set in what is now Canada around 1000 AD,"I really want to develop a mod set in North America during the early middle ages, so that I could depict cultures like the Dorset, Beothuk, Salish, Haida, Algonquin, Iroquis &amp; Ojibwe and I want to include the Norse settlement attempts too.\n\n I know that some of these societies weren't around in 1000 and I have looked really hard for maps that depict the groups that made up North America at this time but funny enough I can only find a timeline of maps for the Arctic. (Maybe the human evidence has been preserved better in the cold :-P ) I would be grateful if someone does have data on what groups would be in the area that makes up Southern Canada and the Great Lakes part of the USA around 1000ad.\n\nLoose cultural groups would be represented with a united power structure as kingdoms/chiefdoms with leadership for the sake of gameplay. Here are some cool features I'd like to give each culture:\n\n* The Innu/Dorset dogsleds as a mount\n* The Haida Gwaii as an industrious, relatively densely populated place with  a couple major settlements\n* Ojibwe, Algonquin and the Iroquois Confederacy as major powers in the Prairies and Great Lakes regions, pockets of Cree to the north(?)\n* Game starts with a Norse city on the west coast of Greenland with maybe a fort and a couple villages. A fort in Newfoundland surrounded by Beothuk, and maybe a fort on Baffin Island surrounded by Dorset (might be a stretch historically but \*fun!\* )\n\nGameplay mechanics to change:\n\n* No horses - would the Norse have possibly had any?\n* Making the journey to the Arctic a challenging barrier with rewards. For example there might be an ice path to the Nunavut areas that freezes and thaws according to the calendar. (Maybe an accelerated calendar with 7 day months?) A merchant playthrough could get wealthy by selling southern food and  weapons to the pre-inuit Dorset who would in exchange have cheap ivory, artworks and rare furs to trade with down south.\n* Maybe secondhand/middle-manned contact with Mesoamerican societies in the southwest boundary of the map. A Jaguar warrior very far from home would be a cool companion and a macahuitl would make a good high-power endgame weapon.\n* Survival mechanics when travelling on the world map? Having adequate food to feed your party or starving in a way that is more challenging than vanilla warband\n\nI would love to hear input and criticism on this one as if I stick with it i could definitely develop it, maybe taking forever to do so. Especially on how to make the gameplay more interesting, since I haven't got many ideas on how to make it especially interesting yet."
evjmic,"Survival horror-ish dream i had, about running a carnival and being attacked by ghosts","i had a weird dream and had to get it down before i lost it, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou are at a school like location putting on a carnival with People that are helping you run the rides, make food to sell, ect. but they were very... stiff(?) moving, so i almost think they were animatronic, and the rest of the dream made me think of fnaf in weird ways, so i'm going to refer to them as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n some of the customers are ghosts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe problem is that some of the animatronics are very bad at their job, so you have to keep up with them to make sure they arent giving customers wrong orders or dangerous things, or to make sure they arent cheating on the games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthen the ghosts will join in, making a mess of things and trying to make orders go bad, and occasionally they will be customers and jumpscare you if their order is too wrong or their game is unfair because the animatronic glitches and cheats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou can also lose if too many customers are unsatisfied, but this doesnt give a jumpscare, but a fakeout one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe other half of the game is about exploring the locations around and in the school and finding the ghosts where they died, and apeasing them. each ghost you apease unlocks new minigames and new locations, and each location has a handfull of new ghosts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe one from my dream that i remember the best is a girl with a broken jaw that sort of... hangs a little too low. and when she attacks, it opens wide and she just takes a chunk out of you, killing you in 3-4 hits. i remember going into a basement area and it was dark and creepy, but nothing dangerous happens until i get too deep and then i see her standing at the end of a hall, and i have to run back out. the problem is, she likes to teleport behind you, so you have to constantly keep turning in circles, because she backs off if you see her. keeping an eye on her for a second can fend her off, but if you stare too long she just backs up into darkness and disapears, ready to strike again.\n\nthe way to appease her was to earn money from minigames and come back with cookies you buy, i think?\n\n\---------------------\n\nso thinking about it after i woke up, you would need a mechanic for making other ghosts more hostile either over time or after appeasing one, maybe as you appease ghosts more areas appear but with them come more ghosts, so there's a natural feel of progression. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfor an ending, I'm thinking maybe when you run out of ghosts to appease, you find out instead of leaving, your gifts were an invitation of sorts and they have been hiding in the animatronics, waiting, and evenutally (when all ghosts are hiding) take their chance to book it. Good ending might be going through much harder sections trying to find how/why/when/where the ghosts were killed and offering them harder to get items at that location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmaybe... if you do this for all ghosts, very good ending, \n\nfor more then half but not all, slightly good ending, \n\nand less then half, bad ending. (or none at all, worst ending)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso once i've got me something with caffine and some food, i'll probably come back and clean this up a bit, its sort of rambly for my tastes."

evc6jl,Looking for help with 2D Western Duel mobile mechanic,"Hello r/gameideas! Not long enough me and my friend decided to start developing games. \n\nWe ended up with simple idea for our first mobile game, just to try out Godot engine and such. It is 2D standoff/duel in Western style for 2 players (PvP) or 1 player vs bots for iOS and Android.\n\nThe mechanic is also very simple. Player 1 is on a left side of a screen, Player 2 or bot is on a right. And after countdown we display a random combination of 4 keys (X,Y,B,A), which player need to press to shoot. Who pressed it faster — wins. \n\nWe almost finished the game. Even added some physics and 2D ragdoll, when player dies and such (it was actually difficult). But we realized the game itself is actually boring. We were thinking about adding upgrades to player character, such as better weapon, which improves your time or so. But it’s still pretty boring. We want to add something to this game, which will improve it in a way to almost endless gaming experience or so. (I am exaggerating a little bit)\n\nMaybe you, guys, have some ideas?\n\nP.S. sorry for my English, it’s not my native language"
evaoyd,Bigfoot survival game where you play as bigfoot,"I've been playing a lot of survival games lately like DayZ, Rust, The Forest, etc. I've also been listening to some podcasts about bigfoot.\n\nWhich gave me the idea, someone should make a game where you play as bigfoot, trying to survive, feed yourself, shelter, etc while also avoiding encounters with man. Single player would make the most sense, since you would want the AI for the humans to be pretty simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe you could pick from different environments, like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Semi-rural. You live in the woods near houses, so its a lot more likely that deer hunters and kids might be around, but you have a lot more opportunity to get food from the garbage and supplies from around the houses to build your shelter.\n2. Remote, your 100 miles into the canadian rockies from the closest town, but its much more difficult to forage.\n3. Rural. There are some farms nearby where you can steal pigs and chickens and pilfer supplies, but you still have to be careful about hikers and hunters, but not as much as semi-rural.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would be a camouflage button, where you can stand still in the brush and ""disappear"" when humans are nearby, unless they get too close. If they get too close you can growl or something to scare them, but if its a hunter there should be a chance they could shoot you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA ""bubble"" around things like security cameras, trail cams, etc so you know how close you can get.\n\nThen a sort of ""wanted"" system like Grand Theft Auto, so if you get seen too many times by people or cameras, or steal too much food / supplies, it increases the likelihood you'll have hunters come after you with guns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game itself being ""how long can you survive?"" If you chose a semi-rural area, you're going to have less game to hunt to feed yourself so you have to take from houses, which increases the chances you get found and shot. Or if you chose remote, its very easy to not be caught, but much more difficult to feed and shelter yourself. This allows players to decide if they want to take the Metal Gear method of sneaking around to get what they want, or do they want to do the brute force survival mode where food and supplies are harder to find but less sneaking."

euy2bh,Reign of Death (Play as Villain),"No idea what flair to put this under.\n\nThis one is set in Modern times (2000-2020).\n\nFinally after centuries of sleep, you awake from your prison and have freed yourself! But the world has changed in ways you never expected... The world has forgotten. The world where real power ruled &amp; struck fear into the hearts of millions has been reduced to mere myth. \n\nYou will remind the world that you are no myth, and that they should NOT have forgotten. \n\nThankfully your wardens have abandoned their duty, and all that remains of them is unbelievers. While it is kind of a relief, it does sadden you to know that even the descendants of your enemies do not know the truth, that they too have power within them. \n\nOh well. At least there's a graveyard nearby... Soon the world will remember what it's like to have Death walk amongst them again. \n\nIdea:\n\nYou're not a Vampire, you're not a Mummy, you're not long forgotten Warlock, you are representation of Death in Life; a Lich. You have untold &amp; incredible power. \n\nBut, being asleep for so long has taken it's toll, you only remember a few things: \n\nAspect of Life - Disguise yourself as any living person. But you can't just make it up, you have to find someone, kill them, then claim their identity for yourself. It doesn't last forever, it will eventually begin to rot and fall off, so you should have ""spares"" available. \n\nRaise Corpse - The most basic. You just need to find a corpse, give it a kiss, and it will rise to serve your every whim. They typically don't make for good soldiers, but it's better than nothing. At first you can only control a maximum of 10. Eventually you'll be able to control hundreds.\n\nSiphon - Life is where your power resides, but you need to take it from others. You can choose to take it all, which will make them into a corpse, or you can take some, but not enough to kill your victims, they'll eventually regain what they lost, so if you hold on to them, you'll have your own batteries. \n\nEverything else, you've forgotten. If only you had access to all your powers, then you wouldn't have to slowly build up. \n\nThe Graveyard will work for now, it has an underground crypt, which you can expand and form your own personal outpost, at least until you find a more permanent residence.\n\nFor now, you're not strong enough to take on the world - you need to build yourself up. You need to find remnants of script, you hope that some of the ancient world has survived the decay of time.\n\nWhile your minions work on building your temporary lair, you need to venture out into the city, learn of this new world, this new time you've awakened into, and maybe, just maybe you'll figure out how to conquer it.\n\nConcept:\n\nYou are immortal. You have powers. But the world has technology you're unfamiliar with. You can build a base, you can make yourself a laboratory, after finding books that peak your interest, you can make yourself a library &amp; perform research (possibly find clues to the locations of components &amp; spells you need), and eventually, you'll be able to make thralls (Living slaves under your control) and slowly but surely claim the world as your own. \n\nThere's plenty that can be done. I haven't completely fleshed out this idea. But I imagine the right person could figure out how to make it a good long game. \n\nIf you wish to use this idea, feel free to do so. I usually am able to unload a ton of ideas, but I've been up for almost 30 hours and can't think of anything else to add to it. \n\nAnd if you want to add more to this idea, feel free to do so with that as well."

eutyyx,Warhammer 40k: Astartes Management (would require a license from GW no doubt),"I chose ""AAA"" cause it is associated (or at least has to do with) with Games Workshop, and given they are the owners of Warhammer 40k, it is very likely to require a license to even make a game based on their universe - hence why ""AAA"" makes sense.\n\nSo the idea is that you get to form your own Astartes Chapter (exactly like the Fan made ones), you are given options as to what your Chapter is based on (like the Blood Ravens from Dawn of War are based on The Blood Angels), you are then allowed to do a color scheme for your Chapter Space Marines, then you are given the choice of what type of World your Chapter will call Home (Feral, Death, Hive, Feudal, etc) as well as what Segmentum (except for Solar, where Terra is).\n\n\--Just in case: I'm aware there are Fleet based Fortress Monasteries and other like The Dark Angels' ""The Rock"" that is built in space, but have those two would likely over-complicate gameplay.\n\nNow comes the next bit: Building and Designing your Fortress Monastery (FM). This could be quite tricky since a FM can be built and designed in pretty much any way and in any location - Some are built out in the open like a massive compound or small city, or built inside mountains, or Built as one massive structure, and can even be built underground. \n\nYou design the exact layout of the entire FM. Then you when you are done, your Space Marines will begin to show up, and begin filling the room, utilizing the mess halls, training amongst each other, etc. \n\nNow the fun bits:\n\nThe Chapter must always have a Chapter Master leading the entirety of the Chapter, so you get to choose who you want as Chapter Master, you'll be shown plenty of candidates for the position, their stats, their leadership experience, their good parts &amp; bad parts, how many battles they were in prior to being assigned to this Chapter, etc. \n\nOnce you've chosen, you'll then get to control your recruiting worlds, what your criteria is for consideration for recruitment, and your trial methods (every recruit MUST pass incredibly difficult trials in order to be considered worthy of becoming Astartes Space Marines), and you can choose how often your soldiers will go off on recruitment missions. \n\nNext you'll be informed that as Chapter Master, you are obligated (well required) to ensure the safety of the worlds in your sector, to keep the laws of the Imperium, and to respond to all requests for aid. \n\nAfter that, you'll be given a list of missions for your Chapter to undertake, these can be: Patrolling, Escort, Cultist Hunting, Putting down civil unrest on any planets, backing up any of the other Imperium based factions that also operate in your sector, and you'll be alerted to discoveries of incursions from Orks, Necron, Chaos, Tyranid, Eldar, and even FM Defense. \n\nEvery mission you undertake once completed successfully will award you with War Gear, Extra Ships, Imperium Favor (used as currency), Temporary % boosts (like XP for troops sent on mission, higher success chance, higher recruitment chances, % boosts to more Injured troops and less KIA, etc), and higher standing with those planets. \n\nNow, you can send your Chapter Master on some of these missions to greatly increase odds of success &amp; gain much higher rewards, but like every Space Marine KIA, your Chapter Master can get killed too. In the event of your Chapter Master dying, you'll have to choose a new candidate for the position. \n\nThe more your troops go on missions, the more you'll gain, but even they can get fatigued, and sending them on too many missions can decrease overall morale, increase discontent, and affect performance in the field. \n\nThe idea is to experience what it is REALLY like to manage a Chapter. And it is totally possible that your entire Chapter could get wiped out, and obviously if that happens, it's Game Over.   \nOn top of this, every 10 to 20 years, a Representative from the Imperium will arrive to review your success/failure ratio. If you do good on your review, you'll receive bonus awards. But if you receive a bad review, your Chapter will receive penalties, and in those instances, you'll get to access Redemption Missions which will help remove the penalties placed on your Chapter. \n\nHowever, if you receive too many bad reviews, your Chapter will undergo an Inquisition review. If the Inquisitor finds your Chapter lacking, then it subsequently be disbanded and then Game Over.  \n\nIt is meant more as a Management type game rather than like Dawn of War games where you command an army &amp; use RTS tactics to win, when they get sent on missions, you'll see a count down for those missions you undertook, and after the allotted time, you'll be presented with a ""Failure"" or ""Succcess"" window, which will detail what happened during the mission, if anyone was KIA, any prisoners taken for questioning, as will show what you gain from that mission if successful. \n\nThe only times where there would be any visual combat is when you have to defend your FM for any reason, and the defense of the FM will be considered High Priority. \n\n\-----------------------\n\nThat's all I got. If you want to add more to it please do so. With GW considering to step up in Media with Tv Shows, Movies, and possibly more games, it would be epic if something like could be made. \n\nAlso, I realize there pretty much is no such thing as money for Chapters, they usually just request &amp; sometimes will get what they need. I'm just thinking that if we add a currency, that players could reach a point where they could use that Favor to get stuff or pay for better reviews (a way of dodging bad reviews which could lead to disbanding). \n\nThe other point is to last as long as possible and that ultimately your Chapter will lose in some way. You're not the Ultra Marines, Blood Ravens, Death Watch, Dark Angels, Space Wolves, Salamanders, etc, you're a new Chapter that has to learn what it means to manage a Chapter in a universe where there is only war."

eujq6w,AR game idea,"I have a potentially cool game idea but want some advice on it. This is an AR treasure hunt game, where users are able to place a visual AR treasure into the world, and then post the “treasure hunt” it in the app, giving a clue, for people to go find it. Think geocaching, but AR.\n\nYou can search for treasure hunts near your current location, and will get a radius over the area that the treasure is within that you need to find. For example, the treasure would be shown within a 5 mile radius, you’re given a set of clues, and then it’s up to you to find where it could be. And you can only see the treasure using your phone camera with AR.\n\nThe treasure hunt can have multiple checkpoints, meaning that you could solve the first clue, only to find the next virtual clue, making you have to travel around to multiple places before you finally find the end treasure. And the more difficult the treasure hunt, the greater the prize. And I am thinking that treasure hunts will have a time limit, so there is a great pressure to get out there and find the treasure before time runs out!\n\nIt’d probably have to start off being tested in one city, so that the number of treasure hunts and user base would be plentiful, before it is used everywhere.\n\nI personally would love an app like this! I think it’d be so fun.\n\nThe only part of this game idea though that I’m struggling with is to find a way to implement a good reward for finding treasures. In Pokémon go for example, the reward for finding Pokémon is that you then have a good chance of fighting and winning a gym. What could be some possible ways that I could make people want SO badly to go exploring to find treasure? Also, what kind of virtual treasures would people want to find?"

eucy23,A Seller Quest : The Sallabar Market," And here is a third little concept that came to me while playing Slay the Spire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Seller Quest : The Sallabar market**\n\n**Introduction :**\n\n*A Seller Quest : The Sallabar market* is a deck-building game combined with some role-playing elements. You are a young merchant from the tied kingdoms of Maje and Cyria who dreams of going to the legendary Sallabar market in the heart of the powerful Kovir Empire.\n\n**Narrative :**\n\nYou play as a young merchant from the tied kingdoms of Maje and Cyria who is trying to become famous enough to be able to go to the famous Sallabar market in the center of the Kovir Empire.\n\nYou will meet many people during your journey who will try to swindle you and you will have to be smarter and luckier than them. You will discover many regions full of surprises and challenges that will put your sales skills to the test.\n\n**Title-** A Seller Quest : The Sallabar market\n\n**Genre**\- Deck-building/Role-playing\n\n**Platforms**\-PC/PS5/Switch\n\n**Target Audience**\-\~10+\n\n**Mode**\- Single-player (+multi-player?)\n\n**Victory/Failure conditions :**\n\nThe objective of the game is to obtain the exchange which will be in your favor during a merchant match. The goal is not only to succeed in transactions but above all to obtain the best possible exchange while avoiding being at a disadvantage. There is not really a game over, a defeat affecting your total resources, while these resources will only limit you in the exchanges that you can initiate.\n\n**Core Gameplay :**\n\nThe game is divided into a ""combat"" phase and a preparation phase. The ""fights"" take place in turn-based combat and make you use a system of cards to represent the hard work of negotiation. Using your card deck allows you to counter the actions of buyers trying to trick you. Certain actions taking place outside of ""combat"" can influence these in various ways.  \n\nWhen you are not in ""combat"" you can either be on the world map, which allows you to advance in your quests, to collect useful objects and to develop the history of your merchant or be in your traveling caravan to prepare your deck, your goods and your skills.\n\n**Graphical and sound atmosphere :**\n\nThe game has a rather nice atmosphere with warm and colorful graphics. The general style is inspired by fantasy, the map drawn is a fairly concrete example of this. For the music the inspiration could come from certain old role-playing style games like the Dragon's Quest. The style of the game can also be inspired by that of the Arab and Mongolian countries for the merchant atmosphere.\n\n**USP :**\n\n\-Prepare yourself for intense negotiation using your action cards, surpass your enemies and become the masters of the merchants.\n\n\-Explore the vast regions of Maje, Cyria and Kovir and start your journey to the legendary Sallabar market.\n\n\-Collect many unique cards allowing you to approach the fights in your own way."

This will allow you to learn different skills, there would be some mini game to check if you are a good or bad student\n2) there would be magical duels: in order to cast a spell you learned, you have to press a cast button then you have to type the magical formula to really cast the spell\nThe more time you spend typing the formula the more you loose mana.

Does it sound fun?"

eu95tr,Mila's Song : A Legend of Choros,"Here is a second idea that came to me but this time I also imagined a large part of the universe that could be behind it.\n\n**Mila's Song : A Legend of Choros**\n\n**Introduction :**\n\n*Mila's Song : A Legend of Choros* is a (2D?) action role-playing and adventure game that take place in the mysterious kingdom of Chiros and the mighty Empire of the Typhon. You control Mila in her initiation quest using an unusual system of spells. You control Mila in her initiatory quest using an unusual system of spells while discovering the links that unite her to this forgotten kingdom.\n\n**Narrative :**\n\nMila is a normal girl who tries to make a living from sculpture. Disillusioned with life, she finds herself spending most of her time for mind-numbing little jobs which has made her taciturn and lonely. She meets in the street a strange masked individual who does not seem to be seen by anyone other than her. The stranger then asks her to remember the Kingdom of Chorus and Ophion before mysteriously disappearing. When Mila wakes up the next morning she is no longer in her room but in front of an extinct campfire in the heart of a kingdom that she doesn't know, or at least she thinks so.\n\n**Title-** Mila's Song : A Legend of Choros\n\n**Genre-** Adventure/Action role-playing\n\n**Platforms-** PC/PS5/Switch\n\n**Target Audience-** \~12+\n\n**Mode**\- Single-player\n\n**Victory/Failure conditions :**\n\nMila tries to solve the secrets of Choros so that she can go home. For that she will face the monsters that reign on these lands and solve the mystery of the Gray Fever that drives the inhabitants of Choros crazy.\n\nIf Mila fails to fight, she can be brought back with the help of the stranger to her last resting point.\n\n**Core Gameplay :**\n\nThe gameplay of the game is separated into two main phases: fighting and exploring the big dungeons of Choros.\n\nDuring combat Mila can use two main weapons, a short and fast sword and a long and heavy spear which she can use to form deadly combos. But the peculiarity of the game appears when Mila prepares to use her spells, combinations of the four power words Aeris / Ignis / Terra / Aqua which she can enter to form unique spells (ZL\[hold\]+A/B/X/Y). The main battles put Mila against powerful enemies like the pirate lord Antiphatès the giant, the crocodilian monster Cottos or the witch of illusions Circe.  \n\nDuring the exploration phases Mila solves the puzzles of the various dungeons and eliminates the enemies that stand in its way. She will also be able to retrieve new tools that will help her advance in her adventure and will cross many different regions like the great city of Hypnos, the ancient ruins of Moros or the sandy desert of Aura.\n\n**Graphical and sound atmosphere :**\n\nThe game refers to the dream world and the psychology of Mila, so it comes out with a rather strange and almost unreal atmosphere filled with forgotten ruins. Choros is a mirror of Mila's life and we can therefore find mixed with this fantastic universe some elements reminiscent of the city of Mila, Neo-Paris which was built when the third world war ended in 2030.\n\nThe music is inspired by that of ancient cultures (Greeks / Romans) and Arabs whit the addition of a touch of futurism regarding Mila.\n\n**USP :**\n\n\-Take part in tactical and wild battles against enemies with unique skills.\n\n\-Discover an exciting and subtle magic system that will allow you to launch impressive combos.\n\n\-Explore the vast dungeons of the kingdom of Choros and discover the dark secrets they contain about Mila's past."
eu8eka,A online multiplayer fps with different eras,"There are ton of video games that put themselves in one specific time or era. Like ww2 or ww1 or some futuristic ww3 type era. \n\nMy idea is why not make a game with combines them in a way, let me explain instead of sticking to one era we take alot of the major time periods and the battles and armys that were big. Like the Roman's and gauls and persians, Spartans, Greeks etc generally more ancient armys. Then the more like medieval armys like the british the French maybe the ottomans but I'm hoping you're getting a view of what I'm getting at. \n\nTaking the various armys and splitting them up into to era/categories in the game up until the modern day, the way it would work is you sign in and pick the era you'd like to play in and then pick from various classic modes tdm and capture the flag but some eras would have game modes specifically restricted to that era. Like one might have a calvary only mode or a joust.\n\nI hope that my idea is coherent enough."
eu85ml,Imbalanced team game- The Dungeon,"I’ve probably explained this awfully, sorry.\n\nYou can queue as either an Overseer (1), a Minion (6) or a Raider (4). The Overseer creates a dungeon (before queueing) following one of three layout schemes, and places traps/bosses in certain rooms (limited to three bosses across the dungeon). It’s the job of the Raiders to fight their way through the dungeon and kill the Overseer (who will act as the final boss). \n\nThe Overseer can dispatch Minions to certain locations to attack the Raiders, Minions being weaker but harder to hit and among them there is one (randomly selected) miniboss minion. When the Overseer does dispatch Minions, they will receive a prompt on their screen to head to where they have been dispatched (failure to do so will result in eventual teleportation there) and they will engage the Raiders. Minions can respawn in their Barracks, which are behind the Overseer’s room. The Overseer also has the ability to control the bosses rather than their AI. They can make these bosses go anywhere within their room, but not inside.\n\nRaiders, once downed, have a 15 second period in which they can be revived- if they are not revived then they are out of the game, and can respawn as a Minion if they wish to do so. They collect loot from enemies along the way and if they kill the Overseer they win."
eu633r,"a total war game where you play as the leader of your faction, can participate in the battles","tho really it's more of Kingdom Under Fire: Crusaders but with Dark Souls combat mechanics that goes down in scale as your forces dwindle\n\nthe game would start off like a normal dark souls game, gives you a sword and lets you stab your way thru mindless hollows, but gives you no magics and no ring items despite having one empty ring slot. You get to the bridge to leave the keep that the game starts in and there's some crossbowmen &amp; spearmen scattered across it (this idea was specifically inspired by the drake bridge in dark souls 1, right before the drake showed up the first time i got really excited by this idea and then disappointed once the drake showed). As you run across the closest enemy initiates a boss fight, referred to on the boss healthbar just as ""sergeant"", as the rest of the enemies form a boss arena out of a shield wall and the archers retreat down to the end of the bridge. You kill the sergeant and he drops an item, and then the game resumes right where you are -- the spearmen who've encircled you become hostile, either you fight them while encircled and get cut down or you break thru one of the shield walls to get all the spearmen on one side of you at which point you've put yourself between the enemy crossbowmen and their allies and get cut down by archer fire.\n\nYou respawn at the bonfire, and get the chance to look at the items. The first is a boss soul and the other is ""Sergeant's Ring"". Equipping it gives you +1 ring slot, and unlocks an option at the bonfire to imbue your Sergeant's Ring, putting up to 5 souls into it. You pop the boss soul to level up and spend the 5 extra souls to imbue your ring, and when you stand up from the bonfire, souls fly from your character into 5 of the mindless hollows who were huddled in the dirt nearby who get up as well and shuffle over to you. You now have two spells in your spell slots, ""line up with me"" and ""disperse &amp; attack nearby enemies"", you select your allies with the f1-f5 keys or tilde to select/unselect all.\n\nYou fight your way back to the bridge and the sergeant is back. You initiate the fight again but this time his men don't just encircle you, they charge your men. They clash, you and the sergeant duel, you win, you break the enemy shield wall and then you &amp; your small group crush them and when the enemy archers begin opening fire with no allies between you &amp; them you charge them and have canon fodder to absorb archer fire as you go. With the archers is another sergeant and a Lieutenant boss who fights you and your surviving allies in melee while the archers give them support, once they fall the captain drops an item and after the bridge is a bonfire at which you get to inspect it.\n\nThis new item is ""Lieutenant's Ring"". It gives +1 ring slot, unlocks option to imbue it with up to 2 souls. You level up, spend 2 souls to imbue your new ring, spend 10 souls to re-imbue your Sergeant's Ring (assuming you were the sole survivor lol) and when you stand up from the bonfire souls fly out of you to two of the nearby mindless hollows whimpering in the dirt, they stand up and from the two of them souls fly out into ten of the nearby mindless hollows who get up and begin following those two sergeants who follow you, the captain. You now have your captain's ring equipped by default and when you have it you have the spells, ""line up with me,"" ""form column behind me"" or ""charge my target"" to command your sergeants with, if you swap your rings like a weapon you switch to the sergeant's ring which calls your selected sergeant (or closest of the selected/if none selected) to your side to act as your personal bodyguard while you command his troops directly in his stead. Next you get a blacksmith who lets you upgrade your troop's &amp; your own weapons, and a quartermaster who lets you begin unlocking and customizing loadouts for your armies.\n\nThe rings don't all come with a full capacity like the sergeant's ring did tho. Every ring you unlock unlocks a new skill that upgrades the stats of the highest rank you can command with it and at thresholds their capacity, up to 5, and you can find/purchase new commands to use with the different ranks. The Sergeant's Ring lets you command a rank of 5 soldiers, the LT's ring lets you command a squadron of up to 30 soldiers, you eventually find a Captain's ring that lets you command a platoon of up to 180 soldiers, a Major's ring that lets you command a company of up to \~900 (keep in mind here these #'s are all with maxed out skills to max out how many of the rank below you you can select without removing your hand from WASD), a Colonel's battalion of up to \~4500, and then a General's regiment of \~22,000.\n\nNow, I hear you asking, ""how do you play a Dark Souls game against and with up to 44,000 enemies &amp; allies in a single fight"" and the answer is obviously you don't. If a general stepped out into a battle of 44,000 combatants to personally lay into his enemies until he won them he won't *personally* see 22,000 enemies die. And if the reason he commanded his army is because he is the most terrifyingly powerful person in that army, then obviously his personal involvement would be in identifying the strengths &amp; weaknesses of the enemy army as it fights his and striking where he's needed to turn the tide of a fight where his forces are losing or to lead his troops to glorious slaughter where they're winning, or seeking out the enemy's most powerful and laying waste. This is the part where the comparison to total war becomes apt -- or more specifically total warhammer &amp; three kingdoms; you are playing a hero character but in a game where you are a button press away from taking direct control of your leader character and sailing into battle personally while also commanding the affair."
eu5881,"A game like Pokémon, but rather than fight with your creatures, you ride them as mounts and try to win races","The game would be open world and you would have to tame mounts to obtain them (not sure yet how this would be different per mount).\n\nYou would have certain mounts that are better on water, others on land, etc. You would be able to have races, and cook items to give your mount e.g. heat resistance for volcano races. There would be many different skin variations per mount too."

The idea would be 3d, as I'm better versed in 3d than 2d. It can be in any genre (except maybe horror) and the game style could be anything. You have the rains here. I'm eager to hear your ideas!\n\nThanks!\n\n(Btw new to posting on Reddit, I have just been around seeing other peoples post)"

ezv1tk,Living world AI,"One of the problems that seems to face living world RPGs is the sheer power needed for all the AI to do their things.

A player would walk through the world and watch as structures are built around them. The world and it's NPCs are no longer stuck at the same moment in time, but are instead all working towards the greater good of the nation."

ezsfr7,New idea for an open world game,Hi I've been thinking that a really good game that (Bethesda) could bring out next could be an openworld Japanese adventure. It would be a lot like (elder Scrolls Skyrim) were you start of with nothing and gain skills and attributes to your character and where you play as a samurai in the middle of a raging war between two sides where you can roam free and do what ever you like and find new armour and weapons (katana) medicine to help you threw your journey as you gain skills and strength to overcome your enemies and you may customise your character how ever you like . Interact with thousands of people (NPC's) and have amazing samurai combat and embark on a whole new adventure. I hope Bethesda gets the chance to see this and hope they like my idea thankyou
ezmu8m,i think this could maybe be revolutionary,ok so i had this idea in the shower like 30 mins ago but its about a deaf girl named vanelope and she struggles in school because her parents want her to fit in rather than to learn just with some help like an interpreter or asl but fast forward a virus outbreak has occurred and its rapidly spreading (zombie apocalypse) and her parents are killed and its just her all alone in a mute world.. she has to rely on her other senses to guide her to saftey because she is deaf... idk it sounds kinda cool but someone has probably already done it :&gt;
ezlhdn,PVP dark souls.,"Basically, as the title says. This is a 3d game with graphics similar to dark souls, except there are 2 players. There could be a map where the players spawn on opposite sides, or randomly generated places, and they go around the map to find loot, armor, etc. This will be a high skill high reward game just like dark souls where the smallest mistake could kill you. The developer could make money from cosmetics and there could be different modes like stars wars themed, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 or 5v5. Maybe you can even choose different classes like assassin, warrior, and druid. You could have ultimate abilities such as a dash that instantly kills the other person, but if they dodge you get stunned."

ezgay8,How could a fantasy open world RPG make basic travel fun?,"What I mean by this is how could a game make the act of walking around more interesting? What I do NOT mean is random encounters in my mind they are like the garnish of a drink, a distraction rather than a solid base. Quite simply I want hiking across a mountain in a game to have the same satisfaction of hiking across a real mountain.\n\nI was talking to a friend about this after watching this video https://youtu.be/Jqx1A1vy4Zo and we both realized that in basically all the RPGs we could think of none of them had the actual travel be fun. It was always just a tedious necessity rather than any form of engaging gameplay, feeling more like walking across a mall than actually trecking up a mountain side.\n\nThe ideas we came up with:\n\nGood maps with roads on them so people can effectivity navigate without a quest marker on their compass.\n\nPack animals and mounts that act like actual living animals and not just crappy vehicles. Even companion animals like dogs should feel alive and not like robots.\n\nVery good and dynamic ambient sound, no half ass occasional bird chirp like in Skyrim. We need the forest we're walking in to sound truly alive as it is. We need to hear the waves crashing against the shore, the winds blowing across a vast desert, etc.\n\nDepending on how developed the companions are some form of idle chat mechanic where you talk about your surroundings, your past, tell jokes, discuss philosophy, etc.\n\nDynamic weather would certainly help, especially if there were extreme weathers like floods, fires, blizzards, sandstorms, etc.\n\nIn Fallout 3 and New Vegas the radio helped a lot in making travel easier, plus you got to hear of the world and your own achievements. The creators can make their lore reason for whatever black magic radio if they so please. Perhaps some sort of mechanic where a companion can read book out loud for the party would be interesting.\n\nMake the walk speed actually decent, can't tell you how many times I wanted to pull my hair out walking around Morrowind at pace of snail with arthritis.\n\nHiring a bard to travel with you or the ability to play an instrument while walking.\n\nBut what ideas do you guys have to make travel more cathartic?\n\nEdit: I'm looking at this as a journey is greater than the destination type of angle. This has nothing to do with writing and this would be in an open world."

You can fly all sorts of airplanes over many islands, huuuge map and it's beautiful too. But the graphics are just a little bit too outdated for me to return that often to it. Especially the combat is janky and weird, long-term. If this game got put into modern graphics like Breakpoint (which has huuge terrain and cool vehicle too, and awesome nature), man  would that be a game I'd spend years in."

ez31vs,Autonomous Battlebots Mobile Game,"Mobile game based on Freemium model - probably very similar to Empires and Puzzles, if you are familiar with it.\n\nI've had this game idea for awhile; I really think it would do well with the right fine tuning, and be very profitable. I just don't have the time to bring it to life, but I would love to help someone else develop it.\n\nYou play as an aspiring battlebot engineer. You collect and develop a team of battlebots (like heroes in E&amp;P), and you have a workshop (like your base in E&amp;P) that you slowly develop over time.\n\nBattle system - Each bot you collect has it's own class, ability, and standard stats (attack/defense/health) that you upgrade over time (by ""feeding"" it unwanted or duplicate bots). Battles are 4v4 or possibly 5v5, and take place on a 2D grid. Before battle, you pick your bots, their starting position on your side of the grid, and a set ""movement"" program you want each bot to run during the battle. During the battle, you don't do anything, except use an occasional helpful item (PvE only). The bots are autonomous, and you just watch the battle unfold. Simple to set-up for the casual gamer, but with enough complexity to keep people interested. \n\nPvE - Story unfolds - You battle through different tournaments against set enemies with set tactics. Enemies progressively get harder, requiring you to upggrade your bots. Eventually, you become grand champion, of course.\n\nPvP - You set up a defense team - pick your bots and their movement programs. While offline, others can attack your team. You can find opponents and attack them as well. ELO system determines everyone's rank. Again, this is similar to the E&amp;P system.\n\nClans - Join a robotics team with fellow players! Have ""wars"" against other clans.\n\nBasically, a standard freemium mobile game with resources and such, but with a unique battle system that should appeal to casual and mid-level gamers alike.\n\nI would be happy to help someone (with better programming skills) develop this game! I have a lot of other ideas for this game that could be incorporated that I won't share here. I hope it gives someone inspiration!"
ez0bcf,Game I've always wanted to play,"So I've kept my eye out for this type of game for years, but no one has made it as far as I can see (if they have, let me know, cause I want to play).\n\nBasically you choose 1 of 4 to whatever characters, with the characters having different types of hallucinations (audio or visual). You have to work together with the other people playing to escape a place (I always figured a horrible mental institution or something) but, because the characters have different hallucinations, some characters dont always notice certain things.\n\nSo if one character constantly had different audio hallucinations of people yelling or footsteps or what have you, they might not notice an ""enemy"" approaching. Or if someone has visual hallucinations, they might start to ignore them until they don't realize one of their hallucinations is actually another person stuck there who is violent. Depending on the character, the hallucinations would become more scary (ie, audio hallucinations of screams and random pounding on walls compared to ones of someone making snide comments) with the hardest characters having both visual and audio hallucinations, but they are the ones that the hallucinations give hints so they aren't completely useless (like seeing a monster outside a window right before a guard walks by so they have more warning and things like that).\n\nAnother thing that would be cool is if a character with audio hallucinations had bits of others conversations cut out. So, I know people who become hyper focused or with schizophrenia who don't always hear what's going on around them, even if they are trying to pay attention. So just randomly cutting the audio of other players or of the background music or of whatever you are trying to escape for a few seconds.\n\nBasically, it's a game that would force players to rely on each other while making them all have to participate because someone might see or hear something others don't. And that thing they see/hear might be a way out or it might just be in their head.\n\nOpinions? Anyone know a game similar?"

eyx1bu,"A Lovecraftian fishing adventure game with RPG elements, an overarching story and world changing choices","I've only been thinking of this for a few hours so all of this is open to change and writing it down here is as much a record for myself as it is to get some feedback. I've wanted to make a game since I was a kid, I've dipped my toes into things like gamemaker studio before but for various reasons haven't stuck with it long enough to learn the skills needed to make a full experience. I'm aware that I should start with smaller games first and I have other ideas for that, but if I *did* have the skills I'd try something like this. \n\nHere's the pitch -\n\nAn adventure RPG based on the life of a fisherman discovering ancient relics and playing a major role in the saviour or corruption of the world.\n\nThink Sunless Sea/Stardew Valley/Metroidvania with rogue lite elements.\n\nYou start as a fisherman in a coastal town, you're free to explore the town and speak to people with plenty of dialogue options and choices that affect your relationships with the residents. Your main task at the beginning is fishing, you have your own boat which is like your 'hub', you have a crew which learn and upgrade over time (larger hauls, better maintenance, can sail rougher seas etc), you follow radio reports and use sonar on your boat to find shoals of fish that you sail to and catch with a mini game. You take the fish back to port to sell to buy upgrades for your boat (better sonar, crows nest, mini submersible, cargo space etc) and various other things.\n\nOnce you reach a certain point (or upgrade your nets and crew etc, not sure yet) you being to find strange relics, you take these back to town and have them looked at by the local scholar/teacher/professor. He studies them and gives you hints towards other spots to search leading to more relics, then eventually outcrops of rocks and caves (some underwater reached with your submersible). Various monsters and corrupted animals live in the caves and this is where the Metroidvania and rogue lite elements come in, you battle your way deeper fighting your way through to a boss each time, with the monsters and bosses becoming more and more disturbing as you find new, harder caves.\n\nThe more you discover and the more relics you bring back to the town the more things begin to change (but it is necessary to further the story), residents become withdrawn, areas become run down, strange shit starts happening. Through dialogue and using various items you can either try and push back against the corruption to help the town and it's residents, or embrace the evil and help accelerate the corruption, ultimately turning them into your own cult. Depending on what you choose you gain access to different weapons/upgrades/crew members.\n\nThere are other smaller towns dotted around coastlines and islands and these communities can be corrupted by you, bringing them into your cult, or you can help them keep it at bay, earning you honour and respect among the residents with different dialogue/items becoming available depending on you choice. Much of the ocean is off limits at the start due to storms, but once you start collecting more relics you learn about certain rocky outcrops where you can perform rituals to clear the storms and open new areas.\n\nYou fish, fight and upgrade your way to a final boss where you have the option of joining forces with it, becoming it's 'high priest' to rule over the cult you've gathered, or you can fight it and send it back beneath the waves, becoming the local hero in the towns.\n\n\nIt's already pretty long so I'll leave it there, I've got plenty of other ideas for story, layouts, art style etc but I think you get the jist by now. Since this is likely to be a one man project I'm picturing it in pixel art, similar to Children of Morta, although I'm no where nearly that talented.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any suggestions? Would it be something you'd like to play? Is it a load of derivative contrived shite? \n\nLet me know, and thanks for reading :)"
eyvo1y,A detective game with a slight twist.,"This game probably will never become real since I don't have the time nor the budget or skills to create something like that but hey, always keep on dreaming.\n\nYou are a detective, not specified in what region or country and you are investigating a handfull of mysterious murders that occured very recently, you soon find out who the murderer is, thanks to standard detective game gameplay and you soon arrive with a couple of special units (didn't want to say SWAT because they're exclusive to the US) trying to arrest him.  \nDuring the raid however you find out that the guy you supposed only being a standard yet special serial killer turns out to have magic abilities and soon your squad gets destroyed in combat and he decides to flee through a portal, you and your partner decide to follow him into a medieval/fantasy alternate dimension, however you need to say undetected since those mages seem to have power.\n\nYou investigate who he is and it turns out he is one of the sacred mages, meaning killing, let alone arresting him is rather difficult, soon you team up with other cops from other dimensions, learning that he is known throughout the entire multiverse. You then gain the ability to change universe, both your own and the medieval one can now be reached anytime and you need to collect further evidence and, most importantly, make sure that your chief believes you...\n\nI pretty much leave the rest open but I think you can see that this would be a somewhat neat idea for a detective/open-world RPG."

Team Coop is also possible.\n\n\nGoal: The player(s) must reach a designated area by going through a series of obstacles and possibly against AI enemies.\n\n\n1. There would be multiple ways and paths to reach the designated area. *Players must not get stuck in an obstacle with no other options but to give up.*\n\n\n2. Players can use items &amp; abilities which would help him/her throughout the level in the form of collectible CARDS!\n\n\n3. Card use is TURN-BASED. Player 1 must use a card before Player 2 can use a card. (time limit for using cards and skipping turns can also be an option)\n\n\n4. Sample cards are as follow: Double Jump, Teleportation, Switch Position, Grappling Hook, Wall Climb, Create Platform, Door Keys, Chest Keys, Health Potion, Speed Potion, Iron Sword (you getting my point?)\n\n\n5. Each players would have 3 cards at the start of the game and shall draw 1 card every turn. It doesn't matter if any of their decks run out.\n\n\n6. Players can customize a deck before starting the game AND can pick up free cards throughout the level. If the player picks up a free card, they are not allowed to draw a card from their deck on that turn. If its not their turn, they would not be able to pick up a free card.\n\n\n7. Players cannot kill other players using weapons, however, they can do other things to hinder them from moving forward e.g. slowdown movement, traps, create obstacle, stun.\n\n\n\nIs there's an existing game like this?"
eyjexf,A few questions for an idea that I am chewing on.,"My idea is the hope to make VR known for this idea.  The reason why I won't go into details for the fact that it would be stolen.  I do have a stroyline idea but I won't just give it up that easily.  In fact, if I do help make this idea a reality, best believe it will be one that is controversial but from what VR games I have seen, the violent aspect is so common place that this idea should feel right at home. \n\n What I would like to do is for starters, what programming language should I learn to make it?  I hear that C# may be the way, but I could be wrong on that, so feedback on that would be nice.  Two, what online classes I could take that won't put me in debt but could help me land a job at such VR gaming company that won't take years with the hope an instructor could take time to tutor me from the basics to the latest. Lastly, what type of copyrights would I have to get in order to keep my ideas mine without it being stolen.  I\n\nSorry for keeping the idea secret but I have learned the hard way from those who had their ideas stolen and from having my ideas stolen by those who have toxic ulterior motives and I don't like to have history repeat itself.\n\nIf you do help me from start to finish and not steal, I would love to have some folks along the journey with me to make this idea of mine not only stick out but to stick it to those moral zealots.

eycaad,My game idea,"I have an idea for a game I'd like to make but I want some feedback before going too deep into the project.\n\nThere's a world were around 50% of the population has a power (percent may vary). some are flight and some are invisibility, etc. One day some scientists experiment and find a way to give powers to those who don't have  or more powers through the possession of relics that they made. Those scientists create relics that give powers that are way too strong and any person with at least one could  dominate at least a good part of the country. They lock up the relics to hide from mankind use. Then a typical bad guy comes and steals the relics and spreads them to a group of people, keeping the most    powerful to himself. with all these people this evil group rule the world. having bases all around the land spread out.\n\nOur protagonist is a young boy who discovered his power is exceptional strength after fighting some bullies. After using the power to save some people from bad situations. One of the scientists finds him and convinces our main character to help retrieve the relics. After some training and failing to attempt a attack on the bad guy once he goes and raids each base to get the relics and fights the bad guy with every other relic and brings peace to the land.\n\nThe play style and game is going to try and be like the legend of Zelda series, using dungeons, items (relics) to progress and solve puzzles.

Every action takes up a turn, that includes object inspection and interaction. The player has to analyze the enemy while fighting it to be able to defeat it and therefore complete the mission.\n\n1. The player will manage an agency, this includes member recruitment, squad lineup, equipment procurement &amp; preparation, and perhaps skill improvement.\n\n2. Every member would have a set of skills, specialties and a background story. Skills that vary from attack, defense, support and investigation. Specialties that include lore knowledge, logical analysis, and advantage against certain type of enemies.\n\n3. The player would be able to setup a squad composed of 3 to 4 members in which the player would send to a mission.\n\n4. Mission details will have clues about what their target would possibly be and shall help the player in choosing which members to put in the squad.\n\n5. Every target monster can be defeated normally however it would be very difficult. The best way to defeat them would be to analyze and identify its strengths, weaknesses, traits and patterns to be hinted by its lore.\n\n6. There would be objects present in the vicinity while fighting the target entity. A mechanic that would be a critical element in every mission as they can provide clues and information about the target that may/may not help the player and perhaps serve as defensive structures/obstacles for the squad members.\n\n7. Every member will say their own opinion/analysis when interacting/inspecting objects depending on their skill and specialty. These opinions/analysis may/may not lead the player to the right solution in defeating the target. The player must think wisely whether to attack or to inspect, to choose which member should attack and which should inspect.\n\n8. A small dungeon crawling can be incorporated for a little exploration, also some monsters could jump to other location while being confronted.\n\n**Sample**:\nImagine teaming up a street samurai with heavy knowledge on japanese folklore, an arabian gunman gifted with retrocognition, a vatican exorcist armed with prayers and brass knuckles, and a traditional druid carrying ancient celtic magic against a reported birdheaded man rumored to wander around a park at night. Well, the birdman could be anything from a demon summoned by a cult, or a mystical fawn mad about having its habitat destroyed, or just another Unidentified Mysterious Animal popped out of nowhere.\n\nNote:\nI would love to do the art but I'm not good. I can contribute on making objects, monsters and backgrounds but I'm never great on human figures.\n\n\nLong post. Thank you for reading!"

In other words, the interaction should be something other than mouse and keyboard or tapping etc. Some examples could be gestures, body positioning, audio, vision (where you look at etc) or something else. \n\nA good point of entry could be thinking of some mundane task which exists, and making that a cooperative experience! Such as for example, drawing! Usually you'd draw alone, but what if you have a canvas where four people control a pen, one controlling movement, one brush size, one color, one stroke style etc! Anything works! The more unique a mechanic - the better. Have you ever had an idea related to this? Perhaps you've seen other ideas here which sound similar - forward them to me! I'm interested in everything.\n\nYour idea could potentially, in the next months, become a real game!"
exo79z,A game idea me and my friend want to make,So this is a conjoined game idea we made while playing another game about a month ago its about a ruined city where there is a lot of vertical space to parkour around and a big story\n\nWorld-The city is a fictional one and is being hit by a bunch of unatural disasters like rapid floods and storms very destructive storms and also radioactive storms these disasters happen to often so people cant really reconstruct the city. The city will change due to your actions but also the enemies all get harder as you progress.\n\nProtaginist-So your good at parkour and also you have grown up in that city you where about 14 years old when the first storm hit and now your 26 trying to survive anyway you can this is also a rpg game so you can make a character build like you can be a really agile person that just slides moves around the city perfectly. Also there are gangs you can join which give you certain perks and downsides or you could make your own gang.\n\nEnemies-The enemies are going to be really smart during action and stealth there not going to be like farcry ai like nothing ever happens when they see something is out of place or a door is open or something is missing then they start to get more suspicious and they go on a personal investigation and dont really drop it like in other games when they know someone is there they start to search out areas and all that but this is just for humans\n\nrobots-So the government is trying to rebuild this city by sending in constuction robots but they have been hacked or gone on the fritz and will try to kill they are big and chunky the smallest is about the size of a human and the bigger ones are like the robots in titanfall\n\nmutants-Ok so me and my friend arent sure if we want these in the game all we know is that there like the humanimals in metro exodus and come in various shapes and sizes but we dont know if we want them i guess just leave feedback and tell me how they could change up combat\n\nhumans-So these are the main enemies they are smart and if you leave a single human alive while taking out a camp they might come back and bite your ass they can use all sorts of weapons can and can track you down\n\nStory and lore-So before the events of the game humans where advanced enough to start making robots. The population in the city was dense and definitely used a lot of power so a over 100 kilometres away was a nuclear power plant that powered that city and others than one day it had a overload and released a lot of radioactive material in the air and on the day it did that there was a huge storm coming over to the city then the radioactive material fused with the storm clouds creating clouds that had the power to make explosions and all that or highly radiate the city then about 12 years later your sneaking into a gangs base to steal some supplies then they catch you and we havent decided anything else from there lol\n\nSo if you want leave some feedback on this and thankyou for reading it all

Just a game that you could teach someone and play with them in a card ride.\n\nI have had a few ideas but later realized that they were trash. For example, it's like rock paper scissors, but in a card game but with boxing. There would be attack cards and defnese cards. Attack cards would go as such, jab, uppercut, abdomen punch, haymaker, left hook, right hook. Then the defense cards would be the same but with the word ""block"" written infront of them. You would simply play 1 of each type at once, like, jab and right hook block, and the other play could play jab block and haymaker. They blocked your jab so they get a point. And their haymaker landed so they also get another point for that. First to 10 points wins.\n\nSo yeah my ideas aren't that good. Any ideas?"

You're responsible for the expansion of the city in the terms of residence.\n\nYou start of with some smaller, lesser quality buildings and some recreational builds, like a little rest spot or a small playground. since you are expanding the city and not building the city itself from scratch, you'll have to deal with the city council, as well as your area's residents' wishes, complaints and such. Also, the building placement is free, meaning it's grid-less placement, but you can turn on grids if you want.\n\nTo get more buildings to build, that are bigger and better quality, and more recreational builds to build, you'll have to do some research. The researchers in the game, are architects, since the buildings are designed, not researched with vials and beakers.\n\nAnd to encourage people to research and build certain buildings, the city council expects you to fulfil certain tasks every 10 years.\n\nSince you're starting in the 1960, or maybe earlier, you'll have to come to terms with the changing laws and such of the city and expectations of residents with their evolving needs and wishes, like teens want at least free space (Leave space between buildings or spaces in general) in the 1960, but in 1990, they want a skate park.\n\nThis idea can be perfected more with good add-ons, but this is the general idea I'm going for."

ex5gvt,A point and click horror with no 'real' monster,"I had a fun idea for a twist on the classic point and click horror genre, what if there just wasn't a monster?  Let me explain what I mean by that.  \n\n\nTake your typical sidescrolling point and click horror game and in typical horror fashion focus on building suspense, especially when the monster comes into view in any way. However the monster itself will be something innocent, like a walking teddie bear. Not a creepy one either, it needs to be adorable and drastically contrast the grim environment around it.  \n\n\nThis sounds familiar so far I'm sure, though kind of uncommon. However! The monster **is** literally harmless, it really is just a teddie bear. So throughout the game you would need to make sure at no point the player actually gets close enough to 'die' to the creature because that literally isn't an option. You would need to focus on subtilies and only reveal what the creature is half way through at the earliest to ensure it only freaks the player out more when they see it. Then at the end of the game give the player a chance to kill it. More than likely they will because it's been so built up throughout the game as evil, then boom! They get the bad ending! You get to guilt trip them about the bear literally being harmless and they're terrible people. For the good ending you can just make it give the player a reassuring hug or something.  \n\n\nOther things that would help add to the game would be a sort of 'sketched' asthetic, I think that style really suits these kinds of games. Childrens drawings would also add to the environment"

I would do horses kinda similar to what you would see in Horizon Zero Dawn but adapt their maine to be cords so you could plug them into your helmet, similar to what Avatar (the blue people, lol) have but technological. I would love to base the antagonistic force on the bubonic plague but it evolved into a parasite.and he looks like the Flood in Halo. So you could run around and see these futuristic knights with giant imploding limbs. Or if not the Flood maybe just a parasite that controls them and they all have a hive mind kinda thing."
f2xueg,Voice controlled spell casting team battle,"\nSo in this game everyone is a mage. \nYou can play alone or in a team. PvE and PvP.\n\nYou can cast spells by speaking. Not in a common language like English but some exotic one, like elvish or come up with a new one or something. ( So in pvp the English speakers won't be in a better place.)\n\nThere's a mage tower where you can learn some basic words and spells and you can train. Also you can meet with others and you can teach each other.\nThe higher level you are, the higher you can go in the tower where there are more powerful spells. You have to try out different combination of words so you will create custom spells that are not available in the tower. Like you have to find out how to say fire in this language and ball and if you say fireball you can shoot a fireball. The most powerful incantations could be whole poems...\n\nYou have a spellbook where you can store limited number of words and spells. So you don't have to remember everything (of course it's faster if you don't have to look up the spells) Also if you already learned it and know it without looking it up you dont have to store it in your book so you can free up space for more complex spells. So you can learn as many spells as you want the only limit is your brain capacity.\n\nThere can be multiple schools of magic like protective, charms, curses, heals, etc. Your brain and spellbook is limited and you have to speak in a different language so you need to specialize in a school like healing so you will be the team's healer. If you specialize in protective spells you will be the tank...\n\nI would really love to play this game..."

f2s11y,"New game idea inspired by Steep, other games and TV shows","So I just got into Steep recently, a winter sports game that takes place in various snowy mountain ranges across the world. The game is just raw fun so far, and I’m having a blast going at extreme speeds and pulling tricks down mountains. I’m not really big into these kinds of things but I’m really surprised at how fun it is. My game idea kind of draws inspiration from different games like Steep, Red Dead Redemption 2, Ghost Recon Breakpoint and other games that offer various survival and RPG mechanics, as well as the TV show Man vs Wild.\n\nThe general concept of the game is that you would be playing as a member of a Mountain Rescue team, you could either play solo or co-op with up to 3 other people. The main goal of the game would be that you are dropped into a large, open world “area of operation” to try and use clues to find civilians that are lost, trapped or generally in danger by the harsh environment of the high mountains. The clues would be subtle and realistic, varying on the degree of difficulty you set your game at.\n\nAs a member of the rescue team you would be contending with survival factors such as the cold and harsh environment, which would limit your ability to just endlessly search for the survivor in need, you would have to stop what you’re doing and seek shelter, gather materials to build a fire (some of which you can bring with you before the mission begins in a loadout system), but if not you’d have to rely on other players, or scavenge the environment to try and find materials to do so. \n\nYou would also be dealing with hunger and hydration. The game would be populated with wildlife and plants to hunt and forage for food, you can have up to 1 main weapon and a sidearm, one or the other, or no weapons because they would take up loadout space and it would be a tactical decision. However, since the high mountains don’t typically have much wildlife, each area would have a sort of “lower” more temperate area of the mountains where wildlife, plants and are more abundant. This would take you father away from your objective and take up time, so it would also be a tactical decision.\n\nThe environment itself would be a survival factor, the unforgiving environment of the high mountains has rough and steep terrain that can lead to exhaustion, and even falling and breaking bones or severely hurting the player, potentially limiting their ability to continue the mission until the injury has been dealt with. Some more serious injuries can not be dealt with and would lead to the player being briefly med-evac’d or a mission failure. The tough terrain would be difficult on foot, but that’s where the equipment would come in. The player would be allowed to choose from a combination of skis, parachutes, wing suits and other equipment that would make traversing the environment much easier and faster. This would be another thing that could be set in your loadout. Another part of the environment to contend with would be the wildlife, some predators are desperate for food in such isolated places of the world and the player would have to be wary and prepared to deal with wolves, bears, and other wildlife that could cause harm to them.\n\nAn important part of the game would be a skill system. Leveling up your skills by performing research, training and exercise between missions would alleviate some of the difficulty from the player. Skills would also be gained by doing various activities in the field. The set up would be similar to what you see in most RPGs. A core set of skills with trees of minor skills that branch off of them. Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Endurance etc. Examples of minor skills would be tracking, awareness, skiing, shooting, bow, climbing, medical knowledge, etc. They would all be relevant to the game and help you complete your missions more efficiently and skillfully.\n\nEach mission would be handcrafted, from the environment and world itself, to the story. As I said before, between missions the player could spend their free time doing research, training or exercise. The between mission gameplay would be similar to some boxing and other sports games. In a calendar format. The player would be able to choose what they do each day until a rescue mission arrives. Each activity takes up a certain amount of time and helps progress the calendar. Some activities would be automated, like studying survival skills, or attending various classes that increase your skills, but other activities like skiing, shooting, etc. can be practiced freely whether it be doing shooting range activities or simply skiing around to get a feel for the mechanics and build your skills.\n\nI think that covered quite a bit of the idea I had, probably not all of it but I’m thinking I’ll stop it there. Let me know what you guys think and feel free to add suggestions or questions."

f2ef3l,An interactive game that is a murder mystery.,"I recently watched ""Knives Out"" and I thought to myself; what if somebody made a murder mystery game in the style of Until Dawn and Detroit Become Human? I know there's Heavy Rain but I personally think that game sucks compared to the two I just mentioned. \n\nThe premise is this; it's a standard murder mystery and we play as the detective. Pretty much, we know just as much as the detective so we don't know what other people are doing outside of the investigations and it's up to us to find out whodunnit. The gameplay consists of only two locations; the murder house and the police station. We search every room in the house for clues that will help progress the investigation, ask police officers for information and interrogate suspects. Of course, there has to be dialogue options. Whatever option you pick can progress the story and change your tone with characters. When interrogating suspects, we don't see a flashback from the suspect's perspective as usual, we just listen to what they have to say making it harder for us to solve the mystery.\n\nThere are a total of 8 suspects and you need to use your wits to expose the right one, other wise you could end up turning in an innocent which will have serious consequences and instead of the game being done, the story will expand because you didn't bring in the killer. So it's crucial that you search every inch of the house, get information from every police officer and ask the right questions during interrogations to solve the mystery of whodunnit.\n\nWhat do you think? And if you have some issues with this game, why not give some ideas of your own on how you would design this game."

Something like that. It was basically like Mad Max but you would stop and get out of the vehicle and raid buildings and fun stuff like that. \n\nAn open world game like GTA (pretty much exactly the same play style and with as rich a story) but in a city and surrounding area that has fallen apart to ruins (but still fully explorable not just a backdrop) with mutant creatures you can shoot or run over would be truly awesome. \n\nAnd with my age and barely able to load up Construct or a similar engine I don't foresee ever making this game myself but please for the love of all the gods someone make this game ;)"

The player can then move around to change the would be future by interacting with people and objects.\n\nProblem would be, the player might not always reach the best solution. Some actions may lessen the death toll, some may even worsen it, some may result to the death of people that aren't supposed to die, while some may even kill the player.\n\nTime would be critical since a timer will be shown on the screen adding pressure while the player explores around.\n\nTiming can also be a key (pull the lever in the exact X seconds to stop the train). Simple dumb tweaks can also be a key (change the flavor of this guy's smoothie so he will have to go back and complain preventing him to get hit by a truck). Not telling (and not talking to and not directly contacting) the people who would die can be a plus.\n\nThe player can always choose to repeat the scenario but perhaps for a small price, could be his own life span, could be the sands of his hourglass or could be the aetheric liquid in his time-travelling device.\n\nThe antagonist could be Father Time carrying a scythe and an hourglass\n\nThere can also be other items and people that can help the player solve a level adding more mechanics like slowing down the time or forcing targets to pause for 30 seconds or maybe even switching avatars between kid, teen, adult and elderly.\n\nSaving the wrong people may also result into bonus levels!\n\nLong post!

In general it would be attack exp, tanky/health exp, and agility exp.\n\n Each one would fill the bar with a different color based on which type they are getting the most and upon the bar being filled whichever type took it up the most you would unlock body parts related to that type. \n\nYou would then be able to apply these body parts and alter your blobs to suit their playstyles. This could very well be expanded alot as far as exp types and body parts go.\n\nThe combat could be turnbased or whatever seems appropriate.\n\nI think creatures should also be trained outside of fights aswell.\n\nI'm not going any farther as i would like this to remain in the realm of possibility."

f1oqx9,A Pokémon platformer,"This game is essentially *Sword* and *Shield* as a platformer with a bit of action thrown in, perhaps. I chose to make Hop the protagonist because it would make a nice change of pace to play as a rival character. I was also somewhat inspired by *Kirby's Dream Land 3* and the *Mario &amp; Luigi* series when creating this. Enjoy!\n\n**PLOT**:\n\nInitially, the plot is the same as the plot of *Sword* and *Shield*, up until just after Hop and Victor/Gloria (you choose the gender of Hop's rival upon starting a new file) receive their starters from Leon. At this point, a mysterious black cloud suddenly emerges from the sky and coveres all of Galar outside of Postwick and the Slumbering Weald. As the three watch, stunned at this development, three pieces of the cloud suddenly break from it and swoop towards the three in an attempt to capture them. The blobs targeting Victor/Gloria and Leon are successful, but the blob targeting Hop is tackled by Hop's Wooloo, temporarily stunning it and allowing Hop to get to safety. Upon seeing the dark blobs escaping with Victor/Gloria and Leon, Hop decides to put his dreams of becoming the Champion on hold, and gives chase in an attempt to rescuse his brother and his rival.\n\nUpon arriving at Wedgehurst, Hop encounters a mysterious Hitmontop who challenges him to a battle. Following Hop's victory, the Hitmontop introduces himself as Dr. Spinona, one of a select few Pokémon who possess extraordinary intelligence and are esteemed resarchers. Spinona explains that he has been researching the black cloud, known as ""Dark Energy"", and it is not one being, but rather a mass of many beings, all controlled by the greater being Minus. Spinona then tells Hop that every 10 centuries, Dark Energy launches an attack on a random region on a random planet to convert its native beings into more Dark Energy. Spinona decides that Galar must have been this invasion's target, and offers his aid to Hop, who accepts.\n\nAt this point, the two encounter Sonia, however Magnolia's granddaughter is looking very different, with jet-black hair and piercing yellow eyes. Spinona warns Hop that Dark Energy can possess beings in order to use their powers, and together Hop and Spinona battle Sonia and defeat her, freeing her from Dark Energy's control. After thanking the two Sonia joins their party as one of their human partners. \n\nHop and Spinona then travel to Motostoke, where they learn something new; due to a set of mystical locks that Dark Energy has set up, they must defeat all eight of the Gym Leaders and rescue them, coincidentally in the same order they must be defeated in the Gym Challenge. In addition, Hop and Spinona must find and collect one hundred Heart Pieces, which when combined will allow Hop to drive away Dark Energy.\n\nWith that, Hop and Spinona set off. They defeat the Gym Leaders to rescue them, and collect the Heart Pieces along the way, also rescuing Marnie and Bede. Eventually, the two make it to Wyndon, where they battle Chairman Rose and Oleana in a double battle, defeating and freeing them. At this point, if Hop and Spinona have not collected all of the Heart Pieces they will need to go back and gather the remaining ones.\n\nOnce Hop and Spinona have collected all of the Heart Pieces, they react together to form a stairway to the massive black cloud, the Hyper Area, which the two ascend. Once inside, they have to fight Victor/Gloria and Leon in a double battle. Once both have been defeated and freed, they thank Hop and Spinona, and the positive willpower of everyone combined with the Heart Pieces to form the Rod of Light, a mystical weapon that will alow Hop to end the Dark Energy threat.\n\nWielding it, Hop is transported to the nucleus of the Hyper Area (Spinona is unfortunately left behind), where Dark Energy re-forms and attacks. Many attacks later, Hop defeats Dark Energy. But at this point, a sudden white light blinds Hop for a second as Minus appears to confront Hop itself. It attacks Hop with everything at its disposal, but after a long and gruelling battle Hop emerges triumphant, destroying Minus.\n\nThe Rod of Light then channels all of Hop's positive thoughts and uses them to destroy the Hyper Area and Dark Energy. Upon arriving back at Wyndon, Hop is hailed as a hero by the people of Galar, and being telepathically asked to do so by the Rod of Light, he decidedes to give up on becoming Champion, and instead vows to defend Galar from all future threats. Meanwhile, Spinona decides to assist Sonia and Magnolia in researching the Dynamax phenomenom (which had been inhibited during the Dark Energy invasion).\n\n*Still a WIP, more coming soon!*"

I imagine its for each guy you control, you choose gradually between power now vs being weaker now and investing in his future which risks the rush by enemy men near him","If each of your men has a gradual choice, such as by grabbing him and moving a joystick or mouse left/right gradually, to choose his balance between power now vs power later, and you can tell him where to move toward at any time... Do we really need the tech tree of you need x and y to build z and you need x and z to build k and you need y and k to build j, etc... Is there something simpler that would be just as fun or more, with fewer simpler choices?"
f1b393,"I have 3 game ideas, wich should I make and sell?","-Like you read in title I have 3 game ideas and if I wsnt to persue game making full time I have too make one and kickstart it, but I am wondering wich of these 3 ideas would bring the biggest audiance and sell well.\n\nI personally love these 3 ideas/concepts, but each one is diffferent from the other and it is going to takr time to create and I only have time to focus on one.\n\nConcept 1: you're a cloud creature, flying away from storms in the sky. Objective is  going into storms and retrieving orbs to fuel a machine to telport to his own world. You are mainly floating, slowly. To be able to go faster, higher or lower or to turn you are using other clouds to propel yourself. The clouds are more like bounce pads,but there are different types of clouds that  change your speed or momentum depening on wich angle you hit them or how hard you bounce into them. There also bad clouds, that blow you back, but  you have to continue forward until you get to an orb, but the orb is in a storm. So the closer you get the harder it wil be.\n\nYour have a variety of movement clouds that speed you up and bad clouds that bring you back. Kind of like journey, but in the sky and everything is made of different types of clouds. Depending on how wel it gets fundend I might add an attack ability so that he can fight cloud monstere. Kind of like Mario's stomp.\n\n(this game will be in 3d btw) \n\nConcept 2: A 2d platformer you move and jump and shoot gas, but the more gas you have the slower you can move and the bulkier you are. The less gas you have, the faster you are able to move and the more lean you are, but the puzzles make you think tactically on how to move and switch between gas levels. Als the enemy's are defeated in a lot of ways, but they each have their own easy way to be dealt with.\n\n\nConcept 3: kind of like a jak and daxter/ mario oddesy, but with different move set. Haven't really worked out the move set yet,but I have worked the enemeys and world. The move set will include guns and a pulse graple. It's a grapple, but you can't pull in or out. You can only swing with it, but the swing mechanic is a bit odd. Because you can' t really swing. To give you a better idea, look up the antigravity hook from terraria.\n\nYou mainly use that to  navigate and hook on off enemys and certain projectiles.\n\n\nWich one would you want to buy, for more info please comment"
f1ajwj,A time travel type game where timing is everything,"Something extremely bad happens, like a nuclear bomb goes off, for example. The player collects information from their surroundings for a certain time limit and then are put back in time with the same time limit. It goes back and forth as the player collects more information to eventually stop the extremely bad thing happening."
f1ai51,game idea,ok so you’re an orphan kid and a family adopts you the father is a blacksmith and an eagle scout he teaches you how to smith and survival skills after a while people in your town start disappearing and nobody can find them one day you hear a loud boom outside and it’s a huge fucking robo mecha destroyer thing  so you like mirrors edge your way to it and you take random metal scraps from it to make a weapon and then you kill it you later find out that the robo things are all over the country so you go an a multi year journey killing all the robots and slowly finding out who did this and why then once you find the origin you go there and like beat the shit out of em but right before you do hw spills some massive beans that leave the player on a cliff hanger leaving space for another game j
f19q6z,Hey! A simple game idea please)),"I am a beginner games every and I want to soon start on a very small and easy project to see what I can do. I don’t want the game to be complex, as I know very little about programming and game dev rn. I’m open to all suggestions))"
f17vyl,I want to challenge myself...,im a gamedev who works on 2d games and i decided i want to challenge myself. So im looking for an idea that could be completed in a month or a little more. I only work 2d and i can do any genre. Id prefer original ideas and no multiplayer. Also no massive games cause i want to make it in a month. Thanks for reading!
f15m5r,Moba but with champion passive synergies,"Those of you who played LoL auto-chess TFT probably know this mechanic:\n\nevery champion is a part of one or more group (shadow, fire, mages and such) and having certain amount of champions from the same group on your team give your team a special effect (in the mage case, a chance to recast a spell).\nthere are also items that insert a champion into a group it isn't a part of.\n\nnow this is a cool mechanic in TFT and is the major fun element in it imo, however I wonder, what would inserting it into a 5v5 moba would be like?\nsome interesting team compositions thats what"
f12iej,Customizable/Forgeable Fantasy Weapons,"I imagine this would fit best in a fantasy game like The Elder Scrolls. Basically, if you go to a forge or anvil you can make a custom weapon from scratch with custom handles and weapons heads even tassels if you’d like. You could shape the metal, sharpen it, smooth it, hammer it, add wrappings to the handle, all the good stuff. A possible feature would be to carve your own designs into the different parts of the weapon. I imagine this could be done with some texture trickery, like painting with normal maps, or just editing the model itself. The different sizes, weights, and materials of all of the different parts of the weapon would affect how it played. Weapons with heavier parts did more damage but were harder to swing, longer handles increased reach but had a weight limit or else they’d snap, and a slicing part would behave differently than a smashing part. I think this would add a lot of depth, immersion, and customizability to a game and I would enjoy to see it in one."
f0zxsv,A game mainly based on exploration and discovery.,"It would be an open-world game with nothing automatically named, but you have an encyclopedia (or something). When you get a new item, a page in the encyclopedia would open for said item. Then, you can name it and give it a description. There could be AI generated items, biomes, etc if you had the time, resources, and effort.\n\nThis could also be made into a Minecraft mod."
f0xpwp,A game where you make your own weapons,"It would be cool if there was a game where you can design your weapons from scratch, adding loading mechanisms, barrels and all of that stuff, and maybe even being able to also customize the bullets of your weapon, and then see if your weapon works or not."
f0wb2p,Climate Crisis,"I think a game taking place after the effects of climate change would be amazing.\n1. Could actually show people what might happen if we continue down this path.\n2. Could also show the desperation people will have during that time.\n3. Can literally be any type of game, a survival game would be perfect for it but maybe a “cod” type of game would work too!"
f0uwst,"How would you make a 3d, voxel based, resource, and creation game not feel like a minecraft rip off?",
f0svac,Pick your team,"Its a 1v1 competitive game with ranked system and a leaderboard. Its essentially a different take on the auto chess games. its a duel (1v1) with less RNG elements.\n\n\nWhen the game starts, both players are shown a grid of 4x4 with 16 possible choices of characters to choose from. The game itself has a wide range of possible units, and the 16 are picked at random and are balanced by the dev. Choices are done secretly at the same time. After both players choose an unit, both units are removed from the pool and the next choice is ready to go. If both players picks the same unit, that's fine, they simply get the same unit.\n\n\nEach character has a few stats. Life Points, damage, attack type (ranged or melee), attack speed, and movement speed. And more importantly, a special ability that stands out from the rest, such as reviving after death.\n\n\nThere would be no artificial forced ""synergies"". Its up to the player to figure out which units works well together.\n\n\n\nWhen making choices, the player has several things to consider. Some units may be a little better than others, but you also gotta consider team compositions, synergies, and your opponement's picks."
f0snsk,A game idea,"I would love to see a game where the player has to collect your body parts that are heavily guarded. Each collected body parts have a unique play. There would be a story after collecting each body parts after collecting all, a story will reveal why the all of them are guarded. This could be a platformer or a top down game. Thx"
f0s8pa,"I need to come up with an idea for a game to create in Unity, it's for a course I am taking in University, I would appreciate if you could help me, please?"," \n\nI have absolutely no idea how to use unity, but this is a project that has to be done by a team of 3 students. so its okay if the project idea is kind of a little bit hard.\n\nThank you in advance"
f0rxse,A game with no end?,"Is there any game out there that has no end and just keeps scaling and scaling as real life years pass by in a single playthrough? I'm talking about a game with no save loading at all, no MMORPG's that are susceptible to having their servers closed by the devs so therefore no online game. The genre doesn't matter. You just start the game and then play and play with no end in sight. All of the mechanics that are available in the beginning keep scaling as you progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure Minecraft and other survival games are going to come up, but those do not count. Those do lose some of their mechanics as you progress through the game. For example, those that I know of have a limit to upgrades and other leveling up systems, exploration, crafting etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not talking about a limitless game, but about a game that has specific mechanics laid out to you in the beginning and those mechanics never ever end, but keep scaling up."
f0r6a0,"An rpg where for some attacks/skills or dodging, you have to do a random warioware-like minigame","Failing it wouldn't result in no damage, just minimal. And completing the minigame would give you bonus damage. Same with dodging. Failing would damage you normally and succeeding would still do damage, but just less. \n\nProbably a shit idea, but hey."
f0qtjh,I think a battle royale set around Chernobyl would be cool!,
f0o68g,"Completely AI generated game with AI textures, voices, models etc","Essentially a game where every single playthrough is different, you have no say over what it is, \n\nwhat genre, \nwhat theme, \nwhat your goal is, \n\nnothing. \n\nImagine taking AI dungeon (a completely AI generated text Adventure game) and taking inspiration from his net as a base for a script, and AI generated voice actors using various vocal samples found online training a net to make new voices, and using the net from thispersondoesnotexist . com\nTo generate characters, \nand use existing game textures and models for a data set to creat completely new AI generated textures and locations.\n\nImagine how memorable every experience in the game would be, it would literally be impossible to become repetitive unless somehow you hit the 1/100,000,000 chance of getting the same seed for the AI on runtime.\n\nI know this is extremely ambitious but with how fast AI has been progressing I wouldn't be surprised if a game like this is soon or already in development."
f0o5g1,What games should I play in your opinion to make my game greater? (Request/Dream kinda thread),"story itself: In a post apocalyptic world where the sun has shrunk and the entire sky has taken a permanent shade of pale brown, two races have popped into existence that have confused the world in what they are so much on which side each race was on, disastrous wars broke out which ended up ruining the entire earth, making other creatures you find on places like the internet where people take videos on there phone to record, and other peoples horror stories.\n\nGameplay itself: It is going to take inspiration from hack and slashes such as kingdom hearts and devil may cry, while looking cinematic like the last of us, it's going to take place in the united states where it's open world and filled with settlements and colonies where they all have there own problems with each other and other reasons.\n\none of the biggest gameplay factors is the affinity with your two team mates which are a being from both races that popped up, and what you guys are going to do on your adventure (There is a even bigger plot then just that, but I don't think it's important on the moment) do side quests that will help the colonies live better lives, and meet new people that are trying to find there way thorough the dead earth.\n\nI already played kingdom hearts 1-3, I haven't played much devil may cry, and I haven't played the last of us at all, but i'm trying to shoot to there style.\n\n any games you guys want to recommend to me?"
f0nyma,Multiplayer Card game,"One deck of cards consisting of four types.\n\nRoles- Characters for the player to act as.\n\nActions-things the players can act out to accomplish tasks\n\nScenarios- Short descriptions of a situation the players find themselves in, can be any type you want i.e. players are all in a car that is out of control and must stop the car\n\nWin conditions- these determine.how players accumulate points during play.\n\n\nBasic gist- 2-4 players. Game is played rounds. Highest score end of 3 rounds wins.\nEach player draws a role card, a win condition and 3 action cards. \nA scenario is flipped. Players must act out the scenario using action cards to interact with each other and meet their win conditions. Win conditions have a value but players will also be scored out of 3 on how well they acted out the role and how well they performed the action.\n\n\nImagine a mix of charades, whose line is it anyway, cards against humanity and a dash of role playing. Decks could be themed around specific characters or scenarios. One example would be a deck of situations that might occur in a bar.\nIdea here would be a fun party game for multiple people to play that allows for short doses silly roleplaying without the need for dice and campaign books. Settings can be anything that can be imagined and the core idea would work with almost any franchise."
f0ml03,"Flight Control inspired game, but it's a ski run","Flight Control is a game where you have to draw paths with touch control, to have planes land on a runway, or helicopters on a helipad, without colliding in the air. When they land on the runway they disappear.\n\nHere's a simple, ski-lift based variation. Skiers arrive at the top of a mountain, you have to draw their path down the mountain, without them colliding. There are also ramps and obstacles such as snowmen to avoid. The skiers all travel at the same speed except for glowing ones that ski faster.\n\nShould there be a ski lift queue at the bottom that you also have to draw a path for?"

One of the first things is, ""mwah!"" \*You feel a hand on your butt, pressing it down to the floor"".  ""MWAH!""  \*You feel a hand on your butt, pressing it down to the floor""  ""Mwah!"" (the owner stands and waits).  What do you do, dog?\n\nAnd of course, it just gets harder from there.  Have fun figuring out the whole potty thing."
f03op7,Bank Vault Themes,"So I'm thinking of making a game set inside a bank vault, but I want to add a bit of variation so I'm thinking of different themes within the vault\nSo far though I've only thought of the base metallic theme, a VIP high class vault and a digital futuristic themed vault, does anyone have any other ideas for level themes that could work inside a bank vault?"
f90aa5,First Person Martial Arts Game,"There are points your opponents body you can interact with. When you click on them, you will the appropriate attack for that position.\n\nFor example, you click on the leg, you'll kick it. You click on the face, you'll punch it.\n\nThe player can also use keys to modify these attacks, for example you press Q + Click on the leg, you'll perform a leg sweep. You can charge the attack by holding the mouse button, which charges up the attack, but expends more stamina. When charging, the attack animation will play very slowly, and then accelerate by a lot when the mouse button is released. To counter this, you can attack the player before their attack is thrown.\n\nYou can also block with the right mouse button, blocks can also be charged to strengthen the block, but you'll also need to release it while aiming at the body part your opponent is using for their attack. And yes, you can also block with your feet - the game will determine based on how low or high the attack is coming from. The faster you block, the less damage you take. The power of the opponent's attack (i.e, by charging their attack or performing heavy attacks) will increase the impact on blocks, so you really want to block charged attacks quicker. \n\nAlso, time will also be slowed down, but not by much. This gives both players a bit more time to strategize and react. Damage should also be realistic - meaning getting hit in the head with a powerful blow will most likely knock out your opponent. If you get swept to the floor, you're obviously going to get stunned. Grappling could also be implement if you want to take it to the next level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheck out this gif of the game Kungfucious for inspiration:\n\n[https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMzE5MDQzLzE3NDkyMTMuZ2lm/347x500/g8HMeJ.gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMzE5MDQzLzE3NDkyMTMuZ2lm/347x500/g8HMeJ.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope one day, this sort of game will come to realization... But for now it's only a dream."
f8zxvm,A Mario cart style racing game where all players have a set amount of gas and can only get more from destroyed opponents,First off I have no clue how to balance something like this.\n\nBut it would be battle-royal-ish. And no player would have enough gas to reach the end by themselves.\n\nI think this idea would force players to remain close to the other races making for a high action race. \n\ninstead of the guy in first being a mile ahead of everyone. He would be forced to stick near other players so he doesn’t run out of gas.\n\nAnd yes this is inspired by the racing scene in Ready Player One.
f8zrmc,Hamster Ball Race Manager,"been addicted in watching marble race in YT and came up on this idea:\n\nA hamster ball race manager\n\nThe player basically plays as an owner of hamsters whom sets them into ball races.\n\nThe player can buy different hamsters with their own stats, monitor their fitness, diet, design their habitats, train them.\n\nRace theme can be olympics, formula 1, sand rally, or obstacle courses.\n\nbest be made in 3d but 2d may work too.\n\nadd more ideas!"
f8ybp2,Avatar the last air bender/legend of Korra world mmorpg,"The ground is already there, the world, nations, classes, abilities, factions, mounts, pets, etc. The PvP can be agni-kais, bending arenas or siege of cities. I would use a resource system like ESO for combat, but more of a hack n slash feel so it feels more like the series. As for story, I'm thinking the worlds avatar is currently evil, hiding in the spirit world, and you have to travel to sages etc. to learn/re-live the lives of previous avatars to learn new abilities and get clues of how to find and defeat the avatar, that way you can meet old characters people love, but have the game set in a post-Korra era, mixing old and new technologies and blending nostalgia and being relevant."

f8wty8,football except the ball is a weapon instead,"so its top down football, and when you have no weapon you have a dash attack, which of course will make the weapon holder drop the weapon when hit, but here is where it gets interesting, there are three weapons, sword, bow, and shield. (you use the ability to dash when you have it)\n\nthe sword:you can swing this sword to stun others when they are hit with it.\n\nbow:you can shoot arrows which stun others when they are hit with it.\n\nyou can block dashes which stun them when they are blocked.\n\nand i don't really have anything more to say, other than that it plays like football."
f8rs25,A game where the day restarts over and over again (like Groundhog Day) but you play as a different character every time.,"Let’s say there are about 20 - 30 characters and everyday after 12pm or if you die you restart the day and you are somebody else. From an office worker to a random high school student to the mayor to a hobo on the street. \n\nYour goal is pretty simple, solve a murder (or another mystery, maybe find out why this Groundhog Day thing is happening?) in a small town. You can interact with the other characters in dialogue and find clues as to what’s happening. You will have a journal that will transfer between characters but any other items will be gone. Certain characters have certain benefits and disadvantages like the mayor has access to more information or areas but he has more work to do before you can actually do stuff with him. When you play as the homeless guy you can move and do things the entire day but of course you start the day broke and with nothing.\n\nIf I were to make it, it would be in a pixel art top down view."
f8qf5m,I'm once again asking for your (not financial) support. I have basic idea for a game but I can't visualise it and select a proper genre.,"Game would be called Popejoy.\n\nPopejoy is a synthetic drug manufactured by Catholic Church causing state of higher connection with ""god"". The world has been ruled by priests since it's invention.\n\nI imagine a character that has a true connection with the God and God asked him to purge those Catholics that created such horrible drug. I am open to all suggestions it's something I loosely think of and would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nI need some answers tho. What would be a fitting genre for it?\nWhat would be CAMERA, CHARACTER AND CONTROLS?"
f8q3kw,Interactive Images as character avatar,"Think of game like [Legend of Grimrock 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251730/Legend_of_Grimrock_2/) but you can choice an image from your hard drive as your characters. This by it self good but it RPG game so each time you get an item you can place it on the image, like a helmet where you can drag it to the character head, you can make the helmet bigger or smaller too.\n\nnow it will be recommended to have image where the character is looking foreword.\n\nI like the idea od a game where I can use my images in a game, like make My friends and me a party of RPG characters, as far as I know there no game like this beside ""Blood Rally Show"" that come last week but that was a racing game"
f8phr7,Secret Power,"In this game, you create and run your own secret society(which you can name).\n\nAt first, there are just a few friends, but as you advance through the Ranks, you recruit top VIPs. You decide if the Society will be good or evil. Regardless, your meetings will sometimes attacked by conspiracy theorists with guns. \n\nYou build/furnish a headquarter, design secret symbols and use the almost unlimited money to buy mansions, cars, yachts, etc. A private army is needed to fight other rival societies.\n\nYou meet and recruit aliens, fight space wars and get secret technologies like time travel or teleporting."
f8p5tu,An idea I’ve had for a short while,A giant map surrounded by sea. Massively multiplayer (no I’m not about to suggest rust) everyone stuck on an island together. You must build defenses and  survive aginst other people also making kingdoms of their own. So basically Warcraft 2: tides of darkness but massively multiplayer and pvp/maybe pve
f8od4f,Weapon deterioration in a looter shooter,"One of the things I want to propose is a system that would make a game unique in the looter shooter genre: Weapon and gear deterioration/durability, similar to games like The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. In such a system items could degrade over time and/or usage and eventually become scrap. Quicker deterioration over time would create a larger sense of urgency in using an item where it is most useful. Quicker deterioration from usage would create a larger sense of importance where it is used. This could also create a gameplay loop of looting with possibly weaker equipment with higher durability to get higher power loot to consume in high level activities.\n\nExpansion on this system could include repairing after usage. My idea for repairing would be that you can repair an item when it is below 90% of the current maximum durability, up to 90% which becomes the new maximum. For example:\n- Item drops with durability of 1000\n- Item deteriorates to durability of 500\n- ... is repaired durability of 900, becoming the new maximum\n- … deteriorates to durability of 800, repaired to new maximum of 810\netc.\nIn other words it is a geometric sequence, b0.9n, where 0.9 is the common ratio, and n is the number of times you’ve repaired your weapon, and b is the base maximum durability. While I did specify in this idea the common ratio, it too could be a variable as a feature of certain weapons. Some weapons may repair better, worse, fully, or not at all. (Full repairs should be expensive though and with weaker weapons in my opinion.) Another feature could be to extend the timer a weapon or piece of gear has for usage in an objective.\n\nThe ramifications of this would be that players work to progress against regressing constantly, and have to engage with using weaker, common weapons when doing easy activities, as opposed to using high level, powerful weapons like they’re not rare. Thoughts?"
f8o97r,a cemetery management game.,"you are put in charge of a cemetery. it gets more and more complicated when you level up. for example, you start with the local garden-variety cemetery with a few plots. at night there are small animals that come, or people, or mysterious stuff happen or get dug out. or there might be problems like weather destroying tombs and you have to rescue people. oh i mean dead bodies. if too many people get turned away from the cemetery due to lack of spaces you will lose points. and it's not always immediately clear what's the most ethical thing to do when situations arise. you eventually move onto more complicated cemeteries like within pyramids or something. and you can level up your own character or buy help to look after the cemetery and fight monsters and zombies and dead fetishists, or build crematoriums etc."
f8nk23,Bloodsport,"A online game where it's just a death match. Players spawn in an area and the goal is to get the most amount of kills in a time limit.\n\nMaps could be a city, swears or plains.\n\nWeapons and armour will fall from the sky (And somehow not break on impact). some weapons will have special effects like increased durability, larger clip or setting people on fire.\n\nThe Player who has the most killed will get to spin a wheel to gain a special effect for the next round. Like increased speed or regeneration.\n\n2 modes, a free-for-all or team base.\n\nThere's also seems to be some kind of mystery. As map seems to take place in a abandon area, no signs of law informant and a red and black symbol appears everywhere."
f8n2we,Game where a small society grows and develops with or without player input.,A small game that you could leave open while you run errands or leave open in the back ground. You can choose to change time scale or “groom” the society if you will to make it look like what you’d like it or leave it to chance.  Think that one episode of Love Death and Robots on Netflix where the couple has a small civilization living in the freezer with a small bit more interaction. Maybe at some point it reaches a certain level where it has an extinction event and is forced to restart.
f8ley4,Game ideas,Hey so ive had a few game ideas in my head for a while and I want to see if they were any good or not\n\n1# a game about having interchangeable arms which give unique abilities. There are about 30-50 arms to collect in total and ypu can do cool combos with them. For example: a grappling hook arm that can be used to pull enemies towards you and an explosive arm that can deal a lot of damage close range.Its essentially a 2d metroidvania\n\n2# a game with a skill tree that determines your playstyle by using class-type sections. Like one section is for paladin and the other is for mage.There are about for sections of the skill tree and about 4 phases. But if you want to get the next phases you have to sacrifice one of the class sections in favor for the others.\n\nPls let me know what you guys think. Thx
f8l1x8,Combo Breaker!,"So, this would be a fighting game based around who had the stronger combos. Instead of having health, the players would have a number of hits they could take. Lets just say 50. You have to hit the other player 50 times to win the round. The fun comes in with hitting the different combos. There would be combos of 3 to 10 hits growing in difficulty from 3 to 10. If you only hit the other player once or twice, you would get stunned and those hits would not register because it was not a true combo.\n\nTell me what you think, if anyone makes this I would love to write the soundtrack!"
f8ktdw,Half-formed chess adventure game,"This is from my 10yo son so there are a lot of holes but I think there’s an interesting concept here and we’d both appreciate input as he’s doing this to learn Unity. \n\nYou start as a pawn. You advance through a world (2D? 3D?) using the rules of a pawn: one space at a time unless an enemy appears. Eventually you come across a person who gives you some challenge and when you complete it, the person turns out to be a king. You learn a rival faction is planning to capture the king so you round up seven friends and vow to protect him.\n\nAs you continue forward (always forward), you hit other challenges (not sure what they’d look like; chess problems maybe?) and as you win them, more troops join your crusade, each with a different means of travel, matching the different pieces. \n\nThat’s more or less it. It’s kind of a story in search of some form of gameplay now that I type it out but I like the basic concept of building an army of troops with different capabilities and using them to win challenges. But I’m not much of a game designer myself so I don’t know where to go with it."
f8kg7v,Fighting people with prayer,"You and the other fighter (AI or another player) have to say various prayers to god to attack the other person, who has a different god. If you say a prayer incorrectly however, your god smites you for wasting their time with meaningless words.  Stronger prayers may be longer and more difficult to say, and may have drawbacks, like cutting off food supply would mean traders might not reach your city, or an earthquake might hit some homes of your city. The names of your god and the syntax of prayers is randomized beforehand, and revealed to you for 30 seconds before the duel."
f8jxm4,[Reqest] Alphabet Game ?,"Hello Everybody\n\nso I was wondering what is the best way to teach the alphabet of any language (for all target audience, not just kids)\n\nwhats the best method so the player will never forget about the learned letter\n\nshould it be like he needs to play a quest where he finds the missing letter or something like that ?\n\nthank you so much guys for your time and reading"
f8h5pe,Watch Fixer Simulator,"A game like PC Building Simulator on Steam, but instead you fix and replace and experiment with the complexities of different watch movements and are able to build custom watches for in-game customer specification. Largely free for customisation in parts and materials and colours. As an add on, PC Sim uses real life parts, so it would be sweet to see if real life watch movements could be placed in the game. Tonnes of potential in entertainment and educational value for this idea, if done the right way."
f8fs6b,Soul Therapist.,"I have seen few games a'la Papers Please here wich was nice (I liked Dream Manager) so I will try mine.   \nSo imagine that after someone dies he doesn't go to heaven or hell instantly and he doesn't actually get judged but rather has to pass a test. You have to meet statistics like crossing the border in Papers Please. But people have the possibility to redeem themselves so they are in a big waiting room like in some kind of hospital. They come to you and you see their card you know what kind of people are they and you choose... Therapy. You tell them which rooms they should go to and wait till their statistics will grow. You should take care of them and look out for them turning into demons/vanish or being summoned by the ouija board.   \nI would see it as old type ""Hospital Tycoon"" game with mix of Papers Please.  \n\n\nAny ideas for special mechanics ?   \n\n\nPS: I know it's really tricky since things that are considered good or bad are different in different cultures or religions so it would be hard to design an afterlife that is universal."

f8cqtv,"A ""realistic"" battle royale","The map would be randomly generated, but a random  ""theme"" that the map would be (neighborhood, city, rural, etc) and a size would be randomly chosen.\n\nYes, everyone would fight until there was one person standing. But, there wouldn't be guns and ammo everywhere. Inside homes, you would find things you would typically find inside a home. Inside a store, you would find things typically inside a store. Guns would be rare, and usually found inside sturdy gun safes.\n\nPlayers would have to revolve around melee weapons and improvised weapons. Most things not nailed down would be usable as a weapon."

f8755x,A turn based rpg game where you play as two barbarian sisters who must go through the nine realms to slay odin,In this game you play as two barbarian sisters who are on a quest to kill odin for killing their parents. In this game you will travel to through nine realms and battle various norse mythology creatures and gods. To give you a idea of the controls i will use the buttons on a ps4 controller to give you a good idea on how the game is like\n———————————————————\n\n\n\nL3- move around and when in battle used to choose a action. Sometimes when its an enemies turn to attack you have to move around in order to avoid their attack\n\nTriangle- used to open things and talk to people\n\nSquare- Used to attack. When your not in a battle you can use it to attack the enemy so you can go first in a battle. While your in battle you will have to press square right when your about to hit an enemy. If you fail to time the button at the right time you deal either zero damage or not alot of damage.\n\n\n\nX- jump/avoid. If your in battle this button can be used to jump to avoid your enemies attacks\n\n\nCircle and L2- parry/ block. If your able to block all of your enemies attacks then you will be able to parry them and inflict extra damage. But if you block at the wrong time the enemy will inflict extra damage.\n\nR2- run\n\n\nOptions button- used to change settings and open inventory to change your weapons and remove items\n——————————————————————\nPlease tell me your thoughts on this. Im a 16 year old who wants to create games in the future and im just wondering if my game ideas are good
f861xi,Random Game Idea Generator,"I love this sub; I never post because I'm not great at coming up with my own ideas, but I love taking 10mins to think about how some of the game ideas posted on here would work (and how they wouldn't).\n\nSo, my contribution: [https://indiegamedev.net/2020/02/23/random-game-idea-generator/](https://indiegamedev.net/2020/02/23/random-game-idea-generator/)\n\nIt comes up with some pretty weird shit, but I've already got like 10 ideas running in my head."

f7y724,"Inspired by ""Samir, you are breaking the car!!"" a VR game in which you're testing for various jobs while the instructors viciously berate you for doing so poorly.","The game is like a cross between *Job Simulator* and *The Stanley Parable*, with a range of job test scenarios and a cast of voiced instructors screaming instructions at you, then judging and commenting on your every failure.\n\nThe game is inspired by [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9-voINFkCg)\n\nEach scenario is some ludicrous job test, designed to feel unfairly difficult for beginners. This includes a taxi driving test on a slippery track with dummy pedestrians running all over the road, or a crabbing boat crane operator test during an intense superstorm, or a police shooting gallery for an unrealistic *Die Hard*-style hostage situation.\n\nYou can play scenarios earnestly trying to do the best you can for high scores... or you can play **""the wrong way""** and try to find/unlock all the rare insults for committing rare and unique mistakes."
f7wbyr,Telltale style choice game,"So I had an idea for a telltale choice style game based on the life of Kurt Cobain, it could start in his teen years"
f7tbnv,Slightly different tower defense,"* you can place as many towers as you want, no money or cooldowns involved to build them\n* when a tower shoots it uses shared energy consumed from an energy bar, so you need to administer that correctly\n* towers shoot only in a straight line and when you tap them, not automatically\n\nSo you have to kind of manage towers in how/when they shoot and how they spend resources when shooting, rather than managing how/when they are built"
f7rbjf,Very Simple Simulator-Type Game,"I am TIRED of making these big games with humongous ideas that I just get lazy with because of how repetitive it gets. So I am just gonna have a simple idea, with a simple game. You are a fisher. End of your description. You must fish to earn cash (of course there will be variety of fish, the more rare the fish is the more money and exp you will get) levels (to be explained) and.. that’s basically it. You will take this hard earned cash to a shop keeper. You can buy better baits, and misc to easily get better fish. The higher level you are the better equipment you unlock. Pretty cool huh? What? It sounds like a basic... boring.... simulator? Of course it does, it’s literally a dumb clicker game at that rate, I thought to myself. So I decided to add a hunger bar (maybe more) to up the stakes. You must fish to get the money to get the food at the shop. Yeah it still sounds dumb but it’s pretty cool if you think about it. You can take something calming (like fishing) and mix it with intensity and suspense (like striving to survive) There is always a bit of suspense of that hunger bar. The chances of fishing are too slim to rely on it for survival. The possibilities aren’t endless, but vast far and beyond. What if the fish you caught don’t pay up to the amount of hunger you lost? What if the fish you caught don’t pay for your food at all? And you starve. These thoughts can be pushed away with better equipment, but to get better equipment you need to level up, but to level up... you have to of course survive, and for that... May luck be on your side. So? Does it sound like a good game to play for a couple of minutes? My goal is just for somebody to sit down with it and play for 10 minutes... and stand up thinking “Cool.”"
f7r4pl,Soccer Team Director (not manager!),"Most of soccer management games that exist are highly focused on the tactics. But the aspect I enjoy the most is the resources management: buying players to sell them later for twice the price, investing in infrastructures, choose the right staff...\n\nThat why I started working on a prototype of Team Director (working title). \n\nWe'll be able to invest in the stadium and other club infrastructures (training ground, youth academy,...), hire staff (Manager, Marketing director, Medical team, etc), hire and sell players\n\nThe manager will be the most important hiring. He will choose tactics and players for each game. He may request a given type of player (a strong midfielder, a fast forward, ...). His ability will strongly influence the team performance and moral. But their ability will be linked to their favorite tactic: if I hire a manager specialised in Counter Attack, but the team doesn't have fast enough players, he will naturally fail, no matter how good he is.\n\nThey players will have a small set of traits (to avoid the overcomplicated system of Football Manager), such as Speed, Strength, Technique, Pass, Talent and Work Rate (the last two will influence how fast they evolve). A season will take 30/60 minutes, so we will go through the excitement of building a squad quite often :)\n\nInvesting in infrastructure will be expensive but will bring more money or help the team performance and growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the reasons I'm doing this project is because it's I really wanted to work on a game, but I suck at design and art. This project is just a bunch of GUIs. I'm using Godot.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you play it? Do you have any ideas?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!"
f7q84o,Immigrant Simulator,"A role-playing game in which you play as an immigrant in some made up country, which kinda looks like the US, cause you know which country you think of when you think about the immigrants, right?\n\nSo in this game, you basically need to survive in the new environment. You will have some stats like health, cash, skills, etc, like in other RPG games and you need to do some actions to improve them. So you will need to get a job, but different jobs require different skills. I also think about it as a fun and engaging way for people who want to learn some second language to practice. For example, in the beginning you will have several options to get a job and they all will be some simple jobs that will not require language skills and the jobs that will do. And the more language is involved, the more cash you can get per hour.\n\nThe job process can be done in a set of mini-games. Like you can be a dishwasher and there will be some simple mini-game in the setting. Or you can be a barista at the coffee shop and it can be wrapped into a pokemon like mechanics, like: ""Wild customer appears"" and you and the customer will be placed into the similar to pokemon interface and you will need to understand what the user wants. If you succeed, you will be paid. If not, then after several trials you'll be fired.  \n\n\nFor the graphics, I think it's better to keep it simple, like pixel-art. But I'm not sure maybe it's really easier to go 3d nowadays. \n\nThose are basically raw thoughts about the game. Please let me know if you interested and maybe we could make something from it. I'm just a beginner in the game dev, so it's basically a hobby thing.\n\nAnyway, I'm open to anything, it's just a bunch of thought I had recently."
f7ly7o,Need Ideas (please help),"I'm just about to finish my game and I'm having troubles trying to figure out what I should do for my next one. Do you guys have any ideas? (I'm a terrible 3d artist, so please dont recommend 3d games)"
f7hs1a,Superman game,I’m going to start a Superman project on ps4 dreams. I want to upgrade powers from nothing to how he is in the comics. For example upgrade jump height until flight is achieved. Increase weight he can carry. Health etc. if you have any more ideas let me know.
f7hdrz,Sports game with stealth sabotage,This is based of a strange dream I had a while back. I was a team of super humans playing this capture the flag type game in a league with other super humans. It was very similar to Tribes except each player had a special ability unique to them. My team would go from planet to planet in a small fleet of space ships. Once we got there we would meet up with an opposing team in orbit set a date and location planet side for our match and go play. While we waited for the match I found a way to teleport on to the other team's ships and would go about sabotaging their equipment and super powers prior to the main game. I remember the sabotage sections would play out from a top down POV of their ship so I could track camera and crew movements.\n\nSo that is the idea: On one level a super ability based sports game and on another level a stealth based infiltration game.
f7fwbn,"A U.S Civil War themed, Mario Kart-style racing game.","A history racing game, where your playable characters are Civil War historic figures, but they do drive go carts.

f7e0er,"A MOBA, except it's also a 2D side-scroll fighting game","Many of us are familiar with MOBA games, like League of Legends and Dota. There are two teams of five players, three lanes, and the objective is to destroy the enemy base/towers.\n\nThis idea is based on those basic rules, but it takes the form of a 2D side-scroll fighting game, like Street Fighter and Mortal Combat.\n\nBefore you leave your spawn point, you select one of three ""lanes"" which you teleport to. Each lane is a long, side-scroll map, in which you should push forward, battling opponent players as you go. \n\nAt the end of the map is the enemy base, which you must attack and destroy. The bases of all three lanes share the same health bar, so even if your teammates are all in different lanes and cannot see each other, you would all be technically working together.\n\nSpecific details would be largely similar to traditional MOBA games. A diverse roster of characters to choose from with different roles/styles, turrets placed thought the map, minions, and so on."
f7di3i,"Papers, Please-like game idea","So I have this idea for a video game, like Papers, Please; but, instead of checking passports, you archive old videos, like from the long gone, to the lost ones that still has hopes to be found, for the sake of preserving national &amp; cultural (and sometimes global) history.\n\nYou start out cleaning films, enhance the colors, transferring the films into a common video format, etc. I could not think of how the mechanics of this particular part would work, maybe inspired by WarioWare minigames or something along the lines of that, maybe a little bit of a puzzle element as well if you wanna go brave.\n\nIn this game, you'd most likely find short films, old silent type films, sometimes even full-length movies! But if you'd continue through, you'd eventually find government hearings, government meetings, election campaign videos, there might be even propaganda! This particular part is what I want to focus on, how media can teach you history, of how did the world or the state had operated, what had happened before, it kind of makes you learn!\n\nIn conclusion, this is one game idea that I would want to make into an actual game. I really like worldbuilding and this is how I wanna express it. By showing you how the world works, how did it get into the shape of today, how the consequences affect the other things around that, I just wanna give, like a tour around my world like it's a museum, except there's no guide, and you experience it by learning it by doing it yourself."

f79rp3,For people who like MMORPG and trading.,"Since as a kid, I loved to play trading games and adventure games. Since few years ago I’ve been playing too much video games, one time I was scrolling down the games on steam and other sources, but nothing would fill my interest. I always had the thought of making a game that I always wanted and would have fun with a community in it. This is a game idea that I thought of since a few days ago.\n\nThe general idea of this game is that you fight, trade and conquer. You have 5 main jobs in this game, those are:\nWizard\nWarrior\nArcher\nRogue\nTrader\nAs for wizard, warrior, archer and rogue it is just like common MMORPG but you can advance from example from wizard to healer, then healer to legion healer, etc.\nBut for trader, you get to create your own shop. By creating your own shop you can make materials for players who are in the fighting field to buy items and materials from your shop. As you gain more in-game currency you can get more materials and items from trading with other traders or buying materials from an in-game shop. \nWhen you have lots of money lying around as a trader then you can evolve your class to a village chief where you can have a few houses where players pay in-game currency to stay in and a few shops which makes you a village chief with quite a wide range of land. As that progress, after you reached higher requirements you can become the noble, etc.\n\nThese were just the general idea of the game, I just wanted to post this so you guys can give me your opinions and questions about it. I would love to hear you guys talking about it as well!"
f77zm3,Cyberpunk Cooperative Heist Game with Asymmetrical Roles,"     Your squad’s fixer just came in with a new contract from a mystery corp. A rival company has just poached one of this mystery corp’s engineers. He was a key member in the development of their latest encryption software and they want him back- or at least they don’t want anyone else to have him. \n\n     You accept the contract and begin mission brief. Each player selects a role and you sit down to come up with a plan of attack. I’ve imagined the roles as follows:\n\nFace — Charming and silver tongued with a knack for improvisation and disguise. You’ll need to maneuver your way through conversations to gain access to off clearance sectors, cause distractions, and pilfer key information. You’re the social engineer of the team.\n\nMuscle — While your companions may know their way around a gun, you know your way around every gun... or sword, monofilament wire, explosives, exoskeleton, and prosthetic rocket propelled fist. You’ll need to be there when the going gets tough- and it always does. Whether it be hosting unexpected company, cutting through a blast door or hostage negotiations.\n\nTechnician — Keyboard cadet and cyberspace cowboy. You’ll need to use your skills to extract data, disable security and surveillance, as well as feed information to the Operator to make sure the mission goes smoothly.\n\nOperator — Keep talking and nobody explodes. Eye in the sky, reassuring voice and the architect of the operation. The only member with all of the pieces to the puzzle, it’s up to you to put them together. You’ll have access to building plans, company directories, a search engine, hostile radio chatter, and electronics schematics. You’ll need to work with the Technician to fill in the blanks, provide the Face details about the Suit they’re intercepting, and tell the Muscle they’ve got sixty seconds to clear the room or they’re in for a fight.\n\nMy idea for this in my head has the Face, Muscle and Technician using a third person shooter-style perspective and all having access to a sidearm but the core mechanics being fairly different between each. The Operator would likely be an off-site player in first person with a sort of series of monitors and screens displaying all of the information they have available as well as team vitals, and a mission clock. The overall focus of the game would be complete interplay between the roles required to succeed.\n\nThe Face core gameplay loop would be more dialogue oriented with a timed ‘select an option’ chat system. Other roles would also enter dialogue when approached before things become hostile but what’s special about the Face is that they will have limited options to bullshit the NPC they are engaged with to extend the conversation timer. The Operator is meant to provide Face with subjects they can use to interrogate if the goal is info extraction or just delay someone if they are buying time for another role to accomplish their task. Say this NPC is wearing a badge when Face approaches. Face checks the badge and repeats the name back so Operator hears it “Oscar Meyer” or something. Technician is working on a jack in point just around the corner from where this conversation is happening. Operator does a search on Oscar Meyer and finds his social media profile which they drag and drop on to the Face’ screen on their HUD. Face gets a HUD notification and the dialogue tree then populates with “hey, happy belated birthday by the way! How was the party?”, “I was so sorry to hear about your grandmother.” Or “Did you use to work at AmazCorp? I thought you were familiar.”\n\nI also have some ideas on Face being able to swap clothing with an incapacitated person, or swipe a lab coat, safety goggles and a key card to blend in. I dislike the idea very much of just going invisible when you put on a dress a la Hitman games. Very basic stealth elements to compliment the general spy vibe I want this role to have.\n\nI have a very complete idea of how each role will work and be fun enough in their own right that I will expand on later. No role is one dimension by any means though. One of my thoughts for the technician is that there are options to do basic ‘hack’ type deals to get in to a desktop but there are also ports or terminals where you can jack in and enter a cyberspace area where you reach out and grab literal data packets- see manifested versions of anti-malware.\n\nI want the main character progression in this game to revolve around gadgets, cybernetic enhancements and prosthetics that are purchased with credits from successful scores. You’ll be able to create a character for each role that is entirely separate. Ideas for things you may get access to buy for your roles... \n\nFace: Eyes that can have a hypnotizing effect, built in projector for illusory effect, smoke and mirror style effects, aphrodisiac pheromone release, lock-pick or poisoned needle hidden in a fingertip, audible heart rate detector...\n\nMuscle: single shot slug prosthetic (hand cannon), Wolverine style retractable claws, grappling hook, corrosive saliva, aim assist eyes, arm that becomes a torch cutter or welder, enhanced strength or speed exoskeleton...\n\nTechnician: access to different dongles for auto hacks, drone tech, AR/HUD modifications, a lot of focus on items to improve your effectiveness in the virtual space dealing with ICE, eyes that flash to blind people, enhanced hearing and early warning system... idea for tech is that they kind of build their own Jarvis or Friday and are putting together a completely package of tools to get them in.\n\nOperator: I don’t think this will have the same style of progression as the other roles outside of cosmetics. I haven’t worked out what progress should look like for this role but I have some ideas concerning special abilities they can use on a limited basis during the mission. Something like the team runs in to trouble and the Operator can call in a favor, pull some strings or ‘knows a guy’.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and I will continue to expand on this once I have more time."
f72h3d,Mafia management RTS,"The game would visually resemble C&amp;C, AoE, Iron Harvest and the like.\n\nThe player would be tasked to manage a mafia organization in a populated town. The whole map would be a town and it would be littered by people having their own daily life; doing their jobs, going to parks, eating in restaurants or shopping or maybe doing BBQ parties in their backyard.\n\nThe player can establish bases/hideouts in abandoned buildings in shadey alleys and recruit members from street urchins to notorious criminals. The mafia can ~~force~~ offer protection to nearby business establishments for income, practice loansharking, drug trafficking, slave trafficking, illegal gambling, or even organize large crimes such as bank heists.\n\nThe mafia can access black markets for arms trade and bribe or lure politicians and government officials to their side. Police/sheriff units will try to stop and hunt mafia members and may organize raids on the gang's properties. Vigilantes may also be present as well.\n\nThe main goal of the game would be to conquer other mafia territories and rule the whole town.\n\nThe difference of this game from other existing RTS mentioned above would be, the player will not strategically place their buildings. The player instead will strategically conquer existing buildings and perhaps give them upgrades later on. The player must also hide their units from peacekeeping bodies and enemy mafias to prevent unnecessary bloodshed and, if possible, if the setting would be in the modern times, the road networks should have vehicles with lifelike traffic sequences so commanding escape vans and setting routes for illegal packages would require strategy.\n\nI would love to see this in steampunk theme but it can also be anything. There can be Yakuza and Bratvia factions. There can even be Vampire factions or Alien infested factions.\n\n\nLong Post! Thank you for reading!"
f71qz2,Realistic sci-fi AR helmet HUD design,"Hello, all. Perhaps r/gameideas isn't the best subreddit for this post, but I've posted some and lurked a lot enough to be familiar with the community, so hopefully it still fits.\n\nI've always been interested in the pseudo-futuristic AR HUDs from sci-fi romps, spy flicks, and in most recent memory: Iron Man. The thing is, most designs seem to favor showmanship over practicality. There's usually a ton of flashy icons, rotating disks, and what UI bars floating around everywhere without a lot of thought into WHY that stuff exists. Why is that disk rotating? Why is that bar rapidly shrinking and growing? \n\nMy request/question is: if you were to design a realistic, practical AR HUD for a spy or superhero, what functionality and layout would you like to see. GPS navigation is a given, but that already exists for civilian use. I'm curious about what things a spy or superhero might be able to use. Just looking for ideas. Thanks!"

f70elf,Wave based base building survival game BUT...,"This is a concept i came up with last year when game maker's toolkit opened that year's game jam, some of you may remember that the condition of that jam was ""only one [blank]""\n\naround that time i was fantasicing with playing a top down survival game where you get to build a base, place traps, and try to defend It from waves of enemies that would rush you over the night, the idea was rather simple but It had the potential to be very addictive game, and this Is when the game jam's concept comes into play.\n\nIn any game where you get to build things, you get to do It in exchange for resources, money, wood, anything that stops you from building for free, so how about a wave based base building survival game with only one resource\n\nThis one resource is just an idea i had for the already existing concept and the same game could be perfectly Made without It, but if that mechanic seems interesting enough for some dev that hopefully reads this, basically you can aproach how you get It however you want, the idea Is that literally every aspect of the game rounds around this only resource (im calling It X for now), for example: \n\nIf you get to use guns in the game, you build/Buy and shoot them using X\n\nIf you want to build a wall or any extructure, you use X\n\nIf there Is a shop, you buy things from It in exchange of X\n\nIf an enemy hits you, you loose X\n\nIf you run out of X, its over\n\nThis are just some examples of how this mechanic could be approached but as i said earlier, this Is not a bible, its a template, even the whole X mechanic can be ignored and make a straight forward base building survival game and if a dev actually makes a game like this, please link It here or DM me or whatever, cause i'd even Buy It\n\nTL:DR: a survival game that involves base building and defending from waves of enemies that attack periodically or over night, extra mechanic of only one resource being used and making everything round around it Is optional"
f6y736,Interesting game idea?,"So I am a nerd and I play paper and pencil RPGs. (E.G. Dungeons and Dragons). I was thinking about how there are endless combat possibilities in these RPGs and I thought it would be really cool if you could do more advanced combat maneuvers with certain items or special combos in FIRST PERSON games. I’m not talking about games like Mortal Combat and all, I’m talking about games like Skyrim. Maybe you could even invent your combos yourself in some special attack settings list. I think this is a really cool idea, I know it would be hard to make and time consuming, but would overall be an amazing addition to first person combat games. Who agrees and what do you think?\n(Side note—Halo is really good at these combat maneuvers but again, there’s no way to control what you actually do in the assassinations)"
f6xx99,Generate game idea,"What r the lost or dead game genre? Maybe v can think of some in creating the game. I was thinking of MUD..it would be a great game if MUD combines with battle royale, puzzle, or horror as MUD is quite dead."
f6xdbr,Unique city building game,you place different zones on a map and each zone is is a different type of building but to unlock new zones buy blending zones you have like homes + office = skyscraper  (I have not decided which zones should be combined to which zones. but some zones can be unlocked by reaching a high enough population.\n\nthe would be on mobile And have simple graphic.
f6wtfs,Supernatural video game idea!,"I have a game idea,  but it’s in screenshots on my phone. It’s an open world game along the lines of Skyrim or the new god of war, but based on supernatural."
f6uqb3,A multiplayer open-world survival horror game I (probably) never will create based on a nightmare I had.,"Okay, I probably won't make this game, not only because it would be a leviathan of a project but also because I'm already working on a bigger and a smaller project.\n\nThis game (I have no name, lol) or at least the idea is based on a nightmare I had. Well, it probably was supposed to be a nightmare but I quite enjoyed the dream and got this idea from it:\n\nYou start in a multi-complex building in a very big but not unlimited open-world that is build to losely resemble europe, having different countries with switchong languages, flags, vehicles and a comparable scale. You are alone, if you play solo, you are the only one in the world (although mods could change this, I would give the game a high modability). Well, at least you are the only human. No, it's not a zombie game, we alread have enough of them. You are chased by a ghost-demon type spirit, it will instantly know where you are and start on the lowest floor in the building. It will make distinctive sounds when it spotted, lost you or has knowledge in which are (up to 500m) you hold up. If it gets you, you're out.\n\nThe goal is to survive a week, each day taking 30 reallife minutes, you can drive cars, fly planes and helicopters but you also need to sleep, eat, drink and go to the toilet (revolutionary!), however, the spirit will travel just a bit slower than you can run (or drive if you're in a vehicle) to stay near you, every night at exactly 12 AM it will teleport to a random location in a 2km radius and will know your general location.\n\nIt also should be smart, it should be able to calculate where it is possible you will be next, identify looted places and e.g. lights in a building and associate this with you, being able to nearly act like a human (it also can be controlled by a human).\n\nThat's my idea. Never seen before but to big to realise, maybe a big company could make such a game but they won't.\n\nIf you have the ressources to make this game, feel free to PM me. Thanks for reading!"
f6ua4e,2D Prison Game! kinda like prison architecture,"**Concept**  \nA prison game where you are a prison guard. You have to guard the prison you're assigned to, keep prisoners in check, escort them to their daily tasks like the cafeteria and showers. Stop riots, fights, and contraband.  \n\n\nThats the main simple point of the game, you're a prison guard following standard prison procedures.  \n\n\nBut how can we make it more interesting and fun?  \n**List of possible ideas**  \n\n\n1. You can do unjustful acts on prisoners like torturing them, refusing to give them their meal, etc. However, if you get caught by the sheriff doing such acts, you will get punished for it.\n2. The prison gets an income every game week or day that you can use to upgrade the prison, the more upgrades, worse prisoners come in.\n3. Riots, and other random events can cause upgrades or number of bodyguards to be reduced. If a riot succeeds and is not stopped in time, something like your camera upgrade can go from level 3 to level 2. If riots cause guards to be killed, you will need to hire new guards, etc\n4. It can either have a set prison already made, or it can be like fallout 4 shelter, you build it yourself with preset rooms that you buy\n\n  \nIdk how to dev, if anyone can send a good tutorial, maybe one day I can learn enough to make this"

f6r871,Our town is a mystery murder and animal crossing.,"So like, I have this written down in a word document. But, it's how the game would work. Sadly, not the story. But I will tell you what I have story wise, and I will paste the inner workings. Then go from there\n\nStory \n\nYou the player, are assigned to a worn down town to be replacement mayor. Because the old one has gone missing, and someone has to fill in the shoes. You are placed there by the government, so they can find out why people around that area have gone missing, also find out what weird happings have been going on. So you assume the role as mayor, you soon find out that there are mystical strings being pulled.\n\n\nInner workings\n\n Characters:\n\nTypes of species:\n\nDevils 24\n\n1 - Spore, Free Spirit, (Masculine, Kind)\n\nAngels 24\n\n1-\n\nRobins 24\n\n1-\n\nRavens 24\n\n1-\n\nOwls 24\n\n1 - Errol, Ordinary (Gentle, Lazy)\n\nBats 24 \n\n1 - Carol, Withdrawn (Bizarre, Emotional)\n\nSnakes 24\n\n1 - Aphrodite, Narcissistic (Earthy, Youthful)\n\nBears 24\n\n1 - Tadhg (tige), Traditional  (Ambitious, Forgetful)\n\nGoats 24\n\n1 - Grace, luxurious (Impulsive, Moody)\n\nDeer 24\n\n1 -\n\nHares 24\n\n1 -\n\nFox's 24\n\n1 -\n\nWolf's 24 \n\n1 -\n\nspecial characters 10\n\n1 - Secretary\n\n2 - Agent Stanley\n\n3 - Old mayor\n\n4 -\n\n5 -\n\n6 -\n\n7 -\n\n8 -\n\n9 -\n\n10 -\n\n\nGame systems:\n\nDialogue system\n\nIt will be an option based system. The options will stem from three choices. Choices will stem from affinity bar's or information from agent Stanley.\n\nRelationship system\n\nthere will be 6 personality types:\n\nTraditional\n\nOrdinary\n\nluxurious\n\nNarcissistic\n\nFree Spirit\n\nWithdrawn  \n\nThere will be 52 characters in each personality group. Making 312 out of the 322 villagers. The 10 others are special characters. They will have no personally group. Because of this, they will only have a Affinity bar of +3 to -3 with there being no vow or death bar. \n\nAffinity bar\n\nThe affinity bar will dedicate what tone villagers will talk to you. beginning affinity bars will depend on personality. These are the number values for each starting Affinity bar for each personality.\n\n1. +1 starter\n\n2. 0 starter\n\n3. -1 starter\n\n4. -2 starter\n\n5. +2 starter\n\n6. 0 starter\n\nafter you reach +7 or -7 the affinity bar will change to a ""vow bar"" or ""death bar"" \n\nVow bar\n\nVow bar will replace an affinity bar, after it reaches +7 and a Max of +20. Only one vow bar can be active at a time. When you try to further with another, a decision will have to be made. to slash your current relationship. slashing a vow bar will turn it into a -6 affinity bar. then the affinity bar can only, under certain circumstances containing to that villager, to turn once again into a vow bar.\n\nDeath bar\n\nDeath bar will only appear if an affinity bar is below -7. If the death bar goes any lower than -9 the villager will disappear without a trace, move out of town, or be found dead in there room. with a death bar activated, no matter if the villager is dead or alive. it will never end good for you.\n\nTraits\n\nTraits are secondary to personality. there are 52 traits. They are barely used twice in the same personality group. But each villager will have 2 traits that will distinguish them.\n\nTrait List:\n\nAngry\n\nAdventurous\n\nAggressive\n\nAmbitious\n\nApathetic\n\nArbitrary\n\nBizarre\n\nBrilliant\n\nConfident\n\nCompulsive\n\nDecisive\n\nDramatic\n\nElegant\n\nExcitable\n\nEmotional\n\nEarthy\n\nForgetful\n\nFriendly\n\nFormal\n\nFreewheeling\n\nGentle\n\nGloomy\n\nHardworking\n\nHesitant\n\nImpulsive\n\nIndependent\n\nKind\n\nLazy\n\nLovable\n\nMasculine\n\nMoody\n\nNeat\n\nNeglectful\n\nOdd\n\nOrganized\n\nPerfectionis\n\nPreoccupied\n\nProud\n\nPure\n\nPrivate\n\nRserved\n\nRespectful\n\nSerious\n\nSweet\n\nTidy\n\nTimid\n\nVulnerable\n\nUnsentimental\n\nWhimsical\n\nWise\n\nWitty\n\nYouthful\n\nHow to look at relationships\n\nAn app on your phone ""provided by Agent Stanley"" will show you Affinity bars, and how to increase and decrease. The suggestions will work depending on certain days and times of year. Suggestions will stop showing after +3 is reached. But if you want different suggestions, you can ask Agent Stanley to research. vow bars and death bars will appear in different columns. With personalities sorting them through the columns.\n\n\nMovement system/Camera system\n\n\nIt will be a 3rd person camera. That will be more of a top down view.\n\n\nInventory system\n\n\nA slot like inventory, only small items and medium items can be carried on your person. Limit of 18 small items, while medium items take up 2 spaces with a Max of 9 medium items. Large items will be shipped to the designated destination. Items can be dropped at any time but items can be picked up by villagers if left on the ground for a long period of time.\n\n\nBuilding system\n\n\nBuilding system will work in a grid like structure. Where items can take up at least ¼ of a square. Items from your inventory will be displayed while building indoors, only outdoors in special places.\n\n\nAs mayor, you can help shape the community. Putting in building areas and restrictions. \n\n\nMayor system\nNothing yet\n\nMultiplayer system\nNothing yet\n\nAs you can see I have a I deal going but it looks like it needs a kick and a little help with finishing it's shape. Any help will be appreciated."
f6r0ad,Dream Manager,"In the Afterlife, we have to continue to work the grind and as luck would have it, you are in charge of people's dreams. \n\nPeople need a good balance of paradise and nightmare in their sleeping mind so that they don't get out of hand. Its your job to give people nightmares and good dreams both in healthy supply so they don't go nuts. \n\nYour clients start out as few, just three people to manage their sleep. Easy enough, just experiment and find out what they like or hate so you can use these in their dreams. Remember you need to balance between nightmares and dreams of paradise or they will begin to snap in the waking world and you will get demoted. You might end up having to manage someone's love life...\n\nAs the game progresses you gain more ""clients"" and have to manage more dreams. If you slip up too many times on what scares someone or makes them happy and content then you will begin to get a warning meter that they are not balanced and could slip into needing medications or snapping altogether.\n\nYou start out with a smaller pool of resources for both scares and good dreams but these resources expand as the game goes on. Also as the game goes on the number of acceptable ""losses"" of people to medications or snapping will decrease. \n\nYou can work towards Dream Manage of the Month, the Quarter, and the Year as well as becoming the CEO of Dreams.\n\nThat's my idea so far :)"
f6pqsv,Lord of Self/All - RPG with Management,"This will be a pretty short idea - as with all my other posts, if you like the idea, feel free to use it as you wish (I doubt I will make it myself).\n\nYou are a boy/girl living on a farm. You were adopted, but your records were kept secret even from you for unknown reasons. You've spent years believing you only have your father, mother, and two siblings as your family.\n\nOne day, a group of soldiers led by a knight arrives and asks for you. To your surprise, they all kneel before you. They say that you are the last surviving heir to a noble family that had great influence throughout the kingdom. They are here to escort you and your family to your estate.\n\nYou are presented with a castle, it is in rough shape, but your inheritance will cover the majority of the expenses, and that you'll need to decide what you wish to do with your lands. \n\nYou have a few towns under your family's protection, you have almost 50 soldiers, a captain to lead them, an Archivist to teach you and advise you, an Armsman for making equipment &amp; training new soldiers, and several servants who will take care of your needs. \n\nWhat you do with your lands is entirely up to you. Listen to your people's needs or ignore them, defend them from monsters &amp; other threats or focus on yourself. What you do with affect not just your reputation as a Lord, but also your relationships. \n\nAre you a Lord for yourself or for all?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't thought of what should be involved exactly, but I think it would be interesting if the player could choose to visit those towns themselves, and if they feel it's necessary, to arm themselves &amp; such, and be able to choose to completely rely on their soldiers &amp; such. \n\nUpgrading &amp; repair their estate, hiring more servants &amp; soldiers, securing mines &amp; other resource properties, and choosing to back certain groups of people. As well as dealing with other Noble families that visit the PC's lands, whether to make friends or enemies. \n\nOne thing is for sure - Gender of the PC shouldn't matter as this is a Fantasy. It is set in Medieval times, but it doesn't follow typical Male-Female Heir rules. The PC would have their own stats and abilities, but wouldn't be some ""super"" character, but the PC's soldiers could be. \n\nTo be able to choose to be a Good Lord, a Bad Lord, or anywhere in between. If it were completely up to me, I'd want it to be really tough in many areas with difficult decisions, along with passing judgment during disputes, and having to choose between things that have no ultimately ""best options"". \n\nDunno the visuals &amp; such, but I was thinking of 3rd person perspective being the best choice. Plus most of it should be no voice dialogue, mostly written dialogue with optional choices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's what I got. Like? Dislike? Have more to add? Feel free to add more to it. If you are a Game Dev, you can use this idea however you wish since you'd be the one making it."

They built it to make their way to heaven but were struck down for their arrogance with the language barrier. So in spite of this, they decided to start digging down to be closer to the underworld, to which they were punished yet again with something far worse. Centuries later, you go investing the tower and stumble across an entrance to the lower floors, eventually finding yourself trapped. The goal is to escape by solving puzzles and riddles encrypted in foreign tongue. Higher difficulties will make use of more complicated phrases. But thats not all you need to be wary of...

f6ngyn,A game where you play as a 80s survivor like man who wields a chainsaw katana and hunts monsters and physcopaths,"A game where you play as a 80s survivor like man who wields a chainsaw katana and hunts monsters and physcopaths. The setting is in a large city. There is a time system where missions will be available at a certain ingame hour and you can check the time by looking at your watch. Side missions are optional but main missions are mandatory. You can create weapons by finding or buying the right items but the items you create can break after being hit a certain amount of times, the more powerful the weapon the easier it breaks. Your main weapon is a chainsaw katana which never breaks and deals decent damage. Finally the games fighting mechanics would be like Arkham knight or spiderman ps4 fighting.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions comment down below and feel free to criticize."
f6java,A game where someone has to coordinate other players,"The game I'm thinking of wouldn't be too big.

You could also have someone on the towers if you wanted. \n\nThere would have to be longer mana wait times to compensate for the lack of players. \n\nThe tower system could probably work around the same way as clash, where you have to destroy at least one first before you win."
f6ifwn,[Mobile?] Top down Left4Dead type game,"A twin-stick shooter with a Left4Dead-style mission layout (linear missions with some RNG elements for loot and enemy placement).

A Chess game variant enhanced with trading card / card collection mechanics.\n\nThis is not my own idea nor the game's title.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThe main gameplay is classic chess. Winning requires the complete annihilation of the opponent's king(s). The player can either move a chess piece or use a card. Depletion of cards in a player's deck will not lead to automatically loose a match.\n\nCards give option for more strategy. Some cards can trasform chess pieces, add specific pieces, change piece movements, forcibly remove enemy pieces, manipulate other cards, create traps on tiles and more. (Unorthodox chess pieces where scrapped)\n\nThere are also *Core Card* and *Equipment Cards* that can be set before chess matches. These cards give passive effects to the player.\n\nIt is also planned to add *topdown openworld exploration* as the idea to be multiplayer was scrapped.\n\nCurrently, the existing cards have reached more than a hundred divided into rarities: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary.\n\n**So... any existing games (tabletop/video games) that has similar mechanics that we should check?** We have already checked Knightmare Chess and Rogue Chess so don't mention them anymore.\n\n**Also.** We are in need of a volunteer pixel artist willing to do character sprites and tilesets for the top down exploration.\n\nThanks in advance!"

Wishing Well that actually works\n\nYou get the idea, the little bit of backstory is there to provide you a framework of why your character(s) would be at all these places and how to have it all make sense as part of one game. \n\nCore Mechanics:\nYou design a ‘legend’ from a blank slate by selecting a few traits, perks or powers. You spawn in to one of these settings with a hint to your objective and nothing but the shirt on your back and have to figure out how to equip yourself and find out what you’re dealing with. There’s no equipment carry over between missions but you evolve your characters abilities and are tasked with increasingly more difficult or complex scenarios.\n\nTraits would be passives that could look something like... \n\nFirearms Expert (you have reduced recoil and sway when using a firearm. Your reload speed is increased)\n\nTelltale Heart (you can always tell me if someone is lying to you in conversation.)\n\nSixth Sense (you’re basically a Geiger counter for supernatural presence) \n\nPowers would be more active things you can do to affect the world like...\n\nTelepath (you can listen to people’s thoughts when you concentrate and communicate to them non verbally)\n\nHands of Stone (one punch KO power when you want it)\n\nThird Eye (like ‘detective vision’ you can use to investigate areas or track things. Maybe glimpses of past events when you interact for added uniqueness)\n\nArgonaut (maybe like bullet time for melee combat)\n\nThis needs trimmed considerably and maybe just focusing on one half or the other on this idea would make for a good game. As I’ve thought a lot about coding this I’ve been looking less at handcrafted areas and more being able to procgen this and possibly sticking to one setting or time period otherwise the art cost of this would be insurmountable to an indie. \n\nI’m just spitballing and tired of typing on my phone now"
f62vkg,A batman VR game where you play as a main villain’s goon,Slowly watching from a first person POV as all your allies I sucked into the darkness would be terrifying.
f62clv,Real-time combat RPG with fully customizable party,"This is something I've been craving for a long time. No game (that I know of) has really done it. Or at least not exactly how I imagine it. \n\nAn RPG similar to Final Fantasy 15 where you have a party of 4 that you fight with in combat except you're able to fully customize and control each party member. Appearance, skills, weapons, everything. These characters can be switched between in combat like FF15 or controlled by other players  (Like what Final Fantasy 15 comrades tried to do).\n\nThrow in Mass Effect/ Dragon Age role-playing mechanics where you can build relationships with your teammates, do side quests with them, etc. \n\nIt'd be cool too if it was half MMO where you can find other parties walking around doing missions in the open world too. \n\nBasically I just want Final Fantasy 15 but with each party member being fully customizable."
f61x6y,“Guncup”: A battle royale where you have to craft the weapons with a n y t h i n g.,"This game Idea came from a dream I had about a game called “Guncup” where you would spawn on a map with the objective of killing all other players by any means, whether it be using a floorboard from a house, to combining and sharpening homemade tools made from anything you can tape, glue, or nail together. There could be guns too, but ammo for them would be rare and they’d make better melee weapons or scrap. Winning would earn you the “Guncup” a trophy that you could trade in for cosmetics or icons for your profile. Currently that is all the ideas I can remember from the dream and following thoughts after."
etyiqs,Card Universe (Draft 3.1) [Repost],"#Overview\nCard Universe is a video game that features a mix of 3d Platforming, roguelike, and Open-World Action RPG elements. The story is that the player is a human from the real world that discovered a magical artifact called a Binder that enables them to send their consciousness into a place called The Universe of Imagination, where humanity's thoughts and feelings create cards which can materialize into tangible objects and forces, with humanity's evil thoughts and feelings becoming dangerous things like monsters and hazards. As an Avatar, the player can gather cards and use them or store them in their Binder for later use. The main goal of the game is to gather cards, level up, survive, and do whatever they want.\n\n#Controls\nStart: Binder\n\nSelect: Menu\n\nA: Jump/Arial Action\n\nL Stick: Movement\n\nR Stick: Camera\n\nB: Interact\n\nX: Card Trigger\n\nY: Card Select\n\nL: Sneak\n\nR: Run\n\nControl Pad: Shortcut Hand\n\nL Trigger: Lock On\n\nR Trigger: Alt. Shortcut Hand\n\nL Stick Press: Card Shortcut 1\n\nR Stick Press: Card Shortcut 2\n\n#Progression\nThe primary additive factor that determines the effectiveness of most of the player's actions is their Level. All damage dealing and damage reducing/stopping cards scale off of the level in some way. Everyone starts at level 1 and more levels are gained through the accumulation of Points.\n\n##Points\nThe Avatar has two counts of points, the Lifetime Point Count (LPC) and the Fluid Point Count (FPC). The LPC is the total amount of points the player has gathered throughout their current campaign and passing thresholds in amounts cause the player to Level-Up. The FPC is the current number of points the Avatar has accumulated and can be spent by interacting with NPCs for cards and other services. Points can be accumulated by killing monsters, selling cards, or finding treasures.\n\n##Meters\nLeveling up not only increases the overall effectiveness of an Avatar's actions, but it also increases the Avatar's meters and grants Stat Points (STs). The Avatar has three meters, the Hit Meter (HM) which regulates how much damage the Avatar can take and is regenerated by healing cards, the Action Meter (AM) which regulates how long the Avatar can exert itself and is regenerated over time or instantly with certain cards but not usable until completely filled once completely drained, and the Special Meter (SM) which regulates how many cards can be set on the Hand at one time with more powerful cards having a greater SM cost.\n\n##Stats\nEvery Level-Up grants the Avatar 10 STs which can be spent in one of five stats which add 1% to their corresponding statistics. \n\nPower increases the HM and the damage done by cards. \n\nEnergy increases the AM and ads to the effectiveness of cards that block damage.\n\nWisdom ads to the SM and ads to the effectiveness of cards that reduce damage.\n\nInstinct ads to the effectiveness of cards that bestow harmful effects on foes and increases effects that strengthen the Avatar.\n\nSpirit ads to the effectiveness of cards that bestow beneficial effects on the user and decrease effects that weaken or hinder the Avatar.\n\n#Cards\nLike the name of the game suggests, the main purpose of the game is the accumulation and use of cards.\n\n##Hand\nAll cards are stored in the Hand for immediate use or in the Binder for later use. Using the Y Button brings up the hand, which is a radial menu that allows for the selection of a card with the R stick that, if it is an active use card, can be triggered by X. Alternatively, specific cards can be assigned to two shortcut selections, the primary being the control pad which can be switched to an alternate selection by the R Trigger. Shortcuts for individual cards can also be assigned to the R Stick Press and the L Stick Press.\n\n##Binder\nThe Binder has pages that store cards in a 3x3 section on both sides of the page and a limit of ten pages. Each card has a limited number of uses and once used up must be found again in the game world.\n\n##Card Types\nPower Cards: Allows the player different actions and abilities. Come in various subcategories.\n\nAbility Power Cards: Can be used instantaneously, lose uses for each successful active use. (Ex. swinging a sword, walking on a wall temporarily, launching a fireball, blocking a hit after raising a shield)\n\nTactical Power Cards: Creates an independent object that can assist the player or harm them if used improperly. Used when damaged. (Ex. bait to attract monsters, a springboard-like area, a bubble that entraps anything inside it and can be used as a platform, a bomb that first attaches to the Avatar then moves to an opponent after a successful melee attack)\n\nConditional Power Cards: Used automatically once certain conditions are met. (Example, neutralizing a killing blow, doing a burst of damage if a foe is at low health, exploding if hit by a fire attack)\n\nBoon Power Cards: Grant passive effects or bonuses to the player and can change their primary abilities/capabilities but may make the player more or less resistant to certain things. Effects can stack. Used when Avatar is damaged. (Reducing damage [Armor], hovering at a fixed height while in midair, allowing free movement while underwater)\n\nResource Cards: Cards that can be stacked. Used for a wide variety of purposes.\n\nMaterial Resource Cards: Used to craft other cards or to cause events in the game world without using Power Cards. (Wood, ore, herbs, and stone of various types.)\n\nConsumable Resource Cards: Used to restore Meters and/or grant temporary boosts to Avatar. (Food, potions, medicine)\n\nLocation Cards: Cards that are gained upon the discovery of a new location. Can be used to fast travel to said location from a different location. Possess information about the corresponding location such as available cards, monsters/NPCs in inhabitation, and miscellaneous information about the nature of the location. Can be used while in the binder and are not placed in the hand.\n\nGuardian Cards: NPCs that seek to assist the player with their own sets of stats and meters. Always deployed while in hand and using card may activate special abilities. (A horse that can be ridden, a satellite that fires a laser to locked on targets, monsters that have been captured and pacified)\n\nArtifact Cards: Cards that grant beneficial effects in or outside the binder. (Picking up two cards at once, an extra life, unlimited stamina.)\n\nCurse Cards: Cards that cannot be removed from the hand once acquired but can be destroyed at certain points of interest or by certain cards. (Halving all meters, doubling incoming damage, making cards damaging the user upon use)\n\nRitual Cards: Cards that cause widespread effects once certain conditions are fulfilled. (Summoning a special boss monster, altering the properties of a location, creating an area where NPCs gather)\n\n##Attributes\nMost cards, characters, and forces that can be interacted with have at least one attribute. If struck by a harmful force that they are resistant to, the damage will be multiplied by .5. Alternatively, if they are vulnerable to the attribute, the damage is multiplied by 1.5. They are as follows: Red&gt;Purple&gt;Blue&gt;Green&gt;Yellow&gt;Orange&gt;Red\n\nAll avatars start with neutral resistance but certain cards can endow a specific attribute. Resistance does not stack, but attributes do.\n\n##Monsters\nNot all monsters fight or can be engaged the same way. \n\nSome perch upon a high point and are able to snipe at the Avatar from a great distance, but have a narrow range of awareness and can be snuck up on when they lose sight. Some monsters can relentlessly stalk the Avatar and can only be damaged under specific circumstances. Some cannot be harmed unless attacked in a certain way, but may not specifically target the Avatar when approached.\n\nLikewise, there are a number of creative ways an Avatar can engage the opposition, such as provoking a monster into attacking its allies, using environmental gimmicks and hazards to the Avatar's advantage, or employing a creative use and combination of certain cards.\n\n##Traits\nEvery card, NPC, monster, or location possesses traits that act as specialized modifiers for interactions between each other. A few examples include:\n\nFire Elemental: Fire attacks and hazards heal instead of damage but take double damage from water attacks and hazards.\n\nLightweight: Get flung extra far by forces that can move it.\n\nEtherial: Only take damage from cards with a supernatural-type trait.\n\nDanger: Direct contact damages.\n\nRegen: Heal over time.\n\nIntense heat: Unless characters possess certain traits they take damage over time. Increases the damage of fire and heat attacks.\n\nFickle: With certain stimuli, may ally with foes or attack allies.\n\nIron: Conducts and attracts electricity, does extra damage to characters with Fairy, Undead, and Demonic traits.\n\n#Player experience\nAt the start of the campaign, the player is dropped in the middle of a random Location. If they die, they lose all their cards and points and have to start over.\n\n##Locations\nLocations are sandbox environments that can be freely traversed in any manner of way depending on the skill of the player and their current selection of cards. Every location has a list of monsters and NPCs that inhabit it, cards available to be collected, and treasures to be obtained through different methods. There are also portals hidden within each location that take the player to a different one. Locations can also contain a number of gimmicks or hazards that can make traversing it easier or harder depending on the player's skill.\n\n###POIs\nEvery location plays host to a number of Points of interest that can be interacted with for a number of purposes in a number of ways. Some POIs play host to a challenge of skill, puzzles, mini games, entrances linear dungeons/courses/challenges, or simple events/tasks that once completed rewards the player with a specific card, healing, ailment removal, long-term buff, or some other convenient service.\n\n##Crafting\nOn the flavor text of certain cards is a list of materials that an Avatar can take to a particular Point Of Interest in order to craft a copy of that card. However, all but a few materials are non-specified and any material that falls into the category of the non-specified material such as ore, wood, or leather, can be used in its creation. When used to create a card, the traits of the material are added to that card, like increased damage to certain foes, more uses, or an extra attribute.\n\n##NPCs\nNPCs can be found throughout each location individually or as groups within locations that serve as population centers. Each NPC type has various likes and dislikes. If the avatar is in good favor, they may offer access to events that assist the player, information on that location, buying or selling cards at lower/higher prices, healing, or buffs. If the Avatar is in bad favor, they may trigger events that harm or make things more difficult, give misinformation, sell or buy cards at higher/lower prices, or debuffs.\n\n##Bosses\nEach Location has at least one powerful Boss Monster that drops many rare cards and plentiful Points upon defeat. Some Boss Monsters stay at a fixed point, others may migrate throughout the Location, and others appear under certain conditions or times.\n\n##Rank\nAll cards possess a ten-star rarity system which is a representation of their spawn rate within each location and the number of points they sell for at vendors. Monsters also have a similar star system which is a representation of how difficult they are to dispatch or how much they can threaten the Avatar.\n\n##Level Calculations and Combat\nAs was stated before, the overall effectiveness of cards scales off from the Avatar's level, usually rounded up.\n\nExample 1: An attack Action card that does 125% damage being wielded by a level 20 Avatar would, before taking in the defense and resistances of the target into account, 25 damage.\n\nExample 2: A level 10 character wielding a card that does 100% damage + 80% Base Damage would do 10 damage, in addition to 8 damage that would ignore the target's defense.\n\nExample 3: A level 10 character wielding a card that does 20% + 5 damage would do 2 damage hitting 5 times for a total of 20\n\nExample 4: A level 10 avatar that deploys a blocking Action card with 120% could block an attack of up to 12 damage, but every instance of contact would count as a use and drain the AM. And if it tried to block anything more the AM would be completely drained.\n\nExample 5: An Avatar using a boon card with an armor value of 10 would be able to reduce up to 10 damage on top of all other boon cards' armor value of non-base damage. However, if it had a damage reduction trait of 20% wielded by a level 20 character could reduce base damage of up to 4.\n\nMost active-use and Action cards have a speed value that determines how many times it can be used in a second, which also indicates the delay until another active-use card is used. Plus, cards that have more beneficial effects or what could be described as overpowered also have a smaller number of uses and take up a greater portion of the SM when equipped and a greater portion of the AM when used.\n\nGranted, these are only factors that matter mostly if the Avatar directly engages the opposition. There are a number of possible strategies and tactics an avatar could employ to greatly shift the odds in their own favor, like attacking from an advantageous position or using a clever combination of cards to meet the situation.\n\nThe Binder cannot be opened while a foe is aware of the Avatar's presence.\n\n#Multiplayer\nThe game features a Player to Player room system where Avatars can utilize their own Location cards to create an interconnected game world. The room creator can select from a number of rules that can alter the primary rules of the game and govern the interactions between Avatars. Players have the option to keep a Card Box which they can transfer cards without the risk of loss. One's Point count and Level do not change upon death while in multiplayer mode and the room creator can choose to scale the levels either equally or based on certain circumstances within each mode.\n\n##Hardcore\nAvatars can attack each other to claim random cards dropped on death.\n\n##Territories\nAvatars can form teams to capture Location Cards which can serve as respawn points that allow the controllers to keep cards. Monsters can be tamed and used by teams.\n\n##Deathmatch\nLast one standing wins a random card dropped from each Avatar.\n\n##Desert Island\nAll Avatars start with nothing.\n\n##Spectator\nPlayers can watch Avatars and trade Cards or wager them on certain outcomes.\n\n#Cosmetics\nPlayers also have access to a number of cosmetic options to Express their own style, such as skins to change the appearance of a card's action, stances that change how the Avatar moves when traversing their enviornment, and of course costumes for the Avatar itself. These cosmetic cards only need to be collected once, have no limits to how many can be obtained, and always remain with the player's profile no matter what happens to the Avatar.\n\nLike my ideas, have some constructive criticism, or want to add some of your own? Please, leave a reply!\n\n#Card Examples\n\n###Magnum Buckler\n \nEffect: Blocks for 80%. If a second input is pressed while deployed, can fire up to 6 bullets per deployment that do 100% damage + 25% base.\n\nAttribute: Orange\n\nAM: 5 (3 for alternate input)\n\nSM: 6\n\nSpeed: 5 (1 for alternate input)\n\nUses: 35\n\nTraits: Metal, mechanical, shield, gun, blunt.\n\nMaterials: Metal material, leather material, gear box, rotary barrels, explosive material.\n\n###Sword Loaded Cane\nEffect: Increases speed by 1 and reduces running stamina consumption by 25%.

etycsc,ファーストラン:龍の道 (Fast Run : Ryū no michi),"It is more an idea than a real project but as I discovered this subreddit I share it with you to have your opinions on the form. (I study Japanese at university  before trying to get into game design.)\n\n**Fast Run : Ryū no michi (ファーストラン:龍の道)**\n\n**Introduction :**\n\n*Fast Run : Ryū no michi* is a racing game with some role play *components* and a story inspired by the world of Japanese animation. You control a young high school student in an *adventure* full of twists that will meet colorful and touching characters.\n\n**Narrative :**\n\nGen Kobayashi is a high school student who loves cars and racing.\n\nAfter showing his driving skills, Yuko Fukuda, a girl from his high school, offers him to participate in the Dragon Race, a team car race. Yuko's father, who runs a garage and was a champion during his youth, will serve as his mentor. Unfortunately it risks closing for bankruptcy due to a large company run by a former rival of Yuko's father and whose son is the current Dragon Race champion. There are also rumors that they are rigging and intimidating those who oppose them.\n\nThe story is developed during the races, of course, but most of it takes place when you leave the steering wheel for chat whith the characters and discover the district where Gen lives. You get to know your companions as well as your enemies while you try to save Yuko's father's garage.\n\n**Title-** Fast Run : Ryu no michi (ファーストラン:龍の道) \[Fast Run: The Dragon's Path\]\n\n**Genre-** Racing/Role-playing\n\n**Platforms-** PC/PS5/Switch\n\n**Target audience-** \~12+\n\n**Victory/Failure conditions:**\n\nThe goal is to succeed against other participants despite the special situations that could arise and spice up the races. The races, with assumed arcade gameplay, are team races focused on the sensation of speed and power.\n\n**Core gameplay :**\n\nThe game is separated into three different phases:  \n\n\- The *races* which will involve Gen and his friends and that present a great variety of environment and situations.\n\n\- The *garage* where Gen will help Yuko and her father, prepare his equipment and customize them.\n\n\- *Gen's life* which will allow you to do some side activities and to advance the story outside the races.\n\nThe main part of the game is racing where Gen and his friends will find themselves opposing other participants including ""bosses"", some crazy road champions with more back story than the usual opponents. The races obviously focus on speed but also on team coordination to be able to respond to all situations and shenanigans of the opponents.  \n\nAn important part of the game play is given to the preparation of the races and the improvement of its vehicles to get the best results. (+Maybe driver skills?) This part takes place in Yuko's father's garage where Gen can also receive advice and train.\n\nThe last part of the game corresponds to Gen's life which allows you to do some additional activities, recover a little money in addition to the races, get special equipment and advance the story between races and the relationships between the characters. (+improve some of his driver skills)\n\n**Graphical and sound atmosphere :**\n\nThe game fully assume its anime inspiration and presents a graphic style accordingly with strong characters and the predominance of a Japanese urban environment.\n\nThe sound atmosphere is very important, powerful during the races and quieter during the life phases. There are many sound effects allowing to mark the show even more.\n\n**USP :**\n\n\- *Exciting races* combining classic racing and battle elements in intense team fights.\n\n\- Discover a *complex universe* inspired by Japanese animation where you will fight to save your friend's garage.  \n\n\- *Personalization* and *skill system*s inspired by the best role-playing games."
