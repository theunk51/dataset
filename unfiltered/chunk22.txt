93yu2y,Crack-Man,"Pac-Man parody where you play as a crack head trying to gobble all the crack in the level. Rather than ghosts there are police officers who emerge from a police station trying to arrest you and the specials you pick up give give you a knife which you stab non stop with until it runs out.\n\nTo actually make more engaging game the levels would have a bit of 3 dimentionality to them, under bridges, shimmying up drainpipes, jumping off of roofs etc but still small and simple enough to keep the overall game play very similar to the original.\n\nSound and music should be 8-bit and graphically I'm thinking [Voxeltron-like](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?cat=6&amp;sub=2) with loads of juice and maybe some drugged effects."
93wand,Anyone have ideas for an action-rpg battle system?,"I'm hiring a really good programmer to make the battle system to my MMORPG.\n\nI always wanted to make a game like Secret of Mana or its sequel, ""Seiken Densetsu 3,"" ever since I was a kid. So I'm thinking of telling him to make the melee combat like the Seiken Densetsu games, especially Seiken Densetsu 3.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or suggestions for a action RPG system?  I might wanna suggest them to the battle system programmer on our game he's working on."
93sxcq,Size DOES matter,"I wanted to throw out a quick, caring and a little harsh PSA to all you new idea guys on this subreddit which has been already relevant for several posts in the last 24 hours:\n\n\*\*\*A BIGGER game is NOT a game idea on its own!\*\*\*\n\nSo many people come on here with posts about how 'imagine PUBG but 10x bigger' or imagine 'imagine Fortnight but with 1000 players' or 'imagine Rust but with the map the size of Skyrim.' This taking an existing game and just scaling it up by ten times is neither a working game idea nor is it a helpful idea. Also do not get defensive when this is pointed out to you and try and protect yourself with excuses such as 'I'm putting it out there for inspiration.' Trust me when I say that every, even half reasonable, game dev out there has these ideas.\n\n""So why don't these games exist then if everyone already knows them?""\n\nBecause the scale of what your suggesting is often just not possible with present hardware. The reason why BR games are generally limited to 100 players is because even at that point the stability of the server for every player is not great, in fact this is probably why there is only one drop ship in any BR game so that most players get clumped together and that 100 initial number quickly drops to a more manageable 50-70. If players were able to respawn and spread out across the map the connection quality of these games would be absolute trash.\n\nThis of course not saying that games cannot be made bigger. Three player chess variants are a simple but excellent example of a traditional format that can be completely turned on its head with that increase in players.\n\nSo what should you do with your future ideas if the selling point is 'it's like Y but X times bigger'? Try to keep the following in mind:\n\n1) Do I think the average gamers computer / internet etc can handle it reasonably well? (Remember that most of your potential player base do not have a high end custom gaming rig).\n\n2) Is there a reason why the increased player base / game size etc will change the way the mechanics and gameplay operate? (BR games being an excellent example of 'yes there are 100 players in the game' but in the average match you'll probably only encounter between 1-10 of them so would it actually make any difference to you the player if there 10000 players? Because unless you're the God of this game the end result will be you will probably kill 1-3 of them then die and start a new match, exactly the same gameplay you would get with PUBG or Fortnight).\n\nThank you all for reading."

93py24,A dream I had of an interesting World sandbox,"Let me preface this with the fact I've never built a game before, but I had a dream. I imagined an open sandbox world, an actual whole planet. I imagine the game starting out as survival game, interacting with the environment, resources, building and creating. I'd want to push the boundaries of variety and crafting, but there would be a steep difficulty curve in the type of resource and complication of building. One character couldn't possible create too much on their own. This would be the basis of the game. \n\nNow there are lots of games with a basis like this, Ark, Rust, etc, but I wanted this to be on a grander scale. A persistent world, where every spot on the planet is available to travel to. Player interaction would be scarce at first, then as more players build and farmed and created interaction would become more common. Friends could play together and build more teaming up than alone. \n\nI would want death to be a permanent severe thing. Your character learns and builds individual skill as he develops. When your character dies your character loses those skills. As for respawning, I think it is important for players to spawn near groups of other players, for teams I would want it to be affected by the locality of other teammates. That way as the game progresses over time and you start the game anew, your character would spawn for the first time near a town/village/group of people that have already claimed a land and begun building. \n\nAs far as NPC's, I want a variety of different animals, creatures and some rare instance of monsters. AI is also a difficult thing, but again this is also just a vision. Creatures and Monsters would have their own territories, interactions with other NPC's, and of course suffer hunger the way players would, and varying difficulties of domesticity. \n\nBeyond this, and I know it's vague, the players would have little interference with the ""server world"". I wonder if towns and cities with complete strangers would develop. Trading between characters far and wide for different resources. Would they get so far as to create countries? How far could their crafting develop, or would the world just become a desolate land of raiders and war. Working together for resources and building would be much more profitable in the long run but players focusing on strength and stealing from other characters for simple resources could be easier and more enjoyable... until they lose their character. \n\nI understand this is a broad and unrealistic dream of a game, but I feel like its one people could get addicted to, and seeing it develop based on how the players build up the world would be interesting as hell. \n\nThank you for reading, I did this more so to get this idea out there that I had been thinking of for a while now. I appreciate your time."
93ozlz,First person shooting/war game,"Both team’s base is at the opposite of the map.The map is huge and it is divided into several village and military base for both team to capture.\n\nYou and your friend can work in squard up to five people, and when you fully capture a location, it start spawning AI to help you defend it, and your squard can choose to attack another location or to help your AI ally to defend against other player.\n\nUnlike Battlefield which is supposed to be a war game ,it will not let you run around maintaining the same location again and again in a rather large map. Instead it makes you feel at war for constantly pushing and occupy for your team/country.\n\nYou and you team can even pull off some strategy like Blitzkrieg in WW2, or maybe hamburger your enemy with a sick Air Force landing .\n\nOf course tanks, airplanes and ships should be added in the game.\n\nSince there are many FPS game that is based on WW1 or WW2 lately , I think this game should go for a modern style like BF4 or Rainbow six siege.\n\nAnd in terms of the gameplay , I think the gun recoil and overall feeling in PUBG is great , and the attachment too.\n\nIn conclusion, this game should truly be a war game , the duration of one game will probably be very long , so I think the main problem of this concept is the playerbase ,if there isn’t enough player the game will quickly turn in to AI vs AI, but if it has enough player like PUBG which ques in with 100 players in like 2sec, it will work really well and you and your friends can leave during the match cause there will always be people queuing up .\n\nAnd the sever is an issue too, maybe quantum computer will fix it 🤔🤔\n"
93np7f,How can you make soccer picks and predictions?,"Why can’t I make [**soccer picks and predictions**](http://www.soccerpicks.online/) instead of buying tips? If this question comes to your mind then you will certainly find this blog useful. Almost every soccer enthusiast wants to break betting odds on his own and there is nothing wrong in trying to break the odds.\n\n**You can break the odds if you have the following things**\n\n·  Time is the biggest factor in [soccer betting](http://www.macaoinsiders.com/). Information about football matches should reach to you at earliest. You need time to sit down and study the matches to find winners of the matches. Also, it can be said that making **soccer picks and predictions** is a time-consuming job.\n\n·  Data is the second biggest factor in betting. You can make an opinion on the present performance of a football team only after studying its past record. When you have relevant data of soccer teams, you can compare the performance of contesting teams and easily find the winner. Data collection might not be a big job but data saving is.\n\n·  Third important factor in betting is influencers. A football team performs at its best only under favorable conditions like comfortable weather and familiarity with the ground. It is called home ground situation. Also, you will find that some teams play good in specific tournaments. You need to notice these influencers while studying individual data of football teams.\n\n·  Performance of individual players also matters most. A team consists of 11 players and all the players have to play in tandem in order to make a team. Teams keep changing their players according to the performance of players. You have to take note of the changing of players and find reasons for the change. It will help in calculating the winning probability of teams.\n\n·  Another important factor that can influence the performance of a team is injuries of players. An injured player has to be substituted and the substitution might not be as aggressive as the injured player is. The injuries and replacement due to injuries should be in your mind as substitution of players can affect the overall performance of a team.\n\n·  You have to keep data of every team to be able to break betting odds as and when required. Looking for data at the last moment won’t help. In speed betting, where betting is done on the current matches, you won’t get enough time to collect data. In speed betting you will have to rely on the data you have.\n\n·  Media reports can help in making an opinion on a football team in a great way. None of the newspaper reports, articles and interviews that are in anyway related to football should be missed. These reports will tell how a football team is doing. You can use this information for making [**soccer picks andpredictions**](http://www.bettingpredictions.cn/).\n\n·  Do you believe in match-fixing? If yes then you can never make the [**correct soccerpicks and predictions**](http://www.footballtipsters.cn/). The thought of fixed-matches will haunt your mind and prevent you from thinking in the right direction. You should keep the negative thoughts out of your mind.  "

93jj6j,MOBA Idea,"So I had this idea that would play in a MOBA style with the lanes towers etc. but instead of having a static champion pool you create a character and can select your abilities from a large pool, obviously certain abilities would not be able to work with others and that sort of thing. The map would be fairly small and games should last about 15-25 minutes. Teams of 5 with a Top lane, Jungle, Middle, and Bottom lane."
93i93o,"A large, survival, battle royale type game, on a HUGE map, up to 1000+ players at a time and games lasting months.","Okay, this is a big one. You are probably not going to be able to create a game like this by yourself.\n\nI haven't thought of a title, cause I'm bad at naming stuff. But here is the general idea of the game:\n\n***THE GAMEPLAY***\n\nIt starts off with a buttload (~1000) of players whos put into small capsules, and shot into the air. When the capsules reach a certain altitude, the players gain control of the capsule and control their descent onto the map (which is fucking HUGE btw, at least Skyrim sized). \n\nWhen the player lands at their desired spot, the capsule pushes the player out and flies away, leaving the player absolutely naked and alone.\n\nSo the player now needs to gather resources, and acquire some weapons. They can choose to build a base, well knowing that a ""zone"" will soon start to move, and they could be forced to leave the base. They can also choose to travel, looking for other players to kill and food to eat, not ""wasting"" time on a base that will eventually be useless.\n\nThe ""zone"" will move very slowly, way slower that a person can even crawl. This means that it would take weeks (IRL) for the ""zone"" to close all the way in. This is also a huge part of the game, since at some point you will need to leave the game to go about you actual life. This will make your player (in game) ""fall asleep"" (like in Rust). And when other players come across a sleeping player, they can choose to execute them, or simple take the loot of them (again, like in rust).\n\nWhen a person dies, they are presented with a black screen with small white text on it saying ""You died :("" or something like that. They will then be able to join a new game, or spectate the game they were in. They will be able to jump through the timeline just like watching a livestream on YouTube. This will allow for players who died offline, to see how they were killed. Or for players killed in PvP/PvE, they can see that they were killed fair &amp; square, and the other player was in fact legit (LOL).\n\nPlayers also won't have maps, and the zone will ""focus in"" on a random part of the map. This will make gameplay much more fun, as you won't really know where you are, and can only go by direction (maybe a compass can be found?), and you won't have any clue on how far you are from the ""zone"", until it is close enough to be visible.\n\nThe ""zone"" won't have ""pauses"" like in PUBG, it will just keep on getting smaller, until the last player is standing. And also I have no idea what the ""zone"" should be? Rising water levels maybe? Or just a thick fog full of dangers? No matter what, it shouldn't be like PUBG or Fortnite, cause their ""zones"" are way too un-emersive. I should like something that feels scary and real.\n\nWhen a player wins, they are rewarded with better stats, an XP boost, and maybe a gift? (Like in CS:GO, where you sometimes recieve crates with skins)\n\nThe players will also have levels and stats. Better stats will make for harder opponents (like the ranks in CS:GO). And XP can be used to up your levels, allowing for faster crafting, slightly more accuracy, luck (regarding loot &amp; gathering) and a little more inventory space.\n\n***THE MAP***\n\nThe map will be very, very, very large for a multiplayer. Since there will be so many players (~1000), and player encounters should be kinda rare. So at least the size of the Skyrim map (however many square kilometres that is). And maybe it should be randomly generated? That's kinda up to the game Devs tbh, since both have their pros &amp; cons.\n\n***ANINALS, ENEMIES AND PVE***\n\nI was thinking that having a 80/20 mix of normal animals (both hostile and non-hostile) and super creepy scary enemies would be interesting. Since it will add to the emersion with familiar animals, but also add to the scary factor with super creepy scary monsters.\n\nNow, I REALLY admire the scary mutant-cannibals from The Forest. They are seriously creepy, and really they're the main reason I bought the game. So the scary spooky monsters should definitely be something of that genre. You know, something human-looking, but it's definitely NOT a human. Maybe they should drop seriously good loot too? So there would be a reason to put everything at risk to fight them?\n\nThe animals should just be normal animals from the regular everyday earth. Like crocodiles, bears, wolves, birds, snakes, deer and pigs/boars? The main reason for these would simply be food, and a slight emersion/PvE factor.\n\nWhen fighting animals, there should be two kinds of fights. Basically every animal has a fight/flee option when engaged, and if the animal chooses to fight, it will try to kill you to the best of its abilities, and if it chooses to flee, it will run away and hide. The animal should also consider changing from fight to flee or reverse mid fight. Maybe it realised it couldn't flee/fight?\n\nThis of course doesn't apply for the monsters, they're wild savage hunters who will fight you to their last breath no matter what. I also think it would be cool if they stalked players/animals too. Like, insanely advanced AI, that would hide &amp; watch players for minutes before striking, and if they realised they had been spotted they would instantly attack. Also pack hunting would be awesome, kind of like lions do.\n\n***LOOT***\n\nThe map should moslty be nature, generally no man-made stuff. But maybe a few forest huts/houses, or very small villages? In these places there should be possibility for loot that cannot be crafted. Like weapons and advanced weapon attachments, medical supplies and very nutritious food like canned beans and spaghetti (these won't spoil and will therefore be optimal food sources when going scavanging or otherwise traveling).\n\nThere should also be supply drops two times every day (the in-game day would last about 4 hours). And these supply drops would also contain non-craftable items.\n\nBoth of these should contain high-valued loot, since risking everything you have will be required to obtain it. And there is no point in risking it all for a mediocre gun.\n\nAlso no loot respawns. When a village is looted, the best loot will be gone and what's left is for the next player. Loot respawns would make villages/houses exploitable, since a player could just wall it off and harvest the loot like some kind of loot farm.\n\n***FOOD &amp; CRAFTING***\n\nYou should be able to grow your own food, but it shouldn't get to the point where the player can live off of self-made food (The player should always be forced to go scavenging for food once in a while). This could be done by making the food grow very slowly, so the player will only be able to harvest it occasionally.\n\nCrafting should actually be kind of like in Minecraft. You have some sort of crafting station, where the player can tinker with components and ressources. Of course recipies for certain items should be provided in a crafting manual/menu. And the player should recieve hints of what they are able to craft, kind of like in The Forest, where the name of certain craftables show up in the crafting menu, when you but certain components together. If that makes any sense.\n\n***BASE BUILDING***\n\nThe Forest has a really unuiqe base building mechanic, and I really like it. It isn't ""block based"" like in Rust, Minecraft or Fortnite. But the player can build VERY unuiqe bases, and REALLY use the environment around them.\n\nThis game would have a similar base building mechanic.\n\n***FINAL WORDS***\n\nAs you can probably tell. This idea is huge, and I haven't thought it completely through. I got the idea a couple of days ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. I searched for a subreddit like this one, so i could share it.\n\nI do know how to make games, I've tried to make my ideas into reality many times before. But my ideas are usually huge, and impossible for me to make by myself. So I'm putting this one out there, and if there are any indie game devs out there who has a small team whos up to the task, i would love for you to be inspired by my idea.\n\nI would also love to help, I know some c++, and I have some limited experience in both unity and unreal engine. But I doubt I would of much help.\n\nAnyways, if you decide to make anything from my idea, definitely contact me and let me in on the process. I don't need to be part of the team or anything, I would simply just love to watch as you worked :) If interested, send me a PM.\n\nI don't NEED credit. But I would like to be mentioned in the credits or something if possible."

93d3qj,"I don't really know, but I had an idea when I was doing my homework.","Look, I know it sounds weird but it just came up to my mind so don't blame me (like *you should do your homework first not this* or *be more responsible of your school work kid,* blah blah blah(. I'm not saying that any of you would say that but in case someone would say it, this is to you)). \n\nI was researching about Challenger Deep and I was also playing this game called Subnautica in the meantime, so I was inspired by it and I went and wrote these ideas down. Here are some ideas I have.\n\n# Main Ideas\n\n* Plot\n   * The player (Chris/Christina Jackson is their name) explores the Challenger deep to find out what there are which is undiscovered, but his submarine gets attacked by something mysterious and crashes into a cave. He survives the crash, and has plenty of oxygen, but has to rebuild his sub with remaining tools and materials to survive. It's basically Subnautica but located in Earth and also in Challenger Deep.\n* Place: Challenger Deep\n* Time: 3006\n* Character age: 24\n\nSo, what do you think of it? I don't know, but honestly if this actually turns into a game, I would play it really fun (because I liked Subnautica). \n\nI would update more and more ideas, and if I turn professional enough I would make it myself (though it would take 1 million years)."
93c36u,[Update] Thief Creed - mingle with npcs and steal a magical dairy,"So an update from [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/8xec6w/thiefs_creed_multiplayer_do_i_make_or_forget_this/).. I decided to go ahead and have the idea made. Sharing here to get more feedback if anyone's interested.\n\n**Summary**\n\nEstablished so far (but subject to change if there's a better idea):\n\n- it's gonna be a free for all multiplayer thief game \n- (think assassin's creed brotherhood mp but you need to steal something)\n- npcs will slowly fill up the map\n- join the game and pretend to be an npc\n- find clues in the map that will tell you where the diary is hidden\n- steal it before someone else does or kills you\n- weapons will also be scattered randomly on the map\n- using weapons in plain sight gains you notoriety like gta and cops will be on you\n- you get caught or die you're out for the rest of the game\n\n**Progress**\n\nSo far I've gotten the npcs implemented:\n\n- [They'll select random stuff in the map and interact with them.](https://i.imgur.com/qF9q11u.gif)\n\n- [They can pass through doors and interact with one another if need be.](https://i.imgur.com/3451fCy.gif)\n\n- [I'm trying to have them behave like how a player would to make them stand out less.. keyword: trying](https://i.imgur.com/OQwjUIw.gif)\n\n**Problems to Solve**\n\n- **Fun Factor** - is 'pretending to be an NPC' fun for you? I know Spy Party exists, I'm thinking people will play this from a 3rd person pov though. So it's trickier since you can't see the entire surroundings behind you.\n\n- **Weapons** - What kind of weapon mechanics would be interesting here? I'm thinking of a grappling hook so you can pull off some Entrapment kinda moves. Scale walls or get to vantage points etc. Pull people towards you? Maybe a remote explosive that you can plant on someone and let it blow up later. Mind you, the game isn't geared towards action so I'm trying to steer away from weapons that encourage maniacal behavior but reward smart/devious usage instead. What do you guys think?\n\n- **Tools** - What kind of tools would be good in a scenario like this? Does it make sense to have lock picks? Or smoke bombs? Previously I mentioned about having a wardrobe where you could change clothes so people wouldn't recognize your character if they spotted you. Maybe have a remote eyeball you can place and refer to watch over parts of the map? Any suggestions?\n\n- **Gameplay** - Would it be boring to keep replaying the same - search for the clues before you can find the hidden treasure sort of gameplay? How many times would you play it before you got fed up? Would different maps solve this?"

93bvjz,A good battle royale game similar to the Fate anime series.,"I've had this idea since i was like in 6th grade (I'm 19 now) and it just seems like the best game i could come up with. I understand it'll be similar to a lot of other games but bare with me. \nImagine every type of warrior throughout history fighting in a large map. The warriors can be Ninjas, Samurai, Archers, Vikings, Roman Centurions, WW2 soldiers, Pirates, Aztecs, and the list could go on. It doesn't have to be historically accurate as I'm all for mages being implemented. What sets this apart from other battle royales is the ""classes"" and their abilities. Imagine yourself as an archer scanning the city from atop a skyscraper when a ninja materializes from the shadows and back stabs you. I'm thinking each ""class"" would have their own ""Ultimate"" that would play a bit on their theme. The pirate summons a ghost ship to sail through the air and the Centurion brings forth his legion to defend himself. The maps would be so varied and different that citys forests could change the outcome of who wins. Using your surroundings would be key. \nThe best part would be looking for your ""Great Weapons"". These are the weapons that make your ""class"" special. The knight's holy sword would be in a museum while the Archer's bow would be in the forest where he buried it long ago. There's so much to toy around with and I'm just hoping someone else can visualize it as well as i can"
9396rk,An oddball game about being a socially awkward hitchhiker who keeps getting kicked out as soon as the conversation goes south.,"The gameplay is about dialogue, but instead of NPCs having to do most of the talking... **YOU have to do most of the talking.**\n\nThe idea/theme is that conversation is actually quite intimidating for certain people, so this game would try to replicate that feeling for the player. To do this, dialog would be handled unconventionally:\n\nDuring conversation, a soup of thoughts, pictures and words would float all over the screen. The player is tasked with selecting, ordering and pulling some of them down into a text box to make coherent speech. But the longer you take, the more *intrusive* words and thoughts keep crowding the screen. And of course there's also awkward silence the whole time you're doing this. Sometimes your character will just blurt out a word you put into the textbox before you finish, or worse... he'll just blurt out a word you shuffled around and now you have to work off of that started sentence.\n\nThe more awkward or senseless the conversation turns, the more irrelevant and intrusive the thoughts that show up to choose from. Until eventually the driver is too creeped out by you and drops you on the side of the road. Now you have to hitch another ride and see how far they'll take you.\n\n*Where* the player is going isn't clearly revealed until you arrive when you beat the game. Part of the fun would be discovering the main character's backstory."

938epl,"A roguelite inspired by the Gamma World TTRPG, Adventure Time!, and the original Legend of Zelda","So imagine this:\n\nYou have a world laid out like the OG Legend of Zelda – an overworld + multiple dungeons. It's designed something like a top-down Metroidvania in that it's very nonlinear and will likely involve quite a bit of backtracking to use items acquired in dungeon B to delve further down into dungeon A, when you needed an item from dungeon A to access dungeon B in the first place. World layout is procedurally generated for replayability.\n\nLore-wise, it's a post-post-apocalyptic world where a lot of fantasy tropes are in effect but you can find relics of the technological age around, which are treated as magical items.\n\nEveryone's basically some type off mutant and/or robot; players basically get two random origins on starting a run, which determines appearance and base moveset. For instance, Vampire Bug, Alien Robot, Fungal Zombie, etc. The second origin (noun) sets base appearance while the first (adjective) modifies the sprite slightly.\n\nGameplay is very similar to, again, old-school Zelda, specifically the 16-bit games like A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap, and Four Swords."
937uqz,GTA + The Sims + Real life.,"Has anyone ever wanted just a legit... life... or crime... simulator out of the GTA games? San Andreas was the closest R\* will ever get to this ideal I fear, where the open-world has a bit of real depth to it and isn't just a fancy menu system to do action missions. I.e. you could rob-houses, turf-wars, get fat by eating too much, run businesses, etc. Systems that add a lot of depth to the static map.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed that R\* keeps making primarily action oriented games, and not actual life or crime simulations. I mean good for them I guess it's what brings in the bucks, but I'm pretty bored of it and I'm sure there are others.\n\nTo the naysayers that say ""Realism is not fun bro"", you are wrong, it's the implementation that determines what is fun, not the context... and they've been implementing the same features for the past 15 years.\n\nIf you want to help me take a shot in the dark at bringing this to life, [gimme a dollar](https://www.patreon.com/2050_). Honestly the patreon is going to make 0 money and will likely never cover the budget, it just provides a bit of motivation to work while my coffers are dry, but am expecting a lot of self-funding eventually if my fortunes turn around."
934lhp,Kind of a modern take on a monster collection game?,"Don't ask me why but the new Digimon trailer made me remember that Monster Rancher was a thing I used to play forever ago, and finding out what monster I could get with random disks in my house was always keeping younger me busy.\n\nSince disks are more and more becoming a thing of the past a monster collection game similar to that general concept of finding, breeding, battling monsters could be amazing if the route to get them or at least a route to get them was to scan QR codes or even barcodes on things. Scan a cool book, heres a cool monster, scan your cereal box, heres a monster. Keep it like the old school ways where you could only have 1 active and a few in storage so people can't just be scanning all day  or put a time limit on it so they can only scan a few times a day. Make it more of a single player thing like they were instead of everything being so PVP all of the time. "
931w78,My Reality,"So i have this idea for a game that I’m very passionate about. It’s about a father who is trying to find son. You play as the father seeing everything through his eyes. I want this game to be psychological and really mess with your head. As you play the game you would get little snapshots of what’s actual happening to show that not everything is as it seems. At the end of the game a pivotal moment would happen where you kill your son without knowing. The police kick the door down and suddenly everything switches to reality. I want this to really mess with the players head and have it be a big wtf moment. If any one has any advice, ideas, or criticism I would be glad to read them because i want this to be a really great game. "

92zlr4,Ideas about 2 potential games... WARNING: LONG POST,"As the title says, I've recently had some thoughts regarding potential games. And no, I am no programmer nor a game dev myself, so I have no clue as to how a game is developed, be it the coding or modelling etc. Fair warning: this is really ambitious in hindsight, and it might be impossible to make due to probable hardware limitations in today's gaming world.\n\nAnyway, my ideas is something like this:\n\n1 (mostly MP based):\n- Think about Heroes &amp; Generals' RTS-FPS hybrid gameplay. Specifically the War Map and how that system works. ""Generals"" deploy troops on a world map, ranging from standard infantry to different vehicle units like tank squads or air support units. The units themselves consisting of real players fight in battles, in order to conquer or defend them from enemies.\n\n- Now, combine this with Battlefield's graphics and destructible environment via the Frostbite Engine. \n\n- Soldiers who rank up high enough, can eventually become commanding officers and deploy troops/divisions on the world map. \n\n- The war ends when one side holds a certain amount of control points (cities/towns). \n\n- Multiple factions who battle for supremacy. But to keep some balance, the factions are balanced out automatically as players pick their factions. H&amp;G always had more people joining either Germany or Soviet Union, which would only give the Allied players a huge disadvantage.\n\n- Skirmishes are available as a more fast paced and ""arcade"" type (TDM, Free-for-all, Domination etc.)\n\n\n2 (mostly for SP Campaign lovers like myself, but with some MP aspects):\n- Think about Mount &amp; Blade's army building mechanics. Add in some modern warfare and squad tactics like Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare.\n\n- Army and base management similar to MGSV:TPP's iDroid menus, where you assign recruited soldiers to different units. Plus the development of newer weapons. \n\n- Possibility for expanding into newer territory. Like in MGSV you send squads of soldiers out to complete missions and gain resources, only here you could conquer new territory and setup new bases and recruit even higher amounts of troops. \n\n- Yet again like in MGSV you can choose to do missions on your own, as you ""the protagonist"" are more powerful and skilled unlike most AI controlled NPCs. Open Worlds like MGSV's Afghanistan and Africa where you can recruit new soldiers, gather resources, complete side missions or capture outposts (or all of the above at the same time)\n--&gt; Extraction is handled via helicopters. If you bring soldiers with you, you'll need more helicopters depending on how many are with you at the time of extraction.\n--&gt; POWs can be rescued/recruited and equipped with weapons to aid you in your missions, or sent back home by choppers.\n\n- Camouflage to blend into the environments OR take disguises from enemies so long as the uniforms aren't soaked in blood.\n\n- (Optional, would be more of a challenge) Your army needs equipment. And you can't build a good army if your men (or women) don't have anything to defend themselves with. Therefore, you need to be able to produce the weapons and equipment by either:\n--&gt; stealing/looting weapons from defeated foes (early game)\n--&gt; gathering resources to build facilities in order to make more weapons (mid-late game)\n++&gt; Tanks and armored vehicles are either produced, captured or stolen from enemy bases.\n\n- Weapon customization where you can edit different parts of weapons (barrel, sights, stock, trigger, receiver etc.) and camo.\n\n- Players can choose to make their base(s) show up in other players games, allowing them to be raided and resources deducted. Raided bases gets a timed protection to avoid the same bases getting raided over and over again in a short amount of time.\n\n\nAnyway, these are my ideas. If something seems too OP or too unbalanced, feel free to make suggestions. If any game devs (or even a studio) out there are interested in trying out my idea, I'll be really honored. \n\nAs stated before. I have no experience in game development, nor in coding or programming, so I don't know how this could be done, if even possible.\n\nThese are merely ideas. Inspiration for the ideas have come from several games that I love, which are mentioned, but I'm leaving a list here:\n- Mount &amp; Blade\n- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\n- Heroes &amp; Generals\n- Freeman: Guerilla Warfare\n- Battlefield series\n- Call of Duty series\n- Hitman series\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this :D"
92wark,Crossover Fighting Game,"Had this idea for a while, a crossover fighter (smash,mvc etc.), where the internet votes for the characters. They could be from literally anything be it TV, games, movies, memes , whatever. I know it’d never happen due to licensing issues but I’d play the shit out of it if it were real. "
92ts4a,"Western Horror Game: First Person, Open World","Inspired by The Long Dark and Witch Hunt: An open map with wide desert planes and a number of interesting and spooky locales.\n\nThe game would start off the player with a bank robbery. Basic tutorial for basic movement, jumping, firing and interacting with different objects (notes, doors, items), inventory system. There would be a chase sequence after you and your partners pick up the loot. The bank robbers manage to lose the law when they enter 'cursed lands' that the locals are familiar enough with to stay away from.\n\nThat night there's some drinking and one of the guys might be from the area and tells the stories people would say about this place. Everyone laughs it off and eventually turns in. Our player character is awoken by the sounds of screams and gunshots. By the time her gets out of his tent several of the guys have ran from camp into the desert, one of the men is brutally eviscerated and the only witness is too shocked to say anything.\n\nFrom there the player is only given a few hints about the monster and goes off into the night to learn more. The camp they set up is near a cabin (placed in a way that would be very difficult to miss) and the player learned about save games and the general plot. Cabin was owned by someone who had an interest in local legend and gives the player a goal: Kill the monster and find his friends.\n\nFrom here the world really opens up and the player is allowed to just explore. Some locations I thought were especially fitting:\n\n* Ghost town that moves the moment you walk out of it and turn your back\n\n * Might cause a dust storm visual effect after a certain radius to hide the disappearance if player decides to walk backwards).\n * Ghost Town can spawn at certain locations.\n\n* Systems of mines (short cut through the center of the map)\n\n * Mostly nothing, but lots of ambient noise and implication, such as far-off sounds that sound vaguely like voices behind rocks and whispers from behind.\n\n * Might have a secret or one of the hints to the ritual in one of the branching paths of the mines.\n\n* Abandoned Native dwellings in the cliff face (similar to Cliff Palace)\n\n* Train tracks that lead nowhere\n\n * Goes out into the desert. If players tries to follow it, it just loops around to the other end of the tracks (another potential short cut), or will go on seemingly forever (treadmill hall)\n\n * Every 5-10 minutes a ghost train can be heard. May or may not be a real ghost train that can be a hazard.\n\n * Perhap the ghost train can be stopped and boarded for something necessary for the ritual?\n\n* An old cemetery that seems too well kept to exist in the desert\n\n * Mostly atmospheric. Maybe the family crypt of an important local family (who would be referenced else where like ruins of an old town) would contain a piece of the ritual.\n\n * Some graves might have those bells that went down to the coffin for people who were afraid that they'd be buried alive. Perhaps one rings as the player passes it. Just a small spooky.\n\n* An old hanging tree with an empty noose\n\n * Mostly atmospheric with the sound of creaking from the swinging noose and perhaps whispers about not wanting to die or the player's guilt.\n\n * Might spawn a monster if one lingers too long, staring at the noose.\n\n* Ruins of an old town\n\n * May have a similar layout to the ghost town or might just be another settlement that was abandoned.\n \n * Might have a relevant item or hit to the ritual.\n\n * Might have many monsters lingering about. Perhaps unique type that begin to spawn after discovering the ruins.\n\n* More ideas eventually.\n\nThe only way to kill the monster (a Skinwalker) is to perform some ritual you have to learn about and discover all the pieces of the ritual. It can be temporarily scared off with a well-placed shot, but it won't really hurt it. The Skinwalker can impersonate humans perfectly, and will change its appearance and voice to sound like one of your comrades. It only reveals its true form after being found out (getting shot while disguised). Perhaps vague information or key details learned from the heist, the escape and the camp scene have to be recalled to figure out when it's really one of your friends and when it's the beast.\n\nBasically three endings:\n\n1. Good ending: everyone escapes the cursed land and you end up in jail and reforming\n\n2. Bad ending: you killed one of your friends by mistake and when you kill the beast and return to society, they hang you\n\n3. An ending: ritual is complete, monster is slain, but your character doesn't manage to get out of the cursed land before dying due to harshness of the desert. Ending that's triggered effectively by speed runs, when one doesn't visit the place that shows off the ritual and just does it because they've beaten the game already. Just some Easter Egg ending, could be sillier like Silent Hill's UFO ending, but doesn't really matter.\n\nEnemy types:\n\n* The Skinwalker. The big baddie\n\n* Zombies. Basic bullet fodder that can get a bit overwhelming in certain circumstances\n\n* Lighteaters. Little child-like spirits that like to dwell in dark places and slurp up oil from the player's lamp.\n\n* Native Ancestors. Protective spirits of the long-gone native people. Will appear randomly and may shoot 1 or 2 arrows at the player. Will make a distinct noise when spawning and have an obvious glow so it's not a complete surprise\n\n* Jackalopes. Not really an enemy, but they will run away from the player and after a certain distance turn into some nice item (health, oil, bullets, etc.)\n\n* Crawlers. From caves, old buildings and mines crawlers are like giant spiders, but oddly human-looking with human-like hands at the end of pink arms and loose similarities in other human features. Deadly and take some additional shots, but fairly rare.\n\n* Drowners. Near any ponds or rivers Drowners can spawn and grab or spit projectile at the player. Would appear to be a woman in white robes who comes out of the water with the scream. Cannot chase beyond the water.\n\n* Others will come about, I'm sure."
9614yv,A stealth/infiltration game about a protagonist who talks his way into enemy territory.,"This game idea is sort of like a standard stealth-action game except without combat. The vigilante hero sneaks into criminal organizations, bases and social events, in order to gather evidence that will bring the criminals to justice.\n\nLike most stealth games, there's a lot of sneaking and hiding. Like very few stealth games, there's disguises and false identities. And like almost no stealth games, you have to talk your way out of trouble.\n\n### It's basically ""Act Like You Belong: The Game""\n\nIt bothers me how in most stealth games, enemies don't react to footsteps and sounds *unless they're **your** footsteps/sounds*. In this game, enemies aren't quick to go guns blazing. Enemies are reasonable and will usually walk up to confront you instead.\n\nIn fact, *sometimes you'll want to walk up and talk to them first so that you appear less suspicious.*\n\n### How it Works\n\nOther than traditional stealth elements, the game is chock full of dialogue with enemy NPCs. You get a list of descriptive dialog options that you can use to lie to guards/enemies. As you explore the enemy area and gather evidence, the character will learn key information that will expand the dialog options.\n\nFor example, if you explored the guard locker room and come across some information there, then when a guard confronts you, you might get an additional dialog option: ""I'm just filling in for Tony. You didn't hear? Apparently Mandy went into labor a few hours ago.""\n\nHowever, if you didn't realize the guard you were speaking to *was* Tony himself, you might be getting yourself into deeper trouble by using that line. ""*I'm* Tony!"" he says. It's not game over, though. You keep getting options to continue lying. ""*You're* Tony? Holy shit, guy, go call your wife right now!\n\nThe game gives you so many chances to save yourself, so long as you gathered the necessary information.\n\n**Intel is your most valuable commodity.** Before a mission, the player has help from an information broker who gives you a mission dossier like in 007 Goldeneye. Remembering what it said—along with what you uncover during the mission—is key to selecting the best lies to fool enemies and guards.\n\nOnce you've completed the evidence gathering objectives, you have to escape to complete the mission."

95wpoe,Mortar Ninjas,"**Basis for inspiration**\n\n[Scorched Earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game\))\n\n**Concept**\n\nTwo players duel. The characters are very nimble and can run, jump and climb. Their only weapon is a mortar. Once they put the mortar down, they have to commit to a shot and can't move until the mortar is fired.\n\nWhen in mortar firing state, the movement keys are used to control the angle and range of the shot. The goal is to hit the opponent either directly, with splash damage from the explosion or by making him fall out of bounds.\n\nTerrain can be destroyed like in Scorched Earth or the Worms game, meaning just cutting holes from the terrain. As the battle rages on, less and less surface is available to stand on. This makes everything more difficult: harder to aim because fewer ground, and harder to move for the same reason. The players are encouraged to make riskier plays as time goes on.\n\n**Extra features**\n\nSome physics could be applied to the terrain to make it react to explosions. Not strictly necessary, but could make it look more interesting.\n\nPowerups/special abilities. Supply drops could be parachuted in and players would need to either touch them or hit them woth a mortar shell. Quick ideas: multiple shells, higher jump/faster movement, temporary shield."
95w9z3,Day of the Dead MMO,"If you have never seen Day of the Dead first I would highly suggest it. \n\nSetting would be inside and around a large american mall complex and with elements of 7DTD and TWD. This game would loosely follow the premise of the movie Day of the Dead, in which survivors find themselves trapped in a mall the days following the zombie apocalypse. After an initial tutorial introducing game mechanics such as movement, looting, stealth, combat and health maintenance, players end up in the mall. Leveling up grants greater access to areas in the complex as you gather supplies and skills necessary to  make an escape to a potential safe zone. \n\nEnemies would be randomized hybrid archetypal zombies, not slow but methodical meandering until they sense you. Zombies are rare but difficult to kill at first, however as the game progresses they become easier to dispatch one-on-one but more numerous. Different areas of the mall have different environmental hazards as well as useful or useless loot. Item crafting and supply gathering is crucial. In the low level areas the mall has electricity and more loot but as you gain access to the harder more infested areas of the mall you will need to party up to survive the supply runs. Most NPC’s are borderline hostile and will sabotage, steal supplies, and make up the major boss battles. High level characters can act as guides for low level characters and get perks for doing so. The toy stores act as a pvp area where your weapons are replaced with nerf equipment. "
95tuxo,"A class based squad only Battle Royal containing a Soldier, Medic, Engineer, and Sniper.","Realistic part: I'm really focused on just the mechanics not anything super fancy. The game would eliminate RNG, a problem a lot of Battle Royals have, and contain a lot of the basics you see in BR's and in class based games. A medium sized map in which you spawn in random preset locations. 8-16 teams, probably the lower side of that spectrum so the map wouldn't have to be so large. You'd spawn in a very rocky map with closely placed shanty towns. I want players to have easy cover but I don't want some gigantic city in order to do so. Each team spawns in one of these towns spotted with few buildings. The map every 5 minutes or so will do a UAV scan of the whole map allowing everyone to see everyone's location. The shorter the match is completed by the more points are awarded to the players. These points are explained later. More points are also rewarded for the amount of help you provide to your team depending on your role. Each class has the ability to efficiently kill enemies (avoiding a ""protect the healer"" scenario) while still holding the individuality players feel in a class based shooter. Some mechanics include (Some realistic and unrealistic.)\n\n* Engineer: The ability to place a turret and briefly upgrade anyone's weapons for a short, limited amount of time.\n* Sniper: Can throw out a flying drone (For extra fun let it have two modes. A travel mode and a recon mode) and an ability that pings the player whenever a player is in a 5-10 meter radius. This doesn't give away the enemies position rather it just notifies the player that someone is nearby\n* Soldier: Throws out ammo for the team and can shoot a rocket launcher every couple of seconds.\n* Medic: Heals obviously, also has an ability to give any player armor. (One at a time)\n\nUnrealistic part: What if the game had multiple maps that each take place in different time periods, no mechanical differences just re-skins of the players models abilities and weapons, however a completely different map. These time periods include a incredibly futuristic laser-esque map, a present war-style map, and a past fantasy/magic type map. Points could allow you to buys skins and serve or serve as a matchmaking system. You could also add special abilities that players get after they've done a lot of killing, healing, building, or damage."
95trx7,Fellowship of the Ring Multi-player Game,"I'm not interested in making games, but this would be an interesting survival coop PVE experience.\n\n9 players - 9 characters (frodo, Gandalf. Sam, boromir, legolas, Pippin, merry, aragorn and gimli) \n\nplayers get to choose their character as they join the lobby, or can join a game in progress if it's not full and choose any characters that are not being used/left alive. \n\nOne session would take about five hours to complete depending on the route they take from Rivendale to Mt.doom. \n\nplayers playing as Hobbits would be medics/cooks/stealth play style. \n\nIf you are frodo, you have the ability of going invisible but at the cost of notifying the nazghul of your location putting the whole game at risk, if you decide to put on the ring.\n\nIf you choose Gandalf, you obviously have wizard powers.\n\nYou get where I'm going with this, choosing legolas would give you the best fighter while choosing gimli would give you the most strength and health etc. \n\nThe gameplay would be somewhat like PUBG, no regeneration unless you eat, you can pick up armor, weapons, arrows, etc. only hobits can make certain items, if Gandalf dies during the mission and you're out of torches, going through a dark cave would be impossible because you can't use his staff to generate light. \n\nThe ring bearer always starts as frodo, if he is killed, the new ring bearer becomes Sam, then the other two Hobbits, if all Hobbits die, then a non hobbit ring bearer would be penalized in attributes because in the lore, the ring corrupts everyone, but hobits can't do much damage to the world, unlike one of the Warriors, who could, so losing attributes would signify corruption of the mind to the ring bearer. This also makes it important to keep Hobbits alive. \n\nYou could basically start with nine players and finish the game with one character left Alive, although you'll face golum inside mount doom, it could be a very tough boss battle if only one hobbit is left alive or it could be very easy to defeat Golum if even Gimli is still alive. \n\nPlayers would face wolves, orcs, nazghoul, bandits, trolls, mountain giants, spiders, bears, dragons, etc. Players have to choose the right path or risk encountering an army of orcs, or risk their lives in the mines Moria, etc. \n\nThe ring can be taken by an orc, if this happens you must chase him down and defeat his companions before he delivers it to sauroman or morder depending on location. If the nazghoul take it, game over, you failed. \n\nThe map would have to be huge, five hours of running just like in the film, although it wouldn't be boring as I mentioned  before, there would be a lot of enemies. \n\nIt's basically survival, horde, battle royal, pve in one game.

95nawr,Super Person,"You are a super person. Not necessarily a hero nor a villain.\n\nWhen you start you get to customize your hero. Not a pre-defined archetype, but choosing individual powers from a list to mix and match, customizing how the effects look (like in city of heroes), each part of the costume and choosing a name for yourself. The powers also shouldn't be re-skins of the same few powers. Shooting fire out of your hand is not the same as shooting electricity.\n\nYou then are released into a large open-world city with businesses,  people going about their daily lives, open heists, civilians in danger, and other super people, either players, AI or a combination. \n\nInstead of choosing a side between being good or bad, you have what's called a reputation. If you do good things (stopping bad guys, saving people, etc.) and people see you, your reputation goes up.  If you get caught doing something bad (robbing a business, hitting civilians or other supers, etc.), your population goes down. Your reputation determines how the civilians, the police, and the other supers treat you. With a high enough reputation you could team up with other super. The hero on a team with the highest reputation is the leader. You could also make a team of villains if your reputation is low enough, and the villain with the lowest rep is the leader.\n\nOf course, you could also perform crimes every now and then while saving people to balance out the reputation, thus bluring the line between heroes and villains."

Now 1 thing din't change, you have 3 or maybe 4 possible ways to play with your cult. Agresive (Murder your opponents), Pacifist (Show that peace is the option(maybe with drugs), Scientific (Something with upgrades, research and maybe this is the drugs possibility) My problem is that I don't know what all the buildings should be or what all the different units should be like every RTS has. Also I had this idea like in a lot of RTS' you have a happines stat, I would do the same but with Authority.

It is also true for  Skyforge on some parts.\n\nGuildWars 2, for  it's dynamic gameplay and ease to stuff, the possibility to create very  various builds and very different ways to play over all classes was  really nice here.\n\nPath of Exile, for it's huge diversity of builds, but having access to the tree from start makes it a bit spoiled.\n\nLichdom  Battlemage, even if not a mmo, this game is pretty unique since you can  craft you own spells, i would like to see this in a mmo, same goes for  Divinity Original Sin 2 which allows to combine multiples skills in one.\n\nI would like to see all those qualities in a same game, so here are ideas that came out of this bit of thinking :\n\n\-  Players defeating enemies to get their materials to craft skills (even  bosses like skills or transformations), since bosses skills should be  OP, boss should be very challenging to kill.\n\n\-  those materials to craft skill should be tradeable (but only once, to  avoid fucked up economy), and can also be stealed by savage pvp on the  open map in some areas, and the most interesting materials would be  dropable on ennemies who lyes in thoses area.\n\n\- No instanciated content aside from solo content, i would prefer one open huge map.\n\n\-  very few vertical progression, mostly horizontal progression, this  means no stuff farming, only farming to extend possibilities in term of  skills, actions, so horizontal progression.\n\n\-  very limited information for players in game, a bit like dauntless,  mostly visual informations (like no hp bar for boss, how can only watch  how badly damages he his by his wounds), the goal is to have players to  discover the game by themselves, not following a guide or wiki or  whatever. This also means the game would lock content you have not  discovered yet to avoid shortcuts.\n\n\-  having access to many information about how game works tend to push  player to get ""meta"" builds, and lack of creativity, i'd prefer to see  players exploring, and get the chance to create unique skillset.\n\n\-  no unreachable content before some levels/gear requirements (like in  skyforge/blade and soul and many others games), because no one want to  farm for hours to reach a content they'll clean fast, actually, having a  very large content like in FF XIV to give the player the possibility to  do different things would be nice.\n\n\- i'm a big fan of high risks/high reward systems, so RNG would be scaled this way, less players = more/better loots\n\n\-  The idea is to have a world where it is more profitable to play alone,  but where the balance of the game imply you cant just yolo to the boss  unless you are well prepared and know what you are doing, so getting  down bigger ennemies should be done with few friends you can trust  enought not to kill you right after the fight to get back materials on  your body.\n\n\- on overall, i want to see  mmo to push players to better themselves, not putting them in front of  sandbags bosses to get better gear to restart same thing later on.\n\nAbout skill farming and materials i'm thinking to gene and mutations to create a skill set.\n\nThere would be so much more to add, but for now, what do you think about this ?\n\nAlso, sorry for my not so good english, it is not my native language\n\nOLD Post is here, since i'm new to reddit i posted at the wrong place first :\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/95deb1/some\_mmo\_ideas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/95deb1/some_mmo_ideas/)"
95erba,Just an example,"Hello fellow subredditors,\n\nIn my entire life I have been fantasizing about a creation of a game that includes a show, or tv series that I have been hooked on at that time, and I really have had great ideas though I have never published any of it because it did not actually crossed my mind. I always hoped that another person who is interested in that kind of software development would eventually make the game but unfortunately, I did not get my wishes come true. Until now. I just thought about looking for it in Reddit(best website ever). \n\nSo... straight to the point, if any of you are Naruto, the anime and manga, you would like it a lot. Imagine a open world, WOW-like MMORPG Naruto game, giving you options for creating a completely unique character of your own choice and desire because there is no man who has at any point of his life, been hooked up on Naruto Anime that didn't imagine the perfect Character jutsu user according to himself. Facts. \n\nSo yeah it will be really amazing if you had the chance to experience a game like that. Thank you for the opportunity of being able to share this with you. I am really high right now so sorry if by any means have broken a rule or something. And yeah, good luck all of you.\n\nYours sincerely, \n\n/VT"
95e7xl,Naming the player,"This is rather abstract, but Have no other place to share it.  \n  \nRemember how in halo games (Halo reach was the one I played), other than your username, the player can choose a 3 (4?) symbol short-hand of sorts. not sure what exactly it was called.  \n  \nAnyway, since that's supposed to be, like, a military call sign, imagine a game that could actually use it to refer to the player.  \n  \nSystems that allow to stitch sentences from single words have existed since half-life 1, so it's certainly possible to make it sound believable, using pre-recorded nato alphabet and numbers.  \n  \nIm not quite sure of all the possible uses for this, but even having the usual multiplayer announcer differentiate between players in an FFA or something would be neat.  \n  \nso, as an example, instead of a generic ""you've lost the lead"" you'd hear ""A07 (Alpha|oh|Seven) has taken the lead"", which is the short-hand that the new leader has.  \n\nI dunno."

95bam1,Team based and tactical air combat game,"A 20v20 multiplayer game with semi-realistic graphics and war thunder sized maps. I have come up with 3 gamemodes so far:\n-STRIKE\nBoth teams have a base which they have to defend while trying to destroy the enemy base. The bases are also surrounded by anti air guns and detection radars.\nPlayers can respawn after a certain amount of time, which depends on the current situation on the map and the number of players that left the match before the battle has ended. Time is unlimited.\n-FRONTLINE\nIt's a faster, deathmatch-like mode. You crash, you're out. Victory is acheived by shooting down all enemy aircrafts. Time is limited.\n-ESCORT\nA more asymmetrical mode. One team has to cover a transport aircraft carrying important load from one base to another. The other team's goal is to take out the transport before it reaches the destination.\n\nEach 20-player team is divided into classes:\n6x Fighter\n3x Interceptor\n2x Attack aircraft\n2x Bomber\n2x Recon aircraft\n2x Electronic warfare aircraft\n1x Gunship\n1x Spotter\n1x Tanker\n\nEvery class can use the basic equipment which includes:\n-Basic engines\n-Air to air gun\n-Flares\n-Chaff\nHowever, every class has access to it's unique parts.\n\nDescription for every class, its role and unique equipment:\n\nFighter:\nIt has short range heat seeking missiles and an IRST heat detector which allows it to silently detect and target all enemy planes. These make it the best at close range. Missiles can be tricked using flares.\nFighters can be used to escort other classes which cannot defend themselves against aerial threats. It can also be used to silently attack important targets that are unaware. They cannot attack ground targets and need to rely on attackers and bombers to take these out, just like they rely on fighters to protect them from enemy planes.\n\nInterceptor:\nIt has access to long range radar guided missiles. Those missiles can reach far, however the enemy is going to get a sound warning when these are incoming. They're also quite easy to avoid with the help of chaff dispensers and evasive maneuvers. \nInterceptors can be fitted with a radar.\nThe best way to play these is to stay far from the target and take advantage of the powerful radar and long range missiles. Interceptors should mostly attack big, slow planes that are easy to hit, although they can harm small planes too.\n\nAttack aircraft:\nCan equip guided air to ground missiles, great for destroying enemy ground radars and anti air guns from a safe distance. Attack aircrafts don't have a radar. \n\n"

9596qt,A Game Based on Frequency,"Genre: Open-World RPG \n\nConcept: Travel through the earth as a highly sensitive psychic who can conjure up abilities based on the nature of every circumstance he’s in. Your goal is to save the world from extraterrestrials who somehow gained access to a universal source of power that’s capable of bending reality itself. \n\nSetting: Mid 2020s Earth after the “Reboot”. \n\nNature: A vibrant world that’s 40% of lighthearted playfulness, 30% of bursting chaos in any way possible, and 30% of mental reflection. One moment you’ll be in your hometown fighting a drunk driver in a car at a dealership with a sudden increase in sensory perception to outrunning a broken ferriswheel that rolled down the hill onto a city bridge at hyper speeds while fighting a robotic clown in a jet pack to being stuck in the dead silence of space light years away from earth wondering why you, the main character, had to be the “one” and eventually praying to universe followed by a surprising event. \n\nBattle System: Old School but with a twist. Every time you find yourself in combat, a certain psycahdelic background will appear representing the overall atmosphere of the situation you are in. The background also indicates your momentary ability. There’s 65 psychedelic backgrounds in total meaning there’s 65 abilities, each with offensive, defensive, and supportive ways of use. However there are some powers you can keep throughout like healing, clairvoyance, and telepathy to solve overworld puzzles and analyze enemies. Remember you’re playing as a psychic. \n\nHours: 20hrs average of story time. 6hrs of postgame content. 5hrs of solving quests and puzzles. Overworld is huge.\n\nMusic: Depends on the scenery. Quirky yet fitting for the most part. Could be unpredictably wacky, randomly serious, dissonantly (if that’s even a word) scary, or at some point nonexistent. \n\nEndings: 2 (there’s an extra if you solve all quests and puzzles along with nearly finishing the postgame content).\n\nInspiration: EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, Paper Mario, Mob Psycho 100.

958u1t,A game idea loosely based on Prehistoric Park,"Note: This game may seem like a rip-off if other games of this genre like Prehistoric Kingdom, Parkasaurus and Mesozoica. However, this idea was merely inspired by the Docu-fiction series Prehistoric Park only. I hope that the amazing ideas in this subreddit, which are extremely creative will be picked up by some game developer and made into a real game. \n\nThe game is a construction management simulation game where the player must build a zoo featuring prehistoric creatures. To obtain these creatures, players must use the time portal, a device that allows the player to travel through time to obtain creatures from the past. Players can send a team to capture creatures and the player can even join the expedition to capture the creatures and bring them to the modern age. \n\nThe expedition team can bring back creatures of a variety of ages, physical condition and even mutations such as albinism, polycephaly and other conditions. Some creatures require different climates and atmospheres. These creatures must be housed in specialized enclosures, which must be domed or covered. \n\nPlayers can choose where the park is built, with every country having a different environment where the park can be built. \n\nPlayers must build enclosures for the creatures, with the use of tools such as terraforming, the placing of flora and terrain painting. Players must accommodate the creatures with space, other members of its species, sufficient food and water, active environmental enrichment, passive environmental enrichment and the appropriate environment for the creature, which includes the correct flora, biome, elevation and humidity. \n\nPlayers must also satisfy the guests who come to the park with amenities like restaurants, food stands and toilets. Visitors also require a safe view of the creatures and protection from the creatures. Players can read reviews left by guests.\n\nIf creatures are dissatisfied, they will exhibit stereotypies and will escape and rampage. Creatures can get sick and injured, which will require veterinarians to treat them. \n\nThe game has a day and night cycle as well as  a dynamic weather system. Natural disasters can occur though it varies with the area the Park is built in. \n\nPlayers must hire employees for various purposes. The player will be given a dossier on each employee before hiring them. "
9565rx,Doing Assignments on a Laptop Infested with New Malware each day (LONG),"Hey, same guy that made Organ Tower Defense game and Light Gun Puzzle ideas here.  Loving this sub.  Anyway,\n\nThis would be a FNAF-styled point-and-click game, minus the Horror aspect and the ever-confusing lore.  In other words, it's purely for multi-task management and gameplay.\n\n**""Story""**\n\nThe story is simple: A girl has to complete 1 assignment from school each day for 9 days.  But, each day, a new piece of malicious software is installed on her laptop where she does these assignments.  Malware cannot ""kill"" the player, but it can erase assignment data and undo progress, wasting precious time.\n\nIn addition to new malware being introduced each day, the assignment would be different each day, too.  I'm thinking of word documents, modeling, graphing, etc.  This contrast's FNAF's repetitive gameplay to make up for the lack of a horror aspect.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nBase Gameplay: Switching between multiple applications on a laptop to deal with malware and work on your assignment, while keeping an eye on the clock to complete it before the deadline.\n\n*Day 0:* Word Document for a friend.  There is no malware or deadline present, but the player is introduced to the applications in the game.\n\n*Day 1:* First assignment for school.  Malware: *Pop-up Ads.*  Anywhere from 1 to 6 pop-up ads appear randomly, and they must all be closed to continue doing anything.\n\n*Day 2: Rootkit.*  Potential Rootkit threats are tracked on IdentityTracker.  You must change your IP on a fishy application  accordingly to prolong the time it takes for the Rootkit to catch you.  Rootkit can get a hold of your computer and delete progress until you change your IP.\n\n*Day 3: Pop-up Upgrade:* up to 9 ads may appear, and they can move across the screen.  *Spyware:* On an informal website, there is a timer showing how long you should stay logged into your account before Spyware starts to permanently slow down progress.  Log out right as the timer is about to end to avoid it, then log back in. (This process takes time)\n\n*Day 4: Adware* and *Spyware2.*  You have an adblocker at your disposal.  Enable it to avoid adware (which slows down how long it takes to change apps), but disable it to see if any particular Advertisements are appearing.  They can be a sign of Spyware(2), in which case you must clear your cache, but this removes some progress.\n\n*Day 6: Rootkit Upgrade:* Rootkit ""moves"" faster.  *Virus.*  For assignments from now on, you must read information from a friend via email to continue.  This Virus will imitate your friend, but if you can notice subtle details, you know to avoid opening them.\n\n*Day 7: Ransomware.*  You can now spend your time mining cryptocurrency (which can't be done when Adblock is on), which is used to pay Ransomware.  If you are not prepared for the price Ransomware asks of you, Ransomware can delete your data very quickly.\n\n*Day 8: Virus Upgrade:* Now better at imitation, and they are more cluttering.  *Adware Upgrade:* If you leave Adblocker on for too long, some Ads will learn to surpass it, forcing you to install a better Adblocker.  *IdiotTrojan:* Does random things to distract you, such as inverting the color scheme, skewing the screen, miscoloring batches of pixels, moving the window, and changing fonts to Wing Dings.  Ultimately harmless.\n\n*Day 9: Pop-Up Ad Upgrade:* Now if ads aren't closed fast enough, you'll get redirected to indefinitely many tabs until your web browser crashes, forcing you to lose lots of progress.  *Ransomware Upgrade, IdiotTrojan Upgrade, and Spyware2 Upgrade:* Self-Explanatory.  *Trojan Horse:* When you change applications, there is a 1/5 chance of the application being switched with a fake that can delete progress if you stay on it for too long.  Quickly see if anything seems fishy about the app, like the latest version, the name, or the publisher, then leave and come back if you spot anything.\n\n*Day32:* An optional day, and a nod to System32.  It has all the malware fully upgraded, and an infinitely long assignment.  The goal is to see how far you can get before the deadline arrives.\n\nIf you any ideas or criticisms, leave them below."

954417,A large scale modern FPS and RTS hybrid. Similar to MAG or Planetside 2,"I'm talking about a large scale game, similar to MAG back on PS3 or Planetside 2, where each team is broken up into multiple platoons broken up into multiple squads of 8. \n\nEach team has a commander, who views the battlefield like an RPG game. They have to tell platoons what objective to run, and tell squads can tell squads where to go. Commanders would select a path to be taken by the squads. If the squad exits the zone/path that is supposed to be taken, they will be punished somehow (either point reduction or an out of zone function similar to battlefield). Commanders would be able to see their top performing/low performing squads on the map and help the team out by giving weapon upgrades, calling in UAV's, setting airstrike targets or vehicle (controlled by actual players/designated by commander or in game squad leaders?) Commanders would also look at the overall battlefield and control where players would spawn from. As squads carry out orders by the commander, the commander gets more points to be able to help out their team more.\n\nPeople would queue for a game based on their preferred function (commander, infantry, tank, helicopter, jet, etc.). \n\nOne gamemode would be an overall zone control similar to Planetside 2. Another would be like the 256 player game in MAG, where one team would defend a central base from 4 sides (for each platoon), and play against other platoons attacking them. Each platoon would have to complete a series of objectives before taking over the main base.\n\nMAG attacker example (from what I remember):\n\n1. They would have to take control of 2 towers. The enemy team would have 4 squads spawning from separate bunkers behind these towers. Usually the towers were easy to take.\n2. Take control of another 2 towers. At this point, it was a little harder to take since it was closer to the defender spawn. One strategy was to go around and destroy an anti air, allowing people to parachute in and overwhelm the defending team.\n3. Once both towers were taken/destroyed, the platoon would go for the main base to secure. Since there were 4 full platoons on 4 sides of the map, it required multiple platoons to be able to overwhelm fast enough. With a commander watching over, they could designate the 1st platoon to move around and help the other platoons to get to the main base. "

94yee5,A Transport Simulation Sandbox Game,"**Name:** Train Sandbox\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A simulator sort of game with sandbox elements where you can build a huge railroad, ship line, truck transport, bus line, air line, etc and every industry and station can be interacted with. It could be multiplayer or even massively multiplayer.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nNo real plot, just running transport services by driving vehicles.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nAnywhere\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* None\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The basic mechanics of this game would need to be transporting passengers and cargo with any vehicle. Of course lines/routes would need to be set up, but once you have the demand you get to drive the vehicles to get things where they need to go. This could be done in a sort of tycoon game style where you make money by transporting things and build up your empire with the money you earn, however this would be an optional game mode to make as a sandbox with no limits would be a little more ideal. You'd be able to start with a blank terrain block probably about a square kilometer or mile in size, maybe even bigger than that like 5 or 10, then you could add more terrain and edit the terrain how you like. You'd get to place the industries and they could be easy to set up like plopping them down, then you get to add whatever sort of transport you like to the industry, so if you want train tracks you just click a button to add room for however many tracks you want and if you want roads for it you can add that too. The simulations of all the vehicles, terrain, and buildings would be preferably realistic, including any damage. There would be no real objective, but you could set up job roles for everything that needs to get done, so if you want a coal line on a railroad you mark the stations and industries that you want stops at and then it's up to you to do the job. With the multiplayer aspect you could have many jobs set up and set a limit of how many people can do said job. Huge servers would need to be possible so that large worlds could be made with several people running different jobs all at once. If it's not an MMO, people would need to be able to set up their own servers and there could be some premade ""official"" servers by the game devs that are online 24/7. The engine this runs on would need to be able to handle a lot and as for damage, that would be handled locally on a person's computer, but damage points would be saved server side, so like if you had a truck that rammed into a tree, the server would save the fact that this happened as well as the impact points so when rendered on someone's computer the client can render the damage on its own rather than the server having to do all the work. For communication and preventing crashes, there would need to be at least text chat and as for signals, traffic lights, and other navigation, that could be handled automatically. And as for controlling the vehicles, there would need to be simple controls and possibly an option for advanced controls depending on the vehicles. As for the trains and their cars/trucks, the people doing the jobs would either need to get them on their own or have a job set up specifically for shunting trains together in different yards. For road transport, npc cars could be included with an AI controlling how the cars work so truck drivers don't entirely feel alone on the roads. And for route building the UI would need to be very user friendly and simple enough for people to pick up without having to dig through several menus to get to what they want to do. There could be easy tools for making things as well like cities and towns, stations, docks, intersections, and many other things. For the vehicles available on each world, that would be up to the creator of the world to decide and they would all be pre-placed. If someone were to leave a vehicle somewhere while the server is running, it would stay in that spot. If they left while in the middle of driving, the vehicle would either keep going until it crashed, keep doing its job on its own, or go somewhere out of the way, and this could be set by the server owner. In the case of a crash or a wreck, rescue teams could either be an automatic thing or a separate job. Derailed trains for example would need to be either placed back on the tracks, taken for scrap if damaged beyond repair, or taken to be repaired and people would need to go to the site with cranes and such to clean up everything.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* The main standout features of this would definitely be the visual damage and part damage system as most simulators don't even bother with this. Another feature would have to be the multiplayer aspect as most simulators don't even have that and when they do it's sometimes complicated to set up. And while industry interaction with vehicles has been done, it's not done enough, so it would be welcome in the genera. Wreckage clean-up is also rare, maybe non-existent in most simulators, so this would be something new as well. Shunting cars for trains is also not done very often, so this would also be welcome.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC. Consoles would not be the best for this especially with multiplayer requiring server hosting of some sort.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Anything extra would have to be anything more in depth than what's already been listed, from more advanced realism with damage like for ships sinking, to actually operating the different industries and working in them. Of course this stuff would be a lot harder to implement.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nI don't need any credit, but if you insist, just put something like ""based on an idea by chimerabyte"" or something similar. I am open to messages to discuss the idea in further detail as well."
94pmis,Tower defense game but with organs and body parts (LONGISH),"**This is a Biologically-inspired Tower Defense/Strategy game**\n\nThe enemies would be types of bacteria, diseases, parasites, and other unwelcome bodily invaders traveling through bodily tubes, and the towers would be various body parts, each carrying out a specific function. (Body parts aren't to scale, of course)\n\nOnce the enemies reaches the ""wound"" of each stage, they would start attacking it until it runs out of HP, which results in a game over.\n\nInstead of spending resources to place each tower, each tower consumes Metabolic Energy using Oxygen at a constant rate, and if your ""body"" isn't generating enough of those two resources, your towers will stop functioning for a while until they completely fail, damaging the wound (don't ask).\n\nOne last thing before the list of towers is that the most important body parts are the Brain and the nerves.  Using nerves, you must connect every tower to the brain  in order for them to function.  Nerves are cheap, but many are needed, and the longer the distance between towers, the longer the signal takes to travel, making brain placement a very strategic task.\n\n# Towers\n\n**Vital**\n\nBrain: Makes all other body parts function using nerve signals. (Limit: 1)\n\nNerves: Transmit signals.\n\nLungs: Produce Oxygen. (Limit: 5)\n\nHeart: Transmits Oxygen to towers in its radius. (Limit: 1)\n\nVeins: Extend the reach of the Heart when placed in its radius.\n\nStomachs: Spray acid that slightly damage enemies, but more importantly, digest stuff.  Digested enemy remains are collected in the stomach.  Some Metabolic Energy is automatically extracted.  *Content overflow can cause organ damage.*\n\n**Support**\n\nIntestines: Empty the contents of a nearby Stomach while extracting additional Metabolic Energy.  The more there are, the more energy is extracted, but less and less energy is received each time through.\n\nSkin: Acts as a quickly self-repairing although weak wall for enemies to overcome.  Each repair consumes additional Metabolic Energy.\n\nLiver: When an enemy or white blood cell is defeated, its remains...remain.  These remains cause organs to slow down.  The Liver breaks down these remains.  The Liver is also the only organ that can stop bleeding (caused by some enemies) via blood clotting.\n\nEye: Detects visible enemies, alerting organs to defend against them ahead of time. (Sensory range: Straight ahead)\n\nTaste Buds: Detect most enemies.  Not affective for forwarning, but it's the only way to alert the stomach not to intake dangerous foods. (Sensory type: Area of placement)\n\nNose: A reliable sensory organ with range as well as ""invisible"" detection.  But, it can easily become infected, causing organ damage and extra energy usage. (Sensory type = General)\n\nSalivary Glands: Sprays saliva on enemies, making them take more damage from attacks\n\nPancreas: ~~somewhat unrealistically~~ makes glucose usable when Metabolic Energy is too low, and stores Metabolic Energy as glucose when it gets too high. (If it gets too high, fat starts appearing, which takes up space for towers)\n\n**Offense**\n\nBone Marrow: Makes White blood cells and propels them at enemies\n\nEar Canal: Makes clusters of earwax that slow enemies down while damaging them\n\nTeeth: Occasionally chomp on passerby, dealing massive damage.  Sensory organs are especially useful for warning this tower ahead of time.\n\nMuscle: Beats on enemies.  Gets stronger as time goes by.\n\nEpithelium: When triggered, sends a signal to lLungs to perform ""burst"" attacks that suck up and expel enemies, turning them into offensive tools.\n\n***If you have any more ideas for Towers, particularly Offense towers, let me know in the comments.  Any body part will be accepted if it isn't a joke.***\n\n# Enemies\n\nI was going to make a list of some enemies and what they do, but this post is already so long, so I'll make a short summary.  Some enemies included are Common Cold, Sugars, (fast moving) Virus, (multiplying) Cancer Cell, (diarrhea causing) C. Jejuni, C. botulnum, Vibrio, (energy draining) Tapeworm, (sensory disrupting) Debris, and more. ~~don't ask me how these are nutritious~~"
94oan3,A game where you teach a bot,"Think open world sandbox like minecraft. Give the player a companion NPC. Then create mechanics where the player's primary goal is to protect and teach their NPC companion.\n\nInteraction could be in the form of a chatbot or something closer to the interface of Maniac Mansion where you teach the companion a series of verbs and nouns that allow increasingly complex/precise instructions.\n\nOrder the bot to watch you, then mine some iron. The bot now knows ""mine"" and ""iron"". You could also show the bot items to teach them ""copper"". Eventually being able to give orders like ""find a cave and mine iron"".\n\nTo be good, this would require a pretty advanced level of AI and machine learning. Possibly more of a research project than a game. But l'd love to see something like it some day."

94maho,An online D&amp;D style game,"The game would have everything like a real life game of D&amp;D. I have divided the concept in 3 points: \n\n**1) The making of a player**\nThe player would be able to do everything costumisation wise. This would range from the looks to level to abilities to weapons. \n\n**2) The story**\nThis would be a part for the dungeon master. The dungeon master would be able to make the enemies (this includes customisation, weapons levels etc), the story and everything a DM would be able to make in real life.\n\n**3) The world**\nThe DM would be able to make the world. This would enclude locations, buildings, etc.\n\nI hope you people liked it and if you plan to make this please shoot me a PM. Cheers people."
94kkn7,r/outside game where you can play as any of the animals in the world,I'd love to play a game with semi-open world like in ARK where you just play pvp using any of living creatures in real life. This idea is strongly inspired by [tier zoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw/videos).\n\nWhy not just go outside you ask? Well I didn't have a chance to choose my region or build I'm gonna play. I just happened to spawn as a Human in Europe. I'd love to get to play as an eagle or a falcon.\n\nThe game could have a progress system like SPORE has where your goal is getting DNA points to evolve your creature a bit (like after choosing your creature to be a bird you can choose it's species).\n\nI know it's complicated but it doesn't have to start big. ARK:Survival Evolved as well as League of Legends was created by an indie company. It would just need a lot of polishing.

94g97c,Does anyone have an idea for a platformer?,
94esth,Harry Potter Choice Game,"Hey! I wanted to pitch an idea that might not make it anywhere, but might still be worth looking at. It take inspiration from games such as the newer Telltale Games and Detroit: Become Human.\n\nMy pitch is to produce a game that revolves around a young wizard living a far distance into the backcountry who is just realizing his powers and going into the age he can be enrolled in Hogwarts. For the parent to get the kid to the school, they go through challenges that force the kid to make choices that subtly reflect the characteristics of the houses. By the end of the game, the choice would include making it into one of the houses based on all your choices, or never making it at all and doing something completely different with your life.\n\nTell me what you guys think! I’m always open to criticism and we can work on the idea to make a better projection of it. "
97lzab,Chess But Every X Seconds You Lose A Random Piece,"A variation on speed Chess but every x seconds on your own timer you lose a random (non king) piece. How long this period is would need to be determined via trial and error though you would likely have multiple options.\n\nIt would add an element of chaos to the game which would drastically change tactics and create an interesting new mechanic.\n\nI propose player vs AI, multiplayer ranked and multiplayer friendly game modes with a variable handicap for friendly games (I might lose a piece every 10 seconds and you lose one every 5 for example).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm marking this as intermediate because online multiplayer would require the maker to know how to create and maintain and active community, coding the AI is not a beginner task and the Elo rating system would need to be changed somewhat to compensate for the luck factor.\n"
97lmkv,Survivor Or Big Brother game,It would be kind of a cartoony graphic design you could play with AI or your friends with up to 8 friends (16 maybe) or 16 AI you have to make choices and build up trust with people.

97kwnp,Game designs,"Hey guys. I'm an ex game designer and map maker.\n\nI wrote game ideas for the last 10 years basically while hoping for game companies that can make them to spring back up. So, without further ado:\n\n(They're pretty nondescript, I just haven't explained them in a long time, maybe ever.)\n\n**Zombietown**:\n\nSingleplayer: Half Life 2\n\nMultiplayer: N/A\n\nA comedy game focused on a trio of characters, in a semi-Half Life 2 but more British comedy style TV show. A semi-open world (main map being the local area, and then later on you can unlock a couple other locations).\n\nI would be the main character. Ahahaha. It's slightly like Shaun of the Dead so largely I come down and bring the characters into a more blasé look at zombies. It's a vehicle for comedy writing, but because it didn't exist I can't really say it's anything other than a concept. Also gangs exist, so most of the conflict is caused by people instead. A wasteland and a janky cartoony 3d style might be appropriate.\n\nProbably would involve a killer who would hunt them down as they go down to Brighton for a mission related purpose.\n\nBecause my friends are unavailable, I'd probably pick Hat Films to star as the main trio.\n\nIf so it'd probably maybe include hackers, or a bank heist.\n\n**LD2**:\n\nSingleplayer: Halo 2Multiplayer: Esoteric fighting and classes in MOBA-style maps\n\nA sequel to a game I hoped to make. The gameplay was a standard pre-CoD4 FPS, so basically no sprinting and press the analogue stick to zoom in.\n\nAbyssal environments, centered around a character called Anatomica. The character would be able to do a lot of exotic things regarding dimensions, and the whole story was set around playing with game design.\n\nThe design kept changing, but bits and pieces are interesting:\n\nI've got one idea which I don't think is worth it but is still it's the protagonist of this traversing through a minigame centered around 4th dimensional geometry. I figured out a basic minigame/game play but it would need to be prototyped to finish the thing. No practical design experience sadly on 4th dimensional geometry.\n\nThe original game design was more like Bioshock meets an action story like Halo, so it would have more exotic aspects like nudity and unique character back stories like Killer7.\n\n**A BUCKETHEAD 2D GAME**\n\nThis is something I've wanted to make for years but hadn't. Probably because of all the other plans.\n\nThe more inventive ideas for the game included making it a AGS game, except having alternate views so that you can see the opposite side of a 3d object when entering the room above you. His album covers fit for creating a world and experience.\n\n**The Crims**\n\nVery much as the name describes. Wanted to do it like The Sims + GTA San Andreas\n\n**4chan City.**\n\nThis one is close to my heart. Years ago I designed a game with a more XIII style, and I'd still love to, but I think that to make a culture for a website that no longer has one sort of ruins the point. I have so many other projects which are projects in name only. So sadly all of these aren't going to be made, but this even includes a metaphor for how it would function in as a world. Even can be extended to 'Internet city' metaphor.\n\n*Other ones I'll add later.*\n\nIf you're interested in making one, give me a heads up. [royaljello@outlook.com](mailto:royaljello@outlook.com)"
97jinf,A psychological horror/thriller that starts off as a slice of life farming game. You soon suspect the townsfolk won't let you leave.,"In a lottery you don't remember entering, you won a farm in a small town and decide to start life anew. The game starts proper as you meet the nice townspeople and begin farming the first season. But soon you start to realize something ominous is happening.\n\nOn the day the bus line is supposed to resume service, the bus is mysteriously out of commission. When you try to make a phone call, you learn that the phone service is down for repair. The townsfolk are suspiciously keen on presenting you with love interests. You find a shrine that nobody seems to know about or at least mention to you. Every time you pass out from exhaustion, you wake up in your own bed. Someone must be stalking you.\n\nWhile renovating your house, you find markings and traces of blood beneath the floorboards. Someone in town accidentally calls you by another name. While plowing your farmland, you discover unmarked graves. You overhear conversation about ""appeasing the forest sprites.""\n\nIf you look forward through the calendar on the mayor's wall, there's a date/holiday marked with a red X that isn't marked on your own calendar. Something is going to happen on or by that day.\n\n****\n\nYou can choose to continue playing the game as a slice of life farming game, pretending that everything is fine. There's an ending for that.\n\nBut if you choose to try to break free of the farming game cycle, you'll find resistance. The townsfolk become hostile and eventually violent. There's an ending for this too.\n\nThere's also an ending in which you turn the tide on the town and escape. You steer the wrath of these so-called ""forest sprites"" onto the town itself. But the path to this ending might take a few playthroughs to discover."
97h5vm,A game where starts out as a simple micromanagement game and and turns into a story driven narrative about befriending aliens.,"So uhhh this idea is kinda personal in a way. Lots of stuff I like combined into once. I’m trying to get some feedback and help because rn I’be never programmed a game in my life and am working off a free trial of a drag and drop. \n\nAnyways so, basically, the idea is: you are rounding up the 4-5 species of aliens that humans know of so we can dissect and examine them. I imagine that capturing then alien wouldn’t be a huge part of the game, most of the game is spent micromanaging the ship with the alien on it. You’ve got to keep it running, prepare yourself against other alien ships coming to rescue their fellow, and also keep the alien from escaping.\n\nEach day you would pick certain skills you level up and certain things to build and do. For example, for the first third of the day you could level up your building skills, the second third you could spend trying to build a reinforced door on the aliens cell, the third you could spend trying to communicate with the alien.\n\nYour first alien should be almost completely docile and emotionless. Like tutorial levels of docile. Eventually, about half way through your first trip, the alien starts to show signs of emotion. If the player spends enough time trying to talk to alien and comforting the alien they’ll be able to form a bond with it. This will not only allow the players to slowly learn more about the aliens culture and itself, but the alien will also boost skills by telling you about its experiences. I imagine a lot of the dialogue could be similar to that of the ideas of the “humans are space orcs” community. \n\nTo the players that don’t decided to venture down this path it will be a perfectly competent micromanaging strategy game, but there should be just enough hints to tell the player that their might be another option if they take the right steps.\n\nAt the very end of the first trip, the alien could escape all on its own, or the player could either choose to release it or not. Or some other option. Either way.\n\nAfter this the game should slowly increase in difficulty. Longer trips, higher amount of ships coming for you, harder to sate aliens who try harder to escape. \n\n\nSo uhhh yeah! That’s my weird 3am idea. What do you guys think?"

97g5rm,Open world villain game where you try to gain traction against a bunch of heroes,"This game idea just occurred to me when I was replaying spider-man 3, but a game where you have a goal in mind as a villian (maybe classic world domination) and you try to build it up, but everything you do attracts attention to you from other heroes.\n\nSingle player, the ""heroes"" that come to foil you would be AI.\n\nYou have a choice in what you want to do and your overall goal, whether it's stealing important components for a machine, stealing money, or you just do it for the sake of carnage ect.\n\nThe way I envisioned it, say you went to rob a bank, I'd imagine an GTA-esque scenario, where there's high chance that a hero (maybe a weaker one) goes to help out and you've got to deal with this guy\n\nThe more you do, the more heroes become aware of you and you can have superman type heroes hunting you down and trying to bring you to justice\n\nYou'd be encouraged to try to be lowkey about things and it'd be a challenge because you actually won't have the type of power to fight these guys early on, it'd be like an actual scenario from a comic book when a hero is thwarting some villain.\n\nThere are other villians around the world and you'll be able to interact with them and team up with them (if you can find them). You can witness these villians fighting heroes in the street and just roaming around.\n\nI'm sure something like this probably wouldn't have a large fanbase, and it really just was something that mildly interested me and was cool IMO. Plus, the idea I had seems pretty complicated to make in a 3d world. In my mind, it would be a really fluid world that seems like an actual comic book with randoms fights breaking out, I'm sure these things would be pretty difficult to make."

97e93x,Metaphorical Shooter,"I've been thinking to combine multiple elements from a few of my favourite shooter games. Like for example, I love the stage selection style of G-Darius and I'd like to use it, and I am thinking to use a special attack move Strikers 1945 style.\n\nAside from that I also have added another mechanics - a kind of unique 'power up' and bomb mechanics. Three kinds of ""power up orbs"": R G B; and the player has six slots to contain them. It works something like this: suppose the player's current slots have R  GG BBB. This translates into: 1 white, 1 cyan, and 1 blue; so player's ship is going to shoot level 1 white (which is about as strong as lvl 3 red, green, or blue), level 1 cyan (as strong as lvl 2), and level 1 blue.\n\nBut suddenly I got an idea; how about if I turn this shooter game into half visual novel-ish. So while the player is playing shooter game, the stage tells a story. The player controlled plane represents something while the enemies represent something else.\n\nProblem I have now, is the fact that it's hard to find something to make a metaphor of to fit the stage mechanics... With the stage mechanics like G-Darius I figured out the stories need to be chronological with each progressing level, but need to be kind of independent at the same time so it doesn't matter from where the player came from.\n\nG-Darius's stage: You start at zone α (alpha). After you finish you are offered two choices: zone β (beta) and zone γ (gamma); after you finish stage two you can go to zone δ (delta) or zone ε (epsilon) from β, or zone ε or zone ζ (zeta) - so this makes a triangular pattern for the stages. With 5 levels there are 15 stages. I plan to use it but I will make it 9 levels, 45 stages; because coincidentally there are 46 Japanese alphabets and one of them is very special which I can use for a hidden stage or something.\n\nFor now to fit the mechanics I'm thinking to make it something kind of like ""dating stories"" with each stage representing different girls. \n\nI'd like some thoughts on this. Does it sound interesting? If anyone reading this has a brilliant idea, please comment. Thanks in advance."
97dkd5,VoidSea Pre-trailer,"I've been working on my 'idea' for the past 2 years. This is the first trailer, it's just a rough draft, no music for now etc, and needs cutting down in places.

97bg3v,thoughts on my idea?,"My game idea is simple. Combine the territory capture idea of planetside 2 and combine it with a modern Shooter like Arma3 or Pubg. An MMO that is based on lets say 4 Armies fighting for control of continents using modern military technology. If the army you choose to fight for wins the continent, you get loot crates that do NOT require microtransactions :) I'm not sure how difficult this would be to make but I think it could be an awesome gaming idea that would really pull on the COD and battlefield player base to join in! Thoughts?"
97bfgv,A multiplayer shooter with dynamic terrain manipulation and randomized maps.,"Before they spawn, players see the large flat map morph to have mountains, valleys, hills, plateaus, canyons and all sorts of structures in random arrangement.\n\nThe engine would allow for dynamic elevation changes to the mesh of the ground. Players have the ability to manipulate the terrain as well, both with weapons and with special powers.\n\nAny time the ground takes ""damage"" (explosives, gunfire, etc.) the localized area sinks down. This is a natural way to destroy cover or to bring an enemy down from a sniper perch. Any ground you sink this way refills a power gauge to use your land manipulation powers. In this roundabout way, you have to spend ammunition to refill your powers.\n\nPlayers can acquire different powers throughout a match. Some things you could do:\n\n* Raise the wide area around you for high ground advantage or a sniper perch.\n* Raise pillars where you aim to create walls for cover, ramps to higher ground, or outcrops to prevent fall damage.\n* Send out shock waves that you can use to push enemies away, or ride yourself for speedy travel.\n* Trigger a trampoline-like pulse that you can use to send enemies or yourself soaring into the sky.\n* Create a localized earthquake to mess with an opponent's aim.\n* And more.\n\nThe game would have a few different multiplayer modes:\n\n* **Standard Deathmatch** on smaller maps.\n* **King of the Hill** in which players (or teams) get points for standing on the highest point the map.\n* **Battle Royale** on a huge, sinking island.\n\nIn fact, battle royale on a huge sinking island is how I started to think about the game after inspired by [this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/96vwzr/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_a_game_like_this/) by u/EvilTeliportist. In both battle royale and kind of the hill, manipulating the ground becomes integral winning."
97auwb,Space Opera Game,"At its core, I’m imagining something like a cross between Gravitar and the Legend of Zelda. There’s a big galaxy you can explore in a spaceship that flies around using Asteroids-style physics, and the game is played from a top down perspective. Graphics would be retro-style, kind of shiny and colorful in a SNES sense.\n\nYour ship starts with only a simple blaster and few shields. As you fly around to different star systems that essentially function like the dungeons in Zelda, your shields get a boost and your ship gets new weapons and upgrades when you beat each system. There’s also other, smaller missions and tasks in the galactic overworld to complete to finish the game. These would consist of things like taking people to and from different planets, trading, transporting cargo, etc. There’d be wormholes here and there to warp from one part of the galaxy to another, and space stations that would function like shops and maybe double as save points. \n\nAs for the story, I’m thinking something inspired by the likes of Star Wars or Firefly, and your ship is like the Millennium Falcon or Serenity respectively. I like the idea of drawing from the former especially, as I feel that a mystical/occult element would compliment this game nicely. "
97a1b8,Willpower : The Trail - Top Down Adventure Game Similar to Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons,"So this is now my second post and after how many views the last one got I figured I'd post another game idea I have. Again this one is really bare and not very well developed but the core concept is still there. Honestly the only reason I share these things is just because I feel the need to create and if I put these ideas for games, which I am so passionate about, I have out somewhere, it feels more real and gives me some pleasure. So feel free to judge this as just a prototype or some mad 17 year old Swedish dude's mind run astray. I just like to share what I have going on inside my head!\n\n# Willpower : The Trail\n\nThe idea I have is for a medieval adventure puzzle game set in an Iceland environment. It will be heavily focused on story but also give you enough gameplay to make it feel like you're interacting with the world around you and having fun doing so. It's supposed to feel like a game after all. Cutscenes are supposed to be non existent except for a short introduction in the beginning which I feel would suit well if it had the art style of The Witcher 3's interlude, hand drawn shots that explain the latest in the story. This will be just in the start of the game though and possibly at the end as too summarize the story and give some closure to it all. The game would be roughly 10-12 hours long and will be set in around the 800-1200 centuries. Somewhere around there.\n\n# Story\n\nThis will be the absolute main focus of the game and if it fails to live up to expectations then the entire game will then be, in my mind at least, classified as bad one. You will play as an old mercenary named Dale Crawford involved in many criminal organizations which has lead to you making some enemies. One of these organizations have decided to take you down once and for all and have kidnapped your wife to Iceland to force you to come to an uncharted territory which will leave you vulnerable.\n\nYour wife Kyla and you have had a rough relationship over the last few years with her wanting you to stop doing illegal jobs for people. You have ignored her requests and continued to live the only life you've ever knew. Even though you might not show it you do truly love her and would do anything for her. Going on your ship to Iceland from from England you can't reach the shores in time as you're attacked by the very people that led you there. You wash up on the beach, weapons lost and mind astray, with nothing left except for your clothes and knowledge about lone survival.\n\nThis is where the game begins. After this you will find many different people to talk to which will give you tools and weapons, threats and fights, and some even offering themselves to your cause, should you accept it you will find yourself accompanied by them. They can survive to the end to game if you help them. You will have to make tough choices to either risk both you and your follower/followers or you can sacrifice them and make sure that your journey continues as planned. Be aware that the game doesn't get longer or shorter depending on the choice you make, but consequences might be dire. The game will not have a dialogue tree but it will give you options on how to react from time to time. \n\nOver the course of the game you will find out more about the backstory of the protagonist and his wife and you will truly realize how much she means to you. You will reminisce about the choices you've made about keeping your job and making her unhappy, denying her the children she wants. You will hate yourself for what you've done, but it only drives you more. This is where the title of the game comes in. Your will to save your wife and redeem yourself for past mistakes will become more and more apparent to you over the course of the game. The Trail has two meanings, one is of course the trail through the steep mountains, sandy beaches and untouched wilderness of Iceland, and one is the trail you take from being a just a man trying to save his wife, to becoming a something more, a man that has only one goal in his mind, one thing that drives him forward. To redeem himself and become better than he was before, to be with his wife and live the life she deserves, that you both deserve. \n\nI have not yet decided if multiple endings would be a viable feature yet in the game. If you could give some feedback to that in the comments that'd be great.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nAs I said the game will be very focused on story but it will of course still be a game. The world will not be open and you will follow a path laid out before you, it has crossroads though as I said in the story and depending on the choices you made you will experience different events. Puzzles will be of big importance with varying difficulty all being placed differently throughout the game depending on what tools, weapons and followers you have at hand. So you can complete the game entirely without using any weapons, any tools or any followers. \n\nCombat will also be a feature but will not be as prominent as puzzles. You can have a light attack and a heavy attack with dodge and block. I don't want to elaborate on combat anymore as I believe that combat will not be that important. The essentials are there though which will mean that combat is possible. The weight of the fight will be more important. The characters you fight and what they've been through. You might be forced to fight your follower for instance sometime in the story. This means that things like dialogue, behavior and choice will be featured more in the combat system to accommodate it's simple nature. \n\nI don't ever want there to be a dull moment in the game so there will always be a conversation being able to be started, items and nature to interact with, and random events to keep you entertained. Of course I can still see the enjoyment in admiring the environment and atmosphere of walking through the untamed wilderness of Iceland so that will still be there. \n\n# Graphics and World Design\n\nThe art will be heavily inspired by the likes of Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons and The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild. Of course the art will never be as good as Breath of the Wild but it will be a guiding tool to how the game will look. Brothers was a great game and it is very similar to Willpower and the art style and graphics of that game will be similar to this one. \n\nEvery location in the game will be inspired by pictures from the Icelandic islands so that it truly feels like the game is set in a land not many have seen, which I feel would make it more interesting to look at. The wind will always be able to be heard as there are not an overabundance of trees in Iceland and the world will be affected by it on screen. Leaves will go with the wind, bushes will rustle and the clothing of people will flap. Wildlife will appear at specific points and you will sometimes be prey rather than predator. You will not be able to hunt though as that would just feel as a tacked on feature for nothing more than to prolong the game.\n\nThe people you meet will all have Icelandic/Nordic accents and they deal with regular problems that a farmer or villager of that time period would. \n\n# Final\n\nSo this is now my second post so far on this thread and I hope that you found my game idea interesting! Of course this is a rough description of the idea I actually have in my head but I think I described it to the best of my ability. This game, if the story is done right, is something that I would really enjoy and would definitely play for myself and I hope you would to! So I bid my farewell. Adieu!\n\n/Littorinaren"

It influence their happiness, their energy for training)\n\n\- Slave for cleaning the ludus and keep gladiator happy\n\n\- Guard to prevent a riot\n\n\- Manager assistant : Hire staff, buy/sell news slave/gladiator, buy/sell fighting equipment, buy a new Ludus ! \n\n\- Buy news slave and train them to be gladiator\n\n\- Hire applicant who wants to be gladiator  \n\n\- Sell gladiator that you trained to make profit\n\n\- Buy good gladiator from other Ludus ( AI or other real people Ludus) \n\n\- Keep your gladiator happy ( pay them prostitute, offer wine, have good food, clean ludus, slave for entertainement, right schedule, better/more equipment )\n\n\- Buy equipment for training and for the fight in the arena\n\n\- Improve the gladiator barracks with bathroom, individual room, etc\n\n\- Get married and see your beautiful domina walk thought your Ludus (different domina for different buff like better food or better entertainment for your gladiator) \n\n\- Train your gladiator ( control them in the training arena or let the AI train them automatically) \n\n\- Manage the schedule of your gladiator ( Sleep, training, lunch, dinner, free time, etc) \n\n\- Choose your champion (and control him in the arena) \n\n\- Apply your ludus for the arena game ( It would be amazing if arena game is PVP ) \n\nThen in the arena, you control the gladiator you choose and fight for the glory ! (and money). \n\nGladiator aspect : \n\nWhen you buy a slave, he is weak, you need to train him, get him specialised with a specific training weapon. \n\n\- One hand sword and shield\n\n\- Two hand sword \n\n\- Two one hand sword \n\n\- Trident and net \n\n\- Spear and shield \n\n\- Etc \n\nA gladiator have a better training if he is happy, to keep him happy you need to make him win fight (training arena or better in the gladiator arena), give him a good place to rest, sleep, or give him gift (wine and prostitute). \n\nIf he train well, he have better stats faster and so more chance to win the fight ( but it always depend on your skills in the arena). \n\nA weak gladiator can totally win against a better one if you are skilled. \n\nYou need to give every gladiator who goes in the arena a real weapon and armor ( different from the wood training weapon they have in the training camp ). You have to buy all of these training weapon, real weapon and armor. \n\nIf you lose in the arena, your gladiator usually just get wounded but he can also die in the arena (spectator choose if you live or not depend on the divertissement you provide)  so you can lose a lot of money and time investment. \n\nYou get paid when you send a gladiator in the arena and get more if you win. \n\nWhen you win a fight in the arena, you alsi gain popularity. \n\nThe price you get paid for sending a gladiator in the arena depend on the popularity of your Ludus. \n\nMore popularity means more money you get for a fight of your gladiator. \n\nMore money let you improve you Ludus, which means more and better gladiator. \n\nSo get more popularity until you reach the colosseum and get the best champion the world ever see. \n\nSo what is your thought about this amazing game ? :P "
977ya1,I need input on magic gameplay,"I am planning on making a fp game were the player has magical powers. I am looking for input on the actual gameplay that involves the magic. Is it a puzzle game? If there is combat, should it be slow or fast? Should each spell be a button combination or a numbered button? I am leaning more toward the button combination because then you could learn the spells while playing the game the first time but then if you replayed it you would know them already and there would be no frustrating unlocking of spells to do.\n\nI am open to  critique. So please comment on what you think."
977jr8,Idea for Upcoming VR Action Platformer (Trying to Innovate Upon Movement in VR),"Hey everyone,\n\nMy recently formed VR Development Studio came up with an idea for a VR game and we want to get general opinions on the idea before starting full development. If you would like to help us please read the general idea below and let me know what you think either by filling out the 3-minute survey (this helps a bunch!) Thanks for any help! Also at the end of the survey is a link to a download of a 4K wallpaper from a recent level mockup.\n\nGame Idea:\n\nVR Action Platformer where the player plays as a hero in training. The player gains new superpowers by completing missions and exploring the general area. Each power has a movement (and possibly attack) focused ability. By combining multiple abilities players will be able to create their own traversal systems (allowing the player to adapt the VR experience to what they can enjoy). We plan for the missions to be timed courses where you have to get to location in a certain amount or catch up to a specific object. We also want to add in attacking, however, we fear it might be a bit much with the fast movement in VR.\n\nOnly 3 minutes to complete, and we'll love you forever! :)\n\n[http://info.dvnc.tech/vr-idea-survey](http://info.dvnc.tech/vr-idea-survey)\n\nThanks for reading and please let me know what you think!"

973ppc,A FPS Multiplayer In-Game Market,"So I thought of an interesting idea for a MP mechanic that is a bit of a mix between COD, BF, and I think Titanfall.\n\nPretty much what this is is a a sort of marketplace for players to spend score they earned that game to spend on Special Weapons/Classes, Vehicles, Buffs, and Abilities. These abilities would be similar to Killstreaks from COD. These can range from AI controlled vehicles/infantry (Similar to MW2's Pave Low or WWII's Paratroopers) to targeted abilites (Like Airstrikes and Artillery barrages) to even super vehicles (like BF1's behemoths)\n\nThis is just a rough concept but what do you guys think?"

There would be a platformer world, an RPG world, an FPS world, a horror world, a point and click puzzle world, etc. Not only that, but each world could parody an already existing IP! The platformer could parody Shovel Knight, the RPG could parody Earthbound, and the horror world could parody Slender: The Eight Pages, and more!\n\n# Story\n\nThe story might go something like this,""You and your friends create a dimensional teleporter, and it is shown off at a school fair. Since nobody believes you, and gets you angry, you demand to send a test subject into the teleporter. It works, but that is a good thing and a bad thing.

96zry7,Can an archer work well in a fighting game idea?,"I'm currently working on a 1v1 fighting game and I want to know if having an archer works well in one, especially since this game takes place in the modern to near future setting with a scfi/cyberpunk/horror style with a little dark fantasy mixed in.\n\nI have two ideas for an archer but I'm not sure either would work for the setting I'm doing. One would be a female high tech geared archer and the other would be more nomadic style of an archer. the high tech one would focus more on high tech gadget and explosive arrows and be able to make cybernetic ravens reappear and attack, while the nomadic one would focus more on dark magic attacks with the dark magic arrows and a dark mystic golden eagle that she can make reappear to attack.\n\nWhich one sounds more exhilarating, the female nomad archer or the high tech geared archer?"
96zmd8,Insomniac Olympics - A couch multiplayer game about racing through obstacle courses with people who could barely stand up.,"Inspired by [a song I like of the same name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDztJ9UY-c), this game idea is a couch multiplayer game that uses basic soft-body physics and overly specific controls to make it challenging and perhaps funny.\n\nUnlike most games where running in a direction is as simple as holding a direction on the analog stick, ""overly specific controls"" are of games like *QWOP*, *Surgeon Simulator* or *Octodad* wherein the player has elaborate and convoluted controls which complicate even the simplest actions.\n\nIn this game, up to four players would try to control wobbly soft-body characters (think Gang Beasts or Human Fall Flat) to race through ever more treacherous obstacle courses. The catch is that you only have direct control over foot placement, and have to rely on the game's wonky physics to maintain balance.\n\n**You control characters like balancing a broom.**\n\nFor example: You shuffle your character's feet left a bit so his center of gravity falls to the right. Now that he's tipping over to the right, you shuffle your feet to the right to stop him from falling. And that's how you start running. Move your feet too much and he'll lean back the other way; too little and he'll fall on his face.\n\nIf you fall, you can still get back up. It's just... well... kinda tricky to get up too.\n\nHaving soft-body physics already, the game would also have you interact with physics objects. You'd hobble across seesaws, stumble across loose cube bridges, trip and roll down slopes, try to limp through windows, the whole nine yards. There would be many courses to choose from. The first player across the finish line wins."
96z93k,Insanity - 3v3 Horror Survival with Mental Stability as a Crucial feature,"This is my first post here and it will probably not get recognized or be very deep and thought out as a game, but I will try my best. I'm just a lowly 17 year old student in Sweden and I've recently gotten into game development but I found out that coding and programming is too hard for me. I still have a passion for creating and for games. So just posting my idea is the next best thing! I have two ideas for games, one is a bit more thought out than the other but both are still dear too me. I will post the other idea I have in a different post so that this one doesn't get too long.  \n\n\n# Insanity\n\nThis is my first idea, it's bare but still something I'd find myself playing if it existed. The core of the game revolves around mental instability and having to preserve it. The game is a multiplayer horror experience in a relatively small map. You and your friends will have to find work together to find an escape or preserve your sanity until help arrives. Meanwhile the other team will consist of monsters, villains and demons trying to corrupt your mind to make you go insane so they can claim you. Matches will be from around 15-30 minutes with 3v3 and 5v5 modes. The 3v3 will be the most prominent and the 5v5 will be available only to larger maps.\n\n# Gameplay Of Team Supernatural\n\nYour Job as a Supernatural being will be to interact with almost everything in the environment to raise the insanity of the Survivors. You can make lights go out, chairs fall over, flip gravity on everything except for the survivor, crack glass etc. The insanity of the survivor will then rise if they witness or hear these things happening. You, as a Supernatural being, will have a third person view, the ability to move through walls and ceilings, and after you scare someone enough without their meter going down you will have the ability to knock them out temporarily for a few seconds and move them to someplace you want. This will be particularly useful if the survivors find each other and decide to team up. When the insanity meter is in the top 10% of it's total, you will be able to trigger a jumpscare with the face of your supernatural being, claiming them as your own which will grant you points. Only the being who inflicted the most recent insanity to the survivor will be able to do this. Also you can not infinitely trigger these events to inflict insanity as that would be too OP. Depending on the severity of the insanity that can be inflicted it will give you either a cooldown or limiting your range of abilities to inflict insanity with for a short time.\n\nInflicting Insanity and claiming survivors as yours will grant you points. These points will give you the ability to buy  new beings with different abilities to inflict insanity with, for example maybe one being can corrupt the view of dawn approaching so it seems instead like the night has just begun. Winning a match will also of course grant you additional points. Balance of abilities with these beings will of course be tended to so that no being feels to OP. That is the basic concept of the gameplay for Team Supernatural, it can of course be expanded upon. \n\n# Gameplay Of Team Survivors\n\nYou as a Survivor will have either to find other survivors in the map as you will be spawned at entirely different locations each time you start a match or survive alone. Your mission is to either escape the area in which you are trapped by finding tools or hatches/doors leading to a new area of the map bringing you closer to escaping, or wait out the time limit of 30 minutes to be rescued by police, sunlight, or for the ritual which brought upon Team Supernatural to end. Maintaining your insanity is crucial to survival and if it goes to the top 10% of it's total, you are in immediate danger. The insanity meter can slowly diminishing over time or you can lower it instantly by yourself by spending time with other survivors, or finding things in the map for instance a picture of a family, a teddy bear owned by a child, seeing dawn approaching through a window, finding and reading a diary belonging to someone, relaxing in a chair for 30 seconds to gather your thoughts etc. Unfortunately for you these items can be corrupted by the Supernatural Team. So instead of a photo of a happy family it can show the family all dead for example. If you have your sound turned up and your ears turned on however you can hear an ever so distinct little whisper of ""Danger"" or ""No"" which is telling you that a nearby object that is intended to lower your insanity, is in fact corrupted and will raise it. Be aware also that seeing another survivor with more insanity than you will raise your insanity but seeing someone with less insanity than you will lower it until you have similar amounts. Seeing another survivor be claimed or be knocked out and dragged away by the supernatural will of course raise your insanity as well.\n\nFinding new areas, staying uncorrupted for long periods of time, finding other survivors, and finding items to lower your insanity will give you points. These points can be spent on other survivors with different abilities, more stamina for sprinting, faster sprinting, higher resistance to insanity, higher strength to knock down doors and unstable walls, etc. Balance of abilities with these survivors will of course be tended to so that no survivor feels to OP. That is the basic concept of the gameplay of Team Survivors.\n\n# Maps And World Design\n\nThe first idea I have for a map is that of an abandoned hospital. The hospital will be run down and completely empty of other people, except for maybe some dead ones. The vibe will be ""Death"" and ""Fake Familiarity"". You can look out the windows and see that an entire town surrounds the hospital but it will be completely empty and more often than not haunted. Which is an illusion. There will be long, dark hallways with high potential for corruption and with little lighting and many doors leading to rooms filled with interaction and dead people and sometimes people that have survived in the hospital for so long, waiting for someone to rescue them, only to die right in front of you. The main point of the game will be that no match is similar to another, every time you walk into a room there will be something there that you haven't seen before or the entire room will be different in size and design. In the hospital this will work very well as no hospital looks the same when it comes to design. Of course the classic things will exist like many floors, reception, vials and plastic bags, hospital beds etc, but it will be different. That allows for replay ability. \n\nThe second map I have in mind will be a sharp contrast to the hospital map, as where the hospital map is based around a smaller width it is more about verticality and more floors, the forest/island map will be wider. It is a forest/island map with many cabins spread out through the map.  The vibe will be ""Untouched wilderness"" and ""Isolation"". The only way to escape is to build a raft or to find tools to fix the broken boat by the coast which will be by a different location each time. The Supernatural Team will be able to interact with mostly nature to inflict insanity onto the survivors but corrupting different items or events such as a deer drinking out of a pond with it's calfs will of course also be available. The Cabins will be placed throughout different places around the map and will sometimes be run down and destroyed to add more variety into the world design. Entering cabins can bring on many different sights and events which will inflict your insanity, these events and sights can be tampered with by the supernatural before hand. \n\nThose are the ideas I have for maps for the moment. There is a lot of potential to what maps can be made and these that I have already thought up can of course be expanded upon and altered.\n\n# Final\n\nSo this is the idea that I have, I can totally get that it seems like a big game and something similar that is done right will probably never come. I have seen sort of similar games already be made, Friday the 13th, which was shit btw, and Last Year which is coming out soon so I can't say how good or bad that game is yet. \n\nAll in all I hope that my idea made some of you interested or intrigued and that it seems like a good idea because I feel that this kind of game is for sure something that I would play!\n\n/Littorinaren"

96rpcx,Slight Variances on the classical RTS model of resources,"A month or two back, I just learned of the announcement for Age of Empires 4 which got me very excited and got me into thinking about some ideas for a more modern RTS game. \n\nThe idea isn't anything too complicated, and should, for the most parts, remain true to the classical rts model of games like age of empires, age of mythology, starcraft, and so forth, but with a more complex and realistic resource system.\n\nTL;DR - Make an RTS game with a more complex and interesting resource system.\n\nThe idea I had in mind involves a system which uses 6 different resources: Money, Wood, Stone, Metal, Food, and Morale. The first 5 are somewhat easier to understand, so I will start by elaborating on Morale.\n\nMorale should be a resource where you gain +1 morale for every unit you make, and -1 morale for every unit you lose. Conquering some like a single settlement or town will give you a morale bonus, and when certain milestones are reached in terms of the amount of morale you have acquired, all of your units will gain stat bonuses based on how much morale you have. \n\nMoney in real life affects the global economy, something which I think would make for an interesting mechanic in an RTS game. In this imaginary game I'm brainstorming for, every faction gets a ""market"" building/structure that they need to build at some point. The market is actually in a network, so in other words, the market building made by every player is a shared market network where players can trade resources for money, and vice versa. The market, however, will have things like inflation and so forth; so for example, if a player trades in wood and gets like 300 money/gold for it, the next time ANY player tries to trade in that same amount of wood, they will get less money due to there already being wood on the market now. All players start with 0 money, and the market network starts with a total sum of 10,000 gold/money which will be all the money that will exist in any given game at a time. \n\nFood is going to be a lot simpler compared to the 2 above. Food limits how many units you can have up at a time, and you can increase the amount of food you have by building farms.\n\nWood is self explanatory, workers will be able to chop down trees and harvest lumber. Workers can also build quarries wherever in order to gather stone. A map will have ore deposits scattered throughout, and mines can be built atop the deposits in order to acquire metal. \n\nTeching up and researching things will require expenditure of money, and money that is spent by a player to tech up will go back into the market network, thus reducing the cost of resources for other players, something which somewhat correlates to realism as a more technologically advanced faction should be able to reduce the cost of resources overall for others due to how much more efficient they will be able to gather. \n\nThis is just a rough outline of how interactions would play out with these 6 resources I had in mind. I think it would actually be even more interesting if more resources than just the 6 mentioned were implemented as it would allow many different play styles and strategies for playing the game although it would make it much more complicated.

96pvbc,"A game like Phage Wars, but on a spherical surface.","Hello,\n\na few years ago I developed a small prototype of a game much like Phage Wars. However, the key difference was, that it was not placed on a boring rectangular plane with borers and such, but on the surface of a sphere.  \n\nThe sphere could be turned and rotated by the player (think of the globe from the X-Com games), so it could be observed from all angels. On the sphere there would be the usual Phage Wars stuff: bases and units that travel between the bases.\n\nI finally found the motivation/time to continue that project into something that would actually be presentable.

96pnq7,Minimal single player topdown roguelike Battle Royale,"Map is a small grid that fits on a single screen. Zone will shrink to its minimal size in only about 30 turns. A turn is complete when the player takes an action (move, turn, pickup, shoot, reload...). Upon completion of the turn, every other npc take their actions (same idea as in the original roguelikes).\n\nYou only see what's in front of you, but a ? appears on the spot where an enemy has taken a noisy action near you (moving, reloading, shooting).\n\nProjectiles could have different speeds depending on the weapon. Ex: rifle bullets travel 10 grid squares per turn, but must be reloaded between each shot. Pistol can fire 5 shots, but they only travel 3 squares.\n\nThe whole map could be something like 30 x 30, and contain some buildings to break line of sights.\n\nCould be made into multiplayer if this turns out enjoyable. A time limit of 5-10 seconds to select an actions could be introduced so that you're not waiting forever after the same slow player. It's meant to be a quick game after all.\n\nAny other simple ideas?"

96nx54,Gather Build Focused Sandbox First Person PvE World,"There's so many e-sports games now it's almost hard to find something that's both relaxing to play and really engaging... Like big and complex with progression and things that you can get that make you feel like you've done something... \n\nIt's hard to describe the particular feeling of accomplishment. Like on Morrowind / Oblivion / Skyrim when you have a room of a house that's just so totally filled with skulls that you get 10 fps moving through it or a whole heap of other cool things you've collected. But that's really limited because it's one of those games where you do the quests and the game is over. There's some grinding and item crafting to do to max out and an achievements list if you can be bothered but your finished. Still great games but the only way to get more life out of them is to do the same stuff you did before but in a different way, magic, stealth etc... your still doing the same stuff though. Limited.\n\nThat's where the creative sandbox really holds it's own (when fleshed out decently), but often lack the story detail of the quest based RPG's I mentioned. And speaking of the creative sandbox...\n\nThere's a lot of talk about Minecraft and Minecraft like games but I think there's even more misconception so I want to clarify. Vanilla Minecraft that the kids play and the Minecraft 1.7.10 Tech packs... may as well be two completely different games. If you haven't thoroughly played a good tech pack you could be forgiven for thinking that automation is as simple as just placing a single block or not knowing the extent the mods take the game too altogether.  \nBut in fact it really can be as complex as your imagination desires. Lua coding farming drones, ""Figure-It-Out-Yourself-Automation"" setups, gear and machinery progression, powerful systems for item storage and processing, logistic item / fluid / energy transfer networks with complex filters and processes... the list goes on. Most importantly is the fact you have tools of possibility. People have come out with systems, setups and designs that even the mod developers wouldn't have dreamed of being done with their blocks. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nYou know those physics games on smart phones where you gotta build a thing to complete a level. Minecraft is kinda missing that. You build a thing with an intention or purpose, but you don't get the ""complete the level"" type of reward for doing things. When I stopped playing Minecraft I had a sad sense of ""right, that's done, it can take care of itself now.."". \n\nSome of the mods on Ark Survival Evolved are pretty clever. Probably the best ""creative possibility"" mods since Minecraft (but still worlds apart). Then 7 days 2 die has a pretty good concept on the voxel terra-former system which is a nice upgrade on the Minecraft block world. btw.. why does 7D2D not have a plethora of Minecraft like mods... what a waste. There needs to be a game that encompasses all of these strong points. In fact there needs to be both a futuristic and a fantasy sci take on this amalgamation of strengths. \n\n* I want to see a game that looks like Skyrim, Borderlands or World of Warcraft. *I know they're polar opposites so I'd settle for Borderlands as it's kinda in between the art styles. Not saying I want it to look like the actual buildings and characters of these games but instead the use of colors, shaders, model geometry, the outlines etc* \n* With the possibilities of Minecraft 1.7.10 Tech Mods, but more brought together. *Build AoE buildings like the lumber mill (even like the ones in Skyrim) instead of a planter harvester block arrangement.* \n* In a world engine like 7D2D that spawns cities with NPC's - shops, factions, races, quests, training etc\n* A complex economic ecosystem to buy and sell the resources I harvest, trade commodities etc\n* With trade routes like Anno but physically implemented in the world with progression - *I want to start off by horse and kart ( think ArcheAge) and eventually build rail and onto other bulk transport and automated systems.*\n* It's got to have progression, character stats and levels, achievements, crafting skills, machinery capability.. \n* The crafting itself has to have progression - *build machines that can be used to build more advanced machines - start from a clay kiln and work towards an autonomous foundry* \n* I want to be able to play the same persistent map / save with a few different characters who all share the same grind rewards like how World of Warcraft has account bound Achievements and Gear etc, *you can complete the same achievement, quest or what ever thing it mite be with each character but you only have to do it once with any to get it marked off your list*\n\nI want to build this world in first person from the ground and create society through my own efforts.\n\nI'm looking forward to see what fallout 76 brings to the table and if we ever get there ... star citizen"
96mag5,Mech Racing Game,"TL;DR: Think F-Zero meets Mad Dash.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of Mad Dash I wouldn’t be surprised, it was an XBOX original title that was similar to a kart racing game except you were on foot.\n\nThis idea follows a similar concept with some twists. While technically on foot, you’re actually racing giant 50ft mechs along courses that are a mixture of pure track racing specifically designed for the mechs, and street races that have you rushing between, over and even under the buildings to get to the finish. \n\nTrack races are all about speed with the track being littered with checkpoints that energize your mech’s systems and increases your maximum speed meaning you can potentially accelerate exponentially as you keep making checkpoints and aren’t hit by anything. There’s also pick ups like offensive weapons, defensive gadgets and super abilities. Each character has a different offensive weapon, defensive gadget, and super ability that has a unique effect on the race. Some have missiles, others have lasers etc. defensive abilities are things like shields/reflectors or something that steals the pick up of another player. An example of a super ability would be a teleport that allows you leap frog one person or a chest beam that blasts everyone in front of you causing them to lose their speed.\n\nStreet races are more so about finding the fastest possible route through the massive sprawling cyberpunk city. There’s no strict path to follow, everyone starts on one end of the city and have to make their own way to the finish, sometimes that has you going underground other times it has you and 3 others scrambling to the top of one of the massive buildings. Street races could also function akin to a death match of sorts where in if you are destroyed by other mechs after a certain number of hits then you get eliminated, but I feel this should be a mode in and of itself. \n\nA third mode comes to mind that also sounded fun, something like a mech demolition derby that takes place in a fake small town/city where the mech that causes the most property damage wins. Every ones offensive weapons and defensive gadgets are set to cool downs, a pick up that activates your mechs special ability spawns periodically. Buildings in this mode are not nearly as strong, even the sturdiest of buildings will collapse after you land on it from a great height or fire a barrage of missiles into it. You can even destroy each other, but you better do so fairly quickly as the more time you spend fighting the less time you have to earn points so it’s definitely a gamble, as they’ll just respawn in a bit. You can take out Player 2, but in that time Player 3 will have scored more points than both of you. This I feel would be a strictly multiplayer mode. \n\nControl wise imagine early Assassins Creed style running and climbing, just on a massive scale. The R trigger activates your “Flat-Out” mode and you enter a sprint, as long as the trigger is held you’ll sprint. Pressing the L trigger sends your mech into a slide, this not only allows you to make low clearances it also gives you a greater degree of control when you turn, basically it’s the mech’s E-brake. Pressing A (X for PS4) is how you jump and initiate a climb, the powerful mechs can climb any surface by simply digging their giant fingers into the wall. Climbing significantly slows your speed depending on mech class. You can also preform a boost jump from a slide, fully charging a jump while sliding initiates a cool breakdance looking move that has you returning to your feet, done properly it has you returning to maximum speed even if you weren’t going that fast when you started the slide. Holding A/X charges the upcoming jump, different mechs have different stats so some can charge a jump for a long time and make massive bounds, others have massive firepower at the cost of agility. Timing jumps properly can mean being the first one to hit the ground running or to make it over the ledge, timing them improperly can lead to a huge detour that may cost you the race or even lead to instant death. \n\nHere’s how I picture the character roster, you’ve got 8 or so pilots to choose from. The more you play as a certain character the more abilities and mech classes you unlock for that character. There are four classes of mech, they are\n\nZephyr Class: the lightest and fastest class these mechs are for the daring who believe in their ability to stay ahead of the pack and not get blown to bits after a couple good hits. These mechs have the best jumping, and even have limited gliding capabilities (hold L trigger in air). Cannot break short-cut walls. Think sleek and clean lines, something resembling a stealth bomber.\n\nTaurus Class: The bulky heavily armored class. This class is not the fastest but they can take punishment like no other and are capable of smashing through specific walls revealing short cuts (sprint into the marked walls without jumping). They also deal 10% bonus damage when using explosive weapons. Think big, person-shaped tank.\n\nHarlequin Class: A class that focuses more on control. Excellent handling and magnetic feet allow for a measured approach to any race. Shave time off a lap by running right up an incline that would require any other class to climb with their hands. Harlequins have moderate agility and health, and deal 10% extra damage when equipped with lasers. Cannot break shortcut walls.  Think Anime.\n\nJupiter Class: The hybrid class that gives you the best of both worlds at the cost of reduced firepower. Jupiter’s are second only to Zephyrs in speed, and have slightly more health than the Harlequin. They have a -10% reduction to their damage, and can only break through short-cut walls when going full speed. Think Michael Bay’s Transformers. \n\nBasically every character has access to each class of mech as you play them, everyone starts out with Jupiter class. Each mech of each class is tailored to their particular aesthetic. For instance the Norwegian metal-head adrenaline junky’s Jupiter is going to look fairly grungy with spikes and skulls (It would be great for him to have a line where he complains about having to use red paint instead of real blood for “legal reasons”), which is going to be quite different from the spunky Korean girl’s model. However each class in that particular characters line up is going to follow their theme so to speak. As you play you’ll unlock skins for the mechs, new supers for the character, and of course tracks and maps to race in multiplayer.\n\nThe game is overall very lighthearted reminiscent of Mad Dash in that regard as well. The whole game’s story follows these professional mech racers and their ride to the top. Similar to a fighting game the story/arcade mode follows whichever character you’ve chosen as they race through the circuits. These are very one dimensional characters, meant to parody the rosters of classics like SSX Tricky and F-Zero. You’ve got the perky and flirtatious lady, the cool black guy, the weird white guy, the brodacious surfer dude, the cute but terrifying Asian girl, and many more. \n\nThey’re somewhat stereotypical really, but with enough twists to keep the characters from offending anyone. The point isn’t to poke fun at actual ethnicities and cultures, more at their portrayal in games throughout history. Most of the humor is derived from anime tropes and a kind of self-awareness of them, say you’re in the locker room before an important race and a rival confronts you talking in that classic anime villain way, then your character just calls them out on how weird it is the way they’re just standing their smirking while they basically explain their whole life story and why they’re so motivated to beat you. Stuff like that, the cutscenes are very minor affairs that take a max of 5 min each between races, they’re really just there to inject a little humor into the game. \n\nSo in summary this is an arcade racer/platformer that involves 50ft mechs instead of go-carts. With an art style resembling that of the Naruto Shippuden games, and just a heavy anime influence in general, while also being primarily a humorous game about racing giant robot-suits in giant cities reminiscent of the ones you’d see in Astro-Boy or Cowboy Bebop. I just felt the foot racing game genre is sorely underutilized and there’s a lot of interesting directions you could take. "

96ksep,Pac-Force,"Having played the strange yet surprisingly fun Mario + Rabbids, I wonder what if they applied the same type of gameplay for Pac-Man. Its turn-based, you would have four characters each with their own stats and weapons, and you’re placed in a maze-type battlefield. The goal like usual is to collect all the dots without getting killed by ghosts. You can attack the ghosts bit won’t die. If you collect a power-pellet you can send ghosts back to their safehouse and you would be safe for a bit."
96koek,(PART 2) Tower defense game with organs and body parts (LONGISH)," Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/94pmis/tower\_defense\_game\_but\_with\_organs\_and\_body\_parts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/94pmis/tower_defense_game_but_with_organs_and_body_parts/)  \n*Read part 1 first if you haven't already.*\n\nThis post is a continuation of part 1.  Basic gameplay mechanics are explained in part 1.  Here, more details, such as enemies, levels, and extra game mechanics (in that order), are listed.  Just like last time, if you have any ideas, put them in the comments.\n\n# Enemies\n\n**Basic Enemies**\n\nCommon Cold: The most common enemy.  Moderate HP and speed.\n\nSugars: Contain lots of Metabolic Energy when digested.  Weak enemy.\n\nAmeoba: Tanky unit with slow movement and areal engulfment attacks.\n\nVirus: Grows and splits into more viruses at a rapid rate.  Each daughter virus has slightly different HP, speed, and movement patterns from the parent.\n\nDebris: Infects Nose and Eye organs easily.  Cannot be digested. \n\n**Special Enemies** \n\nC. Jejuni: Causes diarrhea when digested, and the effects worsen the longer the digestion process takes place.  Diarrhea uses up lots of water and makes some food go undigested.\n\nC. botulnum: Produces clusters of neurotoxins that are weak to areal damage.\n\nNeurotoxins: \^\n\nTapeworm: Steals Metabolic Energy from Stomachs.  It cannot be removed until it dies of age or by starvation.  Moves slowly, however.\n\n(Credit to Friend) Cyanobacteria: Has internal membranes that give it very high hp.  When destroyed, it releases a bunch of Oxygen.\n\n(Credit to Friend) Spirochaetes: Its membrane creates a spiral which makes it move in a twisting motion, making it hard to hit by projectiles.  Proves ineffective against antibodies.  Low HP.\n\n(Credit to Friend) Dictyoglomus: This bacteria shines at high temperatures, and the *higher the temperature*, the *stronger* it becomes.\n\n**Boss Enemies** \n\n(Credit to Friend) Conjunctivitis: Boss of the Eye Socket.  Can heavily irritate Eyes, and mildly irritate other sensory organs.\n\nHepatitis C: Boss of the Abdomen.  Inflates the area, making for less space for towers, but restricted movement for enemies.\n\nBronchitis: Boss of the Chest.  Makes Oxygen a very difficult resource to obtain by causing *Organ failure* in Lung towers consistently.\n\nUrethritis: Boss of the Urinary Tract.  Stimulates pain in all towers with nerves connected to them while urinating, confusing the Brain and making signal transferring difficult.\n\nStreptococcus Mutans: Boss of the Oral Cavity.  Causes the giant teeth in the level to decay.  Causes damage in the Teeth tower as well.\n\nCerebral Cancer: Boss of the Cranium.  Weak on its own, but comes in a large group, and rapidly multiplies.  Creates tumors that make less room for towers and are lethal in high amounts.  The tumors can be damaged and destroyed.\n\n(Credit to Friend) Human Immunodeficiency Virus: Boss of the Body.  If you want to know what effects it could have on the battlefield, look no further than [this image](https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/effects-on-body).\n\n# Level System\n\nThe game takes place inside a human body.  The game is divided into levels that are each in their own regions of the body, and each has its own gimmicks as well as path types:\n\n* **Biceps:** Beginning area with no gimmicks.  Enemies travel through blood vessels.\n* **Eye Socket**: Takes place inside mostly empty fluid, so tower space is abundant, but enemies are just as free to move.\n* **Abdomen:** Paths are long, linear intestines, but tower space is heavily restricted.\n* **Chest:** Paths are [bronchi](https://www.google.com/search?q=bronchi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab#dobs=bronchus) that are constantly contracting and expanding, making for new paths for enemies to take.\n* **Urinary Tract:** The body urinates from time to time, which expels much of anything inside the urethra, at the cost of water.  However, enemies can also travel in blood vessels that connect in and out of the urethra.  Try to trap enemies while they're in the urethra to expel them.\n* **Oral Cavity:** Paths are tooth roots connecting to multiple different teeth (don't ask).  Enemies can attack any one of these teeth, and the loss of any one will result in a game over.\n* **Cranium:** Pre-Final Area.  Paths are blood vessels in the brain.  **The brain does't feel pain,** so damage to any towers cannot be detected and healed.\n* **Respiratory System/Body:** Final Area.  All parts of the body can be accessed via blood vessels.  Resources are more abundant than ever before, but so too are enemies, paths, and ""exits.""\n\nThis level system is still in development, and more areas may be added, such as the anal, ear, and nasal cavities.\n\n# Extra Game Mechanics\n\n***Temperature:*** The more enemies there are like Common Cold and Virus, the higher the body temperature gets.  A new tower, Sweat Glands, would help regulate body temperature so that enemies like Dictyoglomus don't get too powerful.\n\n***Water:*** A new resource, unlike Oxygen and Metabolic Energy, that is limited in supply from the start of the level until the end.  It is used to make blood to heal body parts and to supply towers such as the Salivary Glands.\n\n{{If you have any more ideas, suggest them below.}}"
96jjee,Game about traveling through trippy dimensions,"I'm a sucker for games that have unique and trippy settings. Often times, it feels like you're traveling from point A. to point B. If there's a cool area, you simply step through the portal. I understand the following idea isn't really fleshed out but I'm curious on people's opinions on the concept.\n\nThe goal of the game would be to use things from each dimension in order to reach a goal. Each dimension would be very different and unique and have different ways of reaching it. By the end of the game, the player would know a few options for how to get around. For instance, maybe sleeping would bring the player to a trippy dream/nightmare dimension. Maybe if they find a lake in there, it leads to a Atlantis like water dimension. Maybe another way to get there would be getting sucked into a book or painting. There would be multiple ways to get to somewhere from anywhere else. \n\nI don't want this to feel like just physically going somewhere or stepping through a portal. I want the method of traveling to be through unique, magic like experience. It would also be cool to have multiple secret ways to get somewhere, and that would take you to a hidden part of the map that has cool loot. \n\nPerhaps each dimension is important and has different things you need, so end game would include a lot of shifting between dimensions. Overall, maybe you'd have a base that you continuously build for a final battle. Maybe the game is about preparing for a Seige from dark forces, and you need to muster everything you can to fight them off. The more you explore, the stronger the base gets, and the stronger you get. \n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Further explanations?"
96j3yp,Are fangames allowed here?,\^
96j0bh,Survival Exploration game based in the 1800's,"Sorry if I jump around, but I'm just trying to get my idea thrown out there.\n\nAfter watching The Terror from AMC, I thought to myself, how cool would a game along those lines be? The game could be set in the 1800's and it could be SP as well as MP. You could have up to 8-10 friends play with you.. maybe more or less.. The Captain would have to start out choosing amongst a couple ships. You could have the option to buy better ships after completing explorations. The captain would also have to purchase all the supplies to get the expedition there and back and he would have to hire the crew of AI. Any of the players friends that play would be officers on the ship, unless they really wanted to play as something else, and if you made it a public server, any randoms that join would be members of the crew unless promoted.\n\nI understand this game might be a little too big to make.. but I have nothing to lose by just throwing an idea out there.\n\n(In MP servers, everyone would start with a set amount of money, and if they fail too many expeditions and run out of money, they would need to become crewmen on other expeditions to make some back?)\n\nNow in my mind the game would be FPP, and the visual effects would be of huge importance. The look and feel to an exploration game is crucial in my mind. Time would obviously be sped up, and you could have maybe 1 map to start. On that map you could have maybe 20 explorations that could be conducted.. so if you want to do a short exploration you could choose among like 5 options. Then you could have medium, long and very long quests/explorations.. So technically all these missions would be on the same map, but the points you need to make it to are all placed all over respective to their length. I don't know much about how difficult it is to make massive maps, but after playing Star Citizen and seeing how big they can get with creating entire worlds, I'm assuming making a fairly large generated world in the wilderness shouldn't be too difficult.. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nThe main game could be set in the Arctic, much like The Terror was. After that each new DLC could be new maps.. I.E. exploring around South America, Antarctica, etc...\n\nYou could also add some fictitious monsters to the game, that randomly show up to kill off players and crew to make it more difficult.\n\nThe expedition would have to basically start, try their best to navigate with a basic map to their point, and then make it back. They would have to endure weather, ice packs, ships catching fire, ship getting caught in the ice, having to make the crew carry supplies, and sending out scouts to find safe passage.. the list goes on. I don't wanna go more in-depth because I think I got the main point out there.\n\nIn closing, I have just always wanted to experience the ability to walk around on a beautiful old 17th century ship, enjoy stunning scenery as my friends and I make our way on an expedition we spent nearly all our starting money on, and then suddenly something happens that cause us to change our plans, our ships get stuck in the ice.. do we wait it out and let the ice thaw, or do we continue on foot and come back? People are dying of scurvy and from the dreaded cold, we're being chased by something supernatural, the wildlife is sparse and my friends get mad at me as the captain because they have their savings spent on this expedition, they consider mutiny. I finally get us to the point of discovery!! Now we just have to get back...\n\nQuick after thought ideas:\n\n\*expeditions can have 1 or 2 ships, depending on the amount of money thrown in by the captain and officers.\n\n\*you can revive downed people, so people wouldn't just spam kill captains or others for fun without the chance of being killed off themselves for good.\n\n\*people have to maintain the ship throughout the journey, and they can load supplies into backpacks and lifeboats in case the main ship is wrecked, or trapped and they need to travel across land.\n\n\* if ship/s are destroyed, the crew can send a couple players to a designated outpost and request rescue ships.\n\n\*players are able to use wildlife to survive, but the arctic is appealing, because that makes it sparse during the winter months.\n\n\*seasons should come and go quickly, so that way it gives the crew a little bit of time to gather supplies and hunt before the winter ice comes...\n\n\*If you want to converse more about this and believe this is actually achievable to make, don't hesitate to message me."

96gegv,A 4vs1 multiplayer survival horror game in a spaceship,"I just found this subreddit and I thought that I'd give it a go. In this game, 4 players have to work together to escape a spaceship while being terrorized by another player posing as the ship's rogue AI. If you're familiar with Dead by Daylight, it will be a mix of that  and Space Station 13. Oh, and I haven't given it much thought but I imagine that the game will be in 2d.\n\nThe objective of the game for the 'human' players are to run around overriding locks located in different sectors of the ship and finally making their way to the escape pods. Meanwhile, the 'AI' player's objective is to weaken and kill the other players by using the ships features, however, they are only visible to the 'AI' if they are around a security camera.\n\nThe human players can pick classes for themselves such as,\n1. Engineer- The only class that can override locks and is crucial for escaping\n2. Medic- Able to heal but not ressurect allies\n3. Captain- A support class, able to motivate an ally to speed up their actions\n\nEdit: Formatting"
96fu6i,Making new games?,"I'm a 41 year old whose been playing games for 35 years. I think I've seen pretty much everything by now, and am having a hard time keeping any interest in new games. I tend to purchase something on steam, play for an hour or two, until I see the core mechanics or plot line, and then I've basically seen it all already. There's only grind left and I lose interest and never play it again.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\nI've a lot of programming experience, and have been messing around in Unity for a while now, and feel ready to take on an ambitious hobby project, but I can't get the motivation or enthusiasm to sink all my free time for a year into developing what I consider a boring, unoriginal game. So I'm constantly trying to think up ideas for unusual games and unexplored areas, mostly around simulation, management, and science or engineering inspired stuff, but my ideas generally don't turn out to be so cool as they get realised. I'm also extremely bored of shooting and killing things, but don't know how to successfully design without those elements. I'd like to replace action and shooting with deep, complex learning and mastery over systems, like you get in flight sims and KSP, but I don't really know where to take it in a new direction.\n\nIt also seems like most existing games have taken all the low-hanging fruit, so if you are looking at making something unique, it'll require some brutally hard implementation, like how KSP took on orbital mechanics and gigantic planetary surfaces.\n\nNo real question here, just looking for maybe suggestions on how to proceed. I'd like a solid hobby game idea to work on for the next year or so, but have no idea how to make an entertaining, new game. Prototyping unique and complex, systems-based games is hard, and from the few trials I've done, my interesting initial ideas don't seem to survive the implementation.  I don't have a shortage of ideas, but they generally either don't turn out to be fun, or they are too complex for a single developer. Any suggestions?"

96eunb,Colonize! A game idea that centralizes around the idea of colonization of the Americas.,"I've been reading about the troubles and deaths that were caused by the many failing attempts at creating a successful colony in the New World during the 16th to 17th century. A cool game idea would be a simulation (similar to Cities Skylines) where a player lands in an area (the coast of the Atlantic Ocean) with a small group of settlers and has to lead the settlers in creating a successful colony. During the process, the player would run through many troubles actual colonists ran through back in history. Ex: Attacks from nearby Indian tribes, disease, shortage of food, mutiny, etc. While the concept is similar to a game such as Cities Skylines, this game would be extremely realistic and be almost a survival game. In the end, the player is able to successfully create a colony and then starts to develop new colonies in the south or north where features such as trading could come into place."

It's almost like you're swimming in the ground. If you break through the surface at high speed, you'll arc far through the air without control until you fall back down into the ground again.\n\nThe catch is that most of the landmasses are discontiguous; meaning that you'll have to launch from one floating landmass to another. Some gaps are big, so you'll have to pick up enough speed to make it across.\n\nSome landmasses are small, narrow, winding, hazardous or otherwise difficult to pick up speed on. Finding ways to pick up and maintain momentum becomes part of the challenge. In fact, maintaining momentum and ""flow"" is the core engagement, especially when areas become hectic.\n\nLike traditional platformers, there are still enemies, hazards and bosses to deal with. Some bosses fight you in the ground, others you'll have to jump to attack above the surface, and some boss will have a mixture of both."

98xqne,RTS on floating islands,"Hi! I'm not going to make that game myself any time soon (still sucks at coding) so might share that as well.\n\nSo basically it is about people who were casted away from Earth's surface by AI because humans are dangerous to planet (who saw that coming, huh) and they are living on islands suspended in the air by powerful engines powered by solar panels. They splitted to factions depending on how they want to solve their current situation. One wants to gather many islands above AI mainframe and bombard it, second wants to just live in skies and third, weakest one, wants to try to negotiate. The campaigns for two first should be available from the start, third after beating them as hardest challenge.\n\nSo how should that work? In each scenario you start with single island with town centre. Each island is going to have weight capacity, so you can't carelessly build on them as you please. When you have enough resources you can ""fish"" for more - drop hook on ground to pick up new island. When you pick it up, you mount thruster on it so it can fly now. Each have random resources on it. Maybe you can decide what kind of resources you want with technology progression. Then you can take resources from island, build on it, connect with other islands you own, or in desperate times use as weapon against enemy - just propel it in right direction. To balance it propellers/thrusters should be expensive. Oh, and intensive ""fishing"" can attract attention of AI, so be careful.\n\nI think that kind of dynamic play could be quite interesting. I hope I explained it in correct manner as English is not my native language and I could mess up somewhere. What do you think about that?"
98ufks,"A Co-Op game where the two players are never together, until the end of the game, but they need to use walkie talkies to communicate to complete their objective.","So for example, player two is on his objective, he just killed a bunch of terrorists, he finds the main headquarters of the enemy hideout, He then finds a bomb defusual guide. Player one, has found an active bomb in the middle of the city, player two needs to tell player one how to defuse the bomb, they both need to use clues to communicate and find out what's going on throughout the game, without actually being together in the same area until they meet up, so player one will never see what player two sees and vice versa, both the players just have to use their voice.\n\nThis will be the main focus of the gameplay throughout the story, there's tons of stuff that can be used for this concept, one player has to find information to help out the other player, maybe there's a scene where player one has to interrogate a terrorist, and player two has to confirm if that information is true.\n\nI can't get many ideas come to my mind, but think about all the possibilities for situations the players could be in, ways where they would have to communicate to complete the objective. the possibilities are endless, there could be so many situations where your friend will have to give you some information for where you are or what you're doing, and vice versa, then at the end of the game on the final mission, both you and the other player are pushing into a big city tower, where the main villain is hiding, pushing it from both sides, then you both meet up, and you and your friend have a glorious epic shootout together against all the main villain's goons, so after hours of being seperated, and using voice to communicate, you're now both together again, and ready to finish the game, what's great about this is you can play it twice and have a new experience, so the game will have two different experiences."

At first I even had few friends helping out with art &amp; testing, we were pretty much a ""thriving"" hobby team for some time.\n\n**Long post ahead, I guess, I'll try to include TL;DR at bottom**\n\nAt first we started working on battle royale gamemode (so, battle royale in 2D) out of my very old 2D shooter prototype I had laying around, early in development I realized it would copy surviv.io too much (another 2D battle royale game, even though my games art and mechanics are very different, I still didn't want to compete with that game)\n\nThen I steered more in the way of being a generic shooter, except in 2D, you know, TDM, FFA, CTF. And that's what most of my development time has been focused on. I was implementing generic features a shooter would have, on top of my other features: killfeed, player K/D list, all that basic stuff. My final plan would be having ""ultimate"" 2D multiplayer shooter with multiple game modes in a rotation.\n\nFast forward to last few weeks, development has been going slow, I've completely ran out of motivation and I constantly feel like ""huh, I wish I could dump this game and work on some other game ideas I have"" but that's not really something I wanna do because I've been in game development for some time now and after dumping so much personal projects, I don't want to do same with this one.\n\nI feel like I don't have a clear plan and direction of where I want to take my game.\n\n**Cool story bro, so what's the solution you're seeking?**\n\nI love Reddit community and I feel like I have chance of getting good advice and fresh ideas for my game in which direction I can take it in, more specifically, I will make sure to post some gifs from my game in here to give you all idea of how my game runs, and I would like criticism and ideas on how to make game fun and what to implement, more specifically what kind of gamemode to focus on for the game. (so I feel like being a generic shooter is not something I want, I want something special for the game, if anyone has any cool ideas, I'd love to hear it)\n\nSo first off, here's very rough feature list of my game, that I already have:\n\n* Easily customizable weapon system with different weapons implemented such as rifles, pistols, rocket launchers. With weapon addons/mods in plans (scopes for increased visibility, etc)\n* ""Scoping"" ability, extending range of vision in direction of aim, different for each weapon, will be much more for scoped weapons such as snipers.\n* Dynamic clothing system, all clothing goes on top of character and can be swapped around. (hence the weird artstyle which wasn't probably worth the sacrifice now that I think about it)\n* Working networking, player name choosing on enter, kill feeds, K/D panel.\n* Weapon spawning system, weapon dropping system.\n* Lots of random bugs that I hope to address soon.\n\nGifs to show actual gameplay (All of these gifs are from old versions of the game, because that's where live playtests were done with my friends, and they look much cooler than just me walking around the map):\n\n[Running into building to shoot enemy[(https://i.gyazo.com/7633777ccf7f04ec5620c51906b3d6d4.mp4)\n\n[Another really old playtest, lots of blood](https://twitter.com/i/status/1013139764877365251)\n\nAnyways, I think that's it for describing how the project looks like as it is.\n\nSo what I am looking for is, I want ideas on what kind of gamemode(s) (and features) to add to a game such as this so it would get interesting, also, I don't want to work on something very complex, so I hope the ideas will be mostly simplistic. Also there is a fact to consider that its hard to be a multiplayer indie game, since getting player base will be hard. So something that could be directly played with friends in co-op environment or anything like that would be big plus.\n\nI have few ideas of my own, but I am unsure about them (Gang wars - city based map with different teams earning money by capturing zones for their team and getting better weapons by that, prison break - 2 teams, 1 team are prison guards making sure to contain opposite team, and other team are trying to escape, maybe even something like in senses of escapists the game, but online), do tell me if any of these ideas sound good.\n\nAnyways, it'd be greatly appreciated if anyone has any ideas that could fit my game and make it interesting. The base mechanics of the shooter that I have feel pretty fun but I feel like standard FFA gamemode or something would be way too raw, I need something special, something more fun.\n\n**TL;DR - I developed a prototype of a 2D multiplayer top-down shooter game, but I am looking for some kind of special fun ""gamemode""/scenario/game setting to specialize in and explore it, rather than doing standard FFA or TDM. Feel free to check out gifs and current feature list I included above.**\n\nWelp, this was a huge post, thank you very much for reading!\n\n"
98tzot,Star Wars - Your Way | !!! Lot of good features !!! |," **Star Wars - Your Way**   \n\n\n**Age:**  Rise of the Empire era\n\n**Art Style:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeiXC1Y0u7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeiXC1Y0u7g)\n\n**Tags:** Open World, RPG, Multiplayer.   ( Open Word like No Man's Sky  ) \n\n**Graphics &amp; Gameplay:** Like in Visceral Games's Star Wars game. So the graphic and the game style please do it like that. \n\n**Character:** You can custumize it the way you want. You can make your character 6 species maybe. \n\n**Start:** In the begining you will start without being in a Faction, so you will be a villager and then you can choose factions after. Basicly, you will start on a planet where you have to do the short tutorial and when you did it you can play multiplayer with your friends. \n\n**Planets:** You should make planets that are large. So player can going around it for hours. But if you want to travel fast you can use your own speeder or taxi. \n\n**Multiplayer:** If you did the tutorial then you can play with your friends. I think the best way to make is to make Sessions like in No Man's Sky where friends can join and do they own missions or help with yours. \n\n**Factions:** Pirates/Smugglers ↔ Rebels ↔ Imperials ↔ Pirat./Smug. \n\n**Joining Factions?!:** Yes, I think the best thing that you have to do is the Faction System. You can choose to be Pirate/Smuggler, Rebel, Imperial. After you chose it you can do their jobs. That I will introdunce downer. \n\n***-Smuggler/Pirate*** If you are want to be a Smuggler/Pirate then you have to speak with people in the bars on planets and collect a crew to your ship. After that you can start Smuggling goods from planets. ( like Drogs ) Or you can defeat other pirates or raid their planetary bases and then steal their goods. \n\n***-Rebel*** You can join them by speaking with the leader on a planet which is under Rebel Controll and after you did this he/she will give you missions and if you do some of them they will allow you to join. Then you can Attack Imperial Bases arround the Galaxy and do Starfights and etc... \n\n***-Imperial*** You can join them by speaking with the leader on a planet which is under Imperial Controll and after you did this he/she will give you missions and if you do some of them they will allow you to join. Then you can Attack Rebel Bases arround the Galaxy and do Starfights and etc...   \n\n\n**Activities** \n\n***-Farm:*** You can buy a farm and grow plants on it and you can buy animals that you can breed with each other and then you can harvest them and sell it. \n\n***-Gambling:*** There will be bars in the cities where you can play „Holochess” with your friends and with the AI. \n\n**Vehicles** In the begining you will have a speeder bike in your low class house's garage and you can drive with it. If you want you can buy another or upgrade it if you want. Spawning Vehicles: I think the best thing is to spawn it with an animation that takes 2 minutes and your vehicle will spawn nearby your character. Upgrading: There will be some workshops in the planets for vehicles where you can tunning them by placing symbols, paint, speeding up or placing lasergun in the front of the vehicle etc.. \n\n**Your Ship**  You will get your ship by ending your tutorial and after you did it you can get a crew on your ship and you can do adventures with them. \n\n**Taxi** That is a good thing to travel long distances for cheap and for safe. You can travel with an automated taxi to the other cities of the planet. \n\n**Wanted?!** If you kill civillians of kill the guards of the cities than you will become wanted.   ( so if you break the law ) Shaking of the law: You can hide in bars, houses or in alleys. Or just simply go faster and go high places. Stealth: That is an option to kill someone without alerting the law like in Assassin's Creed. If you stealth kill the guard/citizen then they don't attack you immediately. If they discover the dead body than they will start searching nearby. You can grab the corpses so you can take them far from the people. \n\n**Events** ***Weather:*** There should be extreme weathers on some planets like Sandstorm on Tatooine or Blizzard on Hoth etc.. These things  should be affect you movement speed.   \n\n\n***Abandoned Buildings:*** You can find abandoned places where you can loot goods or ruins. You can find papers with informations about the univers or something like that.   \n\n\n**House** You can buy new houses by exchanging your own or buying them without exchange. There will be limits how many houses can you have on one planet.   \n\n\nThat's All for now thank you for reading! :) By: Erdélyi Ákos – Hungary ( Gamer Name: Brutal Soldier ) "
98t086,Imagine a simulation where you're the Queen Ant and you have you manage your tribe of ants,"You need to assign your ants to different jobs (exploration of the surroundings, gathering of food, construction of the nest...) a bit like real-life ants. \n\nI don't know anything about ants but it would be cool to have the help of an expert about different species so you could choose your species when you start.\n\nThen you have to defend your nest against humans and other ants species. Your population grows super fast but a lot of them dies while working.\n\nAnt Simulator"
98om35,Whimsical Magical shit like the Avatar movie,"Basically I've always really wanted a game with beautiful graphics in which I can transform from a human (optional gender) to a wolf, fox, and big cats. Just an open world game with amazing colors, plants, creatures. Maybe there's a small kingdom in a magical forest with purple and green glowing trees, and you can help village people or even work your way up to be the king/Queens best friend or protector. Idk I like pretty things and being able to become and animal. But it would be a very big game because there would have to be options for colors of each transformation at the beginning, lots of different clothes to aquire. Houses to buy or build yourself, farming, hunting, crafting. Everything. I would love it so much. And the sky at night would have like huge planets that you could see because they're super close and like galaxies and stuff. Ugh! Kill me this game will never exist!"

98bd60,A game with actual stakes.,"A game basically like gambling, but involving skill. A game where you put real money into your in game wallet and then your dropped into an open world map where you can use that money to buy and sell things and complete quests for additional gold. You would lose all your gold if you died. Whenever you want, you can withdraw that money back into your paypal account whether it be higher or lower than the amount you started with. You would obviously have to make it so its easier to lose money than gain it or the company would go bankrupt.\n\nThis way, the game would feel like it actually mattered what happens. Just an idea."
98b9wh,Game that fucks with the players computer.,"For example:\n- A grenade that makes your fps drop to 20 when you get hit\n- A gun that makes your sound fluctuate up and down when you get hit.\n- A gun that makes you hear fake sounds (eg footsteps when theres nobody around) when you get hit.\n- A grenade that shuts down your computer when you get hit.\n\nDont know if any of this is feasible, just throwing it out there."
98ahjc,Arena Fighting Game,"This pains me so much to post this here, as I've attempted to create this game numerous times on different platforms but failed due to my lack of skill.  I will separate the features into categories. **\*This is my first post on here, haven't read the others so sorry if this is too ambitious or if I'm supposed to be a bit less specific.\***\n\n**1 - Armory**\n\nOn the menu I envision, there would be four buttons. One being *Servers*, another being *Armory*, and *Settings,* and last but not least, *Quit.* Armory, when clicked, will bring up another screen that has a table.\n\n|I'm not the best at exlaining,|so here is this|table to describe what I mean|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|but instead of text,|it'll be pictures of weapons that you use|and the ones that aren't unlocked will have locks on them and won't show the weapon.|\n\nThe menu would be dark grey, and the buttons a slightly lighter gradient of grey. In big, white, bold letters at the top, the words ""Armory"". This next part is the weapons I've already had in mind for the starting Rank 1 Weapons. When I say make the damage whatever you'd like, please keep in mind that this is the starter weapons, and what I envision is A LOT of weapons to make the game fun and wacky.\n\n**- A Baseball Bat, LMB is a fast swing that deals 7 - 10 DMG. RMB is the player tossing a baseball into the air, and then hitting it with the bat for a ranged attack. Keep in mind this is what I'm not making, change to your liking.**\n\n**- Glass Bottle, a long green bottle that with LMB hits side-to-side. A very low chance of stunning an enemy, and damage is whatever you'd like.  RMB must be held for two seconds and will have the player slam the bottle onto the ground below him and will turn the bottle into a Broken Glass Bottle, which will swing much faster with LMB and instead of a very low chance of stunning, it'll be a very low chance of bleed effect. RMB will now stab forward with small reach, which will do the same amount of randomized damage as LMB, but will have a bigger chance of bleed effect.**\n\n**- Quiver, which instead of storing arrows, now stores rocks and pebbles to throw at enemies. LMB will toss a rock, dealing whatever damage you'd like. High chance of pulling out a small pebble which fires fast but deals 3 DMG, and a low chance of pulling out a large rock which will toss slowly and a medium range, but will deal 12 DMG.**\n\nA few more less-detailed weapons I'd like to add is a ghost in armour you can summon to fight for you, a reference to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, LMB being a hard hitting punch that knocks enemies back a bit, and deals around 20 DMG but with a fair cooldown. RMB a barrage of punches that last for about a second and deals a good bit of damage, but can be avoided and will not trap players in place. This would be somewhere unlocked at around Rank 40. One more that I think would be hilarious which would be unlocked at Rank 15 or somewhere around there is One Punch Man's Glove, which, can only attack with LMB, and only one time. It'll one shot anything in a medium ranged cone infront of the player, but then afterwards the glove completely dissapears from the characters attire and a crudely drawn smiley face would be present on the characters face instead of the usual blank face. Now, instead of walking, the character would be skipping around the map, waiting to be killed so they can respawn as a different class or the same.\n\n**2 - Character Appearance**\n\nSearch up ""Unreal Engine 4 Default Character"" and go to images. Something like that would be perfect for the game as opposed to a highly detailed character since the animations and weaponry would be silly and over the top which would not fit at all with a detailed character.  When using weaponry, it should of course appear on the character. \n\n**3 - Online Multiplayer**\n\nNo idea how to enable online multiplayer in games but you do that yourself.\n\n**4 - Maps**\n\nOne which I think would be nice and fit with the characters appearance would be a plain white floor that's pretty large but doesn't take even a minute to get to the opposite side, with slim rectangles  that vary in length but remain the same in width as the maps borders. Keep everything white like the character model. (With gray or orange outline if it turns out visually depressing.)  Another map idea would be a gigantic front yard with checkered grass tiles that are green and dark earthy green, and a white picket fence on one side. Transparent walls of course to keep the players from falling out of the map.\n\n**5 - Quit Button**\n\nPretty self-explanatory.\n\n**6 - Rank System**\n\nA level up system that unlocks a few new weapons, or a single weapon, or maybe just two, or maybe even nothing. You can do it how you please, but I think a balanced level up system and weapon gain frequency would be ;\n\nLevel 1 - 0 XP (Starting)                                         1 Kill = 25 XP            1 Win (most kills) = 100 XP\n\nLevel 2 - 100 XP (Two new weapons)\n\nLevel 3 - 250 XP (No new weapons)\n\nLevel 4 - 650 XP (One new weapons)\n\nLevel 5 - 1150 XP (Two new weapons) \n\nect, ect.\n\nNot sure how to explain this rate of gaining XP, but I like it.\n\n**7 - Servers**\n\nOnce clicked will bring up a list of all servers with players in it that list the map and how many players are in said server, and at the bottom of the screen would be a button that lets you quickmatch.\n\nI'm very tired and so have probably put in a bunch of inconsistencies and spelling errors and things that just don't make sense or are unbalanced, but I'm going to hit the sack. If no one picks this project up, I might start trying to do it myself again. Probably won't succeed though. Anyways, hopefully this idea peaked at least someones interest. Everything listed is up to the future developers mercy, it can be changed completely or modified a slight bit. \n\n**\*One more thing I forgot to include is the player's username so it can be displayed in the leaderbaord and above players heads in game, and another thing; Respawn time should be about ten seconds or so, and when dead you can spectate or change class. No auto respawning so everyone takes their time if they want to select another class. Auto kick people if it's been past a two minutes and they haven't respawned yet. Fifteen minute matches or so.\***"
98a9c5,Cosmic Bounty : Border Officer,"Set in the Red Nemo galaxy of Cosmic Bounty (another one of my projects).\n\nHowever, instead of playing as a badass bounty hunter, the player takes the role of a space border officer. The player has the choice of working on any of the planet's in the Red Nemo galaxy.\n\nThe player must choose who to let onto the planet's surface, possible passengers include:\n\n- Civilians\n- Workers\n- Drug dealers\n- Refugees\n- Monks\n- Bounty hunters\n- Faction members (The Counsel, Blacklist etc)\n- And more\n\nHowever, depending on the player's choices, this will determine the player character's career in the border office. If the player rises through their original jobs rank, the player can have the choice to transfer to another planet's department.

987837,Racing game but the cars have spherical wheels,"Similarly to the [I, Robot Audi](https://www.carblog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Audi-I-Robot-Will-Smith.jpg), the cars would have spherical wheels, allowing them to drive sideways, spin, change lanes with absolute ease and more.\n\nI'm gonna combine this idea with another I had in a dream when I was about 10 - cars racing in giant tubes made of colored glass (pinkish orange in the dream) standing high above ground on tall pillars. That way, they would be able to drive on the walls and even on the ceiling."

982d3w,Apocalypse with gods,"So, my idea is that the game would be heavily story-based. The plot is that the Biblical apocalypse in Revelation has come, and the old pagan gods of Greece, Egypt, and Scandinavia have decided to protect humanity. The game is split into three narratives that happen simultaneously, and eventually converge. There's the Egyptian story, the Greek story, and the Scandinavian story. You play as different gods fighting against angels and other forces of heaven, fighting your way to eventually face off against the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The gameplay would be hack and slash, similar to the Dynasty Warriors series, to give off the vibe of fighting against overwhelming odds. Different cosmetics and upgrades could be unlocked through quests or through level progression. Individual pieces of armor could be switched out, but weapons could only be upgraded (since certain gods have very specific weapons that can't be switched, like Mjolnir). You would start with three gods from each pantheon, but you could eventually unlock more over time. The starting gods would be Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Odin, Loki, Thor, Ra, Anubis, and Set. Maybe if it were on PlayStation, Kratos could be a console-exclusive character in the post-game."

982bae,MULTIPLAYER VR MINIGAMES (LONG POST),(Sorry for my bad english)  so my idea was basically vr minigames that you  are competing against 5-7 players for crowns \nSo i had an idea for an archery minigame that had monsters that you had to shoot to get points there would be faster monsters that had more points and there would be humans that if you shoot at them they would give you minus points so  at the end  of the minigame you would get a crown of course there would be more minigames (please comment for mingame ideas) so in a game there would be 5 diffrent minigames at the end the player who has the most crowns wins (by the way the game  would be in theatre so when a match finishes the red blinds would close and a cheer sound affect whould play)
97yy93,"A rogue-like game with RPG elements, Cowboy Bebop meets Blade","I think this would do excellent on the Switch or PS4.\n\nBlacksport is a 2.5D venture where you'd ideally step into the combat boots of Mark Conway, a space bounty hunter who specializes in killing intelligent parasites under the working name Okulai. They pose a threat to universal peace, and Conway is one of the few who recognizes it. The plot involves him uncovering a plot by the creatures to assimilate ( kill and possess ) the human inhabitants of a lunar colony, and he's pissed that some of the Okulai are somehow disguised as Earth government politicians. \n\nThe game is rogue-like and a top down shooter, though there's a bit of melee and powers thrown in. The only thing that can kill Okulai is acid like polonium or gold metal, so it's up to you to choose how much of the resources to rack in. There's venders you can go to using currency called Slims, and depending on what you say to them there's a chance the shopkeepers will not sell to you. That's part of the challenge, since you'll need ample gold weapons and bullets to kill the monsters ( they're in part inspired by the Flood from Halo, but not as disturbing ).\n\nYou can also converse with key people and have followers a la Skyrim, though the rogue-like style makes it different from having to look back every five seconds to see they're there. Most of them are fellow Filters ( name for Okulai hunters ), and they have more fleshed out backstories. Also they can die but but unlike Fallout 3 they can be leveled up through certain actions from you as Conway, thus gaining more health and Immunity as you do. Only difference is you level up automatically starting from 1 but your followers have stronger level caps, like one starts with level 20 when you meet them for example. \n\nThere's also a galactic map you can access and go to different planet settings from. Each planet or space station infested with Okulai have sub sections, and the space station clean-outs typically end with you having to escape before it explodes. And in rooting with Conway hunting space pests for profit, he can earn Slims from groups who believe the Okulai are real. But there's actually multiple other ways to get cash.\n\nOh, and going back to the followers one of them is a genetically engineered human dude with gold coated bones. Nuff said.\n\nFeedback is welcome. I honestly don't think this would be like ""the others."""
97xtix,an adventure game based on the old table top rpg: bunnies and burrows.,"bunnies and burrows was a old gurps game I found out about recently i am starting to like.  you play bunnies in an urban gardens and forests  going on adventures. you would met other friendly animals like squirrels, pigeons and deer, but you could also find many other unfriendly creatures that you must fight like crows, badgers, and foxes. A small cute bunny in a giant and magic but also dark and spooky world would be great for a game. I feel this would be great fro a survival rpg. (cross between don't starve and undertale.) I left a link to a basic summary and the guide book at the bottom.  \n\nguide book: [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BunniesAndBurrows](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BunniesAndBurrows)\n\nbasic summary: [https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1367/58/1367589918750.pdf](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1367/58/1367589918750.pdf)"

97pptf,FPS Adventure Psychological game with a Time Stopping feature. Not what is sounds like!,"So you read the title and don't get me wrong here, this isn't some generic adventure game with insanely bad storylines where you run around and gun people down. You play as the member as a swat team and throughout the game you go to different emergencies. You appear in the truck headed to the incident and just when you break down the door or go through the window or wall or whatever, time stops. Time doesn't stop to give you time to pick your action and which guy to shoot though.\n\nTime stops and your character begins reflecting, he reminisces about his life, thinks about life itself and it's very existence, why he is where he is and about the guys he's there with. He thinks about why he does what he does and why he shouldn't. He starts disliking his job and then when time starts again. You shoot and rescue the hostage or whatever for a brief 30-60 sec.\n\nThe more time goes on the more deep you get into your thoughts and the guys you're there with sometimes die because of someone else's calls. You read something in the newspaper about crime rate being higher than ever before and how bad the world in general is looking right before you were called into an emergency. Your character becomes more and more driven into a depression and in the final mission you sacrifice yourself to save one of your teammates because you're fed up with the selfish world you're in. At least one final act of yours was a good one and possibly you can be remembered for it and affect some people.\n\nI'm thinking it might be a 2D game or a 3D game with manageable graphics. Not sure if this is a good idea though to be honest. Would love some evaluations!"

9aslwk,Berlin Wall game,"I thought of a good storyline for a game .Ok its  Berlin in the mid 70s, and you were separated from your family and you have to try to cross into west germany to get to your family. And it  could be a free roam open world game, where you have to plan how to escape and you could have many options like making a tunnel under the wall , go in guns blazing across the border, or sneakily get through the border which would be the most difficult. And if you get caught or killed you have to start again form the beginning and you would be a different person. In my opinion i think this would be a great game."
9apf10,A game based on the occult and medieval black magic.,"Many games with magic systems depict a very fantastical view of magic. Their abilities are arbitrarily chosen and mastered with ease without any reference to study or secret societies. Lore in games like the elder scrolls talk about secret societies and rituals, like necromancy or daedra worship, but you never actually get the opportunity to engage in these rituals, or open portals/summon demons yourself. \n\nThese games are fun, but totally fictional. And although yes, while magic isn't real, many societies in history have built lifestyles around these belief systems which to me represent an untapped repertoire of lore that we don't often see in video games. \n\nFor example, in the middle ages we saw an explosion of literature relating to Solomon and the evocation of demons. Although many of these works were likely fabricated more recently than they claimed, they also reflect a cultural movement at the time toward the pursuit hidden knowledge and the occult. In fact, these trends happen periodically throughout history, like the rise of hermeticism or kaballah respectively. \n\nHermeticism, Kaballah, Humorism, Medieval Alchemy, Solomonic magic, the Eleusinian Mysteries and even the practices of the ancient Egyptians or Babylonians were once widespread belief systems that centered around magical concepts that continued to develop into subcultures despite overbearing pressure from competing belief systems. \n\nBut what if there was an open world simulator where instead of casting fire spells, the magic system was instead based on these complex practices throughout history, and you'd have to become familiar with real occult works, like the Abramelin, the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum or even cuniform? Draw complex magic circles and cite lengthy evocations in order to conjure spirits that do you're biding. Spirits with AI and voice recognition software, which you would speak verbally to about your will but are also subject to ""interpretation"" by the spirit depending on their disposition. \n\nYou could even join the church and excise demons, but the church would be an antagonistic organization dictated by an authoritarian god desperately trying to usurp the old gods from which he was once kin. The baseline mythology would be babylonian or sumerian, due to the similarities between these and the anatolian, hurrian, akkadian and greek belief systems, from which even many solomonic demons were derived millennia later. And from which the Abrahamic religions are ultimately derived. Angels, Heaven, even Genesis all come from the Babylonian religion. And its no coincidence that the sudden appearance of the Israelite god Yah following the Babylonian Captivity coincides with a city whose primary deity at the time was Ea. The phonological and geographical similarities are uncanny, and the difference in spelling is likely a result of translating these terms from cuniform into hebrew script. This game would not only be a journey into the history of the occult but also journey into the roots in ancient religion and preislamic lore and how many of these concepts inevitably changed over time the more taboo they became. Like lilin, the root for lilith, which actually means water spirit and are depicted in sumerian myths as being loosely connected to Inanna or Ishtar, the goddess of love. Who is also depicted in the Lesser Key of Solomon as the demon Astaroth. \n\nAnd while on the surface it would appear that you're just summoning spirits to perform mischief for you, the more you research into the history of it, the more you're drawn into this ancient Sumerian cosmogony depicting an active struggle for control by the gods, with humanity caught in the middle. \n\nUltimately I'd like the root of this cosmogony to depict the proto-Indo European cosmogony, but there's only so much you can reconstruct, and I think it would be cool if a game like this focused on historical sources and literature.

9any0x,An RPG typing game,"So the type of typing game I am imagining is one like [this one](https://zty.pe/). Basically, on some objects there is a word written, and you have to keep the object from getting somewhere (in this case at the bottom of the screen) by typing the word written on them thus destroying the objects.\n\nOne flaw this kind of game has is that it has a fixed difficulty. It will always be too easy or too hard for someone. So what I was thinking was mixing typing games with a bit of RPG - only the leveling and getting experience part.\n\nWhen you first start the game you will be asked to test your typing speed to give you a starting level (x out of 100, maybe). That level will determine the difficulty of the game (the speed of the objects, how many objects spawn, the average length of their word). And, for every game played you will get experience, thus leveling up, and making the game a bit harder.\n\nNow I don't think this type of game is really hard to make. I actually made a typing game for Ludum Dare 42 (competition where you make a game in 48/72 hours), you can check it out [here](https://luca1152.itch.io/crate-typist) if you are curious, it is a pretty minimal game. That's how I got the idea, because I had to choose a fixed difficulty for my game and had complaints that the game was too easy, too hard, or just perfect. \n\nThe reason I am posting the idea here is that I find it very hard to get the difficulty based on the level just right, and someone (not necessarily a team) here may have the skills to do it :)."

9alejv,Concept: SciFi Sandbox RPG [Generation Star Ship],"So, this has been an idea that I have had for a while that I would never get around to personally, and I hope this inspires one of you out there to try and run with it... enjoy!\n\n​\n\n**OVERVIEW**\n\n​One of the most realistic ways humanity will travers the stars is on a Generational Starship, or a ship designed to house several generations of human beings and send them to a star system many light-years away. The game would be a casual gaming experience exploring the life on the ship and finding purpose for those interim generations that will be born, grow old and die while enroute to their final destination. Basic mechanics of life can be maintained, such as gravity with a concept called a O'Neill Cylinder in a ship almost a kilometer in diameter. This will create the large ""endless linked world"" that is common with games like Civilization where there is a North and South limit but East and West run in a continuous loop. This world can be further expanded into different levels (like an underwater storage area, industrial level, forest/farm lever for food, ect.) that can give a sense of vastness without overwhelming a designer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NPC CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT**\n\nOne of the core mechanics of a sandbox is interactions with players and NPCs. Although I would envision a world with about 100-1000 procedurally created characters like those created in The Guild 2, but with wider interactions like the ""four choice dialogue"" popularized by Mass Effect. NPC personalities (with the possible exception of core characters like a ships captain) would be based on the 5x5 alignment charts, giving a unique feel to individual integrations while encouraging shifting allegiances (lawful good and lawful evil team up to bring a criminal to justice, or rebel good and social good work to stop a eugenics scientist testing on people under the protection of ship staff, ect.). This would also enable for a more fluid text-based dialogue between players and NPCs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE ECONOMY** \n\nOne thing that would be needed to make the game make sense is an active economy of recycled goods and foods. Money, or credits, would be based on simple food as a base unit (1 meal bar = 1 credit). People work on the ship so they can eat, with more work worth more food, or better food. Better living conditions can also be bought with credits, and credits can be earned by providing services (running errands, doing ""quests"") or producing a product (farming, crafting, ect.). The economy would be self sustaining, like in the Guild 2, but would be less in scope in that one player isn't controlling everything from production to people movements. Something automated, like the productive enterprises in Mount and Blade, with an option to directly control one business at a time. Trade would also be key, with small ""village"" districts divided by parks or artificial garden forests to create an artificial divide and drive trade, while supporting group rivalries and tribal mentalities needed to inject purpose and conflict into humanity and give them a reason to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOVERMENT/PUBLIC ORDER**\n\nWhat society would be complete without organization? I would create the Captain, protected by Marines, as a kind of King of the Realm and his knights; there to keep order and... not much else. The real power would be in the elected officials like Mayors, Sheriffs, Treasurers, and Councilors. Local Towns have their own offices with elections that a player can run for and who, if an NPC is in office, acts in accordance with their alignment (A chaotic good Sheriff may attack a lawful evil NPC or player that is trying to seize people's homes or create suffering). This would create competition between NPCs and players for positions that better suite them. Elections can also be manipulated with hacking, which may be an interesting social dynamic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONFLICT AND COMBAT**\n\nWhat sandbox is complete without the ability to kill something and deal with the consequences? I would say that the game's combat be based heavily on melee and CQC style, as guns in space are bad, m'kay. Bows may be an alternative, with guns being the Marine's ultimate ""broke overpowered"" weapons. Fights could also be limited to one-on-one, or have a team-style combat like taking territory in Saints Row or Mount and Blade. A possible mechanic could be that the Captain died, Marines are just kind of there to keep the peace, and battles are waged between factions to see who the new captain would be, Three Kingdoms style. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's about it. Like I said: this is just an idea, and if someone makes a game of sandbox sci-fi on a generation ship, I would be happy. I hope this powers some idea light bulbs and if someone takes this, just let me know what the name of the game is. I would love to alpha or beta test it out for you! Good luck, and keep dreaming folks!"

9ahue4,Two Cryptids/Creatures I would put in an open world RPG.,"I have an idea for an open world RPG that is a hybrid between Sci-Fi and Fantasy (like the Draconic Evolution mod for Minecraft). I have thought of two real world Cryptids and Mystical Creatures to add in to the setting as both wild animals and tamable beings.\n\n**Fresno Nightcrawler:**\n\nIn terms of wild behavior, nightcrawlers would be passive and easy to tame. Though they won't have any combat capabilities, they would have excellent speed and can carry a lot of inventory which would make them great pack mules. Along side this, most caravans would have a tamed nightcrawler to carry goods. They would spawn in forest areas and would be more common to spot at night. Hunting them would require long ranged attacks due to their incredible speed.\n\n**The Rake:**\n\nFrom passive to aggressive, Rakes would also appear in forest areas and would be most common at night. They would be highly aggressive and could easily take down lower leveled players. They would also be able to drain the target's energy/mana. They would behave similar to the cannibals from The Forest and would make use of unpredictable and agility based tactics. If tamed, Rakes would act as a powerful companion in combat.\n\nWhat creatures would you add to the list? Let me know!"

9a1mg9,[VR] someone should make a D. Va shooter sandbox using her mech model,
9a1aq8,A deep-sea habitat life sim,"I may or may not have taken some inspiration from Peter Watts for the setting. The game should:\n\n- Take place in an enclosed map with a bunch of different rooms\n\n- Throw the player character into that place with ~10 randomized, detailed NPCs with their own traits and possibly stats that determine how they interact with you and others \n\n- Should allow for different playstyles and player customization\n\n- There should be common goals that can be pursued together. For example, convince apt NPCs to do maintenance, mining, energy generation, whatever fits the exact setting. Others might try to convince you to do certain things, helpful or possibly harmful.\n\n- There should be individual goals. For example, I don't know, stealing from others or doing a research project while you are there, or getting certain stats for a promotion. Something like that.\n\n- The goals don't necessarily mean a win- or ""game-over"" screen, just something to guide the player a little, although failure to meet a minimum of the common goals could probably mean you're done for (no air, habitat collapse, whatever).\n\nWhat I'm looking for here is first and foremost emergent storytelling through intricate social simulation focused on a small number of Dwarf Fortress detail-level actors while it gives you some other stuff to do on the side to keep you busy. The whole thing could even be text-based if you ask me, which is probably more feasible anyway. \n\nThoughts, ideas, wishes you've had since you first touched anything resembling a social sim?"
9a0j47,An open world game where you play as animals and fight for survival!,"Since I was a kid ive always dreamt of a game like this\n\nThe idea i've always had is like, say your in a savanna plains biome, people can choose who to play as out of a wide selection of animals, for example people can play as Lions, Elephants, Gazelles, Rhinos, Meerkats, Buffalo, Birds of prey, Ostriches, Hippos, etc etc. \n\nIf you pick an animal like a Gazelle or a Buffallo, then you must be wary of Lions, Hyenas and other preditors who can work in a team to try and bring you down. There will be lots of different things that determine how well your animal is doing such as your usual thirst, hunger, but also other things like rest, and whatever ones im not thinking of. \n\nIf your playing as a predator like a Lion, Hyena, etc, you must work together in packs (or not, depending on which animal you are) to bring down prey which will be quite difficult in order to let the pack eat and live another day. The same applies in which you will have thirst, hunger, maybe pack chemistry (depending on how well you work together). \n\nIf your playing as a much smaller animal, such as a meerkat, then you wont have to be as scared of Lions as a Gazelle would be, instead you have to worry mostly about birds of prey which will be player controlled and can also have special sort of thermal sight abilities. \n\nThe game would probably be open world, and you can play in different scenarios/biomes, such as a Tundra biome, Grassland, Rainforest, Desert, etc. \n\nPlease let me know what you think about this! What other ideas you would have, could it be done? would it not work? let me know! \n\n&amp;#x200B;"

99yx6u,My mmo,"Hello dear redditors.\n\nI made an account just cause i got this idea for a game sittin in my head for days and i wanna share it with u guys.\n\nFirst of all id like to introduce myself.\n\nIm 22 y.o. and from germany and i love games that are competitive and mosty set in worlds with magic swords and stuff.\n\nI love the idea of getting loot thrown at me but hate the aspect of grinding.\n\nOne of the prime examples of games id like to enjoy but cant is poe.\n\nNot only does the seasonal system restrict me to play 1 or 2 builds and play the story over and over again, it also compares my skill/time invested by my lvl and not my competitive skill angainst other players.\n\nI also dont like that most games throw bonus shit at you that u cant realy use or is just cosmetics for test which u have to pay big bucks for to get em permanantly i.g.\n\nSo i thought for myself which game would i like to play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd here is the deal.\n\nI thought about a game where my sole purpose is opening chests instead of grinding the same old ass mobs like always.\n\nIt should go in the direction of like for e.g. pubg or fortnite.\n\nI love the thought about working with what i got and not what can i craft for that make my build as effective as others in around 8000 lvls after dumb questing and grinding. I also hate long draggin storys i want my shiny ass paladin clad in beauty to be as effective as his looks and not bein outclassed by someone who has no life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the raw idea i have is a game with graphics and gameplay like in Realm Royal(realy like the feels and esthetics of this one). Which also centers around looting said lootboxes but id like  no classes and a broader focus on gear.\n\nI also want my world to be persistant and not bein done 4 after like 45 mins. I want smaller fights over loot not big world vs world fights like in gw2. \n\nClasses should be defined by gear which is randomized(i hate ptr servers and items i already know i get when doin this and that. why even play then)  like u have a dagger that drops with increased dmg for x and like 3 more stats a passive and a slot or two for skill gems(yes i like the idea of skill gems like in poe) and for 1 place to infuse a dmg or crit buff which u also drop from chests. \n\nWhen u get killed by a player the first person who loots ur body can take one item u previously owned . The rest gets deleted and u have to start anew. This makes people who go to the lenght of killing others feel more rewarded and they can perhaps increase the capability of their build with the new item. The people starting again gets like a sword and a skill gem with a bash skill or a bow with a bow skill @rnd. \n\nSo what is with the balance u may ask. I say f\*ck balance im sick of this games that wanna apear to every casual and get em for money the same bonusses so has who plays 24/7. If u open more chests u get stronger may even invincible but thats the reward for playing.\n\nThe one thing where im not so sure about is about playin with a diminishing quality of worn gear. the longer u use ur gear the more it gets worn until it gets destroyed and has to be replaced. (as u may noticed im a bit sadistic). \n\nI know losing ur gear on death or even on usage is hard for u but thats just how life works u can somehow fix sth but sooner or later it needs to be replaced.\n\nFor funding id like to introduce a cash shop and a real money ah to the game. The cash shop should only contain things to make ur character visual more appealing weapon skin effects etc. The real money ah is meant for a softcore version of the game where only one piece of gear is lost on death and items dont lose durability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all i want a completely pvp focussed game with ever changing builds and many small but exciting moments of feeling rewarded or bein pulled back into reality i wanna create sth emotional not addicting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is pretty raw material i present u here and its not well written cause im a lazy f\*ck but if got any ideas for improvement or wanna share ur thoughts ill be glad to hear em. Until then \n\nYours truly El Bockador.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
99ysa3,SAR: Search And Rescue,"Summary:\n\nI have this idea for a horror game where you play as a Search and Rescue Officer(hence the title) in a mountain range somewhere in the united states. I like to think of it as a game similar to SCP with multiple monsters but you don't  find them all at once you find them on various search and rescue missions one at a time. This idea takes HUGE inspiration from the supposedly true search and rescue stories that are on numerous YouTube videos and Reddit threads written by an anonymous person(here is the link for a YouTube video reading every story: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhkgXOUDetc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhkgXOUDetc)). There wouldn't be a huge backstory for the mountain range it would just be a very strange place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGameplay: \n\nThe game would play a tutorial at first simulating a basic search and rescue mission with nothing suspicious or scary about it. this is how a few of the beginning missions(when I say missions I don't mean like Call of Duty missions where you got to the menu and select which one, I mean more like missions in games like fallouts side quests, but without all the action and shooting) would be before it gets more and more scary. you would get the missions by a phone giving in calls for you to go out. you wouldn't have weapons beside a single hunting knife unless you have a small hunting rifle picked up off of base but they wouldn't be able to kill anything only stun certain monsters. The game would be in first person and you would have to track people down based on clues and other abnormal things near them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharacter:\n\ncharacter customization wouldn't matter but you could still customize things like race, skin tone, natural hair colors, facial hair, and eye color. your character would be an average joe father named John Higgins. character depth wouldn't matter because the focus is on your surroundings and the mountain range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is all the ideas I have for the time being, I will keep this updated as I think of ideas."
99xo5o,How will a turn based battle RPG work without maps?,"I just had this idea. The premise is like this: a turn based battle game (a'la Dragon Quest / Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy). That's the main gameplay. But how would you make the game enjoyable without going to the exploration, text scrolling and lots of grinding.

Options can include depression, anxiety, heartbreak, grief, PTSD and others.\n\nPlayers are able to customise their character completely; whether it be physical or personality wise. After which, they may select what issue to experience, however, by picking one may also include others (anxiety can lead to depression etc).\n\nUi will take the form of the player characters thoughts, an example would be ""Alex will remember that"" or ""You're feeling broken"". As you can tell, I've based this off Telltales concept.\n\nDialogue is alike to Telltales as actions matter as depending on your choice of words, will change the outcome of how your story ends.\n\nI know alot of people may criticise this concept, saying that I'd be banking off real world issues.

99kjf2,[Discussion] Ranged classes in turn-based combat games,"For me it feels weird that the ranged classes like the archer/gunner/crossbowman etc. fight together with their melee teammates  in those turn-based combat games like Final Fantasy, Adventure Quest and so on. You know where there are maybe 3-3 characters from each team standing face to face. They just stand there and shoot enemies from a distance of 5 meters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion the ranged class' strength is that you can pick on enemies from a long range, like in Skyrim or every other game. Of course those are not turn based so it is so much easier to take advantage of long ranged shooter/caster classes, so how would you try and ''solve'' this issue?"
99jrc5,Life or death: hide and seek,"labyrinth game - mp (team mode or every man for himself) and single player\n\nenvironment - a maze or forest with shrubbery\n\nObjective - remain undetected by the monster until you kill it or be the last individual or team to survive (in mp)\n\nStarter equipment - nothing, you can test for wind with finger or tree leaves blowing in a direction.\n\nMonster characteristics - \n\ncan see, smell and hear you based on multiple factors, environmental presence like breaking twigs, heartbeat and odour. If a sound is loud enough, like a fire cracker, can be heard from any point in map. The louder and/or smellier you are, the more noticeable you become. \n\nOther factors - there are multiple sensors around the area that alert the monster to your presence, they are a ‘part’ of it\n\nPlayer movement - \n\nplayers can either crawl, walk or run, and they affect the degree of awareness from monster or sensor(see below). Depending on activity, your heart rate can be higher, which makes you more noticeable (louder heartbeat). Odour is also a factor as the higher your heart rate, the more panic sweat you develop, the smellier you become. Odour will develop through time, but higher energy activities can hasten its development significantly unless a boost(see below) is used. The smellier you are, the larger the range of detectability becomes for the odour sensor and monster.\n\nSensors -\n\n these are mechanisms that can detect you through different means, each sensor can detect you with a single method, e.g. smell, sight, sound and movement speed. Sensors all look the same when inactive, it is up to the player to test them whilst remaining undetected. Once activated, some sensors rotate around to scan whilst others have 360 degree awareness. Some sensors are dummies, they already show as activated and don’t respond to any sense, which when destroyed give you a very strong smell or extra 'presence'.\n\nBoosts - \n\nSensors can be destroyed which then give you a boost. E.g. a wind aura that pushes twigs away from you, the ability to lower heart rate, negate odour, camouflage, proximity sensor to weapon.\n\nKilling weapon - \n\nweapon to kill is found randomly in the map, using the proximity boost would make it easier to find, otherwise can be found from glint in moonlight.\n\nKilling monster -\n\n to kill the monster, you need many of the boosts in order to remain undetected at a close enough range to kill it. Not all boosts are required, but some are needed, like heart rate reducer.\n\nMP -\n\n in MP there is a proximity advantage with some of the boosts, for example, if you’re close to a person who has a wind aura, you will also be silent when moving, or if you’re around someone with negate smell, you will also not be smelt; some can’t be gained through proximity like lowering heart rate.\n\nMP communication - \n\nPlayers can coordinate with each other, such as distracting monster with fire crackers on the other side of map to allow another play to move away from danger or to another location. Activating fan to allow player to be undetected by odour sensor or monster. very important, however, when close to a sound sensor or monster, the player/s close to it must not make any actual sound on microphone.\n\nEnvironmental tools - \n\nthere may be certain things within the area that could assist you like a huge fan to blow scent in one direction or crackers to draw attention away from an area to another. Stones are also available. Stones can be used to test sensors before approaching them, like throwing it at a tree to test sound, or throwing in front of sensor to test sight, if unresponsive, then it may be a odour sensor, so ensuring you’re downwind to sensor to destroy it.\n\nHUD - \n\nmini-map of local proximity (not full map), shows other players, environmental tools, active sensors and monster location and sensory area, at far distances, shows direction of monster and other players. Things not shown by default - inactive sensors and weapon location (can be signalled and noted when observed, which then shows on everyone’s map)."
99j0ys,(Game Concept) World War Online,"Call Of Duty has been declining in recent years. From jet pack-ridden futuristic shooters to censored WW2 games. The fans have been left starving for a game to fill the void in their hearts. So what if a game came that could? That brought an episodic campaign set in an international conflict, Fast-paced multiplayer on great maps, and an intense zombies mode? All packed up with a Pixar-like art style and free-to-play? That’s World War Online.\n\nSetting: The story of World War Online is split into three branches. \n\nDivergence- When the World War Online universe breaks off from our own. A corporation called Goliath has started an apocalypse. Destroying the world with missiles before overwhelming it with hordes of undead. Attempting to force the governments into submission. After months of conflict, the world’s military forces were overwhelmed. Resulting in a international surrender.\n\nRebellion-Small rebellions slowly build up around the world. Waiting for a spark to ignite a revolution. This comes when a special team known as the: Shadow Ops, exposed Goliath’s twisted experiments to the public. Resulting in a mass uprising that pushed Goliath to the brink. \n\nConflict- With Goliath nearly gone. The rebellions contest over what new order will take over. Turning violent when a rogue member of Shadow Ops commits an horrific attack with Goliath’s help. Before he’s hunted down and killed by Shadow Ops’s remaining members.\n\nShadow Ops: Experience the start of the revolution. Lead the Shadow Ops in episodic missions set in exotic international set pieces. A great story for shooter fans.\n\nMultiplayer: Classic. Multiplayer. Fun. Up to 16 players go at in fast-paced maps with awesome guns. Using awesome characters to get the drop on the enemy. And bet your winnings in Wager Matches.\n\nZombies: Play as soldiers attempting to survive Goliath’s betrayal. Kill zombies to get cash to spend on better guns. See how many waves you can survive before getting overwhelmed.\n\nWorld War Online has no loot boxes. All money comes from two monetization systems. The Premium Pass: A special Pass for 15$ a month. Granting early access to maps and guns. A 10% XP boost and custom games. Or Dark Agents, characters you can select before a match with special abilities similar to kill streaks. Which can be earned by completing challenges of paying 10$\n\n\n"

99f1sz,Uncharted: Golden Abyss Remake,"It is inevitable there will be [another Uncharted game](https://wccftech.com/uncharted-not-ending-the-lost-legacy/), not by Naughty Dog but likey by some other studio. Uncharted 4 closed the saga in the most satisfying way possible so it would be a tough act to stretch the series. If anything, there would be a fan backlash that it is going to be Sony's cash-in especially considering the original creators are not attached to the project, similar to what happened to Halo franchise.\n\nOne of the possible candidates for continuing Uncharted is Bend Studio, the developer who is rising with their upcoming Days Gone, a zombie apocalypse survival game heavily inspired by The Last of Us, and already worked on Naughty Dog IP before with Uncharted: Golden Abyss. \n\nInstead of making a sequel no one wants (ahemHalo4ahem), remaking Golden Abyss is the best possible option. Not 'remaster', but a proper 'remake' in the vein of Shadows of the Colossus, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Metroid 2, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Fire Emblem Echoes, and Resident Evil 2.\n\nGolden Abyss is the Uncharted game set before Uncharted 1 and almost no one played. Like MGS: Portable Ops, despite considered a canon, it was forgotten because it was a portable exclusive game and there is no way to play it unless you buy that specific system since it never got the remastering treatment like other games. Also, it was nowhere as good as Uncharted 2-4 which added to its anonymity.\n\nGolden Abyss has [killer soundtracks done by old Lucasarts composer Clint Bajakian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8xSP2suzF4), and the small the entertaining story that feels like a one-off adventure of Nathan Drake. However, the game suffers from the limitation of Vita capability as it mostly reused Uncharted 1 gameplay but even worse. The handheld consoles do not simply fit for the cinematic experience.\n\nAnd because of its obscurity and flaws, Golden Abyss makes a perfect material for the remake as hardcore fans would have no objection and give a great opportunity to experience new Uncharted for the casual fans who have not played the original.\n\nUse the Uncharted 4 engine, graphics, assets, and gameplay system. Redo the story, maybe bring Amy Hennig or Josh Scherr from Naughty Dog to direct/write. Open up the levels and do the semi-open world like U4 and LL. Include some insane set-pieces.  Leave the music as it was.\n"
99endd,A TBS / Fighting Game Hybrid,"A traditional tile-based, turn-based strategy game (a la Civ) combined with a fighting game.  Players move their fighters (armies essentially) around to seize territory, capture, resources, etc.\n\nThe novel parts are:\n\n1.  Combat is resolved through a one-on-one fighting game\n\n2.  Units can be *duplicated and stacked*, forming fighting tag teams and changing the odds.\n\nAn example using SF characters:\n\nI have an ""army"" of 5 Chun Li's (my best character) attacking your army of 2 Guiles and a Zangief.  Now we play SF , I have 5 lives as Chun Li and you have 2 lives for Guile and 1 for Zangief.  When one player has all their lives depleted, they lose.  \n\nWhy I think this is interesting:  Playing most fighting games one-v-one with a friend gets old pretty quickly, since one of you will just be better than the other and once that's established why keep playing?  So in this game, you can both essentially set your own odds.  Are you awesome with Chun Li?  Build 5 Chun Lis and spread them out individually over the map to gather as much resources as possible.  But *how much* better are you than your opponent?  Maybe you can beat your opponent every time 1-v-1, but what if you have 1 Chun Li life and he has 3 E Honda lives?  What if he's bringing over characters that match up well against Chun Li (Idk, Ryu I guess?).  You'd want to retreat your Chun Li and try to engage him with Ken or something.\n\nAnother implication of this idea is that some characters are just crap compared to others.  So those characters can have a lower resource cost.  Dhalsim (at least back in the SF2 days) was terrible, but what if you can crank out 10 Dhalsims cheaply?  You can definitely beat your opponent's 1 Ryu with 10 Dhalsims.  So now *every character* in the game has value and is worth learning.\n\n(I posted this idea as a reply to another thread a while back, reposting as its own now)\n\n"

99aqec,Game Concept: Syndicate Wars,"A free-to-play mix of Rainbow Six and Risk. Set in a dark cyberpunk world filled with evil corporations. Players battle against each other in an international conflict for corporate dominance. \n\nMatches: Player start out by building or selecting a team of agents. Which will grow as they get more throughout the match. Players can choose where to start on the world map (similar to risk). Slowly taking over areas of the world to raise their influence by completing missions (kidnappings, assassinations, etc). But must be careful due to the permanent death system. So sending your best agents and gear into a mission may not be the best idea. When a player encounters another, they will start a Conflict. Betting their cash and territories on round based 5v5s. Where players can switch between bot-controlled agents. The first company to achieve world domination will win.\n\nProgression: After every match, you’ll be given credits to unlock new items, weapons, and classes.\n\nSpecialty Classes: This is the monetization system of Syndicate Wars. Players can purchase a special class from the shop for 10$. Which allows you to call in two agents with unique and powerful abilities. But with lots of counters.\n\nThanks for reading!

You and your partner will ask people until 12:00 A.M. then you and your partner go outside to go look for the killers but everyday you hear a scream then you see blood on houses but at day its not there. Night, day 1. Everyone was inside their houses when your partner and yourself look for clues to find papers that tell about the killers but not their names and their faces. Once you collect all the papers the sky turns red at night and everyones dead. The killers knock your friend out then they kill him. They almost kill you but they drag you to a deserted prison. You then have to escape but there are guards. Once you escape the guards you search the weapon room then you later find weapons such as a Assualt Rifle,Sniper,beretta Cheetah,machete,knife,and bat. Once you get the gun and the melee. You can either go outside or go fight the killers, 1, go outside and never go outside ever again. 2,  go fight the killers then once you collect all the masks from them after you kill each one you kill every boss.

9cglxb,Space world building mmo,"Concept\n\nThis is an open world space and planet based mmo, focused on building factions from the ground up. The game would include deep ship, space station, and planet outpost building systems. By building each piece of these assets modularly from scratch, no two players assets would look alike. These asset would require resources to build, aquired by either mining yourself, stealing from other players or factions, or buying them other players or factions. The core of the game would be to build up your faction and try to conquer as much as the universe as possible, while trying to destroy any rival factions that oppose you.\n\nEarly Progression\n\nWhen fist starting a character you won't just start a new empire. You would spawn on a random abonded planet by yourself or with party of friends. You start of with a basic skill system that allows you to minine and scavenge for basic materials to build a simple ship to leave the planet. From there, by naturally exploring, you can either choose to join an existing faction to get a jump start on your personal assets. Alternatively you could find a bunch of lone wolfs like yourself, to start a faction from the ground up.\n"

9c85va,Survive : Zombies,"Alright, so I'm laying in bed and I randomly thought of this..\n\nPlayer's (in a group of 4) try to survive for as long as they can against a never ending zombie horde. Zombie types include :\n\n- Walkers: Standard zombies\n- Joggers: Slightly faster zombies\n- Runners: Extremely fast zombies\n- Brutes: Bulky zombies that absorb damage\n- Spitters: Slender zombies that's spit acid\n- Bombers: Zombies that explode\n- Plus more\n\nPlayers may choose from an assortment of weapons that they can find throughout the map and that come out of the Unholy Vending Machine. Ammo and Benefits drop from zombies that are slain, these Benefits include:\n\n- Clip Limit: Gives every player max ammo\n- Heal Tick: Heals all players\n- Big Boi: Kills all zombies currently on the map\n- Juggernaut: Makes the player whom picked up the perk the main target for all zombies\n- Bloodhound: Summons a bloodhound (or random breed of dog) to help against the horde\n- Plus more\n\nAs stated before, player's are to try and survive for as long as they can. The higher the round, the more points the player can receive, which they can spend at the ingame market place for skins for their weapons and character.\n\nAs you can tell, I've taken heavy inspirations from COD: Black Ops zombies and Left 4 Dead 2. Before you rant about that fact, Black Ops has drifted away from the core zombie survival mechanic and have opted for a complexish story.. And Left 4 Dead is basically gone (yes I know there was a third game announced, but wasn't it a year ago?)\n\nThoughts? "
9c380p,How can I make a trivia/quiz game on facts about an organization more interesting/impressive?,"I'm competing in a video game programming contest this year, and the theme is to create a video game which tests a player's knowledge of information and the history of the organization behind the competition. What are some unique, interesting, and technically impressive ways to improve upon the very basic, bland, and drab idea of a game that's intended to be basically a test? The game must have an ending, so an endless, or practically endless, game like Trivia Crack isn't a possibility. Thank you!"

9btgjq,Bar Fight - A game of manipulation and improvised combat,"I've been wanting to make this game for years but seeing as I'm just an amatuer in game dev and I've already got several projects started I thought I'd share this idea. Maybe someone can actually make this because I think it's a really great game idea.\n\n**BAR FIGHT**\n\nPremise:  Your character enjoys drinking and fighting and traveling. He likes this so much that he has a goal to travel around the world to bars of varying class and styles and start a bar fight.\n\n**Design**: \n\nEach bar has 3 phases. Manipulate, Combat, Upkeep. \n\n**Manipulation** \n\nDuring this phase you will be tasked with instigating a fight. But you have to be smart about it. You can't just walk up to the nearest guy and punch him in the face. You'll just get kicked out or you'll get in a one on one fight with someone and wind up in jail. You want the entire bar to erupt. To do that you have to slowly turn up the temperature. \n\nTalk to people. Find out what their problems are. And make them worse. So much fucking worse. Tap into their insecurities. Make them think everyone is out to get them. Exploit every angle to get the bar ready to explode. \n\nSome bars are easier to do this than others. The first bars you'll start off in will be dive bars and motorcycle gang hangouts. Places where people practically go to get into a bar fight. These places are easy to get to erupt. \n\nBut as you progress through the game you'll go to classier and classier establishments. Bars with customers who have never been in a fist fight in their lives. And you'll have to work quite a bit harder to erupt the bar. \n\nYou don't need to do 100% of the things available to do but you do need to get the bar to a certain level of agitation. \n\nOnce you feel you've truly done all you can to sour the mood of the bar, you have to set off a trigger.\n\nA trigger is the spark that ignites the flame. For some bars this is as simple as throwing a chair at the bar. Others may involve getting an NPC in the right place at the right time. Or maybe the bar running out of a certain drink. \n\nSetting off a trigger when the bar is not agitated enough will result in small isolated fights and likely get you tossed out as an instigator. But setting the trigger off at the right moment will cause a chain reaction where the entire bar erupts into a brawl. And that leads to the next phase.\n\n**Combat**\n\nThe goal of the combat phase is to be the last man standing. Combat is very improvised. Each bar you go into you will be unarmed. So you'll have to rely on weapons found around the bar. chairs, pool ques, fondue fountains, moose heads, guitars, etc. It'll feel a lot like Dead Rising's combat.\n\nSome items in the bar will help with your health/stamina. \n\nYou'll fight each patron and as soon as you clear roughly half of the Patrons you'll encounter the subboss. Which will likely be the bouncer or some other tough looking character.\n\nAfter you defeat the subboss and the rest of the patrons then you finally need to face off against the bartender which is the boss for the bar.\n\nWhen you defeat the bartender you defeat the bar.\n\n**Upkeep**\n\nAfter defeating the bar you can then spend XP to improve your character. Purchase additional fighting moves. Add charisma bonuses to up your manipulation abilities. Or perhaps stealth to help you swipe important items from characters to get them agitated. The choices you make determines the options available to you in both manipulation and combat phases. \n\nThe XP you gain from a bar comes from both how agitated you got the bar before triggering it and how many patrons you KO'd, the time it took and the amount of health you had remaining. \n\n"
9bslet,My idea for a game,"I’ve always wished there was a Harry Potter type version of the game fable. Basically you start off as a kid in hogwarts which plays slightly like The bully games whereby you go into classes and learn spells etc \nObviously you get sorted into your house based on choices you make in create a character (or akin to Skyrim picking traits etc) \nOnce you have completed your years in hogwarts the game really opens up \nObviously there will story’s and substance etc \nBut when the game opens up you should be able to literally do anything will you become a hogwarts teacher , will you dive into a management sim whereby you own a business in diagon alley, will you join the ministry of magic or will you go down the path of Voldemort and try and control the magic world.\n\nActions you take during your school year would shape your path/personality  somewhat  in the way the good and bad system in fable does\n\nAnd your house gives you certain skills above others\nI.e ravenclaws are better at Alchamy and slyverin and better at persuasion sneaking etc\n\nI know this is a pipe dream and would never happen but someone let jk Rowling know I’m ready for my money now \n"
9br9pd,Kaiju Royale,"TL;DR:  a battle royale where all the players start as small, dog sized monsters, every time a player dies everyone gets bigger until the final two have a Godzilla-like showdown in the city at the center of the map. \n\n\nFirstly I should warn you this game involves a little bit of character creation that may take a bit of explaining so bear with me. Mainly this is just me creating my ideal battle royale game, as I hate games who’s winning strategy is wait in a basement until everyone kills each other and you’re one of the last alive. I’d prefer a battle royale that actually requires you to battle and maintain your stats through side-objectives so you don’t fall behind.\n\nYou start out as a monster about the size of a Labrador, everyone chooses and customizes what type of monster they want to play as. All monsters regardless of type have essentially the same “loadout”, melee attacks, a ranged attack, an AoE attack, a traversal ability, and finally a special ability. Special abilities are monster type specific, the more you play as that type the more abilities you’ll unlock for it and be able to choose from. Traversal abilities are monster specific as well but there are none to unlock and  swap out for. When it gets down to two players they don’t automatically become Godzilla sized, they’re only about the size of a T.Rex. When players approach this size they can pick up large objects like cars or chunks of debris, they cannot be thrown (unless you chose the Gremlin Archtype) but you can use them as shields to block from incoming attacks until whatever your holding gets destroyed. Once it’s down to 2 players need to grab orbs that spawn at opposite ends of the City at the center of the map, once grabbed they grow drastically and slightly change in appearance as well. \n\nExample:\nLizard Archtype- Resembles a large monitor lizard, when customizing you can choose if it uses all four legs or just two, it claws and bites for melee, shoots its tongue for a ranged attack, and swipes it’s tail for an AoE. It’s traversal ability is a simple sprint mechanic that doubles your speed and allows you to run across water as long as you keep moving and aren’t above a certain size, regardless of size your jump is greatly improved while sprinting. Camouflage is it’s default special ability and it only works as long as you hold still. These elements remain unchanged until the orb is grabbed, then the base model resembles Godzilla greatly and your ranged attack is now an elemental breath attack based on the element you chose. \n\nThis basic concept would play out for the rest of the monster types, in total there’s The Lizard, The Ape, The Insect, The Gremlin, and The Buzzard (read bottom for more in depth descriptions)\n\nCustomization:\nThe customizing comes in after you’ve chosen one of these types. You start by choosing the elemental damage type you want your monster to be. There’s atomic, fire, ice, acidic/poison, electric, and cosmic. \nElemental effects:\n\nAtomic- minimal red particle fx, atomic is essentially no elemental damage, but it does offer a 5% bonus to damage as well as 5% reduction in damage received. \n\nFire- flame fx on all your attacks, fire offers burst damage, your attacks set the target ablaze and they receive medium DoT. The effect however can be canceled out almost immediately if the affected player finds water. \n\nIce- blue/white crystalline and misty effects on attacks, offers no additional damage but when you strike a target their attack speed slows by 5%, this effect stacks up to three times and lasts for 3s\n\nAcid/Poison- green fuming and dripping effects, offers DoT like fire, unlike fire the damage is in much smaller increments, however the effect lasts longer than fire and cannot be removed with water.\n\nElectric- zappy arcing effects, adds no additional damage but with each successful hit your attack speed increases by 5%, this effect stacks up to 6 times. \n\nCosmic- Nebulae like trails and gas effects, the same effect in your damage and damage resistance as atomic but you can customize the colors, cosmic is only unlocked when you’ve “mastered” the monster your currently playing. \n\nNext you choose your texture (the insect has its own separate textures, everyone else has the same options) Scaly, furry, slimy, and bald, each choice has a slider that effects the scales spininess/plated look, the furs’ length, the slime’s viscosity, or muscle tone for baldies. After you’ve selected that you choose a pattern or no pattern and then the colors. Next you get into body parts. Each type of monster’s skeleton and base character model remains the same there are no slider options here, it’s simply different styles of heads, arms, legs, and tails that you can swap out for a desired aesthetic. The base model for the Lizard looks like a monitor lizard/Raptor, but you can swap out the head for something that’s more like a chameleon or even a snake-like head with fangs. You can always customize your creature in the main menu because as you play you not only unlock special abilities for that monster but also new patterns, and body parts to choose from. Most body parts are purely cosmetic.\n\nThere’s a catalog of body parts you can peruse through and buy with in-game points or real money, but there are also certain parts that can only be acquired after completing a certain objective like consume 100 npcs and stuff like that. Those parts will stand out from the rest and unlike the others they come with perks. Usually the perk has something to do with what you accomplished, like say you ate 100 npcs and you unlock a head that makes it so eating takes half the time it normally does.\n\n\nGameplay:\nThe map is very large as it needs to accommodate 50 or more players. In the center is a city, surrounding it is several small towns and lots of country side, a badlands type area, and a little forest. Populating this map are lots of human npcs with very simple AI. They just walk around until you get within a certain radius then they run. Killing and eating these npc’s not only restores a bit of lost health but for every 10 you eat you get a permanent boost to your HP and a skill point to add into either your melee, AoE, or ranged attack, or you can spend it on your special ability (you must eat them to gain the points, killing them is easy, but eating puts you at risk for a few seconds). The skill points improve the damage/range of your attacks or decrease the cooldown of your special ability. Killing and eating another player gives you 2 skill points. \n\nAs you play you also earn cash to use in the store, there’s lots of ways to earn cash, killing humans gives you a small amount, eating them gets you slightly more, players are worth double what npcs are, as you grow you’ll be able to cause damage to the environment, the larger the destruction the more cash, completing objectives for body parts gets you a hefty sum, and finally winning the match, that’s probably the best way to earn as winning adds a 2x multiplier onto however much cash you wound up making during the match.\n\nStyle:\nThe game would benefit from a more cartoonish art style, but AAA graphics could do it just as much justice as long as the overall tone is humorous. Think of classics like Rampage, the plot doesn’t really make sense on purpose because in the end it’s about becoming a skyscraper sized beast and tearing shit up. \n\nMonster Type Breakdown:\n\nThe Lizard- the basic all rounder monster, it’s attacks are rapid and it can get around the map at a decent pace, easy to pick up and and get the hang of. \n*for more see above*\n\nThe Ape- Resembles a small gorilla at first, but with customization you can add parts that make it appear much less ape like at least in the face and limbs. Think gorilla body with a wolf like face and clawed hands and feet, that’s just if you don’t want to go full King Kong when you grab the orb. You can leave it Ape like if you choose. You slam one hand down after the other and then finish by slapping both hands down as your melee attack, for ranged you poop in your hand and hold onto it until you’ve found a target to hurl it at. For AoE you raise both arms high and slam your fists down, this does no damage but it does knock back anyone too close, charge it up for a more dramatic effect. Your traversal ability is a sprint mechanic that has you running on all fours, it only increases your speed by 50% but anything you hit takes damage, this becomes useful for making money in the later stages of the match. Your special ability is a self buff, you beat your chest and roar after this for 10s you’ll take 10% reduced damage. The Ape is the bruiser, if you’re looking to dish out big chunks of damage and take hits like a champ the ape is probably the play style for you. Be careful though a lack of awareness will have you outmaneuvered and surrounded with no escape. \n\nThe Insect- this is the odd one out that’s a bit different when it comes to customizing. Unlike the others your chitin is mainly only customizable by choosing how smooth it is, you can be nice and shiny like a jewel, you can have ridges, or you could go all the way to being covered in spikey protrusions. The base model is like the shape of a crab, but it’s got a mantis-like head and scorpion tail. The tail is equipped with a stinger and is the final strike in your melee attacks, you snap twice with your pincers then strike with the tail. Your ranged attack is also your AoE attack, it has you whipping your tail causing the barb at the end to detach and after a brief period explode and deal AoE damage. Your traversal ability is a Wall Crawl mechanic, it allows you to walk along any surface even ceilings. It doesn’t do anything to your speed, but it is handy when you need to get away to a place most other monsters can’t follow. Your special attack has you opening your shell and releasing noxious gas, it does no damage at early stages but puts anyone caught in its radius to sleep for 3s or until they are hit. Grabbing the orb sees a tremendous change in the base character model, you become like a giant wasp with pincers and a scorpion tail, you have no legs so your in a constant hover. Now your special ability no longer puts the enemy to sleep instead the gas has become flammable and sending your exploding barb into it will set off a high damage explosion. The Insect is for those who like strategy, they’re not the fastest or hardest hitting overall, but you can control an area better than any other monster. \n\nThe Gremlin- this one is close to the Ape but lankier and more resembling an actual Gremlin. Their melee attack is just slashing with their claws one hand after the other, unlike other monsters the combo doesn’t end after three strikes, instead with each successful hit you strike faster, the effect stacks up to 5 times and lasts 5s, getting hit with an AoE attack cancels the stack. Speaking of AoE, the Gremlin spins wildly for 1.5s slashing everything in a certain radius, enemies hit by the full 2 spins of the attack receive bleeding damage. Your ranged attack allows you to pick up certain objects in the environment and throw them, at first it’s just small stuff like wrenches and bricks, eventually you’ll be able to throw cars. Your traversal is a nightcrawler-esque teleport, works on line of sight, the bigger you get the farther you can teleport. You can actually utilize the Gremlin’s traversal as an attack, if you aim directly at another player and teleport you’ll appear on their backs and take bite out of them, also unlike other monsters The Gremlin’s traversal has a cooldown of 5s. The Gremlin’s default special ability is called Haywire, touch a vehicle or other form of machinery to send it into a frenzy that ends in an explosion that damages players and npcs alike. As you get bigger your able to affect multiple machines at a time. When you grab the orb unlike other monsters your character model is exactly the same just huge, think of the Monstars from Space Jam. The Gremlin is the glass cannon, with the proper combination of elements and abilities you’ll be dishing out damage like no one else, don’t get overconfident though, the Gremlin squishes easily underfoot.\n\nThe Buzzard- probably the trickiest but most rewarding of the monster types. The Buzzard resembles a mutant crow at first, but can be altered to look like a pterosaur or a Harpy Eagle. Your attacks on the ground a fairly sub-standard, you peck like a chicken, when your flying however you lash out with your talons and hammer your beak down. You simply hold the jump button to begin flying, and stop once your at the desired height, like real birds you can only hover for so long, you drop in altitude the longer you fly in one spot. You don’t have a ranged attack, instead you have a swoop attack that can only be activated from a certain distance while in the air, when it connects you deal high damage. Your AoE requires you to be in the air as well, you divebomb and deal a small radius of damage that increases the larger you grow. Your special ability is Raptor sense, you target a specific player and they become highlighted in your hud, you can even see them through walls. All sound becomes muffled except for the sounds your prey makes. Much like the Gremlin you remain largely the same after grabbing the orb. The Buzzard seems like the easy pick, but you’ll find it takes a bold risk taker as well as excellent timing to survive all the way until the end. \n\nMonster Stats: (these stats are for smallest size your monster can be and do not include the elemental bonuses)\n\nThe Lizard \nBase HP- 100\nAttack Speed- 15 damage per 0.5s\nRanged Attack- shoots 5 meters, deals 20 damage\nMovement Speed- base: 10mps, sprinting: 20mps\nJump D- base D: 12meters, Sprinting D: 24 meters\nJump H- base H: 2 meters Sprinting H: 4 meters\nAoE- radius: 1 meter, deals 10 damage\nCamouflage- remains active as long as you are remaining still and aren’t being attacked. Attacking from camouflage grants 10 bonus damage if the attack hits its target, has a 5s cooldown.\n\nThe Ape\nBase HP- 120\nAttack speed- 20 damage per 0.75s\nRanged Attack- shoots 10 meters, deals 10 damage\nMovement Speed- base: 8mps, sprinting: 12mps\nSprinting Damage- deals 5 damage every time you make contact\nJump D- base D: 8 meters, sprinting D: 10 meters\nJump H- base H: 4 meters, sprinting H: 6 meters\nAoE- radius: 2 meters, knocks back anyone inside 1 meter when uncharged, charged up fully for 3s it will send them 5m. \nChest Beat- gets 10% bonus to damage resistance, 10s cooldown.\n\nThe Insect\nBase HP- 90\nMelee- first two strikes take 0.5s each and deal 10 damage each, theres a 1s delay until the tail strike, once initiated it takes 0.1s and deals 10 damage\nRanged/AoE- shoots 6m, deals 15 damage in a radius of 2m\nMovement Speed- base/sprinting: 9mps\nJump D- 6 meters\nJump H- 3 meters\nTranq-Fart- anyone caught in the 2m radius fall asleep for 3s or until they take damage. Has an 8s cooldown\n\nThe Gremlin\nBase HP- 60\nMelee- starts at 10 damage per slash with each slash taking 0.75s to complete, each stack takes 0.15s off until it only takes 0.15s to complete each slash. As long as you hold the attack button you’ll continue to attack at maximum speed, but your movement speed is halved.\nRanged Attack- shoots 15m, damage depends on the object, metal ones deal 20 damage, while stone deals 15, and wood only deals 10 damage.\nAoE- radius: 1.5m, deals 7.5 damage per spin, takes 0.75s to complete one spin, if AoE button is held will preform 2 spins\nMovement Speed- 16 mps \nTeleport Range- 20 meters, with a target it increases to 40 meters, has 5s cooldown\nJump D- 18 meters\nJump H- 9 meters\nHaywire- touch a machine and it will go nuts, the size of the object determines the damage it’s explosion causes. A radio would deal 10 damage whereas a car would deal 40 damage, the trick is you could actually pick up and throw the malfunctioning radio at your target, you’ll need to survive and grow enough to be able to use haywire on a car and throw it, until then you’ll need to be strategic, lure another player into position and then let the car drive itself into them and explode. If you’re really good you can take out multiple players before they even know what hit them.\n\nThe Buzzard\nBase HP- 75\nMelee- grounded: 5 damage per peck, takes 0.15s to complete one peck. Flying: slashes with talons twice and pecks once, each slash deals 10 damage and combined they take 0.25s to complete, the peck is 0.5s after the slashes and deals 10 damage. \nRanged- The swoop can only be initiated from a distance of at least 7m away, you track your target like a missile flying 2x normal flight speed, if you connect your target takes 25 damage. \nAoE- radius: 3m, deals 5 damage to any inside\nMovement Speed- grounded: 3mps, flying: 18mps\nRaptor Sense- once a target is selected they become highlighted for 8s on your HUD and all sounds become muffled except for theirs. Has an 18s cooldown.\n\nI know it’s a lot and way too much, but I get bored at work and think up game ideas. I love mixing genres, and this idea came to me when I was reminiscing about those old Godzilla games, Destroy all Monsters I think it was called, anyway I think it’d be pretty neat. "

9bf4n2,How to come up with game ideas for indie game developers ? A video I created to talk about this topic.,Coming up with great ideas is a process that I've been improving over the years and also a very common question for indie game developers who are starting in the industry. In this video I provide examples on things that I do to come up with game ideas.\n\n[Coming up with game ideas](https://youtu.be/KsfT_n6PQ3o)
9bd0pf,A game in which you run a small shop but you also own a cat that keeps breaking things.,"This game is inspired by the cats that threaten to tip your glassware over the edge.\n\nThe game has you run and maintain a small shop as the adorable antics of the shop's cat (or other exotic creature) threatens to destroy your delicate wares (antiques/magic potions/relics).\n\nOn the surface, the game is a light business sim wherein you have to buy stock, set prices and keep customers happy in order to make a profit and keep your business afloat. Deeper down, however, the game's core engagement (the thing that keeps bringing you back) is actually the slice of life pet rearing aspect.\n\nAs you play, the cat will often try to get your attention and affection. Sometimes it'll do cute things, other times it'll do annoying things, and yet other times it'll do mischievous things. The rest of the game exists solely so that there is something for your pet to distract you *from*.\n\nAs the game progresses, you get to interact more and more with NPCs while the game expands to include quirky employees and even a love interest. And instrumental in all those is that darn cat."
9bc8al,"Total war style, mass multiplayer, battle simulator!","So here's the idea. Imagine a game with hundreds or thousands of players playing on a single map. They would be divided into two or more armies. Each player would control a single solider in the first person perspective. It could be set in the Roman or Medieval era. There is one game that I've seen a while ago that did something similar and that this post was inspired by. But in a much smaller scale. Unfortunately I can't remember it's name. I want a game where you are part of a unit of around 160 men, charging into another unit like yours and engaging into a hand-to-hand combat. I have some ideas how this could be executed and even some optimization options but I will leave it at this so we can debate about it. To finish up. I'm a big total war fan and I got bored of having to shoot my enemy with a gun from afar and would like to get close and personal! :D"
9bbx1f,An Escape Room Builder," Ok so I've had this idea for awhile and I think it could really take off. It would a mobile game called Hotel Escape. The premier is that everybody has a virtual ""hotel"" with different rooms. You can make your own escape rooms on a builder, and others can play them, and rate them. \n\n The builder itself would have options at the beginning to decide a theme, and how many rooms you want and what the layout would be. Each room would have four walls, a celling and a floor. You can put hundreds of things in the room, things that would associate with the theme. Now, there would be options to put boxes in the room. Each box much have a puzzle associated with it. There would be hundreds of options for puzzles to make, such as tangrams, crosswords, riddles, math problems, logic problems, mazes and much more. You have the options to hide stuff around the room on different objects, that can be used.\n\n You can look at others profiles and play their rooms. Each room can be rated 1 to 5 stars, and has a percentage of people who escaped. Now, the game currency would be coins. These coins can make it so you can more things to your rooms, and make more rooms to add to your hotel. If you can escape a room with a low escape rate, you get coins. If you make a room that had a high rating, you get coins. \n\n So that's the basic idea. Let me know if you like it, and anything you might change."
9bbdt7,TCG Battle Royale,"I had a spectacular epiphany today . What if a TCG Battle Royale game existed where real people would compete in a Battle Royale game ( like the popular PUBG) for instant card prizes and a draft style tournament. It's sort of a game-within -a-game-within-a-game. Here's the premise. 50 people drop into a huge environment and compete to find loot similar to PUBG, except they are also trying to find cards. There will be all different rarities of cards and card 8 card factions. You must choose only two card factions or run agro (one card faction). Now, you can kill other people and loot their cards. You could switch one of your card factions for theirs, if it appears to be better! Only the top-ten players in the game will keep their cards and advance to the draft style card tournament. The other 40 players must pay 1.99$ to purchase another game ticket. The top three players in the game will win booster packs, 1, 2 ,or 3 for the winner winner chicken dinner player. Now instead of just having virtual reality cards, you can redeem your boosters and cards you have drafted at your local card shop. Anything else cool you find; like hero cards, and card mats(super rare), are also redeemable at your card shop. Don't worry, if you have registered with you shop, they will immediately see the cards you have won, and gather them once you have completed the card game portion. Now for the card game. Obviously the top ten players compete in the card game with their factional decks they picked up during BR play. If they didn't find 30 cards, their deck will be filled in with common cards of that faction or factionless cards. In other words their deck might suck. The top two players who reach the finals might win free event tickets to play battle royale for free. In other words they don't have to pay 1.99 because they just won. Then they can go emedietly the next hour and redeem their cards at their local card shop. Then Sam and Kenny can play at home with their new physicall cards that they just digitally found in-game. Pretty cool right. Plus it's a huge cash grappler for developers to really hone in on the latest trends. TCG and BR. Thanks. "
9b9yrs,Got a concept for Pokemon/SMT style monster-collecting JRPG,"Stumbled across an idea and if i know how to develop a game i’ll make it right away\n\nSo the game is basically an RPG that parodies the Pokemon/SMT genre and the entertainment media as a whole. \n\nThe world is attacked by aliens and the main character is an otaku who just figured out he can bring action figures into life and fight for him against the aliens. \n\nThe game is based on the MC collecting action figures which consists of parodies of popular icons in the world like action figures of anime girls, gundam, and western icons figures like the terminator, power rangers, star wars figures, wwe and such. Change the design a little bit but make it obvious what its based on. And give it Funny names. Or make the name in the style of The Somethingsomething. These figures all has different stats and abilities that reflects their nature.\n\nHow does MC get the action figures?\n\nThrough shops of course. More shop is unlocked as MC leveled up. Since the world is attacked by aliens, material to made the figures are scarce. So the MC need to collect materials like plastics, paints and glue before requesting the shop guy to make for him. Some rarer action figures are limited edition and can be obtained by NPCs through helping them (side quests)\n\nWhat makes the gameplay unique?\n\nSets. Collectors love to have complete sets in their figures collection, like having all the member of power rangers. So, i’m thinking the game is turn-based with 3 party members. Each party member is considered a set. With one active and 4 support. They all shared an averaged HP and can be switched who is active on its turn where the active member is the one who fighting the enemy. The supports boosts the active member. If they are all in one set there is a bonus in the boosts.  Complicated? Here an example:\n\nParty member 1:\n\nActive: Figure A\n\nSupport 1: Figure B\nSupport ability: +5 Strength to Active Member\nBonus Support ability: Give the active member [somethingsomething] skill IF all related Figures in the set.\n\nSupport 2-4: all related figures\n\nThat is why Sets are powerful. Also active members can be changed once every turn.\n\nExample Party member 2:\n\nActive: Figure X\n\nSupport 1: Figure Y\nSupport abilities: +5 speed to active member\nBonus abilites: +20 Strength to Figure X if its the active members\n\nSkills:\n\nSkills can be learned by level up, what skill each figures learn depends on their nature. Some figures learns gun skills, some learn fighting skills. There are also passive skills.\n\nThats is all i’ve thought of for now. Thanks for reading! Feel free to use it i wont sue anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
9b9odw,Prison Management game (simmular to prison architect),"Since prison architect is quite old now it would be nice to see a new prison management game like prison architect but have new features, be less glitchy, and have more moddability (prison architect is mostly hardcoded so it restricts modders).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbasically\n\nA game like prison architect (top down prison management game) but modernized with a nicer artstyle like Rimworld's for example, new features, less glitches/bugs, more moddability for modders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you actually decide to make a game with this idea give me a discord invite or something so i can follow progress, also if you got questions leave them in the comments"
9b9gn5,Philippine Folklore Co-op Horror Survival Shooter (Similar to L4D),"The basic idea is a small open world game where 4 players escape from 3 clans of ""Aswangs"" gathering in a Barangay (Small Urban Village) for a Cult-like Festival.\n\nWeapons you will find will be Japanese and American WW2 weapons, Vietnam War era weapons, and other Philippine weaponry such as ""Ginunting"" which is a filipino sword and etc.\n\nSpecial units and Mini Bosses will also appear I cannot mention all of them here since I'm still trying to figure out how to Balance them.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay will be similar to Payday in terms of AI behaves they can notice you by your footsteps or by making loud noises such as hitting objects or firing a gun. \n\nAswangs will retreat from time to time if defeated but that won't stop them from coming after you. Usually they appear in Human Form but when enraged they transform into their true forms and can cling at walls and pounce at you.\n\nPlayers can go to houses and grab things like salt and Garlic in which players can use as protection. In this game Stealth can be a option but can be vital in gameplay especially if the Aswangs manage to capture one of your friends.\n\nEnemy Units (So far):\n\nAswang (Dog Clan)- they appear much thinner and easily killed in human form but when revealing their true form they are much more agile and does quick attacks that are relentless.\n\nAswang (Boar Clan)- they appear a bit more muscular or fatter in human form but in their true form they have more resilient to damage and does knockback in their attacks.\n\nTik-Tik (Bird Clan)- they appear average but usually does attack in the shadows usually makes a ticking sound when close by in their true form. They have long tounges that grab victims.\n\nSpecial Units (Unsure):\n\nMagkukulam- a Witch that chants curses that makes enemies charge at your location if they get damaged they will scream to reveal the Aswangs in true forms. To prevent this Players must kill them fast before they manage to scream.\n\nManananggal- a woman that has bat wings and rips half of their body and pounces on players at the ground while being in the air.\n\nTikbalang- Half man half horse, they appear tall and casts illusions. They usually like to rape young maidens to give birth of their kind. In the game they act in a cowardly manner usually hiding but will attack you in the shadows.\n\nSo far this is my idea for it. I have the story set in my notebook but thats just it."
9b1ve8,A Sandbox MMORPG with a doomsday mechanic,"Inspired by Infinity War, I was wondering about a sandbox MMORPG, probably in the fantasy setting, where there's a doomsday mechanic.\n\nThe doomsday mechanic is player-initiated. At the start, six ""doom stones"" will be hidden as a treasure inside a chest or as a drop from a mob. Possessing a doom stone will unlock abilities and/or stats, making you relatively stronger than the rest.\n\nIf a player with a doom stone is killed, the doom stone will be lootable from their corpse. Disconnecting or logging out while in combat will not despawn the player's avatar.\n\nIf a player with a doom stone logs out (and is not in combat), they will leave the doom stone underneath them, and a guardian will spawn on top of it. The guardian is similar to a boss. If the guardian is defeated, the doom stone will become lootable.\n\nA player can keep the doom stone for himself, or he can share it's buffs through a ""doom spire."" The doom spire is a player crafted building where the doom stone will be housed. Once the doom stone is house in a doom spire, it cannot be taken out unless the doom spire is destroyed through siege weapon/s.\n\nA doom spire can be corrupted with a ""corrupting elixir."" Corrupting a doom spire will not disable the buff it provides, but it will turn players into monsters (the skin can be selected by the player).\n\nTo initiate doomsday--meaning the whole world will be wiped, killing everyone and destroying all player-crafted objects, houses, settlements or kingdoms--all doom spires must be corrupted.\n\n---\n\nSo within this sandbox MMO, players can either strive to end the world or keep it from ending.\n"
9axmlh,Unsure?-3rd Person Action MMO-Lite/rpg with guns/melee/magic...etc?," Third person Action MMO RPG \n\n\*Note a lot of this is place holder some names for things are lame and all I could come up with mostly just trying to get the point of the game and some mechanic ideas across. Also a lot of it will come off as jumbled with no sense of order since I just kind of am going as I come up with new ideas or changing old ones. Just seeing what people think and what ideas could be added. Stuff I'm having issues is thinking of ideas for magic to fit in? Maybe assigning a weapon to use it like a staff or wand? was also think Void caster gauntlets?\n\nStoryish?  \n  Humans have developed technology to open rifts into other dimensions and by doing so have brought their doom! Earth has been wiped out by “Voidlings” Creatures of terrifying power! You, the player will be someone who was lucky and escaped the chaos and arrived in a world similar to your previous with one minor detail their technology has been designed to fight against the Voidling menace! Infected with the void you are near corruption but thanks to arriving in this world the people are able to save you but cannot remove the void essence within you! You gain abilities beyond normal humans and may have even mutated (Customization options for unique eyes, ears, skin color etc....almost like making your own race) your appearance.      \n  Now that you're safe and more powerful than ever you join in the fight against the voidlings. an ever on going battle with no real end in sight. You fight to protect your new world and make sure the same thing never happens again!   3rd person view (\*the world should be HUGE!)  \n  Three forms of combat/weapons. \n\nRanged \n\nMelee \n\nMagic \n\nUtility   \n  Combat will be action/skill shot based. Meaning all combat ranged, magic, and melee will have to be aimed and or timed correctly in order to be effective in combat. If you're firing a gun you have to actually aim it. If you're shooting magic you have to aim it. And Melee combat will have a combination of timed and aimed strikes. Active skills for the most part will be utility based or used to weaken an enemy.   \n  Unsure of how to make Health work. But a level 1 character should be able to kill a max level. Your strength will come from items more than stats. Stats will give utility bonuses and determine what items you can use.   \n    \n  Tier 1 – Weak, Easy to kill, usually appear in large numbers. \n\nTier 2 – Not too difficult to kill, smaller groups and may have special attacks. \n\nTier 3 – Larger and much harder to kill. Appear by themselves or in a pair. Best to have 2+ people to kill this tier of Voidling.   \n\nWorld Ender Tier! Raid level bosses requiring 10+ people to take down.   \n  Killing creatures will be tactics based. Enemies will need to be stunned, trapped, or have other effects placed on them. Reveal the weak spot and let them have it. Some monsters may reveal their weak spot while attacking. Such as a large charging monster may have a flap on its body open up as it runs. You can also weaken enemies by just dealing damage. The most damage will come from hitting weak spots.   \nMonsters and players should share some similar attacks in the sense of how they affect each other. Such as being stunned or parrying an attack. that way pvp could be similar to fighting a tough monster. (I mean you are infected with the void)\n\nPlayers start at level 1. They gain exp by destroying monsters. Each level will increase the amount of exp they will need for the following level. Different monster tiers give different amount of exp. Exp can also be gained from other sources??? Performing different bounty quests from a bounty board and performing different challenges! Right now players have different ways of becoming stronger. Health for the most part will be static with no change in this stat. This means players must be careful and use different tactics to stay alive. The best way to become stronger is get better gear. Armor, weapons, Accessories, and many other items will be key to your survival. As you level you will also gain stat points to allocate into (Current place holders Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence.) You will also gain Aspect points in up to four different aspects (No names as of now) but each tree will represent a stat and a fourth tree for more utility based stuff. Players will be able to master a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. Becoming proficient in a weapon will unlock bonuses and extra upgrade slots for those weapons. Ranged weapons can use different ammo types which may change the way you use it. While Active skills can be obtained with Void Spheres/Crystals. Allowing you to obtain new skills that can be upgraded with support Spheres/Crystals (POE Idea). Items you can wield will depend on your stat choices.\n\n  \n  Players can also become craft items and can train in a variety of different skills.\n\n(Note\* I like the idea of unique crafting. So finding items off of enemies for example ""Corrupted fang"" and using it in any type of crafting to get something unique out of it. something you wouldn't normally get with just a normal recipe. It would be cool if player made items could be more personal based on unique item drops you found. I'd love to see a system that has hundreds of unique potential crafting materials to create amazing combinations. while keeping it balanced of course.\n\n   \n  Weaponsmith - duh\n\n Armorsmith - duh\n\nEngineering - Turrets, bombs/grenades, etc \n\nHuntsman (PH) - Traps, bows, some utility items \n\nVoidcrafting - Skill spheres/crystals, other items?\n\nCooking - Duh\n\nGathering skills can all be leveled.   \n  \n\nWhile outside of towns they will enter an instanced area where a max of 50-100 other players could be possible. The world will be large so running into other players not in your group will be somewhat rare. While still allowing for interesting moments to occur. Monster spawns are not fixed while there will be a safe zone near towns/cities while the higher the tier the monsters are the rarer the chance of finding them will be! Though specific area will have increased chance but also be much more dangerous don't expect to be able to solo these areas easily. Areas designated for high levels will be in the world where people can challenge themselves to take on the strongest of Void monsters!   \n \n\n PVP – Will be in battle arenas and you can also flag yourself for pvp and will be placed into instances with only players who are also flagged for pvp. Players can wager currency in arenas and maybe receive other special rewards for arenas.   \n  \n\nBlock mechanic. Players (and some enemies) will all have a void shield they can summon to block/parry attacks. This shield has a limited energy and is also fairly weak against stronger enemies when starting out. Depending on items and stats you can make it stronger for fighting stronger foes.   \n  Weapons \n\n\*Ranged (Dual Wields available) \n\nSniper Rifle, Pistol, SMG, LMG/Mini Guns, Shotgun, Bow/Crossbow, Rail Gun   \n  \n\n\*Melee (Dual Wields available) \n\nTraditional One Handed Weapons, Traditional Two Handed Weapons, Polearms, Whips \n\n\*Utility \n\nElement guns, Wire guns(Horizon zero dawn) \n\n  \n  \*Thrown \n\nGrenades \n\nChakram or some weapon that returns when thrown?\n\nNote\* Pretty much all I have right now. Overall trying to make something that allows for a variety of play styles. while making something that is not with a normal mmo leveling system while still making use of a leveling system. like stated above something that really is a blend of getting your character stronger while still relying on player skill to defeat enemies. Personally I'm a fan of gear grind. But I like the idea of the majority of items being crafted by players maybe?"
9avet0,Game idea : Magellan age exploration RPG,"I was listening to a hardcore history about globalization and it got me thinking how challenging it was to explore the unknown then. \n\nMy concept - \nAround the year 1500 when the “global powers” and explorers are trying to discover the world, prove its round and not flat and go an adventure. \n\nYou’re a sea captain that directs a crew. You decide how to pack your ships, fleet size, crew, gather info etc. assign crew members tasks and jobs like a ‘Banished ‘ game style\n\nSet sail with the goal of finding new territory, spices, goods, and things for your overloads. \n\nDifficulties that arise are pirates, disease, famine, strange natives that may either welcome you with open arms or poison darts, getting lost at sea, storms, crew mutinies, pirates, enemy factions and the lot that goes with sailing. \n\nMap - have the option for earth (but that would kind of take away from the blind exploring part as we know about earth) or a randomly generated globe. \n\n\nWas an idea I had floating around that I thought would be a challenging fun game. I guess almost Like Oregon trail 2.0 but more open world and on the waters. "
9auoc3,Realistic evolution game idea,"Are you tired of games like spore where you are promised a realistic evolution game but get something so scientifically inaccurate it makes flat earthers look intellegent? I am. That's why I spent 5 minutes thinking of how a REAL evolution game should play. The game starts with you as a cell. Not just any cell, but the first cell. The only cell. You take control of this cell to swim around a 3d environment in the ocean full of chemical soup. You collect enough different types of chemicals, and boom! You reproduce. Now this is where it gets different than all other evolution games. This is where it gets it right. There is no character creator, because nature doesn't have a character creator in evolution. Instead, the gane gives you 3 or more slightly different mutated versions of yourself to choose from, one of these options being the same organism with no mutations. You choose one to play as next, and the other options are then controlled by AI and are a seperate species that will collect chemical soup and reproduce to have thier own different offspring turning into thier own new species. This is how real evolution works. To prevent the game from becoming flooded with species, natural selection would obviously take place on all species by the environment or by other species. This would make it to where the game gets progressively more diverse, and you have to keep getting better to keep up lest you risk extinction. When you finally evolve multiple cells by chance, the mutations will look different. You will become more like an aquatic creature than bacteria and will eventually be able to eat other cells and organisms (unless you like a boring game and chose to have chloroplasts in you for sone god forsaken reason). The new evolutions will be things like more cells and normal cell evolutions during early multi cellular stage and progress towards basic limbs, fins, organs, and other complex adaptations. You DO NOT need to evolve to go on land. You can live your life happy as a fish throughout the whole game. There is no need for civilization stages as the game will never run out of content. Why won't it run out of content? Because the world keeps evolving, the AI adding new animals, new plants, and new challenges. This will continue forever, getting more distinct as it goes, because this is evolution"
9aumpm,"A good, immersive Roman Empire/Soldier game","(This is long but I would appreciate feedback) I myself am obsessed with the Roman Era, specifically the military aspect. In my opinion, the Roman Empire has been completely overlooked in terms of video games. I love games, and am constantly looking for a game that interests me. My idea for this game is the story of a rags to riches story about a shopkeeper’s son, who joins the the army as a recruit. You will be able to customize your character to whatever you like, and name him what you want to relate as much as possible. What I would like for the game is for it to be like Ryse:Son of Rome and God of War in terms of combat, where there’s combos and different weapons and armor available as you rank up. It would be amazing if there was an enormous variety of armor and weapons so that it wouldn’t be a struggle to access different armor and weapons, because I’m not a fan of working hard for appearances and weapons when you’re supposed to be focused on the combat, storyline, and immersion. I also like the player to have what they want, while being challenged with the actual game. Mixing that with choices to make the game go one way or the other and commanding your own legion in an open world environment would be awesome. It would be almost like Skyrim in terms of quests and missions, except both the missions and quests effect the storyline, so that there are no useless quests. I also think that there should be some sort of government system that effects the game. This is all I have in terms of basic details but if you guys have ideas or anything that would be awesome."
9e7ueh,"A multiplayer dungeon crawler with two teams: The Crawlers and the Keepers. The crawlers play the game as a roguelike, while the Keepers design the layout and enemies as the Crawlers explore.","I'm thinking room styles like Link to the Past or Binding of Isaac. Two teams, the Crawlers and the Keepers, will be controlled by humans. It could be either 1v1 all the way up to 4v4. The Crawlers play the game as a ""normal"" roguelike, choosing character classes, leveling up, finding new items, etc., while the Keepers have a room editor (moderately simple, but complex enough to give variety and options) where they design rooms AS the Crawlers are exploring.\n\nThe dungeons could start off with say, a 3 room by 3 room area generated by the game. This would give the Keepers time to get a few rooms designed. The Keepers would design a room with a drag and drop editor, placing enemies and hazards such as saw blades, arrow traps, or ""Solve this quickly or die"" puzzles (already made, just randomized for that instance). They would then place their room adjacent to an existing room (doorways would be generated automatically by the game). Keepers would use some sort of resource, so they can't just spam 99 enemies in a room. Their resource would be GENERATED by A) Time and B) Damaging Crawlers. Meanwhile, the Crawlers will be getting loot from enemies, chests, and puzzles that they solve. After placing X amount of rooms, the Keeper would get to design a Boss Room that has a boss of their choice to finish off that floor. The Crawlers will have an end-game goal of defeating X amount of bosses, while the Keepers need to kill every hero.\n\nBasically Binding of Isaac meets Ultimate Chicken Horse meets Dungeon Keeper. \n\nRandom gameplay elements that I've been thinking of:\n\n* Keepers could spend extra points (or maybe a secondary resource) to place modifiers, such as Extra HP, Broke (doesn't give gold), Juggernaut (Large and powerful), Speedy (faster movespeed/attacks), etc. on enemies\n\n* There would be a procedural generation system to allow for people to just play the game without any Keepers, or the Keepers would be controlled by AI (same effect)\n\n* Keepers could have different classes as well. A Cryptkeeper could have access to only death-themed rooms and enemies, a Necrokeeper could be a class that can't create his own enemies, but can steal dead enemies from other rooms to put in his own with extra powers, etc. A Frostkeeper could have ice-themed rooms and enemies, etc.\n\n* The Keepers should probably also get special powers once per level, like ""For 15 seconds, all enemies focus on a target of your choice."" or ""In this room, heroes will always have 10% slower movement speed.""\n\n* A Shopkeeper would be an NPC that allows the Crawlers and Keepers to trade. As in, the Crawlers could sell unwanted equipment for gold to buy other items, but the unwanted equipment and gold they spend is converted into points for the Keeper team.\n\n* The points of everything should scale. So 4 people playing Crawlers should be able to have a balanced game against a single Keeper, and vice versa. Basically, for each Crawler, the Keeper team should get a certain number of points, which are then split equally between all Keeper team members.\n\n* For games where there are more Crawlers than Keepers, dead Crawlers should join the Keeper team so they can stay involved in the game.\n\n* The game should be pretty frenetic and fast-paced to encourage Keepers to keep designing rooms and Crawlers to keep exploring, so that way the Crawlers aren't stuck waiting for rooms to be designed, and the Keepers aren't stuck waiting for Crawlers to hurry up. Maybe if the Crawlers are stuck in a room for 10-15 seconds after the last enemy is dead, the AI will auto-generate a room and deduct it from the Keepers' currencies.\n\nThoughts?"

9e181w,A First Person Action/Horror Game set in the 13th Century by finding clues to exorcise a Demon,"Story:\n\nThe Order of the Church assembles a small band of Mercenaries to Protect a Priest of the Holy Church is sent to investigate the cause of the Black Death.\n\nThe Characters and playstyles:\n\nThe Knight- A Knight who abandoned the Crusades after a traumatic experience and wants to be absolved of his Sins so he decides to leave the Crusade and become a Knight for Hire accompanied by his closest ally the Painted Man. \n\nHis Playstyle is combination of Offense and Defense, his armor is strong and thick while his weapons are heavy he can deal with Crowds without any problem.\n\nThe Painted Man- a Muslim Soldier who was rescued by the Knight during the Crusades during his time as a Prisoner of War. They became close allies after the Truce between Richard and Saladin, The Knight Protects him as he he Protects the Knight. \n\nHis Playstyle is focused on dealing as much damage as possible due to his weapons being light and fast.\n\nThe Huntress- A woman hired by the Church reluctantly but due to her tracking skills she was hired by the Church for a mission to escort and guide the Priest on his investigation. \n\nHer playstyle focuses more on Ranged Combat, her tracking skills also is a advantage to find trails whenever they are lost.\n\nThe Priest- A son of a Apothecary his skill in the field of Medicine is appreciated by the Church, unfortunately mysterious deaths have been rampant all over the lands of Europe and started to spread further like a Plague. The Church teaches him the ways of Exorcism and with his knowledge of Medicine their faith on this Priest, he is perfect for the mission to investigate the cases of the ""Black Death"" on whether this is a Natural cause or something more Supernatural.\n\nHis Playstyle is different unlike all the Characters they are more accustomed to Combat with weapons. The Priest fight with Relics like Holy Water, and scares them with his Crucifix which makes them reluctant to attack and avoid the group from getting overwhlmed. \n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is similar to Vermintide, players are equipped with a Melee Weapon and a Range weapon. But unlike most Co-op games where the path is linear the game encourages players to explore together and find clues. \n\nThe clues consist of Tomes, 5 in total per map and must be delivered to the Priest to decipher in which he plays a mini game, Safehouses are scattered, 3 in total in the map in which the Huntress can track down trails on areas that can be explored. Safehouses aren't really that safe per-say since Enemies can still break in the doors and windows but can be reinforced and repaired by players.  Players who die will respawn in a certain amount of time in a random area the player can shout for help to get the attention of the others to be freed.\n\nOnce the Tomes have been deciphered the Tomes will reveal the Demons name and now the Priest gains the ability track the source of Unholy essence to perform Exorcism. The exorcism begins by finding the ""Infected Host"" and must be defeated and restrained. The Priest must pressure the Demon in a Interrogation like system to cast out the demon, tools to help include the Holy Water and the Crucifix to further cast the demon out while the other players must protect the priest from the Demon's Forces but here is also a Catch if the Priest is unable to cast out the demon in time, The Demon leaves the host and becomes a Physical Manifestation and becomes  a Boss Battle.\n\nWhile the Knight, Huntress, and the Painted Man are Combat and weapon focused characters, The Priest uses Relics like Holy Water in which he can find Altars to Refill, they deal huge amount of damage and is very useful in Exorcism, he is also exclusive with the Crucifix Mechanic in which he can slow down or stop hordes of enemies. To make him have a Melee weapon he can only use Bluny weapons like Hammers, maces, and clubs.\n\nEnemies:\n\nUndead- Weakest opponent in the game but usually attack in numbers.\n\nPossessed- Average enemies unlike the Undead the can cling through walls.\n\nWitches- They usually dance in a group in fires but if they spot you they will go berserk and attack you relentlessly.\n\nPiper- Summons a horde of Rats that damages slow players dowb in some areas to scare the hordes one player must have a Torch in hand to scare them off. To get rid of the Rats they must kill the Piper to dissipate the Rats completely.\n\nGlutton- A fat man/woman choking with phlegm and mucus, they omit the sound of snorting. They often commit suicide to leave flesh eating maggots that hurts player if they get too close.\n\nNecromancers- often found with a pile of corpses that spawn Undead and breathes out Toxic Gas\n\nUnborn- Fetuses mutated by Unholy means they often lounge at players at creates screeching noises\n\nThe Infected One- the Demon's host they will only spawn if the Tomes are collected and deciphered. They have telekinetic abilities to defend themselves. Once defeated the Priest must exorcise the Infected One but it often call for help From Hordes. \n\nThe Demon- High Health and Damage they can also fly and has various abilities like throw Flames , create storm of insects to blur your vision, and chew players to regain Health.\n\nI know some mechanics sounds unfun especially the Priest"

Many elements of the game are random, such as some treasures, enemies, etc. \n\nCharacters gain exp for their troubles, leading to permanent buffs, such as HP upgrades, more magic, revival potions, etc.\n\nThere are moments of quieter exploration, secret finding, and fighting lower level enemies, but for the most part, you will spend most of your time fighting bosses.\n\nNow, here comes the fun part; if you die during a boss encounter, and are not revived by an ultra rare revival potion within 10 seconds, the boss will attempt to bribe you into helping them.\n\nThere are, of course, great benefits to accepting, and great consequences for refusing. For instance, going back to the dragon example, the bribe could have been something along the lines of, *slay the others for 30,000 gold, and should you decline, I’ll take 25% of your max HP.* Accepting the bribe carrying it out successfully earns the win condition, refusing the bribe leads to exiting the game, but accepting the bribe and killing the boss leads to the lose condition, without exiting the game.\n\nBribes become more complicated and morally challenging as the bosses get harder.\n\nOf course, for easier coordination and cooperation, there would be an option to play with friends, however; the real meat and potatoes of Backstabber’s Bounty is the random mode, where you play with random players, without any means to communicate. (Other than generic in-game commands, like, “This way!” Or “Help me!” Etc.)"
9e0d8p,A game where you travel further and further back in time,"A game where you start in the ruins of a grand estate. As you discover things, you gain the ability to travel back in time to earlier and earlier points in the estates history. \n\n You observe the generations of characters who live there, seeing them as adults first, then as children, then their parents, etc etc. Lots of dramatic possibilities from seeing an evil adult, for example, and then the innocent child they once were, or vice versa.\n\nJust a loose story idea, the game play could be general walking simulator stuff.

9dzw2c,What Zombies mode is better?,"I’m currently designing a free-to-play shooter called: World War Online. But my team are conflicted between two design styles for zombies. Just heading to Reddit for some outside options. Tell me which is better in the comments!\n\n1. Salmon Run Style\nReign Of Shadows (Zombies):\nThe first map in the WWO Zombies Saga. During Goliath’s assault on the world, Shadow Ops stages a counter-attack on their headquarters. Falling into a trap set by Goliath. The assault team is wiped out, leaving only four survivors. Together, they must push back the hordes. Battling their way into enemy headquarters. To finish the fight their allies couldn’t. \n\nOPENING CUTSCENE:\nRed glowing lights illuminate a plane. It rocks and shakes as the soldiers prepare. Shadow Ops symbols are etched onto the walls. A commander gathers them around the jump doors.\n\nCommander: “I don’t think y’all need a prep talk. So let me make it simple. We are jumping straight into enemy territory. They won’t be expecting us, but they have monsters we can’t dream of. They will rip you! They will eat you! You will die suffering. But! If you succeed, if you pull trough. You can save your friends. You can save your families. We can save everyone! Hoorah!”\n\nThe soldiers prepare to drop. One Japanese Agent complains about having to work with them. Before being scolded by an M16 Agent. Who also scolds a drunken Russian. But an American solider pulls them to the jump door. They jump.\n\nThe assault team lowers slowly trough thick clouds. Voices come over the radio. The American solider listens, “Stop! It’s a trap! They know we’re coming!” Planes cut trough the fog and gun down soldiers. Bird-like monsters eat people in gulps. The entire scene descends into chaos as flak guns blast people out the sky. Dozens spiral out of control onto the beach.\n\nThe remaining soldiers rush onto the beach. Monsters spring from the ground and consume them. Machine gun fire sprays down those who remain. Ten soldiers make it to a door. They blast it open, causing a monster to consume most of them. The four survivors run into the elevator as it descends.\n\nThe elevator grows quiet as the battle outside ends. The survivors look at each other. The Agent lays out their circumstances, forcing them to work together. They all introduce themselves before getting on the radio. Command explains, “We have good and bad news. Bad news? You’re the last ones left. Good news? We can get you out of there. We’re feeding the info to your glasses. Even though it was a trap, the building’s layout is likely the same. Everything is simple. Find three power cores from the area. Use each of these to fuel to a generator. Once the generators are on, those monsters will be after you. Defend the generators and we can get you out.”\n\nZOMBIE KILLING:\nThere are many different types of zombies. But most can be killed in the same-or-similar ways. Shots to the body will damage and slow the zombie. Too much damage will destroy the body and reduce it to a bouncing head. Which can be crushed to finish the zombie. Players can also destroy limbs to slow down the hordes. \n\nGAMEPLAY STYLE:\nZombies is built around rogue-like combat and gameplay. Every run has different objectives and zombies. Encouraging players to keep discovering new things.\n\nMatches revolve around completing objectives to recover cores. These can range from killing zombies to completing puzzles. Collecting cores allows players to active the generators around the map. \n\nThe corruption is a major part of the Zombies experience. Changing the map by cutting off certain areas every round. As the corruption rises, areas are cut off and zombies become more powerful. \n\nStyle 2. Classic\n\n Call Of The Dead (Zombie Map):\nThe start of the Zombies saga. Set in the dark remains of a High School campus. Players must fend off endless waves of undead as they attempt to break the endless loop they’ve been trapped in. In a intense and terrifying zombies experience that stands above the rest. \n\nSTORY:\nSet during Goliath’s invasion, a High School is overwhelmed by undead. The students are transformed into flesh-eating monsters. Except for an unlucky four that come back to life. Discovering they’re locked in an endless loop of suffering. Unless they can find a way to stop the apocalypse and end the loop.\n\nZOMBIES:\nThere are dozens of different zombie types. From small differences in health and look. To major brutes like Enforcers or speedy monsters like the: Leapers. Each one will require a different strategy to take down. Making it best to work together with a coordinated team. Or, set traps to surprise and eliminate the undead. \n\nGameplay:\nThe currency system of Zombies is: Soul Vials, which can be collected by killing zombies. These can be spent to open areas. Or, call in supply drops packed with ammunition and random weapons. Which can be upgraded at certain points around the map. Collect guns and see how many waves you can survive. \n"

9dxogu,Dungeon Ninja [Dream],"I have no experience in game making so this is pretty much a dream XD.\n\nEver wonder why keys and boss keys are usually just laying around. Is it the incompetent guards? Why are bosses locked in, instead of locking the player character out? it just lazy game design? No. It's the key fairy or as they liked to be known as, the Dungeon Ninja (probably set up some lore about a dungeon ninja guild).\n\nThe game would start as an overhead 2d adventure game like Zelda I, with about the same graphics. Eventually, when you level up enough, you can go on into a 2d metroid/dead cell view, and then the third level would be a 3rd person platformer game (think Mario). \n\nYour goal is to find 4 dungeons per level and sneak in. There would be a hub world where you can explore it a bit and follow/trick enemies into going back to their base so you can find them easier. If you're caught in a dungeon, you get thrown out of the dungeon and the dungeon is locked, if you don't get through all the dungeons on a level, you can't continue to the next level. The final level has one massive dungeon. If you die or don't set all boss keys, you get demoted and have to go back to the first level. I was thinking of having your boss give you a performance review at the end of a level. \n\nInitially you can put keys in chest or on guards (from behind, without them knowing about it. As you place keys you get experience points and can gain new options. At first you can only place keys into chests or on enemies (you must sneak behind them in order to do so). As you level up you can start putting keys in walls (and leave behind fake walls to denote hidden keys). \n\nThe dungeons would be randomly generated as would the enemies. The hub worlds would stay the same, except for where the dungeons are located. Sometimes a dungeon might be located in the well of an abandoned city or in the side of a mountain. \n\nYou only get 4 keys (and locks) and 1 boss key (and lock) for each dungeon at the start of the game. You can only carry 5 keys/locks (4/1). While you will be able to carry more normal lock and keys, you will only ever get one boss lock/key.\n\nTrying to fight monsters, well, that isn't exactly a safe way to go about things and will get you kicked out. Getting caught isn't the end of things, sometimes you get thrown out and locked out... Until you set the boss key... Then they're out to kill.\n\nWhen you find a boss, your goal is do one of two things. Find a way out and put a normal lock on the door (denoting that this is a mini boss) or find your way out and put a boss lock on the door. Your goal then is to hide the boss key somewhere so that the enemies won't find it. Once getting out of a boss room, and putting the lock in place, new routes can open up. Enemies will realize that the boss door is now locked and are gonna be killing you on sight as you attempt to hide the boss key. You must escape the dungeon one you set the boss lock and key to get full XP points. \n\nEventually as you level up you can use your experience to buy traps, sleep darts, and other tools and items such as smoke bombs and other items to help you run away from enemies, stun them, or incapacitate them for a few seconds. You only use non-lethal methods. While adventurers may kill and save the day, you don't have those skills, your skills are about infiltration and sabotage. \n\nThe further you get into a dungeon the more XP you get. You get said XP from checkpoints. Once you use up all your keys/locks, you leave the dungeon. The more key/locks you have, the more XP you have... However, you don't get to keep as much XP if you don't do your job and where you put the keys will also tally into it (chests are worth less than guards for example).\n\nYour XP gets tallied after the 4 dungeons of a level and then you can spend the XP to gain features and equipment. You can expand your backpack so that you can take weapons in order to put them on chests for additional XP bonuses. \n\nI would like to add story elements but I haven't thought much on that one. Probably something silly where the ninja are very serious about their job to help the main protagonist of the world. Maybe borrow some ideas from Venture Brothers and make the protagonist/antagonist set up a meta business model in the game's world. \n\n"
9dx0ut,Ubisoft Tower Defense,"Basically a tower defense game where you prevent numerous Ubisoft characters from Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Watchdogs, and a car from the Crew from climbing/driving up your tower.

As a multiplatform title, there will be exclusive characters based on the platform like Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn for Sony and Link (Breath of the Wild) for Nintendo. \n\nThere can be a unique multiplayer component where one player controls the tower defense, while other players try to climb the tower using one of the Ubisoft characters.

9dtm1s,"Rebuilding Eden: A game about an alien species trying to restore life to a ruined Earth, post-humanity","Name \n\nRebuilding Eden\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDifficulty to Create\n\nIndie studios\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCore Concept\n\nThe basic core concept is an ecologically-minded RTS game structured around terraforming where you accrue currency to spend based on meeting core goals set out by the game. You have to manage your resources and the ecology of Earth if you want to fully restore life to the Earth.\n\n \n\nStoryline\n\nYou are a member of an alien species called the Guardians who travel from star to star seeding new worlds and restoring the worlds where the dominant species ruined the planet and hit the Great Filter. Once, your kind visited Earth and laid the foundations for a new world - teeming with life - but now the world is a husk of what it has once been. Most life is gone and there is a profound sadness felt in the Guardians' messages to the player character, as they are mourning the life that was there before. Your mission is simple: you must restore life on this planet to what it once was. This will be no easy task though, as everything from mass deforestation to hot oceans and radioactive wastelands are all that remain of crumbling ruins of humanity. Your technology can only achieve so much. Your ingenuity must meet the challenge where the technology cannot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game starts with scanning the planet and identifying areas that can be restored. You could have five to seven areas per continent, and 2-3 areas per ocean that act as places where you can terraform. The areas are graded from very easy to fix to very hard, and each requires something different. Each area is essentially a level in a campaign. Between the number of areas across the three phases, there could be as many as 150 levels, leading to a very long game with a great degree of learning and specialisation required at relatively little cost to the developers. Once the initial areas are designed, the only things that really change are the general parameters.\n\nWhen you start an area, you have a list of key parameters you need to meet to advance to the next phase. Each area on the planet needs to be completed on a single phase before the next phase unlocks. Each successive phase is more difficult than the last, and a phase change unlocks brand new features, but also ramps up the difficulty. By the time the players reach the end of phase 3, the difficulty is much greater than it was in the first phase. Each area has three phases, and are as follows: \n\nPhase 1: The first phase is when the ecology is devastated and the key remedying actions include environmental cleanup and the very beginnings of seeding small plants to create ground cover to minimise erosion. The biomes are still unstable, and need further work to create stability.\n\nPhase 2: The second phase is for when the air, water, and soil are clean and sanitised. Basic ground cover has been maintained and larger plants can be planted and maintained. Arthropods, fish, insects, and small mammals are being reintroduced according to their biome. The biomes become relatively stable at this point, but are still vulnerable to drastic changes. \n\nPhase 3: The third phase is the finishing of the stability of the biome, but, consequently, it is the most difficult. Larger animals are introduced, but the greatest challenges come from managing the food chain and preventing a total collapse. \n\nWhen you start an area, you have a list of key parameters you need to meet to advance this area to the next phase. On the other side, there are also losing conditions for each stage which can end the current area and force a restart. Once the terraforming process begins in a stage, it is an uphill battle to drag the area - kicking and screaming - into the next phase. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself, each particular aspect of a biome has machinery that helps to modify the environment around it. For example, you can have a mass filtration system that can clean water of radioactive particles, slowly reducing the radioactivity of the whole water body. Each piece of machinery costs currency, but can be recycled for a return of currency at about 60% of the initial cost of the machinery. This is to encourage creativity and to avoid punishing mistakes too harshly. It's something that feels necessary to avoid min-maxing and to encourage creativity among the player base. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just ballpark brainstorming on my part, something to consider and possibly pull neat aspects from for the gameplay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf someone does decide to make this game, I would just like some attribution, a chance to help in the alpha/beta, a copy on release, and maybe the chance to help write dialogue - I would be happy to help write dialogue without charge.

9dt6bi,Card game idea,"I've been working on a card game for PC for quite some time, and just want to see what you guys think of the idea.  \nI've become frustrated with the currently available virtual card games and wanted to make one that gets rid of concepts I deem problematic.\n\nThe game will play like a mashup of Yu-Gi-Oh!, Hearthstone, and SolForge.\n\nThe game is set in a Sci-fi universe with fantasy worlds and beings. Each card will represent a single person/thing and the card text will describe the most important elements of their lives, why they are known and should be remembered. Something along the lines of reading a history book and learning about the most influential people.\n\nCard text will be talking about the lore of the card, and not directly describing what happens when the card is played. I feel that this will add a lot of mystery to the experience when played at first (like for example The Binding of Isaac), and for experienced players, the text will hold enough information to recollect what the card does. The idea is to integrate the lore into the players experience and not just have it in some separate menu.\n\nNo topdeck wars, or at least not in a way that we know them today. Players draw 2 cards per turn.\n\nNo RNG - no card effects will have a random factor to them.\n\nBattle has no player interaction, cards simply attack the cards in front of them, if there is no card in front the player gets attacked directly. I want to put a bigger emphasis on positioning of the cards and this should provide more thinking time.\n\nAcquiring new cards will simply be done by seeing them. As this is meant to become a multiplayer experience, when a new card is played by your opponent 2 copies of the card will be added to your card library. This means that there will be no card packs, and that players will easily get access to all the cards.\n\nAll the in-game music will be generated by player's actions, and the entire experience will have a sense of rhythm to it (all the sounds will play on beat). To further describe the music, the bass will always be playing and so will the drums. When a card is played its music will play on the beat. If an effect is triggered the corresponding drums will play along. This feature was meant to help people that like to alt-tab during the game, enough information should be conveyed through the music so that the player can gather what the opponent is doing while not looking at the game.\n\nNo mana system - Or rather it's similar to Hearthstone's mana system, but every card costs 1 mana. The game grants you 3 mana at most per turn (some cards can increase this number). Mana persists over turns, so none is wasted if you decide to wait.\n\nThere are 2 rows of fields, and every card can be played at any position and any row. Depending on when and where it's played the card will take one of its 4 forms (2 forms for each row). This essentially makes it so that every card represents 4 possible options, so that it's harder to be helpless in any situation.\n\nDecks are between 40 and 60 cards. Similarly to Yu-Gi-Oh! the game is over once you have no cards to draw, but since this can be a rather anticlimactic finish, the first time you run out of cards in the deck, your graveyard is removed and put in the place of the deck. This will grant the player a few more turns, while playing at a great disadvantage (since the opponent knows their entire deck).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game will be completely free without any microtransactions, anyone that wants to check it out when it's released can write me to keep them personally updated.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I've thought about many problems in card games and these are my solutions. I might have skipped something important so if anything wasn't explained with enough depth, don't hesitate to ask :)  \nAnd please leave your thoughts in the comments!  \n"
9dpmb0,Shadow Bound: An RPG where there are real downsides for using your powerful special abilities.,"# Story: (Bound to change)\n\nHumans and monsters are living together in kinda harmony, but then a towering beast appears and demolishes everything in its path ruthlessly. Since they are not on their best terms, humans and monsters blame each other for this. The world powers are unable to stop it with all of their force. When most of the world is ruined, a group of friends have an idea. They believe that this beast's origins lie in long forgotten monster magic, and they specifically believe that a certain spell will take down this giant. The 3 of them search the world to learn about this forgotten art.\n\n# Characters:\n\nSteven: A young human who is skilled at the guitar, the the ""leader"" of this band of dudes. He can play songs which can help your team if you play well, or downgrade them if you play badly.\n\nPharah: A phoenix girl who is trying to learn magic. She and Steven were friends for a while, and despite both having feelings for each other, they have never had the courage to admit it.\n\nJude: Another fellow monster/magic user, Jude is Steven's close friend, and will stick with him even during the Human/Monster controversy.\n\nCasey: Some random  human dude who decided to show up, Casey will easily put his safety in jeopardy for the battle. All of his special moves require some hp. \n\n# Gameplay:\n\nThe main gimmick of this game, is that their will be bigger, legitimate downsides to using powers. Like for example, if you use 2 powers in the same battle, or in the span of 2 minutes in the overworld, all of your stats will go down, and if you overwork them way to much, you could lose that party member to perma-death. Or a DPS character could risk doing damage to himself to do alot of damage."
9douvi,Deep Learning experience,"A game that takes the play style of the user, and sets that as the basis of any npc within the game. The game itself would be something similar to metal gear solid V, hitman, assasin's creed, etc. and the enemies attack based on how the player attacks. For example, if the player in the beginning of the game attacks stealthily, later on in the game, the player is getting attacked by an npc playing stealthy. \n\nIt could be set up so that if the player chooses to connect online, it would implement all other play styles of other users into the game. \n\nThis way the characters within the game would learn to fight through the players itself, making it constantly changing and allowing for the game to grow on its own."
9doe2k,"A human fights his way out of a robot military base, getting cybernetic implants along the way, only to realize by the end that he gave up his humanity.","In a robotic post-apocalypse, a few pockets of humans still resist against the robots. One of the last heroes of humanity is captured by the robots at the top of a skyscraper military base.\n\nIt's a 2D (or 3D) roguelike shooter. You play as the human fighting/shooting/hacking/platforming your way down the tower. Along the way you can get a variety of cybernetic upgrades that replace body parts. The upgrades are the kind of stuff that would fit in a Deus Ex game. Eventually you get to upgrade your vision along with most of your body to make your way down past so much of the tower's defense.\n\nThe last floors are extremely difficult, however, so you're incentivized to get a final set of implants/upgrades that replace the last human parts you had left. Once you beat the final floor, it's revealed that everything (from your ""escape"" to the upgrades) was according to the AI's plan to convince humans to become one with the AI. In fact, you passed the ground floor long ago and have been falling deeper underground ever since.\n\n### How It Works\n\nIt's sort of like *Dredd* or *The Raid* in that you're locked in a complex and must work your way past an army to escape. There's also elements of *Spec Ops: The Line* or Hideo Kojima's *P.T.* (in which you almost literally spiraled down to hell) in that it uses the hero's descent to be analogous of going crazy.\n\nThe game's balance would incentivize getting upgrades. The upgrades are unassuming at first, such as a wrist-mounted plasma canons. But the bigger, better and more expensive upgrades later down the line will actually replace body parts. The synthetic eyes become particularly relevant to the plot/theme. \n\nRocksteady, the developers of *Batman: Arkham Asylum* were disappointed when they discovered through analytics that players turned on Batman's Detective Vision and never turned it off. It was just so damn useful. The vision upgrades would do the same for this game. However, if the player doesn't turn off his enhanced vision mode on the ground floor, he will be tricked into thinking it's just another floor. The vision mode will hide the exit. The player will continue to descend underground thinking they're still going towards the ground floor.\n\nThe underground sections get much harder, the upgrades more demanding, and the resources for upgrades more plentiful. The ""final boss"" would be near-impossible without first turning yourself into a pure cyborg.\n\n****\n\nThe game mechanics are explained in-universe. Each time you start a game, you play a new captured hero. This is just the AI getting a new subject. Each death was the AI having to start fresh with another subject. The AI tries to balance the difficulty and resource economy of each floor to entice the heroes to get upgrades. It's also randomizing the layout to find the optimal strategy.\n\nAs is standard with roguelikes, there are multiple endings. One good ending is if the player turns off their enhanced vision mode on the ground floor and successfully escapes. The best might be if the player managed to stay 100% human by the time they escaped on the ground floor. But perhaps the most satisfying would be the first playthrough ending when the twist is first revealed."
9dl2h6,Essentially Multiplayer Hitman,"You and up to 3 other players are all assassins after the same heavily guarded target. The game could either be played cooperatively or in a competitive mode where only the first assasin to land the killing blow gets the payment. \n\nIn competitive mode, every player spawns a further distance from each other and starts out with the disguise of a civilian npc, making them more difficult to distinguish from one another and avoiding any conflict between players too early. This mode could also allow combat between assassins should they run into each other, sabotaging enemy traps or plans, and even the ability to try and rat out your enemies to the area's security team once you've identified them. \n\n"
9dkr4f,Johnny Johnny! No Papa!,"I just had a 200IQ game idea! Just imagine it.\n\nIts midnight, all lights in the two story house are off. Your character( Johnny) wakes up with a huge appetite. So he gets out of bed and goes around the house looking for food. The food is in random places throughout the house, and after 30 seconds of  game play there is a sound, Johnny Johnny! But really distorted and creepy. This signals that Papa is now after the player(Johnny). The player then needs to hide while also still getting food so Johnny doesn't die of hunger or thirst.\n\nThe player Hides behind furniture, under tables, and in cabinets or closets. If the player gets caught by Papa he will then ask them if the player(Johnny) is eating food. The player then responds with No Papa! If they get caught again Papa will ask if they are ""Telling lies!"". The player then responds with ""No Papa!"". But if the player gets caught a third time Papa will ask them to open their mouth, then proceed to kill the player.\n\nThe only way to beat the game is to eat and drink food(Randomly Generated Location) to stay alive, avoid Papa, and collect keys(Randomly Generated  Location) around the house to unlock the fridge(Randomly Generated Location) and enjoy all the food they can eat with a victory screen.\n\nThe game can be multiplayer, with two people playing as the children. Player 1 is Johnny, and player 2 is Chiya. Papa is an AI. Both players only have separate lives. Both players get 2 ""No Papa!"". After a player runs out and gets caught a third time that player dies, leaving the other player solo.\n\nThinking there could also be multiple difficulties, Normal, Hard, Extreme, and Nightmare.\n\nNormal is just Papa and a good amount of food and drinks spawned on the map. And the player only needs to find 5 keys.\n\nHard is Papa and Mama who work together to find the player, with lower food and drink spawns while also needing to find 6 keys.\n\nExtreme is Papa, Mama, and Grandma. Again lower spawns while needing 7 keys.\n\nNightmare is Papa, Mama, Grandma, and Grandpa. Same amount of spawns as Extreme but you need 8 keys.\n\nPapa, Mama, Grandma, and Grandpa each have different movement speeds and awareness. To make it more fair on Extreme and Nightmare, it would be made that each AI enemy can only patrol certain parts of the house."

The UI doesn't have to be nice and fancy, in fact it'd be cool to just have raw text and buttons.\n\nThe game is simple. You have $500 and a laptop to start, and from there you can make different decisions. You can invest in some stocks, deposit it into the bank, or start up a farm.\n\nThere are multiple farms, some of which make you more money but cost more to buy. A farm produces a couple of cents an hour, but you can set up multiple farms. From there you can choose to invest in different things like an extra computer, hiring a friend, upgrading your computer, or create another farm.\n\nHere are some ideas for expansions and farms:\n\n* game farms\n* click farms\n* crypto\n* new computer\n* new monitor\n* new hardware to prevent wearing it out\n* selling cpu power\n* bots to make free-to-make items and then selling them, particularly manual labor that's automated.\n* the farms don't need a lot, just some buttons.\n* folders for each farm, simulation for an os\n\n(By farm, I mean farms like mining crypto, click farms, or other things. Off the top of my head I can think of some Roblox farms where you make skins or outfits and sell them using a bot of sorts).\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

9d8ms5,A photographer simulator,"TL;DR: House flipper but your job is to be a photographer.\n\nSo you work as a photographer for a company (E.g. a magazine company) and your job is to take pictures of interesting animals, plants, sceneries, buildings... and they pay you depending on how good or bad the picture is. \n\nFactors that may change your salary: resolution, composition, what the image is about, was the image shaken...\n\nWith money you can buy better cameras, lenses, tripods (Yes, sometimes the picture would get shaken, and the only way to prevent that is with a better tripod), maybe some photographing courses. \n\nWhen you get more recognition you could start working for bigger companies and get better salary, and to get more recognition, you could start posting your pictures to the in-game social medias."

9d3hri,Creative way to design a magic-based combat system?,"The other day I was fantasizing about a new Harry Potter game and got inspired to develop a prototype for a real-time action magic-based game (*totally unrelated to the IP obviously*). Thing is, I couldn't really picture the best way to implement combat spells into the game in a way that feels rewarding and varied. A lot of ideas crossed my mind but I'm not sure which one is the most fun. The older Harry Potter games can be entertaining, but their combat was always minimal and/or lackluster. Which got me thinking, what combat system would fit those games the best?\n\n* In the first few games, combat was very simplistic. You basically held a button and stuff happened. \n\n* In the latter games, there were some mouse movement patterns to cast, but ultimately they became crappy third person shooters. The last two were particularly awful.\n\nI'm trying to find a balance here. A system that's not too spammy, having room for player skill to impact the outcome but also not so complicated that it'd make me wish it was a turn based game instead. \n\nOther than the Harry Potter movie tie-ins, games that are floating in my head are Arx Fatalis, Elder Scrolls games, Magicka, Lichdom Battlemage. Possibility of combining spells and being able to react to the oponent spellcasting seem like good ideas, but I'm not sure about ""spell drawing"". What do you guys think?"
9d2lul,Fly on a Wall,"TL;DR: stealth/wonky physics simulation type game where you play as a fly that’s actually a human turned into a fly so they can be the ultimate spy. You need to navigate your way around bad guys and find the intel you need. \n\nThe trick? These dudes go totally apeshit if they see you, not because they know your a spy, this is the first testing of the technology. They just really hate flies. They’ll slap at you, swing and throw objects they’ll even start shooting at you, eventually if you can’t lose their attention one of them pulls the pin on his grenade and blows the whole room to kingdom come screaming like a maniac as he does it.  If you’re really good you can get them to take each other out and then the rest of the level is a breeze, except not because breezes are like hurricanes for flies. \n\nThe same as an actual fly I feel time should move a little slower, giving you enough time to get out of the way of the enemies wild flailing. Control wise I think slower time helps as well, cause you can make it the fly’s flight as graceful as possible. Then I had an idea where at the end of a level it spectates your gameplay but at normal speed so you can see your little self buzzing around then watch the enemies just lose their goddamn minds. \n\nThat’s basically it, not a terribly complicated game, sort of like Superhot in its mission layout but with more humor and is stealth based.

9cxoez,Medieval Trade Company (MTC),"The basic concept is that you run a trading company during 1100-1400. The goal is to make money, and not to rule a country like many other games during this period (e.i crusader kings/eu4). \n\nOne thing that should be in the game is choice, and those choice should make a difference. You should be able to choose your starting location, which will effect local prices, what things are locally produced, how much money people have, how much credit you can borrow, and so forth. Another way choice should affect the game is through events. Maybe there is a crusade going on, will you take part personally/sponsor or not at all? Or maybe the king wants to take out a loan to finance a war, how will you respond?\n\nI previously mentioned that locally produced goods should be affected by the region, which will affect your choice of starting region. Will you take part in the trading of luxury goods like spices and silk, or will you focus on large-scale trade of more common items like grain?\n\nThere should also be many different ways to spend your profits. Perhaps you will give a donation to the local church/monastery, or will you try to capture more of the market? \n  "

9cwr6s,"Ultra-realistic MMO (repost of mine old one, placed here back when there were only three posts in total)","So, the idea is: you are dropped in drop pod like [astroneer](https://astroneer.space/) , you choose landing site and you have only basic tools, you have to get something better than rock on stick or on rope. Game would be on VR using 2d treadmill (like [infinadeck](http://www.infinadeck.com/) ) and VR glove controllers. All players would be on one server. After some time (like certain events triggered by players) players would get notificitation implying something alongside ""pack up! (x time units) remaining!"" they would use some button on controller to spawn box in which they could put some things (not too much though). And now comes the big stuff: world would be fully interactable, server would be globe and most unrealistically (techwise) of all: creatures would be created by natural selection algorithms. All of trees and animals come from one or few common acestors, and minerals might even be used by some species of animals. "
9cwk8j,Hunger Games - The video game.,"You might have heard or thought of it before, but really... why the hell is there not a single video game based around this brilliant idea? Hear me out here before you comment something about Minecraft or how its not going to work. \n\nWe have all heard of Halo, CS: GO, Call Of Duty and Rainbow Six. All these have been massive successes in the gaming industry. Its the Team versus Team First person shooter concept that is common with these games. They have been around for the longest time and still remain popular. In 2017 a completely unique genre of ""Battle Royale"" surfaced and it has been the biggest, most popular thing since Counter Strike.  ( I personally have played these games for an estimated 5000 hours, so i believe i have an idea of what i am talking about).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there was one concept between all this that was completely forgotten. It was first introduced as a book, then a movie. You guessed it, its ""The Hunger Games"". People got exited about this for a bit and then it disappeared. Minecraft was pretty much the only game to take advantage of this idea and thus it was made into a ""Mini Game"" that was playable only in certain servers. This was a big thing in YouTube, which garnered attention for it and made many channels grow in popularity. Like the relation ship between Battle Royale Games and Twitch. Now \*im not trying to bring back Hunger Games\* but rather the concept\n\n \---&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*The Concept\*\n\n\- 50 Players spawn in a circle around ""the Cornucopia"" where a lot of loot spawns from weapons, meds to armour. You decide if you take the risk to join the battle for the loot. Loot also spawns around the map.\n\n\- Weapons would be mainly meelee weapons and different bows. Battle axes, compound bows, swords, daggers... you name it. Could also be guns, who knows.\n\n\- Before each game in the lobby you can pick a skill that suits your playstyle. The lobby also has training dummys and different props for target practice. \n\n\- Care Packages fall from the sky (1-3 at a time) in a random location. Like in Darwin project, these care packages could be voted for which would be a good feature for Streamers.\n\n\- Different ""disasters"" happen trough out the game which would force a group of players move from one location to another. These disasters can be forest fires, spikes falling from the sky, toxic gas or something equally threatening.\n\n\- You can craft traps or maybe find them in containers trough out the map. Also camouflaging yourself could be possible with a skill.\n\n\- At the end of the game players will be put to sleep or just teleported to the middle in a circle that shrinks. Last one(s) remaining win the game. Rewards could be just moving up in ranks or different skins.\n\n\- Duos and 3 player squads are available as game modes. Game will be ideally in first person.\n\n\- The Map. The map would ideally be a forest with lots of trees and some open grass fields. The map would also have to be almost completely flat with a couple of hills. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy this game concept should be taken to notice by big companies such as EA and Ubisoft? It fits all the demands of the video game market today. It would be a great game to be played by streamers (which is a big selling point for games these days) if done right, of course. Instead of rushing another singleplayer game like ""Assasins Creed"" or ""Metal Gear"" , how about this? I truly believe this is something that would garner a lot of attention and be a top seller."

9cqcfs,"A superhero management game where you protect a city from superhuman threats. Recruit and train supers and normals, build facilities, maintain relations with the public and the government, apprehend villains.","Basically, a management game where the player can select an existing champion at the start to be the first superhero in the team or generate an entirely new one. The setting would be perhaps a small city, said to be one of the last bastions of order in a world where the advent of powers has caused chaos. Powers come with the drawback that they have to be used regularly or else they take control of you for the sole purpose of destruction. The starting situation of the city would always be the same, but would actively develop during the playthrough. Most of the game's lore and story would have to be uncovered as you went. The ultimate goal would be to grow your team and improve the condition of the city.\n\nThe main gameplay environment would be a top-down city map through which the player would make administrative decisions on a turn-by-turn basis, such as building facilities, managing funds, and growing the team. As for the superheroes, they would have double identities, preferences, hopes and dreams, and morale. Events in their lives would affect their performance, and they might die or turn villain or get injured. Their powers would be procedurally generated from multiple parameters. eg: a main feature of fire and subtype of bolts, or main feature of telekinesis with affinity for glass.\n\nThe other gameplay type would be missions, where you would deploy the team and play a realtime, isometric battle. You would be able to deploy reactively (to an attack) or proactively (raid a lair) anywhere on the map. In these instances, there would be allies, enemies, and civilians. What groups fit into what categories would be determined before the battle. You might work with the police/army or attempt to overthrow them. In any case, harming civilians is always penalized. The control scheme would have to be more hands off to allow the characters to display personality in their fighting.\n\nOnce in a while there may be a catastrophic lore event that is triggered by conditions being met in play, such as having amassed 20 heroes or discovered a secret lab. This might be a giant monster, an invading gang of villains, etc. that may destroy the city and lose the game if your team fails to stop it. This makes it so that there are story landmarks while allowing each playthrough to be different. There will be an event at the end of the game which allows a win condition. \n\nAnyway, tell me what you think. I realize this has become more of a design rather than just an idea, so feel free to add your own designs based on the core idea. "
9cq4ac,Dead Days (Game Concept),"Dead Days is an open-world zombie survival game set in America. Players wake up in a zombie infested hospital. They have no tools, food, or weapons. Just their weak body and their wit. Forced to survive thirty in game days.\n\nEvery day is fifteen minutes. Each day has its own day and night cycle. But days can be skipped by sleeping. If players do, they need to choose secure locations. Otherwise a zombie may sink it’s teeth into their flesh. Which would cause death. PERMA-DEATH. \n\nDeath means you must restart your thirty days. But, keep the blueprints and skills you learn. After five days, The Great Horde will spawn. Millions of zombies will consume a random location in America. Growing rapidly every day until the entire map is consumed. If the player can stay ahead of the horde, they must survive the last three days in a zombie-infested map. Where zombies become a lot more bloodthirsty and desperate.\n\nDead Days also offer Multiplayer. Fifty players spawn with random loot. But always includes a gun, bag of food, and tools. Gaining more resources will make you more powerful. But will also highlight the location around you to other players. Meaning you could meet a powerful ally or a desperate threat.\n\nJust a game idea! Please leave thoughts below! \n"
9coolg,"A VR game that isnt VR. Instead, each eye sees the world in the past and present.","So you know how the VR works by presenting the same world rendered a few inches to the left and right in order to mimic the human eyes capability for producing 3d vision. While, how about instead of using the screens for that purpose, we allow two separate images at the same time in different times or locations, and the game is played by closing each eye and comparing the worlds to each other in order to discover things and solve puzzles.\n\nFor instance, closing your left eye would give you a clear picture of the room youre in, with a locked door, and then closing your right eye would reveal that there used to be a level to the left of the door which has since been covered up. \n\nThe story would be something along the lines of, your left eye has been endowed with magic allowing you to see the past.\n\n\n"

Also, in the way that Stardew Valley is a fan-made off-brand love letter to Harvest Moon, this would be a fan-made off-brand Hogwarts, where the setting shares features and spirit with the Harry Potter universe without sharing licensed details or names: Using Hogwarts as a conceptual template to build the open RPG those books never had. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCarrying on the Stardew Valley analogy, this game would have a similar open-endedness and slow burn. There would be no linear plot beyond the relationships you develop with other characters, and the passage of time across the school year, then over the summer, and through the next year and so on. You get the homework done and earn academic honor, or you just barely pass and focus your energy on learning to duel, or collecting artifacts, or exploring secret passages. \n\nCharacter creation would let you customize how you look and what your personality is like, with a survey to help sort you in school, and help pick your wand. You can buy robes, and later customize the inside of your dormitory room. The progress of the game would take you from your first year as a young magic-user through until your graduation."

9cjdis,A superhero/villain open world,"I have been looking for a good game where you can be a hero or a villain and not just follow story quests and actually play the part. Most superhero games are very story based and after the story there isn't really much saving going on. Minus Prototype, there aren't many open world games where you are the villain. Even then after the story, not much going on.\n\nMy idea is a open world game where the player can either be a superhero or super villain. After you choose your side, you are seated into a random lobby and will compete for the number 1 spot (respectively to your alignment). If you play in this lobby and then leave to go eat dinner or something and come back, you will be in that same lobby. After 24 hours the top ranking heroes and villains are rewarded and you are seated into a new lobby with different people. As a hero you would get rewarded with how fast you stop the crime or respond to the distress, how many people you save, etc. As a villain, how much chaos or people you hurt, how much money you steal, etc. Also, either side will get points based on stopping the other side in the process, gaining more points for how high they are up in the ranks. For example, a hero stops the #1 villain in the lobby would get more points than that of stopping a villain at the bottom. The players' own ranking will also take part in the total points given. If the bottom villain takes out the #1 hero, then they will receive a huge bonus for doing so (unless the hero is the only hero in the lobby, otherwise there could be some problems)\n\nMy biggest concerns with my own idea is how many options for heroes and villains there would be. Yes there are many super powers out there, but balancing all of them together may be difficult. The map size would be pretty decent size because my vision is about 20-24 players in a lobby. But this is an idea that I know would not be an easy task but would play nonstop."
9chf7n,Gimme your best ideas. (Plz),
9cgz76,Moose Rider,"Simple concept, there’s a moose standing unaware of the player, the player must quickly climb aboard and remain so whilst the moose loses its shit. It tears ass through the woods and eventually through a town, and then a city, and then you find your way into NASA and onto a ship and then to Mars and who knows where else you could go. That’s the basic idea but here’s why it’s entertaining.\n\nThere’s a stamina system for your hands and legs, each hand has a gauge and the legs share one that drains as the moose bucks and tries to fling you off, you’ll need to alternate your grip and hold on tight when the moose does something especially crazy. L Trigger grips the left hand, R trigger grips the right, and another button controls your legs grip. It’s best to use your legs if you run out of stamina for your hands, or if you just want to watch your upper body flail in the wind like an awkward but glorious flag. You’ll need to position yourself in way that allows your legs to grip though. You have very basic locomotion before riding the moose, you can move around and jump, the controls are actually a lot like human fall flat in that where you’re looking determines your hand placement, it’s just not quite as floppy as HFF, still floppy enough though that your guy looks hilarious while on the moose though. You want instances to happen where the moose bucks on an incline just as you released grip and it lifts you into the air but you manage to come down right back on top of the moose and get your grip again. Only if you touch the ground after being knocked off will the game end. Basically the whole point is just to see how far you get. \n\nStylistically taking a page from the katamari games I feel would add to this game’s appeal. "
9cgsed,Growth-Spurt,"TL;DR- The basic concept is you wake up in a laboratory and are told you’ll be doing some experiments. The main mechanic is that when you walk forwards you shrink, walk backwards and you grow. Walking sideways has no effect. You shrink down to mouse size at the smallest, and are about 40 ft tall at the largest. \n\nPortal-esque in that you’re solving puzzles for some mysterious corporation while being monitored, except in this the people are still there and the company isn’t just some AI run amok. The rooms are generally very large to accommodate your maximum size. Some are smaller specifically to limit you so you can’t cheese a puzzle with the mechanic.\n\nYou can also pick things up, throw them, and jump. Your movement is determined by the direction you push the left stick in and not where the camera is facing i.e. the right stick just controls camera position and not player locomotion, this helps when you want to walk sideways but also want to watch where you’re going. The camera is 3rd person.\n\nAt first puzzles are simple like grow to a large enough size that you’re heavy enough to activate a switch, and then on to things like having to shrink down to mouse size to fit through a hole, then having to grow tall enough in that room to through the object you needed through the hole at the top of the wall back into the room you came from. And eventually at the end the puzzles take a more free-form approach as you make your escape, your using the grow/shrink mechanic to avoid guards, stomp on scientists to get your revenge or sneak their offices to find a key card. Eventually you escape that’s the end pretty much.\n\nStyle wise I feel like anything could suit it, hell you could even change it to 2d if that’s more your bag. You could have it be funny and lighthearted, or go full grit and make it so when you grow and shrink it’s gruesome and horrible sounding. Either would work.\n\n"
9fwjj8,The Trench: A Game Concept,"I came up with this little idea in response to the overwhelming amount of WW2 shooters where you play as Badass McBulletproof and I thought it might be time for something different. I propose a classic point and click adventure game set during world war one, the game will have you attempting to survive day to day in a trench, with different scenarios playing out day by day. The game should have extremely well-written and likable characters you can interact with, get to know, and then watch get shot down in front of you Black's style by the end."
9ftkaf,The Simpletons - an experimental game about making NPCs talk and interact with each other using emergence.,"*Emergence* is when complex behaviors arise from the interaction of many, simple rules.\n\nAn example of a game that uses emergence is Scribblenauts. ""Wood burns,"" ""trees are made of wood,"" and ""flamethrowers make fire"" are rules that result in flamethrowers being able to burn trees. The developers didn't specifically script them to do that; they only made consistent rules that lead to this outcome.\n\nThis game would be a Sims-like game with various NPCs in a small community (a large family in a house, an office workplace, a youth campsite... pretty much any setting that's fit for a TV sitcom). You might be a character that interacts with them, or an outside observer with limited interaction.\n\n### Using emergence to create unscripted NPC dialogue and interaction.\n\nThis game would have simple, predictable rules that consistently interact with other rules to create unpredictable outcomes.\n\nFor example: ""imperative statements make others act,"" ""declarative statements proven wrong reduce trust,"" and ""lack of trust will make one ignore imperative statements."" So if NPC X tells NPC Y ""give me cake,"" then Y would normally give X cake. But if X had earlier told Y, ""it's raining"" and Y had realized it's *not* raining, then Y would not give X any cake.\n\nY not doing what X wanted results in X *hating* Y. In turn, this would lead to even more shenanigans between the two NPCs. NPCs have individual personalities in their wants/needs and their threshold for things like trust or affection.\n\nLike Scribblenauts, every object in the game is a noun. If there's a couch in the game, then there's a word ""couch"" to represent it as well. The same is true for adjectives. If the couch has internal settings to be colored blue or size large, then the words ""blue"" and ""large"" exist as well. Similarly, any actions that can be performed in the game are represented by their own verbs. If it can't be done in the game, then the game doesn't have a verb for it.\n\nThe joy of the game would be interacting with the NPCs and witnessing those interactions cascade and snowball into unpredictable outcomes. Or perhaps it's a puzzle game about trying to achieve *specific* outcomes by saying the right things to the right people."

9fp854,Kingdom Come: Deliverance but PIRATES,So like Kingdom Come: Deliverance it's realistic and you start off with no knowledge as a crew member with no respect and you're just following a Pirate Captain.

With realistic sword combat and pistol combat maybe axes and spears. Sounds pretty cool in my opinion!
9foxdr,"""Conway's Game of Death"", where multiple players take turns placing a few squares first on their own isolated part of the board, then gain access to more of the board as their pieces move out organically. Each player has their own color. You win if you dominate the board.","[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s\_Game\_of\_Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)\n\nRefer to the above link to see how the Game of Life rules are set up.\n\nI have made a couple of long, long game idea posts recently, so time for a short one. On a big square board with lots of grid space, players put about, hmmm, five squares without the logic of the game playing out. Then when all players have placed their squares, the game runs for a few steps, perhaps 5-15. Then they place more squares within the areas they've gained access to. Spread out and conquer. \n\nWin by controlling nearly the whole board (with all other players having five or fewer spaces, that is, the per-turn amount). Players have unique colors and perhaps shapes within the squares. The color of a newly generated square is determined by the majority color around it. (If 1/1/1, then chosen at random.)\n\nA more active mode would have the game play at a relentless pace, for example one game frame per two seconds. Players would still have a limited number of squares to make per turn, but the game could go fast enough for this not to matter much. Also, the number of squares per step could be selectable.\n\nMmmmm. To make things more interesting, players can skip turns to save up more squares then place pre-set shapes like guns and gliders as long as there is the space. Or whatever.\n\nOk. I typed it. I like it less than when I first thought of it. But there you go."
9fmb1i,A game set in Armageddon,"I have never seen a game that uses this setting, at least in the AAA area. Unlike in a post-apocalyptic setting that is caused by nuclear war, meteor, natural disaster, or human stupidity, this one is caused by a god with a plan for humanity. The only game I can think of that deals with this concept is  Shin Megami Tensei, Doom to some extent, and Bayonetta, so it's about time there should be a game with all of the next gen hardware we have available. I know a game like this can be controversial, especially for religious people, but these days what doesn't offend people? Anyways, here's my idea of what it could be like.\n\n\+**Story**\+\n\nThe forces of Heaven and Hell are at a stalemate. The world they're fighting in has been reduced to charred ashes. Hollowed out buildings remain that proved there was once a civilization before the apocalypse, fires and lava refuse to burn out, and clouds of thunder and dust block the skies from view. Those who have followed in the Creator's word have been taken to the Planes of Heaven. Those who didn't believe or follow the scriptures were left to rot on a dying planet. After years of plague, war, droughts, fire, disease, starvation, and famine, humans that are still alive linger on in settlements away from fighting or hunt savagely in the ruins. The Holy War rages on across the planet, however it is within the area of what use to be the western area of North America is where a campaign is at it's critical. You, a demon, an angel, or a human, have the power to decide the planet's victor. Will the angels complete the prophecy as fore told by the scriptures? Will the Dark Lord rule the planet at the end? The outcome will be decided by your actions.\n\n\+**Factions**\+\n\nThe Angels fight to establish order and rid of the demons that raid the burning Earth, however they will not tolerate anyone who won't abide in the Creator's rule. Most of them are devout and will do anything to please the Creator. There have been isolated incidents of Angles questioning Heaven's rule.\n\nThe Demons fight to rid of The Angels and establish chaos, but are slaves to The Destroyer. Many of those within the Demon Army were once humans who have went through unspeakable stages of Hell, who want nothing more than to kill the Angels who sent them there. Very few remember what they were before.\n\nThe Remnants are a mysterious group of of humans who have banded together to drive out both the Demons and Angels from Earth. This alliance of humans is shaky at best, only held together by their leader and the food supply that strangely never runs out.\n\nThe Player can decide which faction they start out with and which faction they end up siding with, or they could just kill everybody... that works too.\n\n\+**Faction Classes**\+\n\nThis game would have a large assortment of angels and demons that are inspired by many different cultures to give variety to these two factions. Here are some of the types of units that can be found in these factions.\n\n***Angels***\n\nAngels: They are the basic fighters and the most common in heaven's army. At this point in their early lives mastery of the sword and ways of archery have been completed. Along with those skills, the basics on light magic have been covered. Formidable foes against many humans and demons.\n\nArchangels: Angels who stand a bit taller than the rest. At this point Archangels have made advances in their magic prowess. Instead of shooting basic lighting, lighting bolts are their go-to magic attacks. Healing powers earned can bring the Shattering into a stabilized form and their aura have a denser layer.\n\nPrincipalities Class Angels: These types of angels are found leading the inexperienced into battle. Their power level are on par with a new Archangel, but their build is mostly focused on healing. A touch of their healing can slowly rebuild limbs and bring those from the brink of shattering to a combat capable.\n\nDominion Class Angels: You rarely see them outside of safe havens. They usually spend their times reading scriptures and forming tactics for upcoming battles. In the rare case they are brought in to battle, it can have devastating effects on the enemy. This type of angel has long abandoned the use of melee weapons and bows, and have focused their time to a magic build. Beams of light of capable of obliterating swarms, the thunder storms of the sky can be manipulated to barrage the battlefield. The presence of a single Dominion can give an attack buff to all magic users. Rarity of this type is due to how long it takes for them to reach their level and it would be devastating and expensive to lose this unit.\n\n***Demons***\n\nImps: Small, crawls everywhere, and can easily rip off a man's face. These little monsters are used for scouting (thrown into an area and see if someone shoots it) or suicide attacks. When not in the battlefields, they're used for minuscule tasks that aren't of huge importance.\n\nHell Bats: In order to overwhelm flying angels, the Destroyer bred a line of flying demons to bring down the angels above. The first and weakest are Hell Bats, that can be summoned by beginning magic users who resemble per-judgment bats. However, their head is more humanoid with untamed teeth. The best attack they could do was a simple bite that can rip off a man's hand in three seconds or less.\n\nMoaners: They are almost ghost like, and some mistake them for Angels. They use to be sinners who have lost there children during The Judgement or who decided not to keep their children during their pregnancy. They've been cursed by the Creator to wander and search for the children they lost, children that they'll never find. Hell integrated these cursed women into their army for their swiftness that rivals the angels and their ability to slowly suck the life energy of their victims. If one encounters these poor souls outside the battlefield, it will first ask you a question and it will always be the same question every time. ""Are you my child?""\n\nSpawnlings: They use to be human. After an eternity of torture and misery, their minds have been broken down and their bodies reduce to the bones. Personalities range from miserable to borderline insanity, with everyone containing the urge for angel dust. They are usually armed with crude swords and few use dried human skin as armor. Most spawnlings die in suicide attacks against the other factions in a tactic to overwhelm the enemy with numbers and unpredictable behavior. Those who do survive will become stronger and eventually mutate magic skills, put in a path to become respected servants of the Dark One.\n\nCharlings: They are spawnlings who know how to use basic fire attacks and begin to say a few phrases here and there. Participation in swarm are no longer expected from them but are used to fight low level humans or angels.\n\nDemons: Charlings who have earned the right to be called Demon. They have a straighter posture that resemble humans and also developed a whole personality with intelligence. Skilled in fire attacks and learn some basic summoning magic. Competency with swords and armor has vastly increased, when they once just ran in to try to stab the enemy they now block attacks and make use of whatever armor they can carry.\n\n***Humans***\n\nHumans simply have the same ranking system as the military that existed in the pre-judged world. Rookie to captain to colonel, etc. Ranks have been added such as scavenger and the mysterious special ops that the humans are rumored to have who can hold their own against a Dominion-Class Angel one on one.\n\n\+**Factions Abilities**\+\n\nAngles have magic that specializes in light magic, healing, and defense. Since they represent holiness and purity they would have attacks that represent those things. Their attacks glow in the sunless lands of what use to be earth. Precise lighting bolts can pierce through an entire behemoth and still be able to shock an imp behind it. Beams of light are capable of blinding and burning the sinful. A touch of their healing magic is said to be able to cure any sickness that plagues mankind. There are those in the Heaven's army who dedicate all of their training to becoming a healer. Masters of healing can be seen bringing injured angels from the brink of shattering and capable of regrowing someone's limbs. Angels have been created to be powerful as well as mobile. Some do wear plates of armor, but most prefer mobility that their wings can give them. To make up for the lack of amour, strong auras have been built into every angel in existence that can protect them from damage. It's similar to the human's fictional force field. The stronger the Angel, the stronger the aura one posses. A single layer of an aura can block a full clip of a sub machine gun. Their weapons include bows and arrows, blessed swords, blessed axes, blessed axes that they could summon out with the palms of their hands. Considering their weapons holy, most Angels refuse to use anything that wasn't made in heaven. Because of their wings, they are extremely mobile and capable of going 50mph. (The amount of debris in the sky, not to mention the constant thunder and thick black clouds, makes it impossible to fly further up.)\n\nDemons have access to magic that leans toward destruction and summoning. It's common to see a demon shoot fire balls from their palms or mouth that are hot as the flames of hell. Those who are skilled enough can even manipulate lava and throw them at their target. Since angels have flight, demons have the ability to conjure a chained spear that is burned onto their charred arms. A strong enough demon can launch this at an angel and have it pierce through their shielding and yank them out from the air. However, an angel without a shield is still a danger to a demon, they are strong warriors after all. So the main strategy after yanking them from the air is have them land in the center of a horde and swarm said angel. This is where summoning magic comes into place. The Demon army's strength is in numbers, where most of spawnlings from hell are thrown at the enemy until they are worn down. It takes a while to march a horde to a destined area, so those who can summon spawnlings  while on the battle field are quite convenient. The most powerful summoner builds can bring in an infestation of imps to a fully developed titan. Since the demons of hell lack the aura ability they rely heavily on armor that is made with the rusty metals of the underworld. Some of this armor has been carved with runes that increase their attack and defense stats in exchange for part of their stamina.\n\nHumans don't have the ability to master the magic of Angels or Demons, but they can acquire some of the skills of both sides. The souls of fallen angels and diminished demons can be ""consumed"" and give a varied amount of power that the angel or demon had. Humans have been seen using the aura of fallen angels along with using dark magic to take enemies out. The Remnants aren't too picky on what kind of weapon they'll use, some are seen charging at spawnlings with broken beer bottles, others using bows from fallen angels, and some wearing armor from demons. After years of horror, survival, and witnessing the entire planet dying, humans have become desensitized with violence and are more familiar with what the wasteland has to offer. Guerilla tactics are their go-to strategies.\n\n\+**Gameplay**\+\n\nIt will be like the typical Action RPG, such as Fallout or The Witcher. If you want a generalized explanation of this game it can be summed up as The Witcher 3 with guns, demons, and angels all within a apocalyptic setting. Players are capable of dodging in combat with every weapon having their own feel and style. It would be open world, it won't be humongous, just big enough to fit everything in. If you're a then you won't stand a chance further outside the starting points as stats are set on each npc. The standard view would be 3rd person, to get full scope of the fight the player partakes in. I would like for all melee weapons to be able to clash with each other, with weak swords breaking when they hit swords of higher rankings. Also for armor to shrug off projectiles from cheap guns or beginner magic.\n\n**+Arsenal+**\n\nThe player will have a large selection of melee weapons, guns, and magic attacks to kill any hostiles. Each weapon, depending whether they are blessed or cursed, will have a specific effectiveness against any race. Swords that were drenched in Holy Water will be extremely effective against demons, Swords with demonic runes can be super effective against Angels. For now, magic can be categorized in Light and Dark magic. Along with projectiles such as bullets, magic, and arrows, empty bottles or misc items can be thrown to temporarily stun weak enemies. Imagine chugging down a health potion then throw the empty bottle at an incoming savage human.\n\n\+**Quest+**\n\nThere will be quests that can lead the player into getting weapons and armor, and quests that will either please or displease factions. Companion quests for party members would be preferable to have as you'd be getting a decent amount of characters who will join you in your endeavors. These characters have their own opinions and goals, so unless an angel is questioning their faith they will not help you in any quests that are in favor of other factions.\n\n**+Downtime+**\n\nObviously a game can't be a simple quest/grind fest, so we can sprinkle in a few things in the liven the world a bit. Within Human settlements the player can play salvaged arcades, play bar games, have chats with survivors, or simply have a drink. In Safe Havens the player can see how Angels entertain themselves by playing chess with them or reading the scriptures. In Demon Holdings the player can participate in a ""thunder dome"" style arena where demons fight each other to ashes, and whatever the fallen demon had in their inventory goes to the victor. They have plenty of demons to spare, so it would be more sensible for them to have it rather than the humans.\n\n\+**HUD**\+\n\nThere would be a lack of a mini-map and a health bar in the game.\n\nThe Angels have a built in Guidance system that will work as a spell. A pixie can be summoned that will fly towards the desired destination. The amount of health an angel has can be indicated based off how many cracks they have on their skin. More glowing cracks, less health angel has. If health reaches zero, the angel will scream something like, ""Forgive me!"" or ""Have Mercy!"" or ""Guide me, Lord!"", before their body shatters and turns to dust. (Different dialogue for the player depending on their choices)\n\nDemons can summon an imp that can crawl towards the destination, which upon reaching it will explode. The next time a demon summons an imp it will be a different looking one. Health will be indicated by glowing cracks as well that glow a fire-like color.  Upon death they will screech before turning to ash.\n\nHumans can use their technology to guide them, such as a GPS or a map. Health can be indicated by how much bleeding or heavy breathing there is. Once reaching zero health groaning will commence, they will shout people's names or give a horrifying shout once they realize where they will end up seconds before dying.\n\nOf course if the player wanted to they could activate the HUD option. The lack of a HUD is for increased immersion for the player in order for them to become invested in the world and not constantly look to the bottom right.\n\n\+**Player Choices**\+\n\nAll choices will contribute to what kind of ending you will receive. From the grand decisions you'll have to make to small talk you'll have with NPCs. This can either change how the story flows or whether or not an NPC will help you in battle. Certain perks will affect your dialogue choices, much like in Fallout games before the 4th entry, such as the ""Devout"" perk where you can recite any line from the scriptures to convince an angel for a certain quest goal. The race you choose will also affect choice, after all, a demon with a ""devout"" perk won't be as convincing as as the previous example.\n\n\+**Companions**\+\n\nEach race will have certain unique characters who can aid you in battle, if you can convince them your worth their time. Each one of them has a perk that the player can't access and abilities that are exclusive to them only. They also have their own level up system, where they can get stronger after each battle. When fighting they will aid you by fighting or by healing or by simply hiding behind a rock and shouting cheers from a safe distance.\n\n***Annabelle:***  Before Judgement Day, angels can spend some time on earth as a guardian angel for poor souls (restricted only to those who follow the word of the creator that is). Many were encouraged to do so in order affirm their love for the creator's flock. Annabelle, a full devout and one of the top fighters in her group, proudly volunteered and spent almost 10 years on earth. After her visit, something changed within Annabelle. She began to question the scriptures and didn't have the same warm feelings she had when she read them. She fell within the ranks and wasn't given the leader rank when Armageddon came. Despite this, she always volunteered for scouting missions, especially when it involves venturing into human territory. Angels who ventured with her say she always goes over to a fallen human and looks for their face. She wouldn't do anything with them, she just gets sadder with every face she finds.\n\nYou can find her within Safe Heavens or out in the wasteland during scouting. If you can get her to trust you with enough speech points and somewhat knowledgeable of the scriptures she will follow you in missions that are for Angels or that are neutral.  With her beside you you'll have access to her ""Guardian Angel"" perk, which will give you a 10% attack bonus, a 20% defense bonus, and an extra 5% of damage when using swords or bows. Her healing magic isn't up to par with the rest of her covenant, as she focused more on a fighting build, but she can provide a modest 3 points of healing per second. She fights using a one handed sword, Light attacks, and a bow. She'll usually wait for the enemy to attack first and then attack after dodging with either her sword or a point blank Light attack at the sides. Other times she'll take the hit, let her light shield absorb some damage, and counter when at close range. When ordered to keep a distance she'll fire arrows at enemies coming near you when you're busy fighting one. If she trusts the player enough she'll take on a finishing blow if near enough.\n\nYour time and dialogue choices with her will determine whether she will stay with Heaven or take a different path. It will also determine whether she will stay with you... or reject you.\n\n***Tarrare:*** Before arriving to the LA area, no one really knows where he was or what he did before Judgment. He would speak in grumbles as if he never learned English and even when you could understand him each back story he tells would be different. Some doubt he's actually human. His disfigured body, wide mouth, and musky teeth made others consider him as a demon with actual skin. Although, the cut and bruises he would receive do seem to prove he is from earth. Despite being slender as the blackened trees of the wasteland he can fit all the meat of a Demon Bull in his stomach and still ask for seconds. Within human settlements he'd be dared to swallow things to entertain others and be rewarded with food scraps for every object he swallows. One day, when he was refused second rations he was caught eating the arm of an injured worker to satisfy his never ending hunger. While eating of the Human flesh has been a common practice, (it's uncommon for anyone to not have done it and survived) man power is in short supply these days and steady rations from the Remnant HQ made it unnecessary. They immediately kicked him out and refused to let him back in.\n\nYou can find him in the middle of nowhere surrounded by gnawed corpses of various beasts and a few human skeletons. If you can prove to him that you can provide him with nourishment, he will follow you to the gates of hell. Because of his weak ass limbs he won't be able to fight enemies head on. With a low endurance stat, his aid in battle will boil down to jump on the enemy and distracting them until you can kill them yourself.  With smaller, weaker, enemies he will attempt to kill and devour. He knows he's almost useless in battle, and to convince you that he is a decent companion, he will search for bullets and items he doesn't want to eat then give them to you in the hopes that you'll use them to kill his next meal.\n\nThis human honestly doesn't give a s\*\*\* on which side he is on as long as he is fed. A potential story line for him is meeting with the guy who had is arm eaten by Tarrare. This can end with either a peaceful resolution, a beat-down, or another murder.\n\n***Sinder:*** ""Kate."" It's the only thing Sinder can remember of his previous life. He remembered that he used to enjoy it and that it was fun (something rare in these times), but that's about it. He was powerful fire user in the armies of hell. Quickly, he climbed in the ranks through the arena, fighting magic users and Titans alike. After killing his captain in a match he became the new captain in his clan and grew in strength. One swift of his finger can make pillar of fire spring into the air and is skilled enough to manipulate lava that flows onto the wasteland. Despite earning his new title that could earn him some respect in the depths of Hell, he went rouge in order to search for clues of his previous life. While at his search he put on clothing and carried items that belonged to the old world. With each item he finds, he can feel a tiny amount of humanity being restored.\n\nYou can find him in a bar, enjoying a drink and playing with a rubric cube. He wears a leather hoodie to disguise himself, but if you are able to get his trust by being a decent magic user and knowing enough demon chants he will reveal who he is. He may be rouge but is still mentally chained to the voices of the destroyer. so any mission that goes against chaos he will refuse. As mentioned before, he is an great fire user. His fire attacks can crisp any foe in front of him and if given enough time to generate full magic points he'll spam his most powerful move. Because of the time spent in the arenas, he's more inclined to fight the larger/stronger enemies up close, leaving you to fight the weaker ones. The lack of armor that he wears makes him a difficult target to hit, thus he is he won't be a strain on your health potion supply. Although with low health stats, he can easily get knocked out if he's hit hard enough. Sinder will have the ""Hell's Flame Perk"", which will give you buffs in magic attack up to 20%, an increase on magic points by 5%, an extra 5% in magic attacks when using fire, when you are in his presence.\n\nYour choices that you'll be making in his story line will determine who he becomes. Will he learn what ""Kate"" is? Or will you convince him to drop the thing that's tormenting what's left of his mind.\n\n\+**Music**\+\n\nWhile sounds of gusts and screams would be more eerie and more fitting of this setting, people are gonna want to hear something else. Music will change upon where you are and who you are fighting. For example, when in Angel territory you shall hear music played by harps, piano, flutes, violin, Capella voices, with each lyric sung in Latin. In Human territory you can hear licensed music or music created by survivors when passing by a radio or speaker. In Demon territory, you'd hear clattering metal and demonic chants, as screams of the tortured come together to create a dreadful tune. During battle, music aspects from 2 or 3 factions come together to create awesome music that'll increase thrill in the player. The song ""Libera me from hell"" can give an idea of music for a player on the human's side fighting angels, although the song doesn't match up with the amount of dreariness I have in mind for this game.\n\n**+Conclusion+**\n\nThis was a pretty long post. While it may be a dream, I could see being developed eventually. The only team I would trust with this would be CD Project Red, since this game would resemble The Witcher games in terms of mechanics. Not Bethesda, after what they did to dialogue, and definitely not Bioware as long as EA is running things. A man can dream. Thanks to anyone who reads this long post. See you on judgement day."

9fk4x6,Genre Blending,"This isn’t necessary a specific game idea, more so just a discussion on genres and what you think makes a good blend. I personally like to see too genres you never really see together. Like recently I had an idea for a kind of Fantasy Spaghetti Western setting. So you’ve got that twangy dueling music, but there’s also orcs and elves walking around. Basically Red Dead Redemption meets Skyrim, not necessarily in respects to gameplay, just the setting.\n\nSo what are some blendings of genres that you would really like to see? They can gameplay genres, story settings, whatever."
9fipbm,"Open/ semi open world, medieval army raising, rpg/rts/army management.","Core: be able to go around and recruit npcs. the better they are, the harder/ more expensive to recruit. travel the open world map. early game your troop acts as a mercenary/bandit.

9fc47c,Phone App/Social MMO game,"Hey r/gameideas,\n\nI've had a game idea for a long time now that I wished would come true. Basically, I'm a huge fan of the Megaman (as my username would show for those who know) and Gundam franchises. Particularly, I love the idea of being able to build a custom personalized unit to do things with (i.e. battle, interact, explore, etc.). So, I've always wanted a phone app game, where the focus was on collecting parts, weapons, armors, etc. and customizing and tweaking your individual avatar/bots.\n\nQuite simply, for those who are familiar with the Megaman.exe series, I want something similar to that in the sense that these individual characters would represent the player in a digital space, which can then in turn be used to interact with other players for social and gaming aspects. I have a lot of additional ideas such as battle format, social aspect, etc. but just thought I would lay out the basic premise of the game.\n\nThoughts and critiques would be greatly appreciated (and any willing developer to take on my idea would be my personal hero lol). \n\nThanks!"
9fbv1o,Kitty Warfare (v1),"I'm a new user to Reddit but I've had a lot of game ideas. This is one I've had for a while but am still working on. I might add more ideas later or in a separate post.\n\n**Kitty Warfare:**\n\n*Kitty Warfare is a game similar to TABS or Total War. You place different troops down except they are all cats as well. The difference is that at any point you can take control of one of your troops and fight as them in a FPS-like experience. There are 5 different Factions or groups. Each group has 3 different standard troops and a master who is the best of them all but more expensive.*\n\n*(There are also 3 types of sizes. These don't effect gameplay but some are just bigger.)*\n\n**Faction 1: Pirates**\n\n1.Flintlock\n\n*Flintlock troops are the size of normal kitties. They have an eyepatch and a normal pirate outfit. Their weapon is a flintlock pistol.*\n\n2.Cutlass\n\n*Cutlass troops are the size of normal kitties. They have a pirate hat and a rouge pirate outfit. Their weapon is a melee cutlass (pirate sword).*\n\n3.Musketoons\n\n*Musketoon troops are the size of normal kitties. They wear a sea scoundrel outfit. Their weapon is a musketoon.*\n\n4.Pirate Master\n\n*Pirate Master troops are a tad bit bigger than normal kitties. They wear the Caribbean outfit. Their weapons are both a cutlass and a flintlock pistol.*\n\n**Faction 2: Greeks**\n\n1.Orphean\n\n*Orphean troops are the size of normal kitties. They wear a* *greek robe*\*. Their weapon is a\* *lyre* *which shouts musical notes that act as bullets.*\n\n2.Shields\n\n*Shield troops are the size of normal kitties. They wear a greek robe. They hold a shield which they ram into people with.*\n\n3.Spartans\n\n*Spartan troops are the size of normal kitties. They wear a spartan outfit. They hold a spear which they throw and then pull out a sword.*\n\n4.Greek Priest\n\n*Greek Priest troops are the size of normal kitties. They wear a greek robe. They hold a bible which shoots out little bolts of light.*\n\n**Faction 3: Medieval**\n\n*(Don't Have Stuff Planned For Them Yet)*\n\n1.Archer\n\n2.Blacksmith\n\n3.Knight\n\n4.Medieval Priest\n\n**Faction 4: WW2**\n\n*(Don't Have Stuff Planned For Them Yet)*\n\n1.Flamethrower\n\n2.Mustard Gas\n\n3.Assault Rifle\n\n4.Hitler\n\n**Faction 5: Misc.**\n\n1.Kitty\n\n*The standard troop of the game. Fists only and normal size, this is the cheapest in the game.*\n\n2.Big Kitty\n\n*A bigger, more Hulk-like version of the normal kitty. Pretty powerful but mildly expensive.*\n\n3.Super Kitty\n\n*Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we need. A Superman style kitty who flies around and shoots his laser eyes along with occasionally coming down to super punch a few enemies. Very expensive.*\n\n4.Evil Kitty\n\n*The Lex Luther to our Superman, the Joker to our Batman, the Green Goblin to our Spider-Man, he is the Evil Kitty.

9f93un,Dungeon Safari: high speed dungeon crawling," **Dungeon Safari** \[WIP title\]  \n*A single player racing game in which the player controls an old-timey car embellished with armor pieces and rides it through a monster and obstacle-filled subterranean dungeon.*  \n\n\nHi everyone, I am happy to share this idea with you and hear your thoughts and tips to make this work as a game, which I am absolutely inclined to make.  I am solo (hobbyist for now) game developer using UE4.\n\nSo, the core idea is pretty simple: the goal of the game is to reach the finish line of each level of the dungeon. The player may have the ability to control the vehicle speed but I don't know yet if it would be better to have branching rails, or the ability to steer or change lane (like an old-school racing game).   \n\n\n Players may choose the party of adventures driving, each with its own quick because adventures will offer ways to eliminate or avoid obstacles: the jousting knight could knock skeletons and maybe help steer; the sorcerer might be able to put defensive shields...  \nThere might be lockable vehicles like a multistory coach, a unicorn-motorcycle (god I love this one!) and they might need some kind of fuel like crystals, vials... souls?  \n\n\nAs you see, it is definitely not defined yet, for example: what about boss fights? perhaps you need to chase or run from them while fighting.  \nI want to hear your feedback  and ideas. I really want to make this into something good but it might take a while, this does seem to be a project that needs more people, especially 2d artists, to be something as good as I think it could be.  \nThank you everybody :D "

9f3tf9,Super Niche Survival,"Now I know the survival genera is on life support right now given the massive amount of bs cash grab indie survival games that are out there, but this is an idea I had for a long time that was given hope by, but eventually was killed by the changes in developmental direction of the punching bag of the gaming world; Dayz. Also let it be known that I did use the search function to try and see if his idea had been posted before and saw nothing, so forgive me if this amounts to a repost, and link me to the OG post(s). Also fair warning text wall that would make the US Mexican border wall look like a chode incoming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe premise of the game revolves around the tropes of classic open world survival. An arbitrary time after social breakdown, you are a lonely survivor in a very large map, with the ever-looming threat of permadeath, a number of small soft skills that can be built over time, realism inventory and survival mechanics, and of course because reasons, zombies. The niche aspect of this game would be a serious attempt at adhering to a 1:1 time ratio on survival mechanics, requiring hard skills and knowledge to accomplish goals, and extremely difficult zombie combat, as well as being first person exclusively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*First off, the map.\*\* The setting of the game would ideally take place in an area with similar geography to western Pennsylvania, around the area just north of Pittsburg called Cranberry township, which has a good mixture of rural, forest, and urban environments backpack for instance being ""x1 55 liters + x2 1 liters"" limited size, approx. 25x30 miles, and be hand-crafted rather than procedurally-generated, with a number of hotspots classic to the genera such as an airport, military base, city downtown, prison, etc. Ideally there would be one larger city in the map, with smaller towns and suburbs branching off along the main highways, settling into rural and undeveloped areas further out, in a 1:1 scale that would make it believable that the region was populated by about a hundred-thousand people, but also provide a variety of enviornments. This would be by far the most difficult aspect of this game to create, as any hand-crafted map usually is, especially given the serious scale described here. A 24-hour Day/night cycle would also be present in game, as well as somewhat predictable weather effects. Nighttime is extremely dark, and without lights is nearly impossible to navigate.\n\n\-------------------------------------------\n\n\*\*Second, permadeath and other player mechanics.\*\* This could be given as a settings choice at the start of a game, where parmadeath could mean that you lose your character, all their gear, all their soft skills, everything about that character, but the world and any changes to it remain the same. The other option would be complete permadeath, where the whole save file is deleted and the whole game must be restarted. Player mechanics such as control scheme would include a freelook option, and a gunplay system very similar to the current state of the Dayz standalone, save for a few minor details. This means that reloading weapons would be done manually through the inventory system, and the classic 'r' button would not reload the weapon, but instead cycle the bolt on a rifle/rack the slide on the handgun/cycle the chamber on a shotgun, ejecting the current round in the event of a misfire, or to make a weapon ready to fire. Movement would be ideally have flowing movement with inertia playing a great role in movement, such as in the Witcher 3. Navigating obstacles would mostly involve climbing and vaulting, to the extent that is seen in Battlefield 1. No Assassins' Creed or Titanfall parkour, but not nearly as rigid and limiting as is seen in the Arma series. In essence, if the hands are free, the player should be able to climb over walls at eye level, shortened to chest height with a two-handed item equipped, and further shortened to waist-height when carrying an item of sufficient weight (item weight touched on below). There would be a free-jump button, but it would achieve very little vertical distance. Instead, jumping would be more useful for horizontal distance to clear gaps, and be very reliant on the inertia of the player. At a full sprint the player could jump much further than at a walking pace or even a jog (duh). Finally, sprinting, jumping and running would all rely on a soft stamina bar. Sprinting (moving at a 15 second 100m pace unencumbered) would drain stamina the fastest, although it would be much slower than most games in the genera, with about a full 45 second sprint taking up the whole stamina bar at ""level 1"" Fitness (soft skills like fitness are touched on below). Also unlike most survival games, jogging (moving at a 10 minute mile pace unencumbered) would also use up stamina, but at a much slower rate than sprinting, with a jog being sustainable for about 20 minutes at ""level 1"" fitness until the stamina bar is drained and the player must walk or rest to regain stamina, the latter recharging it more quickly. Despite the apparent limitation of the stamina bar, the player \*can\* continue to sprint or jog even when it is depleted, but doing so rather quickly increases a hidden ""shock"" stat, which if brought high enough, will cause the player to fall unconscious until the stat falls below a threshold. Given the size of the map, the ability to jog or sprint for relatively long distances is necessary, but the mechanic would result in the player likely sticking to a more localized area in the map until they found less demanding means of travel, or needing to be fully prepared when making a journey on foot.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Third, And most in-depth, Items, inventory and survival mechanics.\*\* Much like in Dayz, the inventory system would revolve around clothing items and their individual storage capacities, with inventory capacity directly linked to what clothes were being worn. A variety of clothing items can be found, each with their own stats relating to insulation, water-resistance, weight, toughness/protection, and pocket/storage space. Items would all have a volume stat listed in cubic cm or litres, and Storage space would work on this volume system by pocket, with a pair of jeans for instance having a value of ""x2 500 cubic cm + x2 200 cubic cm"". This stat means that the jeans can carry a total of 1.4 litres worth of items, but no item can be larger than .5 litres in volume. A backpack, on the other hand, would be one large pocket, potentially with a few smaller pockets, with the stats of a mountain backpack for instance being ""x1 55 liters + x2 1 litres"" This would make backpacks useful and necessary for carrying large items, but not entirely crucial to carrying basic necessities. Total clothing slots available would include a spot for a hat, face cover, glasses, shirt, vest, jacket, pants, socks, and shoes. In addition, some items such as rifles can be equipped with slings, freeing up the hands or backpack space. The inventory UI would look similar to Dayz's inventory, with each clothing item having a separate inventory bar so the player can allocate items to different clothing items. Equipping items could either be done in the inventory menu, or by a hotkey bar. However, only items stored in the pockets of the pants, shirt, Jacket or vest could be added to the hotbar, or if they are on a sling over the shoulder. To access the inventory of the backpack, the player must be stationary, and a short animation of taking the backpack off and opening it will play, then closing it when closing the inventory. Weight of inventory items would factor into running distance and movement speed, decreasing the distance the player can jog or sprint until they start accumulating shock points, and slowing the speed of the two, though walking speed and ability remains the same until a certain threshold, where any movement will incur shock points very quickly, and result in unconsciousness in a matter of seconds. \n\nHunger will also be slightly different than in other survival games, and be somewhat more complicated. Instead of the standard hunger meter, which ranges from full to empty, with empty causing the player to start losing health and anything else being A-O-good, I would propose a system that had two meters; a standard hunger meter, and a second, possibly invisible, nutrition meter. The hunger meter would work like most other games in the genera, being drained at a constant rate, but moreso by physical activity. Though in keeping with the 1:1 time ratio, the hunger meter would take about 4-8 hours to begin to indicate that the player is hungry, depending on amount of physical activity, and would take up to about 36 hours to be fully drained. Having the hunger bar at 0 will not directly kill the player, but having the hunger bar below a certain threshold would cause the second 'nutrition' meter to drain. A low nutrition level would cause the player to weaken over time, slowing movement, shortening the stamina bar, and lowering the threshold of unconsciousness for the shock meter. When the nutrition meter reaches 0, the player will slip into unconsciousness and die, the last hour or so being incapable of movement faster than walking without incurring shock points, and having an extremely low shock threshold. The total time for the nutrition meter to reach 0 from full with a constantly empty hunger meter would be approximately 5 days. Not exactly a 1:1 ratio, but the fully-realistic 30-40 days to starve would be drawing the process out far beyond what would be playable past the first four. On the flip side, keeping the hunger bar full or near full will raise the nutrition meter over time, increasing the stamina bar, and increasing the rate of soft skill gain (still getting to that.) The counter-balance to such a drawn-out system as this would be the extreme rarity of food, and the realistic difficulty of making food last. Canned food, while existent, would be extremely rare, with the player of average luck barely being able to scrape out a living scavenging in a city for it. The most reliable source of food in the early game would be hunting, with animals native to the northeast USA being present, but not necessarily easy to catch. Animals will flee from the player at long distance unless the player is able to practice effective stealth and/or persistence. Players who have real world hunting experience would be at an advantage, knowing how to effectively hunt a white tail or a turkey. And just as with a real animal, once shot with an arrow or bullet, an animal will not simply fall over and die, but flee and must be tracked until it is found either in shock, or having bled to death. From here, the player would have to have a means to effectively skin and cook the animal, or risk a very high chance of disease (to be touched on). A mechanic such as this is possible as seen by the programming of animal AI in Dayz, which was designed by the makers of the Cabella's hunting game, and somewhat accurately reflects the behaviors and senses of prey animals. Despite the difficulty of hunting, which would likely take Per the scale of the hunger meter, one deer or turkey would be easily more than enough to fill the player from empty, so another counter-balance to this would be a mechanic that spoils unpreserved food. Meat kept at room temperature will spoil in a matter of hours, while meat kept frozen, salted, or a number of other techniques will keep the meat edible anywhere from one to three days depending on the method. This would allow a player to build up a stored queue of hunted food if dedicated, but one that would only provide a relatively small buffer of time. The late game option for hunger would be the growth of crops. Doing so would only be possible with seeds for a plant, soil capable of sustaining the plant, and ritual watering. This is a late game solution, as growing crops would provide a massive yield of food that could be stored for a very long period of time without spoiling, but takes a long time to come to fruition. While it wouldn't be a whole annual cycle as is in the real world, it would still take a period of about 35 days for a crop to fully mature, the seeds plantable immediately after harvesting without adverse effect on the soil, as a system like soil nutrients would be have too many variables to factor. Under this system, farming would be the only reasonable way that the player could build up a lasting store of food, keeping the rare and horded canned food for emergencies only. Eating beyond fullness is possible, but doing so too much will cause the player to vomit, draining the hunger meter to 1/4 value, and thirst to 1/4 value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThirst would work similarly to hunger, with the thirst bar being separate from a second 'hydration' meter, only this one would move much faster than the hunger bar, and be more heavily affected by physical activity. It would take about two hours for the thirst meter to indicate that the player was thirsty, and about 6 to 14 hours to empty, depending on physical activity. The hydration meter would take about 40 hours to fully drain, at which point the player will fall unconscious and die. A low hydration meter will have effects such as decreased stamina, blurred vision, and ironically, a more quickly-draining thirst bar. Just as with food, water requires a counter-balance to the scale of the dehydration speed. The Northeast USA has a very large number of fresh water streams and rivers that run through it,  so the in-game map would be filled with them. But drinking this water, while possible, would very likely result in contracting a number of diseases (to be touched on later), and is generally not worth it if at all avoidable. Boiling fresh water or drinking rain water that has not sat for more than 12 hours will be the only safe options for hydration in early game, and can be done in both craftable containers, or lootable ones, the latter of which would be generally not too uncommon. Dehydration will likely never be an issue for the player once they have gone beyond the very early game, but is a very real danger in the very beginning. Just as with overeating, It is possible to drink beyond the thirst meter, but doing wo too much will result in the same effects as overeating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisease would ideally also play a large part in the games survival mechanics. Diseases would include a number of known viral and bacterial infections common in the area ranging from influenza to dysentery. A player can contract a disease from a number of places, from drinking standing water to a scratch from a zombie (remember they're in here? yeah, I forgot too. This post is too long.). Contracting the bacterial infection dysentery from standing water will cause the player to vomit uncontrollably, will lower maximum stamina, and cause the hydration meter to drop much more quickly than usual. The disease will eventually pass in a matter of about 56 hours on its own if untreated, but the player will only survive if they keep themselves very well hydrated with clean water the entire time, to counteract the dehydration. continuing to drink dirty water will only reset the disease clock, resulting in inevitable death as dehydrating effects overcome any amount of fluid intake. Other diseases , such as those that can be contracted from eating uncooked or spoiled meat/crops, or from a deep cut from a zombie, can be more life-threatening. These infections will lower stamina and the hydration meter more and more over time and eventually cause a buildup of shock points, either until the player dies of dehydration or shock value going too high and causing coma, or they find antibiotics, and being a regular intake of them over the course of a few days. At a certain point, however, the disease can no longer be cured by any antibiotics, and the player is doomed to die. This point represents when the infection gets into the bloodstream, and infects the whole body. Generally unless a person is on an IV antibiotic 24/7, they have zero chance of survival at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHealth and injury would also work differently than any other game than the current market sees, and would not include an actual health bar anywhere in the game. Instead, the player being alive counts on the preservation of a series of somewhat independently-functioning meters. If any of the meters reaches either 0 or the kill threshold, the player will go unconscious and die. The meters are as follows: the known nutrition meter and hydration meters, as well as two others, the blood and shock meters. The blood meter is the measure of blood in the players body, and is effected only by bleeding from a wound, be it anything from a gunshot to a very nasty gouge by a zombie or wolf's teeth. Bleeding decreases the blood meter at a rate dependent on how many bleeding injuries there are, and how severe they are. Bleeding can be stopped with items such as gauze, rages and bandages to a certain point, however large enough injuries cannot be stopped by these means, and the only chance of survival in these scenarios is cauterization, which brings an increased risk of infection if not regularly maintained with alcohol and antibiotics. All clothing would provide varying degrees of protection from cutting injuries respective to the parts they cover, but none will protect you from all levels of bleeding damage. Shock is the bar closest to a health bar, but has a few differences. As hinted earlier, shock is a value that increases rather than decreases, and is increased by many things from over-exertion to late-stage diseases. Shock also gradually decreases over time at a constant rate, but more quickly when at rest. The fastest way for shock to be raised is by physical injuries, be they blunt force trauma from a zombie flailing it's arm at you, to a gunshot. When shock is raised to a certain level, the player falls unconscious. If it is a passive raise in shock such as over-exertion, the shock value will eventually fall to a level where the player regains consciousness. However, if more shock is applied once the player is unconscious by anything such as a zombie or another bullet, the shock value will rise until it reaches another threshold at which the player goes into a coma, meaning bodily shutdown and brain death are unavoidable, and the player has essentially died. It is possible that a single blow can cause the shock meter to instantly rise beyond the unconsciousness threshold, and go straight to the coma/death threshold, such as a gunshot to the head, or a very well placed strike from a zombie to the head when the shock meter is already dangerously high, or a swipe or bite to the head from a bear. All clothing items can provide varying degrees of shock protection to their respective parts of the body, but nothing will make the player truly ""safe"" from death by shock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\---I would like weather and temperature to play a part in survival, but I have never to date seen a game get the feature right to where it is not a constantly-fluctuating stat that becomes more of a nuisance than anything that requires players to constantly take off and put on a jacket every few minutes to stay at a stable body temperature with no adverse effects. For this reason, my ideal game would not include weather survival and body temp. unless someone could provide a reasonable and well-thought-out mechanic that would circumvent the problems that plague every game with it.---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\------------------------------------------\n\n\*\*Fourth, skills and world-modification/base building.\*\* Soft skills relating to physical abilities would be present in the game, mostly drawing inspiration from the skill system of 'The Forest', with the main skill groups being strength, and endurance/fitness. Both are increased by use. \n\nFor instance, Fitness is increased by running, albeit at a rather slow rate compared to most other games. Consistent running and use of stamina is required for a player to raise the skill, which would have a great many ""levels"", but each level would result in a rather small improvement in stamina and running speed. At maximum ability the player could sprint for a full two minutes at 11 seconds per 100 meter pace, and jog for up to an hour at an 8 minute mile pace. This sort of advancement would occur over a period of about 200 ""levels"", each of which taking slightly more time to attain in standard soft skill fashion. The higher levels would only be attainable by a player who went out of their way to grind the skill simply for the purpose of maxing it out, as diminishing returns would eventually render further increase of the stat a net negative for time efficiency. Fitness would affect a great number of in-game mechanics beyond movement however, from the overall rate of stamina depletion, to the effect of item weight on stamina depletion, to the time one can hold their breath while steadying a weapon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrength is also increased by strength-training actions, such as chopping trees, or landing hits on enemies with melee weapons (weapons and melee fighting not discussed in detail). Like fitness, strength increases in a great number of small increments, each level providing boosts to a number of factors such as melee weapon shock damage, increasing the thresholds of total carrying weight, and raising the shock thresholds for both unconsciousness and coma, in essence making the player harder to kill quickly. At maximum ability, the player would have the shock resistance to have a chance to survive an unarmed encounter with a bear, and be able to carry extreme weight without being greatly encumbered by it. Note that like fitness, increasing the strength stat yields diminishing returns, and is impractical beyond a certain point, but just as possible. For the purpose of not boring the player with essentially becoming the Doom Slayer by maxing out both Fitness and Strength, also note that having both stats maxed out will not increase the shock resistance and melee damage to super-human levels, and fighting a large group of enemies using hand-to-hand tactics would still very likely result in the player being overwhelmed and killed, or at least doomed to die of their injuries. So at best you're Beowulf. Still badass, but by no means immortal. \n\n\------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Finally, the Zombies.\*\* This is where this game would likely lose a lot of people who were not already bothered by how over-complex the survival mechanics are, as many of the ideas listed here can make it seem as though the zombies are viciously broken in their dominance over the player, but the goal of the game is to aim for realism and hardcore survival that requires using your head versus gaming instincts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs stated, zombies would be ""Realistic"", or as realistic as a fictional creature can be. An undead person infected with a brain prion, as these zombies would canonically be, would know no limits. They would not pay attention to the physical limitations of their host body, as they would feel no pain, and only strive toward their goal of further sustenance. They would sprint faster than any normal human being could until they tore their ligaments, and swing their arms at the player hard enough to dislocate them and tear their muscles, but would continue to fight. It would be like fighting a meth-addict on PCP and steroids, and a normal human will lose 9.9/10 times in a straight fight. Even a player with fully maxed-out strength and fitness would have a challenge physically overpowering one without a weapon using brute force alone. In the game zombies would be able to grab the player and bite them without mercy until they bleed out or die from shock, and the only way to escape would be the ever-unpopular mechanic of a quick-time key-mashing fest whose difficulty would be dependent on the strength stat of the player. It isn't a my favorite mechanic either, but is the only one I can think of that would make sense given zombies' ability to grab the player. (If someone manages to read to this point and is creative enough to have a better idea, comment it and we can circle-jerk over it's greatness.) Other attacks of the zombies would be classics such as biting and flailing of arms. each type of attack deals a bit of shock and bleeding damage, a flail dealing much more shock damage than bleeding, and a bite dealing much more bleeding than shock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKilling a zombie is also difficult, as they work on a similar shock meter that the player does, only they would not have an unconsciousness threshold, and shock damage only applies when striking the head, neck, or upper spine, a strike anywhere else being virtually ineffective at killing them. A zombie would also not be able to bleed to death, but could be dismembered to render many of it's attacks such as grabbing and flailing ineffective. Decapitation or destruction of the brain/brain stem is the only was to quickly kill a zombie. However, as stated before zombies do not pay attention to their own limits, and may very well damage themselves when trying to attack the player, severing or dislocating their arm when attacking and rendering it virtually useless for further attacks, or tear the muscles in their legs when running toward the player at an inhuman sprint, causing them to fall and be incapable of running anymore, instead only being able to crawl as though their leg had been severed. Also undesirable is the mechanic by which that system of self-injury would operate: the dreaded RNG. Under it, the chance of a zombie tearing its leg running at the player increases dramatically every second that they are running, and the chance of them dislocating/severing their arms when flailing is also very high, and stays rather constant. So it is likely that a zombie may only get off one hit with each arm if it manages to get to the player, but that may be all it needs to deal serious, possibly fatal damage. Most difficult given the damage one zombie could do would be that the zombie count would not be few and far between, but rather reflective of the population of the region, stated before to potentially be around 100,000 people, concentrating heavily in the cities and hotspots. As well, in another trope of the zombie genera, they would be very sensitive to sudden lights and noises such as flashlights and gunshots, and would quickly swarm the area around a player that fired a gun a few times in a city. The difficulty of zombie encounters would make stealth paramount, and cities all the more dangerous and difficult to survive in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a few other aspects that I have in my head, but it has honestly taken me hours to write this as it is, so I will only briefly touch on the final points. Vehicles would exist, but require serious effort and some hard knowledge of how to keep them working (I.E parts like spark plugs and fuel lines, fuel itself, engine oil, etc.). Items would have a durability system similar to Dayz, particularly with damaged or wet bullets and firearms jamming or misfiring often, and well-maintained ones using good bullets having virtually no issues, but not degrading nearly as quickly as in Dayz, fitting into the 1:1 scale ideal. The game would be available as either a single play or limited multiplayer experience similar to the plans for the upcoming ""Anthem"" game, which allows four friends to play together on a single co-op game. Full multiplayer would not be available because player exploitation and the long-term metagame of Dayz is why many of the more hardcore features of the game were never implemented or were changed, as other players' natural tendencies while playing with strangers either broke or left open for exploitation many mechanics. If you managed to read this whole thing I congratulate you. I am dumbfounded that I wrote as much as I did. If you have any ideas to improve, build upon, or completely scrap and shit on mine written here, I would love to hear them. Also, I don't foresee this type of game happening, by my hand or anyone else'. I have virtually no programming experience, and know that so many of the ideas and the learning curve in this game turn people off from this game, making it a poor investment in time and programming resources, especially given the current state of the survival genera and global Fortnite-mania."
9f3dei,[Mobile - beginner] Top-down runner / idle RPG,"* How you play the game:\n\nThe mechanics are really simple: swipe **left**, or swipe **right**, sometimes **up** and sometimes **down** as any basic runner. \n\n* What you see: \n\nThe twist is that it's a 2D top-down view, your character is always travelling up at a constant speed. \n\nThe roads all have three lane: Left, middle and right. Put your character on the right lane for it to interact with anything on that lane: a shop, a fork in the road, or an enemy. \n\n* Combat\n\nStaying on the same lane as an enemy is ""combat"", if you're stronger you kill him, gain money and XP, if he's stronger he takes a bite out of your health. \n\nYou determine the strength of an enemy by… well, deciding if you wanna take the chance to fight it or not if you don't already know. A coherent visual progression needs to be done: smaller and basic enemies = weaker, bigger and more complex design = stronger. \n\n* Choice\n\nAs you traverse towns, swiping right or left at the right moment will let you enter shops and inns, letting you buy and sell stuff. \n\nWhen you get out of town several randomly generated paths will start appearing as you travel the road, swipe right and you may enter the Enchanted Forest, if you miss it or wait a bit, you can swipe Left to enter the Old Quarry, etc. \n\n* The challenge\n\nAs your character gets stronger, he also travel faster and it become harder and harder to swipe at the right moment to either gain the right buffs or to avoid certain dangerous paths or enemies.\n\n------\n\nThe goal isn't to create a really engaging game mechanically, but simply to bring together two types of game aspect, the idle RPG where the goal is simply to see your character's unique path and progression (it's rogue-like in that regard) but also the slight interaction of endless runner where your choice and reflexes might influence your path. \n\n--------\n\n\nThere might be hundreds of tweaks to do and design, stats, items, skills, powers, ennemies, stories, areas, that would end up making this game really interesting, but I just wanted to lay out the core design idea, I think it would be a real fun game to design and think about - but sadly, I'm one of those ""I don't code"" guy, so yeah if anybody wants to do that game, I could easily lay out more detailed mechanisms and design concept.\n"
9f33m2,A survival game where you have a robotic hand/arm as every tool / crafting station,"I've seen a lot of decent survival games made by 1 person (like subsistence) so I think this would be doable by 1 particularly skilled intermediate (or better) developer. \n\nImagine a game like ( the forest | subsistence | green hell ) where your character is in a forest in the middle of nowhere and you have to survive. Unlike the other games, your goal is not to craft tools and work benches to advance your crafting skills. You have a super high tech robotic arm that you upgrade by finding and harvesting resources that it can use for upgrades internally. My first vision for this game was something like... you have a robotic arm, you go to grab a tree, the hand expands to grip the entire width of the tree, and then a buzz saw comes out of your arm and cuts up the tree. For some reason this visualization is just so neat it won't stay out of my head. Here are some further thoughts on different mechanics to flesh out the core further.\n\n=\n\n*skills / upgrades*\n\nI think a skill tree sort of ui would be a good way to handle progression. The hand can start with basic harvesting skills that let it transform into an ax or pickax. Upgrade the ax tree to eventually get the buzz saw / chainsaw which can quickly harvest a tree or other wood structure. Upgrade the pick to get an auger / mining laser. Here are some random ideas that would have to be organized into the tree...\n\n- crossbow: fire sticks with enough power to kill a rodent, easier hunting\n- blunderbuss: uses gunpowder, can fire any small object as a projectile, injure larger animals, can fire spears for easier fishing\n- grinder: can break down larger objects into generic ammunition for the blunderbuss\n- gauss rifle: uses the arm's own power supply to launch metallic projectiles, higher level = \n- furnace (+ furnace upgrade tree): melts down increasing durable minerals in less and less time. First upgrade only needs stone to create the most basic furnace\n- hammer: create small shelters, traps, other miscellaneous useful structures\n- fabrication drones (max upgrade = escape vehicle construction?): utilizing resources already gathered, does large scale de/construction for you \n- storage upgrades: everything will be stored in the arm as a base resource, upgrade this for more instead of the usual room full of chests\n- fist / glaive / scythe / whatever cool sharp stabby thing: upgrade to increase effectiveness against animals\n- taser: non-lethal for scaring off animals that could otherwise harm you. Could be to avoid harming animals or ward off ones you cannot yet confront\n- solar panels: charge the arm from sunlight (and less but still some with moonlight) instead of consuming &amp; burning wood for power\n- typical efficiency upgrades: reduce power consumption of various activities, increase power restoration from various activities, etc\n- grill: cook meat you harvest from animals\n- bionic eyes: unlocks various eye upgrades (nightvision, \n- electric discharge: used to start fires, precursor to (or first version of?) non lethal stun taser thing\n- flamethrower: use some combustible fuel source to spray flames because you hate nature\n- mineral detector: helps you locate requested resources\n- sonar: sonic pulse that maps out your surroundings for a quick check on hostile wildlife, nearby structures / caves, etc\n\nI also have the idea for upgrading the rest of the character. Not sure how to organize that one, but you could use the robotic arm to perform surgery on your legs to give you robotic ones. That could result in faster movement, jumping higher, reduced food consumption, etc. \n\n*flora &amp; fauna*\n\nI don't have a specific setting in mind for this, but I think boars, deer, bears, a generic fish, and 1 passive animal that's easy to capture for meat would be a good start. It would make each relevant related upgrade feel useful. Boars would be the aggressive-when-attacked middle animal and bears will be the threat that is mostly avoided until the player can get far enough along in the tree. If the user focuses on body upgrades and non-lethal defense, they could actually get through this game without killing anything. Maybe this wilderness / island can grow quinoa so they have that as an option for protein. I don't know if I'd want to copy the *specific nutritional requirement* systems a lot of games are adopting, but having those food options there would probably please the crowd that enjoys them without annoying the people who hate it. Maybe there can be buffs for having properly balanced nutrition instead of penalties for only being able to find/consume 1 kind of food. After getting killed for the nth time by wild bears in subsistence, my mind drifted back to this game idea. Another visualization that frequently comes to mind is upgrading the power / durability / whatever on the arm so when a bear tackles you and comes in for a bite, you just bitch slap the pelt off that fucker and continue with what you were doing. Maybe some players will opt for the violence tree that ends with a massive glaive / pike that you can shove through the brain of the biggest beast on the island. Others will opt for the adaptive stun baton that will use enough electricity to spook off a given target. A few might rush for the robo-body upgrades right away so they can subsist on sunlight alone. \n\n*game goals*\n\nIf the premise of this game is that your hand/arm are some infinitely complex and advanced robotic miracle that borders on magic, then picking a good end goal is tough. Build a satellite that can connect you to the internet so you can ask for a rescue? Use fabrication drones to build a boat / submarine / helicopter / rocket and drive back home? Become entirely robotic and live in peace on the island for all eternity or become skynet? Build a nuclear missile and destroy the world? It's not easy to choose. Maybe a few of these can be picked as options unlocked by the players play style of being hostile / passive. Anyway, here are some disorganized game goals from the start:\n\n- observe your robotic hand and get some shitty tutorials on its basic functions\n- go punch a tree and pick up the sticks which burn up inside the arm to mysteriously produce power\n- use the powered up arm to more rapidly harvest wood to get a surplus\n- gather stones and build a furnace\n- use the furnace to melt a weak mineral which is used for the first handful of various upgrades AND boil water (until then, I guess water is tied to fruits? but this is a pretty easy milestone, so no worry of early unfair deaths) \n- catch a little animal or harvest a quinoa plant (or whatever it is) \n- harvest some fruit / vegetables growing on the island \n- get balanced nutrition buff that makes your annoying survival meters go down MUCH slower\n- build a basic shelter\n- sleep to fast forward through time\n- eat and drink some more\n- collect increasingly advanced materials while slaughtering local wildlife \n- build a thing\n- win\n\n=\n\nAs you can see, it's more of a vision of a handful of neat things than a complete game, but since it's a survival game there isn't much more you need for something people will enjoy and dump a few hundred hours into. I like how complex green hell is but I also like how simple subsistence is. Any number of small additional quirks like a robot hand can make games like those play entirely differently, and that's why I own so many different survival games even though their differences are pretty minimal. I would definitely enjoy this game idea as well. I expect in my own ventures, I will get as far as a grey cube that can shake slightly as a brown cube with a green cone on top of it disappears. I hope this idea entices some individual or team, I'd really like to see it!"

9ex277,Want simulation game ideas/simple game ideas for mobile games.,[removed]
9ewm9s,Game Idea I've started working on. Need help to make it more enjoyable and fun,"Hey   \nBasic Premise:\n\nThe game will be a river making game where the player will carve out a path on the map and the river will start to follow the path. The river will increase the speed on slopes and slow down on plains. (automatically)  \nThe look : It will be a top down 2D view. It will look mostly like how maps look.   \n\n\nDesign : The game will be distributed on different levels and sublevels. Each level will have 7-10 sub levels. Goal in each level is get to the next point / end of the map and to cover more area.  \nLevel 1 - Find a path to the exit.  \nLevel 2 - Make greenery, find eroded land parts and go across them. Eventually they will turn green.  \nLevel 3 - Lakes. The river flow is slow and water level is also slow, go to each lake or create a small stream from there to main river to get speed.  \nLevel 4 - Avoid flooding.  \nLevel 5 - Avoid polluted waters / river / canal etc.\n\nLevel 6 will be a mix and match of the previous ones.\n\nGameplay : The player will start from a source and will drag mouse / touch to create a path. Then the player can draw another stream from the  river and create branches of the river to achieve objectives.\n\nI think this game has a good start but I'm unable to find the main strength of the game.   \n"
9ewezx,Weaver of Fate,"  This is another video game idea I have. Once again I'll use the Playstation controller to describe the buttons. You control one character in third person.X is used to jump. Square and triangle attack. Holding L1 would block and dodge. Pressing square at the right time while blocking will counter like in Ninja Gaiden. In order to use a certain type of weapon you have to train with it. To do this you enter a dojo type area and have to preform all combo's with the weapon. At the beginning of the game you'll train with a basic weapon. Later you will train in weapon shops. As you advance in the game you can train further with the types of weapons. Weapons and armor that are too heavy will slow you down and some you won't even be able to wear. With magic you either equip rings or get tatoos with symbols for the spell. Holding down L2 or R2 will zoom close to your character and give you a sight to aim for enemies. If you are holding down L2 you can assign spells to R2, R1 and both of those combined. With R2 it's the same but reversed. You can also wear necklaces or more tatoos that can be assigned to all combinations of two shoulder buttons. This is for area and curative spells. To use the sight for long ranged spells you first hold L2 or R2 then the combination of the shoulder buttons on the other side. Holding down R1 first will bring a sight like your ranged spells but be for a bow. While holding it down you can use L2 for your weakest arrow, L1 for your strongest and R2 to use what you have the most of. If you have the same amount of different arrows it will use the strongest and then alternate. While your using either ranged magic or a bow you can use X as you do L1 to block and dodge. You can set up area and curative spells to Square, circle and triangle while doing this too. Holding down circle will bring up items. You can set them to the arrow buttons and the shoulder buttons while holding circle.  \n I've always liked the cut scenes in Mass Effect games because you can choose how you respond. The problem I have with it is that you either have to read the responses after another character is done talking making for a long pause which takes away some of the cinematic quality or read them while the characters talking and have to pay attention to both at the same time. So I came up with something simpler. In this game when there is a cut scene where you can respond you use the arrow buttons to choose your response. Up is for positive, down is for negative, left is for neutral and right is for inquire. Or you can push none throughout the game to have a silent protagonist. How this will work is by the time you have to answer yes or no to take on a quest if you haven't said anything your character will just nod his head.  \n As for the storyline it will revolve around your character holding the fate of the world. Whatever he decides will effect the whole world. There would be a timeline with good, evil and neutral quest's. Your alignment will determine whether or not you can take a certain quest. There would be plot points that you only learn depending on what quest's you take. There would be a karma system where when you respond to someone it will give you good, bad or neutral karma. Choosing a positive response won't always give you good karma. If there's a scene where someone is being mean to someone then a positive response will go along with it where as negative will have you protest the situation.  \n I also have an idea where if you go out of your way to be good or evil (which would be called benevolent and malevolent) you will have a special boss at the end. The game will inform you that after you continue your game will be erased and you will get one chance to defeat the boss. If you turn off your system after this point you'll lose your game. If you continue and beat this boss you will become either a king or a tyrant. The benefit for this, other than unlimited money, is in the online mode which would be unlocked after beating the game. This will have extra quest's with up to four people. The leader waypoint would lead them to the next part of the quest while the others will lead them to the leader. If you stray too far you will exit the quest. The leader will be determined by either who has the most experience or if your a king or tyrant which makes you the leader whether you have the most experience or not. If your neutral after you beat the game you can't be a king or tyrant but you can do both good and evil online quests. At the beginning of the game when you're making your character it would always randomize your character so that no two characters look alike in online mode.  \n Karma would also determine what your characters look like. Just no horns or halo's like in fable. Using magic enough will cause your hair to slowly turn white. If you want to have a mage character but not white hair you can dye it in barber shops in towns. You hair would grow in real time and certain haircuts would require longer hair. The same for your beard.  \n How your character develops depends on how you play the game. When you attack and do damage to an enemy your strength goes up. When you do damage with a spell that spell and your overall magic power goes up. With more strength you can use bigger swords and stronger armor without it slowing you down as much. If you want a really strong character use the heaviest sword you can and then work up from there as you play the game. Some spells would require enough magic power. Any items that enhance your attributes will work like a drug. Over time you would need more and more until you need it to get to your normal strength.  \n There would be seven endings. Three for basic good, neutral and evil. And the benevolent and malevolent where you either win the special battle or not. "
9evueq,Dawn of Fantasy," I'm making this because I have a video game idea but don't know anyone who can actually make it. I'll describe how to play with the playstation controller. I have some ideas that I think would make a good Final Fantasy game but unless, by some miracle, Square Enix agrees to make this game that might bring a lawsuit.\n\nGameplay\n\n How it works is you have three characters. One front row and two back row. With the front row character you can move him around with the left joystick and use combos with square and triangle. L1 is to block and dodge. With the two back row characters you can use curative and destructive magic. The view in battle will be with your characters on the bottom of the screen and the enemies on the top. Both enemies and your party will have back and front rows. The back rows can only be attacked with magic or ranged weapons which do less damage than melee weapons. If you defeat all front row enemies your front character will be able to go into the enemies back row and attack with a melee weapon. This is the same for your party. When your front row ally dies you can control either back row allies the same as the front row ally. You can switch between them by tapping L2 or R2. When there are front row enemies still alive you can use the arrow buttons to choose a back row target for your front row ally. Pressing circle would have him attack with a ranged weapon. How you control the back row allies is by holding either L2 or R2. This will pause the game and bring up five options. You can attack, defend, wait, use magic or use an item. The arrow buttons go through the options and X will choose. You must hold down L2 or R2 while choosing. The characters have gauges where when that character attacks or defends it slows down. When the gauge fills the ally can use their magic. With wait the gauge will fill faster but leave the ally more vulnerable to physical attacks. Items can be used at any time but there is a cool down period which also freezes your gauge. If you press R1 you can use your front row ally to choose special attacks done by pressing X and use items. The special attacks require your front row ally to have a full gauge. At the beginning of battle you will choose what your back row allies will start off doing. During this the game will pause. You can attack, defend, wait or use an item. Any time you are choosing spells, items or who your back row allies are attacking the game will pause. The reason I want it that way is because while your making decisions what will your front row character do? Some games let you choose what certain characters do during battle before it starts but I never liked that. I'd rather have the game pause and have more control than choose my strategy before battle. I also have an idea with summon spells where your party will disapear and you will have full control of the summon for a period of time. During this time you can attack with square and triangle. You can also block and dodge. If this becomes a Final Fantasy game it could have all the classic summon characters.\n\nStoryline\n\n This is where I may need it to be a Final Fantasy game for legal reasons. In the beginning there was only one crystal. This crystal was the essence of all life. Then an evil being destroyed it into three pieces. The crystals were then used to banish this being.  Many years go by and someone predicts that he will return so they have the strongest warriors and mages have children. These warriors then die in battle leaving their children orphans. As the game starts the three orphans are given the pieces of the crystal. With them they can bring each other back to life. At some point in the middle of the game they are killed by the evil being shortly after he awakens. The crystals bring your characters back but shatter. Now if they die all hope is lost. Some time passes and all the characters grow up when you next play them. It's possible I can get away with this story but I'd still like it to be a Final Fantasy game."

9eprmd,My video game idea ( part 1 out of ? ),"For a couple of years i am working on a game idea ( its a combination of scribbles , drawings , actual game mechanics , tons of lore and a dream ) \nNow , if you dont want to see another MOBA idea then you should probably leave ... but if you do want to hear the idea of a random pal then you should make yourself a cup of coffee , cause this post is gonna be pretty long.\nFirst of all , even tho my game has a lot of lore in it ( i mean a lot , 3 books written by me to be precised) i still think it does a great job at game mechanics and fairness as well imo . I would say its more on the DOTA side , it still is pretty different from it . I started making this game when i quit playing LOL for 4 years ( gold 2 when i quit ) so Dragon Fire (the games name right now ) would be a way to make my dream of a more fair moba closer to reality . I started by sketching the first commander of the game ( hero , champion , whatever ) which turned out to be a cute but deadly lizard creature named SAM . It isnt my favorite one ( not even close ) but it was the first  , so in a way of respect i kept him in there and didnt trow him in the dark portal ( my bin ) . If i had to compare him to other dudes in different mobas it would be a combination of earthshaker and bloodseeker in dota 2 and a mix of warwick and malphite in league . The actual art for him is a human sized lizard with a sword sticking out of his side . \nThe commanders dont have 4 abilities like most of the time , but 3 , and with a passive ( or 2 sometimes ). The keys for them are 1 ,2 ,3 and not q w e r . Sam's 1 ( q ) is his ""spam"" ability , working a bit like malphites q ( again its not the same , but im trying to compare it with something ) . His 2 (e) enrages him for a couple of seconds giving him better mov speed and atk speed . If he hits something while the duration is on it will be restarted . His 3 (r) gives him bloodlust , giving him even better mov speed and a little amount of atk speed . This duration restarts when he kills another commander . His passive empowers his third normal attack , which now stuns the target for half a second . \nHe should be a tank that can also do a lot of dmg , even more if outnumbered . After 2 years i think hes a bit overpowered , so i changed some things so hes a little bit more skill based , but still keeping him pretty basic . \nHe doesnt have a really long story because back then i didnt think this idea would still live on for so much time . His story is that he lived peacefully with his family until his land was attacked and he had to move blah blah blah ... until he met an asshole giant ( i think it was a giant ) and that giant stuck a sword in his stomach in a fight for territory. He didnt die because of his brilliant healing power and strong will . But he kept the sword in him hoping that one day he will find the giant and kill him with his own sword . end ( i guess)\nAfter SAM i made another commander called Black (its not racist i swear) shadow in the darkness , who to this day has a big impact in the worlds lore . Hes a humanoid with dog like features ( not werewolf ) but still looks almost like a human would . Hes a hired criminal .\n\nIm pretty sure i wanted to write more but i forgot so ill maybe write it in the next post . I still have like 30 commanders to talk about , and i didnt even finish Black . And if you have any criticism about the game im opened to hearing your thoughts .\n\nOh and my first language isnt english so if i made any mistakes im sorry ..."

9epbcm,"Combo Mechanics, skills mechanics.","I though would be nice something like commands that you could choose the form of your attack, in a mage bolt or even a sword attack, to make it personal, and in mutiplayer, it would explore the different people choices and behavior.  Like a combo, for example, to make a line bolt atack ahead, press foward, to make a triangle  bolt atack press V, to make a circle atack press C, and than if you want you can develop/choose to make different combos, which would cast more mana, so than you could choose make a line, than after the bolt line spriting, the circle bolt, so would be ""foward+C"". The same would happen to use the mouse and choose directions, like send a bolt to the sky, to make a aerial atack, or mix a combo which would start with a aerial line bolt going up, than coming down in a triangle form, than finishing with a circle on the ground.  So in the game could have ground monsters, or flying monsters and the combo could be usefull, or could have monsters formations, like a resistent one that splits ahead and weaker ones that stands behind, or weak spots in the monster. So the combos could be usefull to make hits or create camps of defense, healing, etc. It could be something like a few squad of enemies too, sometimes, and be kinda hack slash variation. For the melee fighters, the same combo logics, but with the sword atacks, of course, could have something like aerials too, or throwing something, but in general the sword atacks, something like ""mount blade"" directions logic.                                                                                                                                                           \nI felt would be cool this possibilities because the games are too much boring today, because people are so different, and they come in a game and choose skills and than is the same animation all the time for every person, it becames boring sometimes, would be good if people could choose use simple atacks, and overwhelming combos, which would cost differents mana and make the mage/knight becames tired, and need to replenish after, so not being able to do it so often especially in lower levels. The most cool would be that people could choose the forms of the attacks, so it would make it very personal and variated, and the shape possibilities (like line, circle,etc) would have considerable costs, for the player choose well, in needed moments, or thinking about position, and dont be just spamming skills around all the time.                                                                                                                    \nOne comment apart, i think that's why games like ""league of legends"" have made to many sucess, even in repeated map all the time, is because people can choose different skills, and even in this different skills they can spell it in different positions, choosing timings, and it have considerable costs. The worst about rpgs today is that you got a skill in the lvl 10 and its the same animation for the rest of the game, only increasing damage by the time, so its just spamming skills around, most the skills arent even setable and you dont need ability to use it well.\n\nSorry about the long text eheh, i just would like to simulate what i mean, dont even is necessary the graphics but is the main idea about mechanics, wisely mana costs, and personalization in setable attacks, isnt need the amazed graphics and a lot of shape possibilities, but just think about the variations, even if too many wouldnt be that possible, could be a few."

9eljoe,Rebellion [Game Concept],"Rebellion is set in a dystopian society. Most of the world has been taken over by a confederate-styled organization known as: The Wolves. Who dominate with airships and gas rifles. The few communities that avoid their rule hide out in the forests. One day, the Ramadan clan is attacked. Their village is destroyed for resisting the Wolves’s rule. The last survivor: Ratan, must go on a quest for vengeance. Uniting the clans together to fight against The Wolves. In what is best described as a realistic assassins creed.\n\nRebellion is based around realistic gameplay. Players must sneak trough thick forests and dense castles to kill opponents. Snacking on meat to maintain their stamina and speed. But no so realistic it interferes with the main gameplay. Allowing players to feel like an assassin using guerrilla tactics.\n\nRebellion also comes with two other modes.\n\nSecret Wars: The multiplayer side of Rebellion. Players hide amount crowds of civilians. Trying to blend in and eliminate the other assassins. Or battle team in Team Death-match modes.  \n\nSurvival: A difficult horde mode. Players are locked into a tiny area. Using all the resources they scrounge to battle waves of enemies. Wether chopping up the undead, sniping stealthily with bows, or blasting them with rifles. "

9ehomn,League of the Lawless,"*Please note: This idea does not reflect any political opinions. Just a cool idea.*\n\nThe year is 2042. After war, disaster, and famine have ravaged the Earth. Upon victory in another bloody civil war, activist rights groups have determined use of guns and gun violence is unethical, and that guns should be abolished and disposed of.\n\nThis lead to the Modern Witch Hunt, where everyone was required by law to give up their firearms, as well as other weapons, such as blades, brass knuckles, even some household objects, such as baseball bats and hammers. Those who refused or fought back... “mysteriously vanished.”\n\nEnter the League of the Lawless, a rag-tag group of vigilantes using illegal weapons, namely firearms, in the name of the law, and protecting the nation from evildoers. The only problem? If someone is found dead with a bullet inside them, you get into huge trouble, i.e, death. \n\nIn this sense, there are two phases to the game: normal, open world exploration, and mission-based assassinations. \n\nDuring the open world segments, you explore the city, doing mundane tasks, like stocking up on limited resources, and talking to other NPCs. The map is relatively small, so it would help to get to know everyone as well as you can, as it would help in the assassination segment.\n\nAssassinations are less of an epic, frightening encounter, and more of a puzzle to be solved. Remember, you can kill them in a number of violent fashions, so long as it’s not with a gun.\n\nThis is why knowing the NPCs is important, to know the behaviors and mannerisms of the victim (who’s being attacked) and the villain. (who’s attacking) Note that not all missions will feature a victim, i.e, a late night bank robbery.\n\nThere would be a lot of nuance to the missions, for example, if you’ve discovered the victim is highly against the use of guns, it may be in your best interest to knock them out or escort them away before using a firearm. Some will keep your identity a secret, others will turn you in for money. If the villain is standing under a precariously dangling chandelier, shoot the ceiling and maybe the police will think it simply fell. Maybe there’s a spare beer bottle or trophy you can hit ‘em in the noggin with. Beat the villain down with your fists, even! Throw them into a lion enclosure, leave them to freeze in Russia, **chop off their head and cook it til it explodes in the microwave**, just... don’t shoot. Your gun is a tool, not a weapon.\n"
9egi4v,My game idea,I have a game idea where there is a war going on between gods/mythical creatures and humans.

9eewyu,Defunct franchises in need of a sequel,"General discussion question, what dead game franchise would you most like to see brought back to life and why?  What elements in particular are worth resurrecting in a new game? \n\nMight be a good way to generate some game ideas.  "
9edpre,My game idea,"  \n\nGame idea\n\n**Name:** Code name: Big mama\n\n**Type:** Zombie survival, Action and Adventure (Add one if you want)\n\n**Storyline:** You live in the year 2020, one day you are watching the news and they are talking about a meteor made of diamond speeding towards earth, the people studying it later find out is faster and the core is made out of plutonium and uranium, it is a lot more dangerous then they excpected, so they start a recruitment system to get people into space, to safety.

When you and 49 other 20 year olds arrive nature has taken back everything, it has overgrown all buildings. And what about the people that didn't make it to space? They turned into zombies and are now roaming the earth being the first barrier between you and survival.\n\n**Goal of the game:**  While surviving the zombie apocalypse try to defend a city with the food, water and resources you find so some day people may return and re-inhabit the planet. \n\n**How it works:** You can use the resources you gather to make houses, furniture, weapons and traps. You can find food, water, guns, tools and other resources to survive in houses, shops and campgrounds. The world isn't just a open world, google maps is used to render the by you selected area (you can always make this area larger).\n\nI hope you like my idea and if you have any comments please let me know.\n\nThx\n\n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9eapaw,Overclock: The ball game of the future,"Overview(pitch):    \nOverclock is a fast-paced, team based sports game set in the year 2089. The sport is a combination of hockey, soccer, and basketball and is played on a rectangular stadium with the markings of a soccer field. 2 teams of 5 cybernetically enhanced players will face off in a competition of wits, skill, and strategy to try and throw a ball called the “Clock” into the opposing goal. It won’t be that easy though. The opposing team is armed with extending robotic hands, mechanical legs capable of keeping speed with jaguars, and rad hairstyles that merit serious discussion. Here’s the catch: Your team does too. Play ball like never before with Overclock.\n\nPlayer customization:\nEach player can customize their own unique avatar down to the eyeballs. Although clothes and gear will be sold separately, every single physical feature of the avatar can be tweaked and adjusted to the player’s content. These features include, but are not limited to:    \n-Gender    \n-Hair color    \n-Hair length    \n-Hairstyle, Hairstyle, Hairstyle     \n-Eye color    \n-Eye size    \n-Eye shape    \n-Eyebrow length    \n-Eyebrow thickness    \n-Skin color    \n-Height    \n-Nose size    \n-Mouth size    \n-Arm length    \n-Race    \nPlayers are equipped with a standard team colored jersey(Red or Blue) and shorts that can be traded out for fancier cosmetics with money earned from winning matches.     \n\nGameplay:    \n\nControls:    \nOverclock is played with a classic PC setup, although other ports may be available later on. The player controls the avatar in a third person perspective. The default controls are as the following.     \nW-Move forward    \nA-Move left    \nS-Move backwards/skid    \nD-Move right    \nMOUSE1-Pass Clock    \nMOUSE2-Activate Arm alteration(If active ability is available)    \nQ-Activate power core alteration(If active ability is available)    \nF-Activate Leg alteration(If active ability is available)    \nSPACE-Jump    \nSHIFT-Overclock legs    \nCTRL-Overclock power core    \nE-Overclock throw    \nR-Rotate Overclock Power    \nTAB-Match statistics    \n\nMatch Overview:    \nBefore the match begins, there is a setup phase where each player calls out their position in the chat box. Although the positions called out in the chat are not binding, the next phase is. Each player(randomly scrambled) will take turns selecting a position to be in throughout the game. The positions include goalie, offense, midfield, and defense. Each OverClock match lasts 10 minutes. At the end of the ten minutes, whichever team gets the most points wins, or the match ends in a draw. At the 5 minutes halftime mark, the team is automatically logged into a voice chat system to discuss tactics and how they can better improve their playstyle in the next half of the match. Points are scored by the clock being thrown into the goals on either end of the playing field.     \n\nVisual Orientation:    \nThe player uses the mouse to look around the field, while turning the avatar’s orientation to meet the field of vision, and can run in different directions using WASD. The field of sight is locked onto the back of the avatar and turning too fast will result in rapid deceleration and \npossibly coming to a dead stop before reacceleration.     \n\nInteracting with the Clock:    \nWhen a player runs over the clock while it is not possessed by anyone else, he/she will automatically pick it up. A player can steal the clock away from an opponent using special alterations and intercepting passes. The player can also use MOUSE1 to attempt to grab the clock while not in possession of the it to steal the clock away. This ability is a melee attack and offers the new owner of the clock invulnerability from any other steals for 1 second.     \n\nTo pass the clock to another teammate, they must be in range of your throw. A teammate in range has a white circle around them and is also informed that you are in pass range. To pass the alteration, hold MOUSE1 on a desired location or a teammate and release to throw the clock. While readying a throw, your movement speed is halved. The longer you spend time readying your throw, the more accurate it will be, shown by a white circle centered on your crosshairs, decreasing as time passes. A 100% accurate throw takes 0.8 seconds to charge.     \n\nNow that you know how to pass to your teammates, you should also know how to prevent enemies from doing the same. When using the default, or “stock” augmentations, you can left click to grab the ball from an opponent when you are in melee range from them(5m). Other augmentations may let you push the ball from your opponents in a certain range or grab the clock from range from another opponent.     \n\n-Leading your shots: Leading shots is a very good tactic for offense. First, you must click and hold your shot ON A TEAMMATE. The ally knows that you are about to pass to him/her via a small message near the bottom of the screen. While charging up a pass to your teammate, drag your mouse around the teammate to show where you are going to throw the clock in accordance to their position. If they are running towards the opponent’s goal, lead your shot so that they can keep running and not have to delay the offensive push.     \n\nWhen the Clock is thrown into the goal, a massive charge up originates on the goal, with an associating sound effect, after a few seconds of that, a brief moment of silence, and then a pleasant “ding” as the scoreboard increases the scoring team’s score by 1. A massive shockwave blasts out from the goal, stylishly lifting the scoring team off their feet and blasting them back to their called positions.     \n\nOverclocking:    \nThe heart and soul of the game, overclocking one of your alterations gives the user a powerful boost for that certain alteration. You may overclock either your throwing arm, power core, or legs to give you a boost unattainable in any other situation. An overclock meter fills up at the bottom right corner of the screen. The following events increase the overclock meter:    \n-Picking up the clock:+2%    \n-Throwing the clock:+2%    \n-Receiving the clock:+5%    \n-For every second the clock is in the air(only when thrown by you):+1%    \n-For every second you are in midair:+0.5%    \n-Intercepting a scoring goal while in the goalie box:+25%    \n-Intercepting an enemy pass:+5%    \n-Passive:+0.5%(per second)    \n\nOverclocking your arm alteration:    \nOverclocking your throwing arm will give you an ultra-powerful throw, reaching the highest possible speed tier. The throw takes 3.5 seconds to charge-up in real time, but In-game time is reduced by 250% while you are charging up your throw, giving you time to aim your important shot. The clock travels at 60,000 Hammer Units Per second when the throw is released(1900 m/s(Meters courtesy of Valve VUS, 2011, inclusive)).     \n\nOverclocking your power core:     \nOverclocking your power core delivers extra power to all of your units, giving you -50% knockback from all sources except yourself, a +50% speed boost, and a +1 tier throw power upgrade for the duration of 8 seconds. Overclocking your power core costs only 50% of the overclock meter.     \n\nOverclocking your legs:     \nOverclocking your power core gives you a super jump that immobilizes you for 2.5 seconds before launching you into the air with a +750% jump height boost. A single super jump can get you across the arena in less than 5 seconds! You also receive +450% air control while super jumping, as the position of your landing site is also important. When you land, you send out a shockwave, knocking back the clock and all other enemy players in a 25 meter radius.(Meters courtesy of Valve VUS, 2011, inclusive).    \n\nSpeed Tiers:    \nSince the Clock follows a physics-based travel style, It will be able to travel faster and slower based on what players are using or who threw the Clock. How fast the clock is traveling is visualised using speed Tiers. If a clock reaches a new speed Tier, then it is traveling faster than the previous one and has a different set of particles trailing it for each speed tier it reaches.     \n\nSpeed Tier 1: A team-colored trail(Blue or Red)     \nSpeed Tier 2: A fireball blazes behind the clock, team colored    \nSpeed Tier 3: The clock crackles with energy, with team colored lightning trailing behind it    \nSpeed Tier 4: Only attainable by overclocking your arm alteration. The clock is pure white with a blazing trail left behind it.     \n\nAlterations:    \n\nOverview:     \nYou can customize three parts of your character’s body that will affect gameplay, your arm, power core, and legs. You can equip any combination of alterations with your three customizable parts. These alterations do necessarily make you stronger, as they each have their buffs and debuffs, but change your overall playstyle. A certain alteration may also be fit for different types of positions while not viable for others.     \n\nArm alterations(examples):    \n\nThe Lock-N-Load:    \nAn arm alteration that guarantees the wearer a Tier 2 clock upon passing or throwing the Clock, but increases wind-up time by 1.5 seconds, making accurate passes take more time and giving the opposing team a larger window to steal the clock. Best used by defensive position players.    \n\nThe Grappler:    \nAn arm alteration with an active right-click ability that detaches the hand from your arm extension and launches it forward on small rockets in the direction you are aiming. If the hand collides with a player, the clock will be stolen from them and the hand flies back to you, returning the clock. On the downside, you cannot pick up the clock automatically by running into it. This also affects passes to you, making you shoot the clock down midair to gain to receive passes. Like many other weapons, this alteration changes the overclock ability. The overclock ability when using the grappler can only be activated if you have possession of the clock. When activated, your hand, clutching the clock, will launch away from your avatar, speeding across the stadium with+250% speed while you control its flight  in third-person mode. The boost lasts for 7 seconds.     \n\nPower Core alterations(example):    \n\nThe Spectre core:    \nA power core that has an active ability: Grants the user stealth and +50% speed 5 seconds. When stealthed, the player cannot be seen and is shown as a semi-visible, slight ripple in the wind, barely visible and noticeable in the fast-paced environment of Overclock. On the downside, the weapon has a 0.5 second increase when readying a throw. Like many other alterations, this alteration changes its overclock ability. The player can turn fully invisible upon activation for 8 seconds but gains no speed boost.     \n\nThe Barreling Ram:    \nA power core that turns you into a terrifying beast that has the ability to charge up into your enemy's faces in the blink of an eye. Activating your special ability fires your back thrusters into afterburn mode as you perform a slide tackle, knocking the first enemy that you come in contact with 50 meters straight up into the air. Where they may not use any active abilities. This augmentation changes your overclock ability, making you charge up for 2.5 seconds before ramming into an opponent at 1,800 m/s and knocking them back. You can also use this to score an easy goal.     \nLeg alteration(examples):    \n\nThe Refractionators:    \nA set of cyborg legs that gives the user the power to drastically change the direction of a jump with a double jump ability. The double jump will propel the player sharply in a chosen direction, but now the jump ability has a 5 second cooldown. Like many other alterations, the refractor alters its overclock as well as its stats. The overclock now has 50% reduced jump height and distance, but activating a double jump during the super jump will propel the player with enormous speed towards the direction of aim, reaching the ground in a mere 0.34 seconds at maximum jump height.    \n\nThe Turvan Augmentation:    \nA unique augmentation from the faraway lands of Turvania, this augmentation trades speed for resistance to CC and crippling effects to other opponents. The Turvans replace the normal jump ability with a charge-up jump. The longer you charge up a jump, the higher and farther you will jump. Up to 3 seconds of charge, (125 meters forward, 75 meters up). Upon landing, you will create a shockwave on your landing, crippling all opponents in an area around you to a crawl. The downside to this ability is that your jump now has a minimum charge time of 1 second before having to jump, wasting precious time when you sometimes don’t have enough of it.     \n\nThe Curveball:    \nA leg augmentation that alter your movement instead of jumps. This leg augmentation drastically decreases your acceleration time, making you recover from sharp direction changes almost instantaneously, but decreases your base movement speed and resistance against CC and knock back.     \n\nSo.......what do ya'll think?\n"
9eamc5,WAH," Nintendo won't put waluigi in smash because he doesn't have his own games, so here's my idea for a waluigi game. the opening cutscene starts with waluigi rolling through the mushroom kingdom in his signature car, the drifts up to bowser's castle, hops out the whip, rolls up on king koopa himself, and bitch slaps him off the throne. he then proceeds to forcefully take over the mushroom kingdom and the surrounding areas, calling it the Wah empire. you can play as a selection of characters, each with custom cutscenes, dialogue, and endings. they all have their own reasons to take waluigi down. for example, wario and bowser want the throne for themselves, peach, mario, and them basically want to restore peace to the mushroom kingdom, maybe toad want to free his people from servitude. professor egad can see it as a project that can get him more funding. it'll be a platformer, although i don't know if it'll be 2d or 3d. every character will have unique abilities that can reach different areas, and the soundtrack will be a mixture of the weird and often experimental elements from the soundtracks in wario games, and elements of hiphop and trap. the final world, where waluigi is based, will be bright, colorful, zany, and most importantly, trippy and mind bending, waluigi can be portrayed as a sociopath with no other intentions than making the world burn, but with the same crude sense of humor we all know and love.

9e8uhp,Halloween game idea,Long story short we hold a Halloween party every year with a different theme. We decorate the house bar and the house in a theme. Last year was murder mystery and we had to guess there killer throughout the night. This year our theme is religious/church/exorcism. We're going to decorate the entire house and garden as a scary church the bar itself will be a church. We're going to have a confession box in the church/bar. We need a game that will take place in the confession box. \n\nWe're thinking some sort of guess who game..  There will be 40-50 people here playing. We're thinking maybe everyone writes one truth and one lie about themselves. Sit in the confession box pass both over and the other person just guess which is the truth and then try and guess the person. You get a point for each one you get correct. It costs two euro to enter the confession box. Who ever has the most points at the end wins the pot. That's just an idea were bouncing ideas all night so any ideas welcome. 
97lzab,Chess But Every X Seconds You Lose A Random Piece,"A variation on speed Chess but every x seconds on your own timer you lose a random (non king) piece. How long this period is would need to be determined via trial and error though you would likely have multiple options.\n\nIt would add an element of chaos to the game which would drastically change tactics and create an interesting new mechanic.\n\nI propose player vs AI, multiplayer ranked and multiplayer friendly game modes with a variable handicap for friendly games (I might lose a piece every 10 seconds and you lose one every 5 for example).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm marking this as intermediate because online multiplayer would require the maker to know how to create and maintain and active community, coding the AI is not a beginner task and the Elo rating system would need to be changed somewhat to compensate for the luck factor.\n"

97kwnp,Game designs,"Hey guys. I'm an ex game designer and map maker.\n\nI wrote game ideas for the last 10 years basically while hoping for game companies that can make them to spring back up. So, without further ado:\n\n(They're pretty nondescript, I just haven't explained them in a long time, maybe ever.)\n\n**Zombietown**:\n\nSingleplayer: Half Life 2\n\nMultiplayer: N/A\n\nA comedy game focused on a trio of characters, in a semi-Half Life 2 but more British comedy style TV show. A semi-open world (main map being the local area, and then later on you can unlock a couple other locations).\n\nI would be the main character. Ahahaha. It's slightly like Shaun of the Dead so largely I come down and bring the characters into a more blasé look at zombies. It's a vehicle for comedy writing, but because it didn't exist I can't really say it's anything other than a concept. Also gangs exist, so most of the conflict is caused by people instead. A wasteland and a janky cartoony 3d style might be appropriate.\n\nProbably would involve a killer who would hunt them down as they go down to Brighton for a mission related purpose.\n\nBecause my friends are unavailable, I'd probably pick Hat Films to star as the main trio.\n\nIf so it'd probably maybe include hackers, or a bank heist.\n\n**LD2**:\n\nSingleplayer: Halo 2Multiplayer: Esoteric fighting and classes in MOBA-style maps\n\nA sequel to a game I hoped to make. The gameplay was a standard pre-CoD4 FPS, so basically no sprinting and press the analogue stick to zoom in.\n\nAbyssal environments, centered around a character called Anatomica. The character would be able to do a lot of exotic things regarding dimensions, and the whole story was set around playing with game design.\n\nThe design kept changing, but bits and pieces are interesting:\n\nI've got one idea which I don't think is worth it but is still it's the protagonist of this traversing through a minigame centered around 4th dimensional geometry. I figured out a basic minigame/game play but it would need to be prototyped to finish the thing. No practical design experience sadly on 4th dimensional geometry.\n\nThe original game design was more like Bioshock meets an action story like Halo, so it would have more exotic aspects like nudity and unique character back stories like Killer7.\n\n**A BUCKETHEAD 2D GAME**\n\nThis is something I've wanted to make for years but hadn't. Probably because of all the other plans.\n\nThe more inventive ideas for the game included making it a AGS game, except having alternate views so that you can see the opposite side of a 3d object when entering the room above you. His album covers fit for creating a world and experience.\n\n**The Crims**\n\nVery much as the name describes. Wanted to do it like The Sims + GTA San Andreas\n\n**4chan City.**\n\nThis one is close to my heart. Years ago I designed a game with a more XIII style, and I'd still love to, but I think that to make a culture for a website that no longer has one sort of ruins the point. I have so many other projects which are projects in name only. So sadly all of these aren't going to be made, but this even includes a metaphor for how it would function in as a world. Even can be extended to 'Internet city' metaphor.\n\n*Other ones I'll add later.*\n\nIf you're interested in making one, give me a heads up. [royaljello@outlook.com](mailto:royaljello@outlook.com)"
97jinf,A psychological horror/thriller that starts off as a slice of life farming game. You soon suspect the townsfolk won't let you leave.,"In a lottery you don't remember entering, you won a farm in a small town and decide to start life anew. The game starts proper as you meet the nice townspeople and begin farming the first season. But soon you start to realize something ominous is happening.\n\nOn the day the bus line is supposed to resume service, the bus is mysteriously out of commission. When you try to make a phone call, you learn that the phone service is down for repair. The townsfolk are suspiciously keen on presenting you with love interests. You find a shrine that nobody seems to know about or at least mention to you. Every time you pass out from exhaustion, you wake up in your own bed. Someone must be stalking you.\n\nWhile renovating your house, you find markings and traces of blood beneath the floorboards. Someone in town accidentally calls you by another name. While plowing your farmland, you discover unmarked graves. You overhear conversation about ""appeasing the forest sprites.""\n\nIf you look forward through the calendar on the mayor's wall, there's a date/holiday marked with a red X that isn't marked on your own calendar. Something is going to happen on or by that day.\n\n****\n\nYou can choose to continue playing the game as a slice of life farming game, pretending that everything is fine. There's an ending for that.\n\nBut if you choose to try to break free of the farming game cycle, you'll find resistance. The townsfolk become hostile and eventually violent. There's an ending for this too.\n\nThere's also an ending in which you turn the tide on the town and escape. You steer the wrath of these so-called ""forest sprites"" onto the town itself. But the path to this ending might take a few playthroughs to discover."
97h5vm,A game where starts out as a simple micromanagement game and and turns into a story driven narrative about befriending aliens.,"So uhhh this idea is kinda personal in a way. Lots of stuff I like combined into once. I’m trying to get some feedback and help because rn I’be never programmed a game in my life and am working off a free trial of a drag and drop. \n\nAnyways so, basically, the idea is: you are rounding up the 4-5 species of aliens that humans know of so we can dissect and examine them. I imagine that capturing then alien wouldn’t be a huge part of the game, most of the game is spent micromanaging the ship with the alien on it. You’ve got to keep it running, prepare yourself against other alien ships coming to rescue their fellow, and also keep the alien from escaping.\n\nEach day you would pick certain skills you level up and certain things to build and do. For example, for the first third of the day you could level up your building skills, the second third you could spend trying to build a reinforced door on the aliens cell, the third you could spend trying to communicate with the alien.\n\nYour first alien should be almost completely docile and emotionless. Like tutorial levels of docile. Eventually, about half way through your first trip, the alien starts to show signs of emotion. If the player spends enough time trying to talk to alien and comforting the alien they’ll be able to form a bond with it. This will not only allow the players to slowly learn more about the aliens culture and itself, but the alien will also boost skills by telling you about its experiences. I imagine a lot of the dialogue could be similar to that of the ideas of the “humans are space orcs” community. \n\nTo the players that don’t decided to venture down this path it will be a perfectly competent micromanaging strategy game, but there should be just enough hints to tell the player that their might be another option if they take the right steps.\n\nAt the very end of the first trip, the alien could escape all on its own, or the player could either choose to release it or not. Or some other option. Either way.\n\nAfter this the game should slowly increase in difficulty. Longer trips, higher amount of ships coming for you, harder to sate aliens who try harder to escape. \n\n\nSo uhhh yeah! That’s my weird 3am idea. What do you guys think?"
97h3de,Helpfull tools for gamedevs!,"Soooo, when I started (not so long ago) with game development, I din't know tools that are free to help me so I listed some helpfull tools!  \n\n\n\- **Hacknplan,** This is the perfect planning website, since I started using it I felt more satisfied and I make more progress. It is just perfect.  \n\- **Adobe Xd,** This is free! And it is perfect for designing; websites, UI, etc.  \n\- [**draw.io**](https://draw.io)**,** No, this isn't a .io game where you draw. This is a program/website where you can make diagrams. This is very helpfull to get your ideas visualised.  \n\- **paint.net ,** This is a easy to use and free replacement for adobe photoshop; yes there are many good replacements but that is the one I used.  \n\- **MagicaVoxel,** This program is perfect if you can't model. I used this program to make basic models.  \n\- **Bosca Ceoil,** Even if you're not a musician you can still make something reasonable out of this. This is a free music program!  \n\- **Audacity,** This is perfect for audio effects and such things. I din't use this much yet because I din't needed it yet.  \n\n\nThat is my list!

97g5rm,Open world villain game where you try to gain traction against a bunch of heroes,"This game idea just occurred to me when I was replaying spider-man 3, but a game where you have a goal in mind as a villian (maybe classic world domination) and you try to build it up, but everything you do attracts attention to you from other heroes.\n\nSingle player, the ""heroes"" that come to foil you would be AI.\n\nYou have a choice in what you want to do and your overall goal, whether it's stealing important components for a machine, stealing money, or you just do it for the sake of carnage ect.\n\nThe way I envisioned it, say you went to rob a bank, I'd imagine an GTA-esque scenario, where there's high chance that a hero (maybe a weaker one) goes to help out and you've got to deal with this guy\n\nThe more you do, the more heroes become aware of you and you can have superman type heroes hunting you down and trying to bring you to justice\n\nYou'd be encouraged to try to be lowkey about things and it'd be a challenge because you actually won't have the type of power to fight these guys early on, it'd be like an actual scenario from a comic book when a hero is thwarting some villain.\n\nThere are other villians around the world and you'll be able to interact with them and team up with them (if you can find them). You can witness these villians fighting heroes in the street and just roaming around.\n\nI'm sure something like this probably wouldn't have a large fanbase, and it really just was something that mildly interested me and was cool IMO. Plus, the idea I had seems pretty complicated to make in a 3d world. In my mind, it would be a really fluid world that seems like an actual comic book with randoms fights breaking out, I'm sure these things would be pretty difficult to make."
97frjm,My last and final fighting game character design I need some advice on,"Right now I have a bunch of characters and a lot of the themes revolve around futuristic cyberpunk/horror and some fantasy themes mixed in. So I have a variety of characters in the mix.\n\nI need help with deciding the better choice for my last character.\n\nI want to design an African American female fighter and my options are to make her a female cyberpunk mad scientist with cyber tech gear, a martial artist/movie star actress that fights like Bruce Lee, a cyberpunk police officer with flying drones she uses to attack or a secret high tech cyber agent/spy with super spy tech gadgets. Which one of these ideas and designs sounds the best for her?\n\nIf there are any other suggestions to help with any ideas or design for this character if anyone wants, I would greatly appreciate it too.\n\nThank you for anyones help."
97e93x,Metaphorical Shooter,"I've been thinking to combine multiple elements from a few of my favourite shooter games. Like for example, I love the stage selection style of G-Darius and I'd like to use it, and I am thinking to use a special attack move Strikers 1945 style.\n\nAside from that I also have added another mechanics - a kind of unique 'power up' and bomb mechanics. Three kinds of ""power up orbs"": R G B; and the player has six slots to contain them. It works something like this: suppose the player's current slots have R  GG BBB. This translates into: 1 white, 1 cyan, and 1 blue; so player's ship is going to shoot level 1 white (which is about as strong as lvl 3 red, green, or blue), level 1 cyan (as strong as lvl 2), and level 1 blue.\n\nBut suddenly I got an idea; how about if I turn this shooter game into half visual novel-ish. So while the player is playing shooter game, the stage tells a story. The player controlled plane represents something while the enemies represent something else.\n\nProblem I have now, is the fact that it's hard to find something to make a metaphor of to fit the stage mechanics... With the stage mechanics like G-Darius I figured out the stories need to be chronological with each progressing level, but need to be kind of independent at the same time so it doesn't matter from where the player came from.\n\nG-Darius's stage: You start at zone α (alpha). After you finish you are offered two choices: zone β (beta) and zone γ (gamma); after you finish stage two you can go to zone δ (delta) or zone ε (epsilon) from β, or zone ε or zone ζ (zeta) - so this makes a triangular pattern for the stages. With 5 levels there are 15 stages. I plan to use it but I will make it 9 levels, 45 stages; because coincidentally there are 46 Japanese alphabets and one of them is very special which I can use for a hidden stage or something.\n\nFor now to fit the mechanics I'm thinking to make it something kind of like ""dating stories"" with each stage representing different girls. \n\nI'd like some thoughts on this. Does it sound interesting? If anyone reading this has a brilliant idea, please comment. Thanks in advance."

An MMO that is based on lets say 4 Armies fighting for control of continents using modern military technology. If the army you choose to fight for wins the continent, you get loot crates that do NOT require microtransactions :) I'm not sure how difficult this would be to make but I think it could be an awesome gaming idea that would really pull on the COD and battlefield player base to join in!

8liect,A game inspired for Advent Rising.,"For those who do not know it:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_Rising\n\nIt could be a reboot or a different story, but it would be a game of action and adventure in third person putting emphasis on the combat using extraordinary powers of the protagonist. The powers would be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Powers related to information, absent in the original game: radar, being able to perceive through opaque objects, being able to perceive camouflaged enemies, hidden messages and ambient threats, being able to perceive the aura of individuals and perceive their intentions or identity to unmask traitors, possessed or shapeshifters, even perceive a virtual future, like *Prince of Persia.*\n\n2. Telekinetic powers: being able to push, pull or crush objects and people at a distance, be able to jump very high or fly at the last levels of the game, which could lead to the game being open world.\n\n3. Increased attributes: alter the matter of own body for greater resistance, speed, strength, self-regenerative health and mobility as *Infamous.* \n\n4. Powers related to the manipulation of energy: shoot projectiles close to absolute zero, shoot plasma beams at high temperatures, capable of generating hard light blade and shield.\n\n5. Powers related to the manipulation of space-time: dash, weaponized dash, as charge of *Mass Effect*, slow down time, teleport, projecting a black hole in the form of a blade for brief moments, projecting a white hole as shield, immunity to time stop.\n\n6. Powers related to the ethereal body: astral projection to explore, to be able to return to your body if you have suffered fatal injuries with a mini-game perhaps, immunity to mind control.\n\n"
8lhuy2,A visual novel about cheating in a relationship,"I'm not sure if there is such a game (there probably is, but it may not be prominent enough to be significant), so I ended with this idea. \n\nThe format is a visual novel, and at the very start of the game you are introduced to your fiance. The first scenes would leave the player the impression of the relationship being boring or mediocre, like the CG showing a bland apartment, or the music being generic. The fiance though won't appear as boring, but their interaction will be brief. The brevity is to make the player not have much of a connection with them, thus enabling the player to want to take the cheating route, but have a good enough impression to be kept in mind.\n\nEventually the player will meet someone they may want to cheat with. The love interest(s) will end up taking up most of the interactions the player will have throughout the game, thus further giving incentive for the cheating route. Whether or not the interactions end with good or bad outcomes, the player will receive a text from their fiance that may either guilt them or encourage them into the route. Ex. if the player ended an interaction supporting the route, the fiance will text the player pictures of them trying out wedding dresses, or telling them how much they miss them or how they first met. \n\nThroughout the game, the player ends up learning about their fiance through conversations, items and places representing a part of their relationship. This makes the player steadily grow a connection with the fiance without directly interacting with them. The love interest(s) in contrast will appear attractive and exciting to get to know, but have shallow relationship depth.\n\nAt a critical part of the game, the player is either encouraged or discouraged depending on what route they are taking. If they are going for the Cheating route, the player will go on a date with their fiance before they go home and have a heartfelt scene with them, thus discouraging the player to finish the route. However, the Faithful route will lead the player into knowing a deprecating flaw about the fiance. Ex. lying to them, being distrustful, being pushy etc. It can also give more depth to the love interests, Ex. learning about their hopes and dreams, their vulnerabilities, their past etc.\n\nDepending on the what the choices the player amounts to leads to these endings: \n\nIf the player decides to do Faithful route, it will present itself as a Bad End. The fiance will greet the player happily, have dinner together, and overall be as mediocre as the beginning. Bad End will appear in an unpleasant font on the last CG and ""defeat"" sounding music.\n\nThe Cheating route will be the Good End, though instead of the mediocre tone of the Bad End, will leave the player with a dramatic emotional-scene without much of a reward. Good End appears in a shiny font with victorious sounding music.\n\nSo that's pretty much it, there may be more to add to this game but this is what I have so far."
8lht2y,A game based on the Legion series.,"For those who do not know it.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(TV_series)\n\nIt would be in third person and we would be David Heller, with many dialogues, monologues and puzzles to solve, an adventure similar to *Dreamfall* or *Life is Strange*, but with some action and combat, but not on the physical plane, but on the mental plane. The story would develop around us while we try to distinguish reality and fiction, external reality and internal reality, sharing the confusion of our protagonist with situations more surreal than those of *Silent Hill* or *The Evil Within*.\n"

8ldw12,An Action Adventure Open World Set In the South Pacific (1937-1939),"So I have always been a huge fan of the Indiana Jones movies, and recently replayed Uncharted 4. These two mixed with the newest season of [Archer](https://imgur.com/a/9Z43EZj) have got my imagination going.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nThis is basically an homage to [1930s-1950s action adventures](https://imgur.com/a/BPsg3mP). The same inspiration for the [Indiana Jones movies](https://imgur.com/a/sL20vkc) and an awesome show, [Tales of the Golden Money.](https://imgur.com/a/t60oBUQ)\n\nI thought this genre would lend itself nicely to video games, and thought people may enjoy ripping around the South Pacific Islands fighting Nazis, Imperial Japanese, undiscovered tribes, and nature. \n\n**Game Title**\n\nHave given this a little thought ,but I would love to hear what you guys think. I am partial to *Lost Horizon* but that is the title of a 1937 film. Also Horizon has been used recently in a game title so ... I guess have some stuff to chew on.\n\n**Setting**\n\nAs I said above I was envisioning this taking place in a fictional island chain in the South Pacific (1937-1939). Im imagining that there will be a sizable distance between Islands, and that there might be a larger island that can have a big city. Im thinking that Suva ,Fiji might be a good place to have this large city. Im imagining that most islands will have [dense tropical jungle, and some small villages/ port outposts.](https://imgur.com/a/rObqwD9)\n\n**Characters/Abilities**\n\nIm imagining the main character will be a mesh of a bunch of different characters mentioned above. Think of an Indiana Jones/ Nathan Drake blend. A maverick hero, who would be able to insert witty commentary for the ridiculous/ fantastical situations he finds himself in. \n\n*Backstory:*Ex US pilot who fought in the Spanish Civil War as part of the [Yankee Squadron.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Squadron) This would make the main character in his late 20s/early 30s. After leaving the Spanish Civil War, he finds himself flying a cargo plane in the south pacific. All of this is flexible, I pretty much just ripped off the backstory for Archer, but I feel this works perfect as it puts the character in the perfect place in time for this story to work. \n\n*Other characters:*I think that it would be nice to have a sidekick type character. Also a similar theme throughout all of these action movies is a main love interest. \n\n*Villains:*Nazis are a go to, but it might be a bit overworked, any suggestions would be awesome!\n\n**Game play**\n\nIm imagining it will play a lot like Assassins Creed 4 - Black Flag. You can fly/ upgrade/ buy new planes to traverse the map. I want to have many options of seaplanes to choose from, as this will be you main mode of transportation and way of making money.As you roam around you can do simple supply missions, rescue missions, treasure hunt, and a to be determined string of main story missions. All of this while there are massive weather events that you must deal with.  \n\nI hope you guys enjoy this idea, and look forward to hearing some feedback/ suggestions! Also if someone could come up wild a fun story to go along with this fun setting. \n\n**TL;DR:** Open world game similar to Assassins Creed 4 where you roam around islands finding treasure/ performing other missions. Difference being you play as an Indiana Jones type bush pilot who runs his own cargo service.\n"
8lcilw,A Pokemon game with realistic-ish Pokemon battles,"I always thought turn-based 2D games were fine given the media they were on. But what if....\n\n\nSo let's say you're on a 3D platformer. You've been in town all this time but you just now get outside of town, and you have a Pokemon. When you enter into a Pokemon battle, it's not because something in the wild that you couldn't see just sort of blindsided you; it's because you stumbled upon it while exploring a jungle or something, either got attacked/attacked it yourself, and then kind of hunt-style, chased it down.\n\nAnd during Pokemon battles you actually play as the Pokemon you have out, battling. You can use less important command buttons for trainer commands - like giving you an item or something, I guess. But in the shows Pokemon battles are more fluid, like a battleground; and this could be replicated pretty easily.\n\nI like the idea that I'm a trainer who has to sneak up behind an Abra, find it sleeping in a tree branch in the woods, toss my Pokeball and release my Bulbasaur; who puts it to sleep, then it falls or something and hits the ground getting injured, and I can then throw the Pokeball, hitting a command button on my remote that causes the trainer behind Bulbasaur (with me as Bulby) to throw the Pokeball before Abra vanishes. \n\nAnd so on.\n\nIs such a game possible?"
8l2khk,Battle Arena Game - Looking for people,"Hi, I'm a developer.\n\nI'm a huge online player, and also cooperative games player. And recently, I have been fed up of playing on games like LoL or OW with young people or just crazy people who ruin your game experience by trolling or flaming. \nSo I'm starting to develop mine. Don't think with the name that's it's a new ""Battle Royale"" game-like, I'm not a fan of this type of games.\n\nIf you know the anime Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Zero, the gameplay is easy for you to understand. You play only cooperative, 2v2 or 2x7 (didn't decide yet). One of the two players is a mage with spells (etc), but quite weak. And th other player who teams with him is a strong class (assassin/Ninja/Berserker/etc) and has to protect him. The goal is too defeat ennemies (quite simple).\nBut one more rule, if you kill the mage, you kill his protector too.\n\nI think it can be quite fun as a cooperative online battle game. But it will take me some time to do this alone. That's why I'm looking for developers who would like to make this project come true.\n\nOr any ideas about the gameplay are welcome.\n"

8l1p66,Ideas to expand maze survival game,"Hi. I need some ideas to expand my maze survival game. Sorry, at this moment I don't have a game story to tell (could use some help with this too :)) You just start in a forest to survive, but you start with some gear and a weapon, because there are many enemies (animals, soldiers, zombies and creatures) all around you have to fight for a place to build and survive. So in the beginning there will be a lot of action, but once you have builded a camp you can 'choose' to go for easy/almost non violent (mainly farming) or go for fast paced shooting. At this moment the playing world is divided into three 'biodomes', a forest, a maze and a desert. The forest and desert are connected through the maze, so you have to go through the maze to get into the other biodomes. I'm thinking of implementing a sort of maybe 'hemp' farming so that the players can exchange an amount of hemp to get an easy passage through the maze.\nThe idea is that you have other resources (to build or craft) at the different biodomes, so you have to visit them ones a while. Maybe some other ideas why a player should visit the other biodomes?\nAlso I'm thinking of whether or not I should put in something that the players should defend, maybe an object or so, or maybe the hemp that players can farm gets attracked by enemies... this way the multiplayer aspect could bring some teamwork gameplay.\n\nAny ideas are welcome :)"

The ruling? The AI is too powerful and should be shut down.

You could take most of your time to create a functioning warp drive to get to another planet or a rocket to leave earth, or land somewhere else. (Other ideas too, of course.) Additionally, certain things may help you “start up”. \n\n“Start up”? Start to create your force to come and destroy those who seek to dismantle you, of course!

8kp0pf,Real world idea.,"Now this is just a game idea I've been thinking of that cannot and will not play with today's technology. But this is like a maybe 20 yrs in the future type game. So let's go to the start of the game. It is the stone age, you choose what country you start off in and each country has it's own good and bad things and if you start off in the stone age or a time before sea travel then you must stay where you choose. But its multiplayer and the whole game is played on 1 server. The Earth. Maybe different servers for different regions but the main idea is 1 server for a ton and I mean a ton of people. Every month the game passes through 1 thousand years. And each real time month a new update comes out featuring new inventions from that time. And the game is basically first come first serve. Unless you want to be left in the dust. The server resets whenever it gets to the year 2000. But other than that, yoy show up and start however you can. People will have better stuff than you but that's something you will have to deal with. Basically: Real Life The Video Game."

8kn3md,Ironclad - an alternate history ship RPG/ship action-adventure game.,"Abstract: Manage the submarine-battleship Dreadnought and her crew as you and the entire allied powers of WW1 take on the sunken continent of Atlantis, then the Eldritch abominations below that. But watch out! Evil Atlantis can control the weather, so you'll be sailing through hurricanes to get at their ships!\n\nPre-game exposition: The story takes place in an alternate history mid-1920s. The start and middle of WW1 came and went generally as expected, except that what we don't know is that the Central Powers found Atlantis, a still-existing mostly-underwater civilisation that lives in under-the-seafloor caverns vaguely reminiscent of the hollow-earth ideas. Just as the war's about to end, Atlantis is finally persuaded to join the central powers, mostly because of their own evil plans to take over the world and so forth. Atlantis, by the way, figures out how to sorta control the weather, at least when it comes to the ocean. So they launch all sorts of giant waves and crazy storms at the allies, especially Britain, and the east coast of the US, with their attack waves following closely behind. The Atlantis forces would, naturally, consist of giant robots. As the war rages on, the central powers in Europe fall, distancing themselves from the central powers over in Atlantis, and it kinda becomes ""Everyone in the world who gives a darn vs. Atlantis."" After ten years of fighting, they have almost-entirely uncontested control over the Atlantic, or at least the deep atlantic, but the major nations have managed to keep control over their land - so Atlantis might have footholds in Africa, the Caribbean, and maybe a bit of South America, but it's mostly an ocean war. But ten years of constant war has led to a great many scientific advancements on the allied side, and they're not as outmatched as they once were.\n\nin-game Plot: As Britain's coasts were devastated, many of the shipyards fled to the less contested Pacific Ocean, and moved to Australia. So your character is the XO (executive officer) of a newly commissioned warship, probably called the HMAS Dreadnought, a submarine battleship - not the first, but the first Australian one. Now, by submarine battleship, this is a surface battleship with kind of a turtle shell that goes over the deck, it's capable of submerging maybe 200 metres at most, partly to avoid sinking in heavy weather. You're ordered into a fleet action against the Atlantian forces in the Pacific, fighting through an artificial typhoon to take on their forces. Trying to keep the crew functioning and adequately following your captain's orders, your ship is plunged into battle after battle, eventually, if you did things right and you don't find yourself fighting against frequent amphibious mecha invasions of your allies, you push the Atlantians off of the surface of the ocean. You're transferred to a new ship, a deep-diving assault submarine, your first actual command. This submarine (placeholder name: HMAS Krakenslapper) leads the assault on the sunken continent of Atlantis itself, punching past the outlines of the old Atlantis, and fighting through the underground city within. If it goes well, the defenders retreat to the caverns below the seafloor. Here, stuff gets pretty weird - you get to meet and generally fight the whacky monstrosities, sometimes lovecraftian in nature, which the atlantians have subjugated, allied with, or contained. You can convince the atlantians to surrender, or y'know, murder them all, but by now you've basically unleashed cthulhu, and you get to learn all about how their kind used to live somewhere else, then inhabited the earth fleeing from a disaster, and then they got buried alive and would love to get out and feast on the landscape. At some point command decides that they'd like to put the lid back on this can of worms and buries these caverns with a heck-tonne of rock, or maybe just diverting some magma because we're not messing with nature enough already. You can wholeheartedly agree with their scheme, negotiate an unsteady peace with the monsters instead, or go down there and murder them all - the third option results in some kind of ""what monsters have we ourselves become"" monologue, probably during the ending cutscene.\n\nWhy aren't you the Captain?: The reason you're an XO and not the captain of the HMAS Dreadnought is that, as the captain, it would generally be assumed you could sail wherever you want, and designing the coastline of the entire earth might be too much work - therefore, the captain picks the destination, or he might decide on one after consulting with you on a few options. Depending on your performance, and the performance of the crew below you, you gain more and more of the ability to influence the captain, his superiors, and their superiors, as well as convincing enemies to surrender - this becomes especially important late-game, as you can argue for policy changes, and this score is essential to choose a non-standard ending.\n\nGameplay: Almost all of the game would take place from a 1st-person perspective, as you go around the ship. While you can help some with strategy, an XO's main job is to handle day-day activities, which is reflected by the main gameplay. When not in battle, the ship needs maintenance, parts need repair, the crew needs their boredom alleviated, and to be kept on task. When fighting, you manage damage control, organise people into doing what fits the captain's orders, keep everything working, and sometimes, take over for a crew member having a nervous breakdown. While the Captain manages the ship, you micromanage the ship, making sure no critical bits are overlooked, and often participating hands-on. Obviously, most players aren't sailors, and neither am I, so a lot would have to be dumbed down. There would be a bit of FPS stuff, especially in the battle for Atlantis, and when you get put in charge of the Krakenslapper, the gameplay is more command oriented, kinda silent hunter 5-style. A great deal of the gameplay would really be character-oriented dialogue and ""keep the team together"" sort of stuff, trying to keep morale up and the ship and the crew going efficiently. Oh yes, and you'd definitely get to fly a reconnaissance floatplane at some point, so airplanes would happen. Though friendly units help out a lot, especially when carrying out a decent strategy, it's supposed to be a very hard game, and the tables can certainly turn. If your ship performs pretty badly or you fail to propose a change to Admiral failure's grand strategy, you may find yourself facing increasingly-difficult defences of friendly coastlines, or escorting fleeing monarchs and presidents, until the nations capable of fighting back all fall. There'd be a normal mode, with reloading saves, then a hardcore mode, where if your ship falls and you escape with a decent chance of rescue, you can be put on charge a slightly smaller Australian vessel, but if you yourself die, game over, the status of the campaign thus far calculates a brief of an ending in the game over cutscene. There'd also be a co-op campaign mode in which the second player is an XO or the commander of one of your ship's escorts. Among the two most important things to me is that this game would definitely need to have very good graphics, and the characters would have to be very well written.\n\nHow hard would this be to make?: Probably pretty hard - I'll give it a flair level of ""experienced"". Cartoon graphics would be out of the question, so this game would require a great deal of work, especially when it comes to waves, weather, structures, scale, explosions, faces - ok, everything. The game AI, both ships and crew, would have to be very complex in order to avoid being very annoying. The sound design would have to be pretty good, and not just the music - the sounds of battle/not battle would have to deliver an immersive feel, best exemplified by upcoming game Post Scriptum. The weather would need to be reflected accurately in the sky, in the surface of the water, and below, which would take a lot out of the physics engine, and require a great deal of research. Aspects of ship management should be dumbed down, but should still be generally accurate, so that's more research, and the damage system would have to be generally realistic (if with a bit of plot armour)."
8kmmow,Project Cars: in arrivo la versione per dispositivi mobili,

No micro\-transactions needed, everything is unlocked in\-game with free updates every so often that add new troops, weapons, and gear. I personally like this idea 100&amp;#37; better than the original idea I had for it \(C&amp;C \+Skylanders, just a simple top\-down shooter with a portal to put cards on\).

8kch10,Oh no... My li'l killer now has a shotgun...,
8k9546,A multiplayer survival game with a STRONG emphasis on team work,"We all know the biggest faults with multiplayer survival games is the player killing and yes it's supposed to ""add to the action"" but it honestly just makes the game less fun. If games like DayZ or Rust had a way stronger emphasis on team playing like you can only build a shack by yourself but the more people you add, the larger your base can become. Or swarms of zombies or whatever are too large to take on by yourself so you need team mates to do it. It wouldn't be horrid if a large team went up against another one, but there should be far more benefits to working together as it's far more realistic. In reality if zombies were killing everyone you wouldn't kill your neighbours you would use your shared skills to survive it together.\n\nI also think that the loot from dead players should be downgraded as someone else has used it before. Damaged armour, a worn gun, half eaten food and the like so killing people wouldn't even be worth it.\n\nIf one of these early access games could come out with this system I think they would get a lot better attention."
8n3oiv,Massively Multiplayer/Battle Royale Roguelike,"So, I was thinking about what makes the Battle Royale genre fun to play, as I'm firmly in the category of ""Battle Royale has opened up so much design space and we needa explore this genre ASAP"", and it occurred to me that Battle Royales are a lot like MMOs, just without the persistence \(and also they're usually shooters, but that's irrelevant\).  \n\n\nThe actual idea is that we could have a PvE oriented RPG, but use the instanced formula of Battle Royales. Essentially, you would queue up and get placed with a bunch of strangers \(probably either 20 or 100\). You would start at level 1 in either a starter town or the entrance to a dungeon. You each can go about leveling up, collecting gear, potentially partying up, and progress onto killing the dungeon's floor bosses. When a floor boss is killed, a global chat message would go out saying X player killed the boss for the floor, and that boss wouldn't respawn. The game could have multiple objectives, but the main one would be killing the final boss of the dungeon, at which point a score board could come up showing the names of the players who killed each of the bosses and completed various achievements \(e.g. collected the most gold, killed the most slimes, killed a secret optional boss, etc\).  \n\n\nThe actual gameplay type doesn't matter all that much to me, though as far as feasibility for an indie studio it'd probably be best to make it a 2D action roguelike ala Vagante or Caveblazers. It could have ""perma""death or not. Alternatively it could even lean in a more MMO direction and mimic something like vanilla wow gameplay on a much smaller instanced scale. You could potentially even set it up to allow for player crafting, gathering, guilds and etc so that if players want they can opt for a more economic or social playstyle instead of participating in the boss rush of sorts \(although that would radically increase the work needed for an MVP\).  \n\n\nEssentially the idea would be to establish a sort of mmo feel with ""world first"" clears and such, but on a much smaller time scale and without nearly as much of a long term commitment."
8n1pyb,Looking for ideas : 8 player local multiplayer game,"Hi! I've been lurking in here for a while but have never posted...\n\nFor the past 3 years I have been prototyping different ideas of a local multiplayer game suiting 8 players or more.\n\nHere's everything I try to respect when making those games :\n- Playable from 2 - 8 (or more) players\n- Very fast paced\n- Easy to follow\n- Easy to learn\n- Hard to master\n- Lots of replayability (multiple maps/multiple weapons/multiple modes)\n\nI take most of my inspiration from games like Karboom, Saggitarius, Towerfall Ascension...\n\nI have never been able to finish a game yet. I either hit a point where I am no longer able to add anything, either because I don't have the knowledge or because the quality of my code when I started the project sucked too much.\n\nMy goal would be to find an idea I love and to finish and polish it.\n\nHere are three ideas I worked on recently :\n- A game where the players each control the position and thrust of a limb of a rocket cat.\n- A game similar to Towerfall ascension where players can control in which direction the gravity affects them and their respective weapons.\n- A 2D space shooter where gravity has an important impact on gameplay.\n\nThanks for your ideas and thoughts!"

8ml6sk,The game industry should create Standardized Character Profiles.,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I play the same custom character as much as I possibly can. I know what she looks like from high-def 3D to simplified 2D sprite. It would be a simple matter to describe her precisely, and I think it'd be really cool if I could just give any game some simple xml file and it could then grab the closest equivalent for that game. This would be especially helpful in 3D games where I always end up spending a ton of time just to make the same old character. It wouldn't just have to be physical characteristics though: You could include basic social traits and basic play styles too. \n\nCan you imagine starting skyrim with a low level rune spell because your character typically plays as a trapper? Having your friends as followers without all the drama of actually learning how to mod? I think a simple feature like this would be ideal for rpg games, but not just rpgs. Imagine picking a general building style and having your age of empires civilization match the aesthetics, and you can of-course do the same thing with play style and having custom tech trees or friends profiles and allied civilizations. \n\nI'm a big fan of customization, and while I think in many cases you'd still need to be able to make small edits, I think this feature would could be a real game changer too.

8mhwhh,GoT OW RPG with family avatar mechanic,"Ok so here is an idea I have had for a while. \n\nMany people have already thought  of a Skyrim-like open word RPG set in Westeros. However what sets my idea apart is it having a family inheritance mechanic. \n\nLet me explain this mechanic further. You would start centuries before the events in GoT as a single charecter (this could be done warband style) in the world of Westeros. As you progress questing and earn enough currency for a keep, you will get too marry a spouse. This spouse and any offspring have now become playable charecters. All playeble charecters you do not control, will be governed by an AI.\n\nI would also like to mention that this game would permanently kill off characters to: falling in battle, diseases, old age or simply bad luck. Would your current charecter die, you would get a screen saying ""All men must die"" and you select one of your surviving family members.\n\nThree major goals could the focus of the game: getting on the iron throne (via marriage or conquest), building a diverse family and stopping the white walkers.\n\nThe game could feature temporary quests like Roberts Rebellion or the War of the Five Kings where your family chooses sides and influences the coarse of history.\n\nSo that is my idea in short. I know it will be a big undertakement perhaps more suited for big developers, but I wanted to leave it somewhere in the hopes of someone sharing the excitement in this idea. \n\nAnyways cheers, let me know what you think!\n"

8m53z4,mildly depressed developer searching for inspiration,"Hi! Five sentences about me: \n\nI am *experienced* *enterprise* developer and at the doors of my '30 I feel a little void in my heart. What I **lack** is **vision**. Although I helped few people polish their games (nothing big) and myself made clones of classics, I have problems with coming up with my own *opus magnum*. \n\n# I need creative help. \nI will give a few love interests of mine later, but now please bear with me a non-cool criteria of game I would like to make (I hope other devs will understand) :\n\n1. **Web**: I want to make browser game. No mobile, no complicated installers and compatibility issues. If someone has modern browser, should be able to play.\n2. **Simple**: I don't want any massive online rpg, aaa game or any of rookie dreams. I know my limits. It would be nice if game idea could be extendable through time with new cool ideas, but base game should be easy to grasp, ideally hard to master. I don't want any statistics overload and force players to memorize ton of information before being comfortable. I don't care about story.\n3. **Mechanics**: It doesn't have to be completely new, fresh and mind blowing idea. Through my time as commercial mechanical designer and software engineer I don't believe in honest intellectual property and coming with completely novel ideas. 99% of things was already invented, but need a little refreshing. I'm completely ok with reusing ideas with a twist. If you know some interesting examples, let me know!\n4. **For developers only**: Creation of a game is a facade. My deepest intention is getting my hands on new paradigms after mostly mind-dumbing world of enterprise. I want in my spare time do a monument of my software engineer's pride (that's why it shouldn't be overshot with complicated ideas) - nice CI/CD pipeline, TDD, Design Patterns, Rx, Automation, Metrics Driven (that's why it should have a minimal fanbase, at least 5 people :P) blah blah blah. All the honey of beautiful project - I am capable of that from technical perspective\n\n# I really need creative help, like - please\nI suck at coming up with ideas, big time. Probably because I like to play games, but play a few of them. Tried to force myself on working on that shortcoming, but I am not a shiny visionary, I am a grind/shadow leader type that gets work done. I **kindly ask** you for ideas for mechanics that you would find interesting and are easy to tdd, that are somewhat ready in terms of interactions inside game. \n\n## What settings I like\nThis is a **bonus**. I promised my love interests and I am a sucker for this settings and anything relating to those will have my utmost attention. \n1. **Big Robots**: FrontMission 1&amp;2 are still one of my favourite games, but I couldn't find exact mechanics behind it.\n2. **Spaceships**: The idea of barrages, lasers, space, big naval-like battle also makes me exited. Still I am afraid of 4X games at they may be to big or hard to balance.\n3. **Cyberpunk**: Shadowrun is a math nightmare, but idea of modern tech with magic and gloomy present has still it's appealing.\n4. **Tactical games**: Oh, gosh. I love squad games and I love crushing my enemies to drink blood in their skulls.\n\n## What I don't like aka completely no-no (sorry not sorry I suppose)\n**High fantasy**, *Platform games*, *card games**\n\nI truly hope you will help me find here my diamond.

8m0p3o,Project godlike - An idea for a 2D fighter game.,"**The idea**\n\n‘Project godlike’ is a 2D fighter with the twist that every fighter is made as ridiculous and overpowered as possible \(hence the name ‘godlike’\). Things, that would be considered gamebreaking in other games, are somewhat a standard here. The game is kept balanced due to the character variety and rock\-paper\-scissors mechanics, which can be found in games such as Smash 4 or Overwatch \(‘counter picking’\). Additionally, this game full of mechanics and has a high skill ceiling to keep it fresh and fun.\n\n**The formula**\n\nJust like in Skullgirls, the player can make a team of 3 characters when playing in a 1vs1 battle. Every character introduces new mechanics and maybe even their own health bar. Most often, characters are in a 1v1 situation, but can call others for assists \(again, like in Skullgirls\). The stages are flat, and don’t have obstacles \(for more see: stages\).\n\n**\(Possible\) Characters and abilities for the characters that would fit this game**\n\nGenerally, the cast should be kept small so that balance can still be focused when characters are created. The bigger the roaster, the less balanced the game. This means, that multiple ideas can be used for just one character.\n\n· **The zombie**: Can revive themselves in fights. This ability should be limited. On the other hand, this character might have a small healthpool.\n\n· **The vampire**: Drains health as they hit you. \n\n· **The tide\-turner**: A character, which can swap with any of the opposing team’s characters for one of the own. Obviously, this character must have weak attacks since this ability itself can be very strong, and the ability to swap is limited \(a certain amount of damage is dealt, a cooldown, or something else\).\n\n· **The dodger**: A fighter, which is able to dodge most attacks easily with the help of button inputs. The twist: The character only has 3 life bars, where one depletes after a single hit by the opponent. This character should also deal moderate damage to fit to the high\-risk, high reward gameplay.\n\n· **The wall**: A character, which can’t deal any damage, but can stand in between the fighters. It can take a lot of hits, but the characters which are being protected can block combos and stronger attacks. While this sounds very strong, the player having this character basically only has 2 characters to fight with and the other player can also prevent the wall from coming in by pressing a combination of inputs. The ability of both the player and the opposing player to bring in or block the wall by using this input should also be on a cooldown to make the impact more significant and not spammable.\n\n· **The one\-hit\-KO Wonder**: This character deals no damage but fills a meter next to his health bar. When the bar is filled, and the according input is used, the player can one\-hit KO one of the characters. Can be mixed with the dodger.\n\n· **The character which opens a rhythm\-based minigame and the one who wins, kills the other**: Ridiculous, right? Perfect.\n\n· **The character which is in some form controlled by the opposing player**: While this sounds like it would make you lose, it will interrupt all ongoing attacks by the opponent. Can be mixed with the wall\(?\).\n\n· **The character with big hitboxes**: This character can deal damage over a large portion of the screen.\n\n· **A character that can swap between stages**: Why not.\n\nWhen looking at these ideas, we can already see some rock\-paper\-scissors\-relationships and interesting dynamics:\n\n· The vampire can abuse the wall and leech health for his own good when he predicts that it comes in.\n\n· The dodger is a counter to the vampire, since he has little health to drain.\n\n· The one\-hit\-KO Wonder is countered by the zombie.\n\n· The dodger counters the one\-hit\-KO Wonder, since he is able to block/dodge all the attacks.\n\n· The wall can’t do much against the one\-hit\-KO Wonder, which attacks may be strong enough to hit both wall and shielded player.\n\nIt should be noted, that the ideas can be combined: A zombievampire who can heal and revive themselves or a one\-hit\-KO Wonder which is more dangerous because he is also a dodger. We have no limits, this is the formula of the game! \n\n**The stages**\n\n· **The stage with no walls**: You can’t get cornered in this stage, it will keep scrolling in the according direction indefinitely.\n\n· **The point\-blank stage**: Characters stand at point blank.\n\n· **The normal stage**: Just a normal stage, like it can be found in most fighters. How boring!\n\n· **The stage with teleporters**: There are teleporters on each side of the stage which lead you to the other side \(Alternatively: No teleporters, if you go in at a side you come out on another, like in Smash 4 on the Stage balloon fight\)."

8px7sp,WW2 Alternate-Reality.,"1940. Operation Sealion has been a success, the Battle of Britain was lost. Now the German invaders are moving inland from their landing points and encroaching on London.\n\nYou will play as a member of an Auxiliary Unit (AU), these were Winston Churchill's stay behind forces in the event of a successful German invasion of the United Kingdom. Each AU was made up of 8 men, usually members of the local home guard. Once the Germans invaded Britain the AU members would then move to their secret bases (usually underground bunkers/tunnels). Each AU was given a 40 square mile area to work in.\n\nThe AU's were tasked with disrupting the German advances by destroying railway/airfield infrastructure, harassing/skirmish attacks and basically being a thorn in the backside of the invaders.\n\nSo, the game would be a resistance style game. Set in a fictional area of English Countryside measuring 40 Square miles, containing a few small villages, farms, a military airfield (RAF airfield now in the hands of the Germans) and a number of other locations.\n\nThe objective of the game is to survive at least 2 weeks of in game time, this was how long the real life Auxiliary Units were expected to hold out for in the event of an invasion.\n\nThe HUD would have a time of day, and a total number of German Forces. You could be able to kill every German soldier in the game map, if you manage to survive long enough.\n\nAfter two tutorial missions, the game becomes a free roaming action game. You will be free to strike and disrupt the invaders as you like, utilising upto 3 other AI members of the AU as a small team. You will receive intelligence from the local populace about German forces, and radio updates from the AU base.\n\nFor equipment, you can restock at the AU base. However you will have a limited supply of ammunition and weapons, the same as real life. Depending on how long you survive you can supplement what you have with captured German equipment.\n\nThe longer you survive the more ruthless the German invaders will become, their AI will become better and they will launch more patrols into areas of the map they believe you to be operating. They will also become more hostile to the civilian population the longer you survive, this would culminate in public executions. These events can be stopped by intervening them.\n\nBasically this game would be a free roam, WW2 resistance shooter based in the alternate reality of the UK being invaded, can you kill all the invaders in your area of operations before the AU is wiped out? \n"
8pu9f4,Superhero alter ego simulator,"A game where you play as a superhero's alter ego,an average man who tries to hide his secret superhero identity. In this game you have to do everyday stuff,like brushing your teeth,taking out the trash,printing documents and other normal stuff. But the fun part comes when your supersense notices that a crime is happening,so either you're at home,at a date or at work doing important stuff,you have to decide wether to continue doing what you're doing or go save the day,both options will have an outcome that can be positive or negative. "
8ptmib,A Massive (Or moderately big) Multiplayer Campaign,"Basically, a grand campaign played online with many people who all must work together to accomplish a goal. Maybe something like a D&amp;D game but there's like 50 people playing all in separate parties and it's likely you'll never interact with some of them, but they all effect each other's games.\n\nI was playing Medieval: Total War Hotseat, which means you play with a friend and take turns uh taking your turns, with a Lord of the Rings mod when I thought of this horrible, could never implement and even if you could would never work, idea. This is not necessarily a Lord of the Rings game idea but Lord of the Rings is the setting for this particular idea just because that's what I happened to be playing/watching when I thought of it.\n\nBasically, you have a bunch of different characters (played by other people) in a very large world space working towards a shared goal, say for example ""Save Middle-Earth"" or ""Destroy the One Ring.""\n\nThese characters could range anywhere from someone in the Fellowship to the leader of Gondor, Steward Denethor if you didn't know. Maybe it could involve even more minor characters like and inn keeper. Who knows?\n\nWhile each character has the shared overall goal, maybe not the inn keeper, they all each have individual goals and things to worry about. For example, Steward Denethor is maybe focused on trying to protect Gondor's borders. If Gondor falls, the rest of Middle Earth will likely soon follow. The members are the Fellowship however are tasked with keeping Frodo alive and escorting him to mount doom. If either one of them fails their assigned tasks, it will make accomplishing the ultimate goal that much harder for the others.\n\nSo, to accomplish the goal all the players must work together. If one fails, it will make it increasingly difficult for the other. Deaths and decisions are permanent, unless you're Gandalf.\n\nSo, if I'm getting my economic terms right, the game is being played both in the micro and macro sense, depending on what kind of character you are. A member of the fellowship would be micro, really only concerned about protecting Frodo. Whereas Steward Denethor would be worried about all of Gondor. Ultimately \nsome characters would be more important than others and maybe would even require some trust or special circumstances to even play as them.\n\nIn the Lord of the Rings specifically, there's a lot of worry about betrayal because the Ring plays with people's minds and gets them to do things they would never otherwise do. I thought about how to encourage some betrayal/or just fear of betrayal. I thought you could have custom characters or at least the ability to upgrade different players based on experience you've earned in your play throughs. Accomplishing the ultimate goal of saving Middle-Earth would net huge rewards for the surviving players, but is almost next to impossible to accomplish. So, occasionally players may get new tasks such as someone playing as Boromir may get task that wants them to steal the ring from Frodo or kill Frodo. While it would be nothing next to the reward they'd get from the ""Save Middle-Earth"" task, if they don't think they'll accomplish that it might be reward enough for them to do it.\n\nAnyways, I just think it could be fun to play with a bunch of people in a grand adventure/campaign whatever who all have to work together to accomplish an almost impossible goal. That said, it would never work and will never happen."
8psjhf,Just another Dungeon Crawl...OH GOD WHY IS THERE SO MUCH PINK IT BURNS.,"So its a pretty simple idea *incoming 3000 word essay*. In this game you get to command a legion *4 max* mighty heroes with the *insert default slay the dungeon plot* in a top down, turn based and extremely colourful dungeon crawler where every entity for some reason leaves a trail of elemental power behind them as they walk which coincidentally if an creature or hero walks on elements they dont like they can...die.\n\nOn a very conventionality simple grid system in randomly generated dungeon sliced into different levels (because RIP open world dungeon crawlers). You must hunt the extremely odd, colourful and plain weird enemies spawned to hunt you down because what else are they going to so paint...actually, yes. \n\nLeave trails, make weak spots, collect relics, be smart with your champions with different attributes and skills. In order to trick that helpless forest creature to walk through 20 blocks of fire spawned by your very own pet baby dragon. OR be a real BADASS as you and use a unicorns dead corpse to spray magical pink colours at your enemies which melt there skin. \n\nSeriously though its a simple dungeon crawler with Splatoon sorta graphical element. Just a quick thought and I'm eager for some ideas on the subject. "

The rest of the game is you trying to deliver the box and making sure it isn’t damaged. \n\nA damage bar is present based on how much damage the package has endured, and the player also has a life bar.\n\nThe player is challenged with insane climates to travel through such as mountains with severe storms and deserts with sand storms.

8por0c,VR Idea - Roguelike Driving Crash Course,"A first person driving simulator in VR where you try to get the best time possible in an obstacle course with randomly generated obstacles. Weaving through cones, avoiding moving objects etc; however the courses are generated based on a long-strand combination seed generator.\n\nBy this, I mean there are a finite # of combinations of courses (like maybe 2000+) all generated by the engine. Some look really similar, some are unique but they’re all different with essentially the same obstacles (in each difficulty setting) just installed in different ways on different paths. \n\nWhen the player loads the game and is on the starting line, they have no idea which course they’re on. They try to drive as hard and fast as they can to the finish line without hitting an obstacle and exploding. If they finish successfully, their time (and/or score) Is compared and added to an online leaderboard that tracks all the best finish times for each course combination.\n\nSo essentially, this achieves a competitive VR racing/driving simulator that prevents the player from practicing a course and committing it to muscle memory. Every time they hit Play, the engine chooses one of the 2000+ course combinations randomly and the player has a very small chance of playing the same course twice. It has replay value because the player will want to get better at the GAME and not the courses; the online leaderboard will encourage people to keep coming back to try and get a spot. \n\nThanks for reading!"

8phop5,My game 1 1/2 years later - Then and now,"Around the December time frame of 2016, I started my game dev journey with some programming knowledge and no game development experience.  As of today (June 8, 2018), I have amassed a lot of knowledge within the industry (certainly not enough to be considered experienced, however).  With that said, this is a post to reflect on what  I expected then, what I know now, and how I can use this experience as well as any advice from you guys to reignite my desire for developing.  Perhaps this will inspire some of you as well.\n\n[My original reddit post with my game idea can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/5ltktm/the_greater_good/)\n\nA year and a half later, [this is what I was able to come up with.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IWLa64-wq4) I made this horde mode style game following a C++ tutorial for UE4 and some other assets I acquired over the year.  As you can see, this project I created for my senior project in college ended up being completely different from my original game idea.  Let this be an example to ALL WOULD BE INDIE DEVELOPERS that SCOPE is the most important aspect when it comes to your game.  I had to cut a lot of things in order to make this within my senior year of school (with the majority of it being done within the final months of the final semester).\n\nSince my graduation, it has been months since I have opened UE4, but I opened it up today and found a little creative ember a brewing.  I may not use anything in this horde mode game I made, but I will use it as a stepping stone towards the right direction.\n\n**Mission Statement**\nTo bring the game industry back to what it was.  The industry is filled with FPS and wanna-be action RPGs that focus on money - deliberately cutting content for DLC, selling save slots (looking at you Konami), and pay to win methods.  Since people are okay with this, most gaming industries have completely forgone the essence of what make games good - a compelling story, the player emotionally connecting with characters, dramatic boss fights, etc - in order to pump out these types of games.  Very few games entice me now like the way they used to back in the 90's.  Therefore, I want to make a game that goes back to it's roots; a game that makes the player think, focuses on story rather than fast paced action, and brings the player within the game itself.  \n\n**So What I Need:**\n* Someone who is very creative with writing stories.  My field is in programming, my home is in Visual Studios, and I am aware that my creative gene is lacking.  I can piggyback ideas off of others, but I need to piggyback.  Therefore, read my original post (it contains my original thoughts) and let me know what you think.\n\n* Some one who is gifted with 3d design.  I open up Maya or Blender and I go full retard.\n\n* (If game has multiplayer) Someone who has experience with online networking within UE4.  I have a basic understanding of networking, but PUBG has shown what inexperience networking can do to a game.\n\n**Game Ideas**\n* Reading my original post should give you an idea of what I originally wanted.  We can go for that idea but with a much smaller scope, branch off of my idea into something a tad bit different, or craft something new.\n\n* No MMOs; no huge open worlds like Fallout or Skyrim.  The intent is to make something within a reasonable scope for a small team.\n\n* I am in the mood for something Sci-Fi has that tends to allow for some pretty head popping stuff (anything from time travel, to alternate realities, to dystonia governmental systems (like Bioshock)).\n\n** Goals **\n*To make a playable protoype with the bare essentials (animation system, weapons, basic UI, basic objective tasks, etc) within 6 months.  This means the bare skeleton of the game, NOT nice game mechanics such as weapon upgrades and side quests.\n\n* Make the first level playable by June 2019.  This would be our playable Alpha Demo, released to a strict testing group.\n\nAnyways, if you have any Sci-Fi story suggestions on my original story idea or would like to participate in the making of the game, let me know.

8pha5g,"A game about Jurassic Park, but gameplay like Alien:Isolation","The game is simple: you crash on an island with dinosaurs, and you have to survive. You and your friends’ helicopter crashes on the Island, and you (the only survivor) have to find a radio, a boat, etc., and escape. The only catch, though: velociraptors.\n\nVelociraptors in the films were considered super intelligent, capable of complex thinking and teamwork. Maybe in the game, the longer you work against the Velociraptors, the smarter they get. If you take the same doorway multiple times, they’ll start ambushing you there.  If you run across the same bridge, they’ll surround you. This would keep the player having to change their play styles the entire time. \n\nThere could obviously be more types of dinosaurs, with different ways you must deal with them. Pterodactyls: you stay inside. T-Rex: remain still. Dilopasaurus( the acid spitting one-too lazy to google how to spell it): attack quickly, before it spits at you. The list could go on and on.\n\nIf anyone has any other ideas or things to add, please leave a comment!\n"

8pfg9p,Jurassic World shooter,"Alright so the backstory is Ingen has staked out a remote island hidden from the public eye near Isla Nubar for experiments focused on weaponization of carnivorous dinosaurs. They’ve turned the island itself into dinosaur safe\-haven complete with all kinds of herbivores and carnivores, so they can observe how their genetically\-modified dinos interact in the wild and the degree to which they can be trained. They have a significant footprint on the island, with research facilities, dino holding/training areas, military outposts, ports, airfields, etc. \n\nThe CIA has gotten wind of the experiments they’ve been conducting, and due to the fact that Ingen’s private military has been growing both technologically and numerically in the past decade, cyber attacks, yada yada yada, they deem the operation to be a strategic threat to interests of the U.S. government. \n\nHere comes the player, a customizable CIA operative skilled in direct action operations and long\-range reconnaissance and surveillance. The advancement of the game plays kind of like Far Cry 5 in that you need to capture outposts, interrupt INGEN logistics, kill local INGEN leaders, etc. in order to draw out the head honchos, eventually winning the game by taking out the operations manager of the island. The actual combat would probably best played out like a Ghost Recon Wildlands 3rd person shooter, with lots of cool CIA tech.\n\nThe appeal and the real meat of the game comes in the form of the interactions with dinosaurs. You encounter a number of herbivorous and carnivorous species in your travels across the open world, as well as encounters with the genetically modified killers that INGEN has been working on. Those could be boss fights, idk. \n\nBut the REALLY cool part is that you can capture dinosaur eggs that you encounter along the way, bring them back to your own or captured research facilities, incubate them, and grow them into a friendly fighting force. Put limits on the number you can control at one time, make some of them better at certain things than others (ex. Raptors are super stealthy, T\-Rex destroys everything and takes a ton of damage). Inspiration for this idea comes from an old Jurassic Park RTS game called Chaos Island. \n\nYou lead your team of dinos across the island, the CIA flies in scientists and other NPCs from the dinosaur rights group or whoever the hell they're supposed to be to augment your own research/incubation facilities, you slowly expand your footprint and continue to disrupt INGEN ops until they are eradicated from the island and you win the shadow war between the US govt and a dangerous private military corporation. The game should be gritty and violent, def. rated M for mature. "
8pdn2y,DayZ how it shouldve been made,"A lack of illustrations in this thread is simply from writing it on mobile with no access to the internet.\n\nAs a long fan of the dayz mod and then DayZ standalone, I think many of us can agree we don't really fancy the ""king of the hill"" genre and are attracted to the free and open world where nobody tells us where to go and when.\n\nUnfortunately, having over 3k hours in DayZ, I've been along for the ride and the game has stagnated and is now making changes that is making many players unhappy, but I digress. \n\n\nThe idea would be to remake a zombie simulator, add in the red glowing zombie eyes from DayZ origins, and make it more about nature and surviving the elements, give players something to do other than just killing each other.\n\nFor instance, add snow, and hence footprints in snow to track players or wildlife, and the ability to see drops of bloods from wounded animals or players, like in ""the long dark"" \n\nFootprints that would snow and fade eventually, and snow more around more important areas, along with clothing required to be there.\n\nAdd weather. I know the Bohemia engine is  limited, but hey..\n\nAdd cars, as we all want a zombie simulator that isn't a running for hours simulator that might end with dieing from a glitch that should've been solved years ago. \n\nI've got plenty more I'll add later but I'm on mobile and my time is running out "
8pbt7m,[Prototype] How do you see this evolving?,
8p15yd,A game idea based on A Quiet Place (2018),"Name: A Quiet Place\n\nPremise: The player character is a survivor of the alien invasion featured in A Quiet Place. The player character must survive while evading the aliens and attempting to find ways of exploiting their weakness of noises with high frequency. The player character must also deal with hostile npc’s like bandits and a cult known as the Emissaries of the Dark Ones, who believe he arrival of the aliens was meant to “cleanse” humanity and regularly sacrifice fellow cult members to them along with survivors. The creatures are also carriers of 6 extraterrestrial diseases that cause symptoms such as vomiting, abscesses, cysts etcetera though the diseases are spread via infected blood or other infected fluids entering the orifice or open wounds. The leaders of the cult will exploit the weakness of the creatures to high pitched noises, causing them to expose their vulnerable flesh and kill them, subsequently consuming the blood and becoming symptomatic carriers, exposing the disease to other humans in an attempt to “purify” humanity. \n\nSetting: The game is set in an open world environment of the United States of America, albeit scaled down by a large amount.\n\nGameplay: The game is a first person survival horror game set in an open world. Players traverse an expansive urban environment filled with aliens hellbent in killing anything that makes ample noise, scavenging the world for supplies and weapons for hunting the scarce prey that still dot the landscape. Food and resources can be acquired by looting abandoned houses. The player character has a “sound meter”, which alerts them to how much sound they are making which subsequently leads to an attack by one of the creatures. The game has no respawn points, as death is permanent and requires the player character to start over. The game has many NPC’s, which the player character can interact in a variety of ways, ranging from robbing them to trading supplies with them. There is a extensive dialogue system based on sign language. The game has no overarching plot and no “endings”, though the player character can take on side quests from npc’s. The game has a combat system, albeit one that focuses on silence, since the creatures have hypersensitive hearing. \n\nCreatures: At the start of the game, the focus is to evade the creatures, as the player character lacks the necessary devices able to create the high frequencies capable of disorienting the creatures, exposing their weak points and allowing for the player character to damage them. However, as time passes, the player character will be able to find devices able to emit said high frequencies though the danger of cultists and hostile npc’s still remain. Despite the power of such devices, they are relatively fragile and can be stolen. Some are also not portable and other may be too heavy, as the player has a set amount of items able to carried within their inventory.\n\nVariants: To not sink into repetition pertaining to creatures, there are different variants of creatures. Asides from the common quadrupedal aliens, there are also bipedal and winged variants, both of which provide challenges and opportunities for the player character. In addition to this, there is also various age groups, ranging from infants to adolescents, both of which have unique behaviors and looks. \n\n"

8ovz6t,Native American Tribe Building/Survival Game,"A 3PP game where you create a Native American tribe and play in pre-colonization America.  You gather supplies to build different shelters like teepees/wigwams, longhouses and weapons like bows, spears, tomahawks, etc.  The more supplies you gather and more animals you hunt, the more people your tribe can sustain.  A map shows all the area you control, and if you run into any other tribes, the area they control.  You can fight other tribes to take some or all of their land, or make peace with them to fight as allies in other wars, or if you are much larger than them have them surrender their land and join your tribe.\n\nHopefully this sparks some other ideas others may have as I'd like to hear some other things that could be incorporated.  It just doesn't seem like their is really any solid Native American themed video games but its definitely a fascinating part of history and could be a fun setting for a game."
8op802,Please help me elaborate.

8okp6u,A first person shooter inspired by the best,"I know what it sounds like, another first person shooter in a saturated market of games although I feel like this may potentially work.\nTheme: Militaristic (not helping myself stand out here)\nMovement Mechanics: Skill based, inspired by CS: Source and 1.6 so bunny hopping galore but not too easy and with a high skill cap\nCombat Mechanics: Inspired by games like Combat Arms and Quake and thus very fast paced with little need for holding angles for hours due to the fast movement\n\nDifficulty: With the movement mechanics like this, I believe it could have a very high skill cap allowing for countless hours of playing. This may lead to the game not being beginner friendly\n\nProfitability: Could go either F2P or P2P depending on ideas although with F2P, profit could still be made via selling skins much like COD:Online skins with high production value and animation work\nPros: Large chance for E-Sport due to high skill cap, flexibility with profitability, not something trying to recreate a genre but adding a breath of fresh air\nCons: Difficult to program, Not massively beginner friendly, based off of my own opinion so looking for feedback\n"
8oklo5,Idea for a game show. Multilingual Showdown.,"This game show brings groups of people from all over the world. They're not supposed to have any bilingual skills or have any knowledge of the languages spoken by the other contestants. And are then divided into teams so that there is no one on their team that speaks the same language as them.\n\nThe goal of the game is for them to complete a series of complex tasks while finding ways to communicate with each other. From the perspective of the viewer, everything they say would be subtitled. And different weeks will feature different parts of the world. Its an international game show meets reality TV. The point is to appeal to audiences from anywhere in the world, no matter what language they speak. But also to demonstrate multinational team work, helping to consolidate a perception of global unity. But for the most part, watching people try to interact with people that can't understand them, or different cultures interact that have no apparent common ground, is bound to produce a number of relatable challenges. Even poor interactions would be funny, as one party might be completely oblivious that the other one is calling them names and insulting them in their native tongue. \n\nIt would be an interesting social experiment testing the cooperative capabilities of people when they can't rely on language to communicate.

And we could keep costs low by recruiting a bunch of people from 1 city per featured nationality. "

8oe0jl,Playhouse Tycoon Game,"I love tycoon games and there are A LOT of possibilities to cover in such games. However, I have never seen a tycoon game based around musical theatre (probably because most people don’t see the business side of it). My idea is that you would be the owner of a playhouse, where you would hire staff and upgrade your theatre to compete with rival theatre houses near you!\n\nInteresting Feature Ideas\n\n-Convincing producers to back shows\n\n-You would start with mostly having your theatre running small revivals or local writer’s shows, once gaining notoriety you would catch the attention of more famous writers and mainstream revivals\n\n-Upgrades for your playhouse: stage (lights, sets, etc.), actors workshop (where you can hold acting workshops to possibly produce the next future star), concessions, seating, ads, etc.\n\n-Award shows (presented sort of like the movies by lion head)\n\n-Negotiating system with actors (harder the more mainstream)\n\n-“Original production” introduced semi-early game (where you can write your own shows and produce or sell them off)"
8odpyo,Elementals: An action hack and slash that changes pace mid-fight,"Quick intro to gameplay\n\nHow the fights will work will be basically a collaboration between Bayonetta and Bloodborne where the player has two attack buttons (in this case a heavy and light) for each arm that can be pressed in different orders and patterns to perform combos, a dodge button, item usage button and a button allocated for spells and other similar things.\n\nAs the player fights enemies, this bar under the health will fill. This bar would be The focus bar. The bar is segmented into four sections. The bar can be filled by attacking the enemies, performing long combos, and just by basically being aggressive. As the bar reaches the next ""level"", the player will gain a buff of some sort such as gaining a perfect dodge to fill the bar faster, gaining access to launchers and air juggles, and blink dodges and stinger-like attacks for those of you who played DMC. However, if the player is hit or stops playing aggressively, the bar will drop and the player will lose the abilities associated with that level. This makes the fights more slow and methodical when you first enter them, but will later become faster and more frenetic as the player has to play well in order to keep their speed up.\n\nPremise and story\n\nThe setting is on Earth around present time during the year 20XX. The main antagonists are the Ten Deities, five gods and five goddesses who control ten different elements (fire, earth, water, air, plant-life, animal-life, aether, lightning, darkness, and light), and they have been largely forgotten. This has already left them angry at humanity, but also seeing humans destroy the world they have created through their actions such as pollution has pushed them over the edge. These deities then come to earth and annihilate everything in their path to try and protect their world and all of their creations.\n\nSome time after the Deities onslaught, some of the surviving few humans discover something. When the Deities made the journey from their world to ours, they without knowing tapped some of the natural world's energy for human use. The same energy the Deities used against humanity. With this new power, the surviving few created a kind of order. An order where humanity doesn't place their faith in some higher power. They place faith in themselves, and this order has made it their mission to kill the Ten Deities and protect humanity from their wrath.\n\nThat is where the player character steps in. They are a prodigy when it comes to using the natural energies and have been chosen by the order to stop the gods one by one.\n\nThanks to anyone for reading.  This is an idea I've been tossing around my head for a while and if anyone is interested, I do have design and personality ideas for some of the Deities and have ideas drafted up for the different classes the player can choose from and different spells and weapons"
8ocamx,Stand alone Labo game,This game would be like a puzzle game where you would have to interact with different items in rooms with the Nintendo labo kits. So I guess it would be an escape room type of deal.\n\nThis game could have a mode where you only use one toy-con and a mode where you would have to use multiple labo kits. \n\nSo far that’s all I can really think of right now but it’s a start I guess.
8oc141,"A Megaman inspired platformer built around music, especially Rock 'n' Roll!","#Premise:\n\nJazzy is a guy on a quest to become the ultimate rockstar. He's heavily inspired by Lord Raptor from Darkstalkers. On his quest, he'll battle different music themed bosses and learn different weapons (instruments) as well as meet band mates along the way. Inspired by Megaman, Shovel Knight, and Scott Pilgrim Versus The World! Each stage would have its own musical theme, such as a jazz stage set in a club, or a rock or metal stage set in a concert.\n\n#Gameplay\n\nJazzy will sidescroll through different stages for various reasons, usually fighting a bosd at the end. I don't know much about level design, especially in platformers so some game recommendations would be appreciated. Anything to teach me more about the genre.\n\nHe'll start with a guitar as his base weapon, because guitars. On his way he'll get drums, a mic, a trumpet/sax, maybe even a triangle! The instruments perform different attacks when he plays them. One idea was the drums being a power up or stage thing similar to the car in street fighter. He sees the drum, starts playing, and now he has to rock out to keep enemies away.\n\n#Final Notes\n\nLiterally all of this is subject to change. I just came up with this in the shower and plan to make it if I ever learn how to creare games. I might pitch the idea to YachtClubGames, the makers of Shovel Knight. Idk.\n\nBut yeah! Give me some ideas. Tell me some criticisms. I'm all ears for anything you want to say."

8nwkvf,30 Second Army,"I have a idea for a game I want to develop and would love to hear if you would like to play it!\n\nYou can chose local multiplayer, or solo. You get 30 seconds to try and build an army from a preset selection of characters. Little soldiers take less time to develop than bigger soldiers. At the end of the 30 seconds your army goes up against the opponent's army. You do not get to do anything but sit and watch your army win, or get destroyed."
8nvxgb,Confined Chaos (Open world game),"- Confined Choas\n\nI have come up with a concept for a new game called ""Confined Choas"" this game will be shattering as it is set in a very large open world where \nChaos is all that is made with no Real story rather then many characters from side quests to become familiar with truely showing in the end\nthe broken nature of this fictional world. The game will take a lot of inspiration from a Borderlands 2 loot based style, to the character customization\nfrom games like saint's row and Grand theft auto and the fast pased style of games like doom and call of duty with large land scapes to get\nfamiliar with. It would be if created a first person shooter with up to 4 player co op and smaller area battles with a online 6 v 6 or 10 v 10 set\nof modes. Some of the things that could be possible is this game would be made to be broken and crazy as you want to experience this world like\nthe true gaming psycho path you are with the possibilitys being unmatched as the game would provide a large amount of insane things anywhere from\nmonster turtles with giraffe heads to 12 legged humans that eat ashes made by burning the hair off humans or mutants. This is just some\nof the idea I have invisioned for a video game as I have always wanted a game that breaks barriers offering a never ending joy ride of action,\nenjoyable moments, and the chaos that is set to break loose in the open world of Confined Chaos.

8nrkfn,Single player RPG that transitions to MMORPG at max level,"So hear me out:  this idea involves the creation of its own world with its own intricate storylines.  2 factions, of 3-5 races each.  The races may share sizes, but cannot share appearance (I.e. no good humans and evil humans, but humans versus human sized orcs is ok).  The game begins as a single player experience with a flowing narrative.  This is where we world build.  Both factions will play through single player surrounding the same events of the story, but with different missions or quests, however the outcome of the narrative remains the same.  Leveling is included, however certain quests automatically push a player towards the level cap, so for instance, the third major storyline mission automatically pushes the player to level 42, for example.  The final portion of the single player experience is a major event, most likely a battle between the two main factions that includes an interruption to the battle of one of the main foe groups (example, the battle is near an ancient burial ground, undead begin to intrude to the battle, allies are resurrected and begin fighting their former comrades, both factions are routed from the chaos, and now a major foe is established for pve).  Upon completion of this major quest, the player has risen through the ranks a bit, and is sent to the main warfront or maybe is only phased to the online portion of the game.  Upon earning max level, the player begins encountering other players, in areas that were previously only NPCs, but also gains access to areas and a world that is most likely 200% larger than what they understood it to be from the single player campaign that only serves to introduce them to the conflict and some major players.\n\nI think from a design like this, the focus on narrative for a single player would create investment in the world, but then only allowing interaction with other players at max level creates not only almost another game to be played (ala max level) but reinvests the player in the narrative.  “That captain fought with me at level 20 and had that awesome short cinematic where we sailed across the ocean and then we managed to take out that enemy stronghold - now he’s a naval commander and he’ll give me quests to hunt the other faction in a certain zone where he wants a beachhead!”  And having the static single player rpg experience that in itself is a good size playthrough allows a narrative that is unchanging: your factions are always at war.  However, the development post release and post max level would only be focused on developing dungeons and raids along with world zones with unique interests (traveling vendors that are available only if controlling a specific zone, but the zone rotates, forcing players to dispute territories on a rotating basis).  Also unique NPCs: due to the nature of the conflict, perhaps there a vendor from the opposing faction in the sewers of your main faction city, selling black market goods.  Another race of mercenaries who are pulled from all races have quests to sabotage specific zones (either sabotage your enemies, or even sabotage your allies depending on the needs of the mercenaries) - an idea for neutral factions and reputations.  I’m sure I have more ideas, if you want to make this game let me know and I’ll funnel my ideas to you :P"

8nr3z2,Is this a good idea?,"During a world war in 2083, you were the member of the British army and you were fighting against USA who's sociopathic president at the time wanted to take over the world. All the countries are fighting against them, but the US army are so powerful that if one nation were to die/step down, America would win. You are a member of the British army and you are fighting in Greenland. The US army kills 3 of your men (only 6 soldiers left in the army) and the other 3 are seriously injured and limp into an icy cave for cover. However, it is so cold in the cave that you are cryogenically frozen for 100 years until the cave melts because of global warming. It is now a world where America rules over and all the other countries are slaves. The president was genetically modified so that he stops ageing and his lifespan is extended. You and the other 3 men reform the army. You can get a few different endings: assassinate the president, join forces with America, nuke America, convince the president to stop or get everyone to rise up against America. Is this a good idea for a game? I call it ""The Remnants""."
