9kjc9v,Weeping Angles puzzle game,"I propose a game based off the Weeping Angles from Dr Who. It will be a grid based puzzle game where the payer has to move a group of humans through an area infested by Weeping Angles like monsters. Each human has a 90 degree field of view and a blink counter. The angles can only move when unobserved (not in field of view or while human is blinking). if an angle can reach a square adjacent to a human while unobserved the human vanishes from the time line (killed).\n\nThe goal will be to get from Point A to Point B with as few humans getting killed as possible. Each human will have to blink after a certain number of turns, but two humans can cover the same Angle to keep it locked while one blinks. Since the game is Grid based humans will not be able to move through a square an angle is occupying, which will require players to loose line of sight to get some blocking Angles to move out of the way.\n\nThe game will track the visibility level of each grid point and only display Angles that are in visible to the party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

9k4k1x,A video game that is a card game where you can submit what you want the cards to say.,Alright. Imagine cards against humanity but with just the blank cards. Now imagine the cards you filled out were put to a vote as to which ones would be added. So to start it would be say 100 of each card made by devs. The rest would be made by players and the players would then decide where the game goes next. \nThere could be a separate section to fill out cards and vote on them or it could just be something where at the end of each game a player can fill out a card. :) so what do you think?
9k4f64,Cabin in the Woods inspired Horror Game,"So I love Cabin in the woods, like a hella ton. I wish they'd make prequels of the movie that take place before the main event of Cabin in the Woods. I think having a game based off the movie would be awesome. Have survivors going into  the basement and randomly picking objects that can summon various creatures of nightmare. Not sure how the game would go about but make it a royal kind of game like Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th but make it different, unique and awesome. I'd love to have a game created in a sense and ties with the lore of Cabin in the Woods. "
9k4a5x,Behind the Throne; a turn based strategy/ management game,"As a preface, I'd be lying if I said this idea wasn't largely sparked by recent controversy over changes in Rome II: Total War, as well as my own opinions on representation in gaming. My idea is heavily based in the political and ""intrigue"" system in Total War games, and many other aspects of the games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Concept**\n\nSet in a historical European, or maybe a pseudo-historical European-esque context, you play as noblewoman. A newly married Queen, whose objective is to make your kingdom the most powerful state in the world by the time of your death. Your task will not be easy. As in historical Europe, women have few rights and little to no direct power. You must use intrigue, cunning, and manipulation to bend events to your will. The game will feature next to no player control over armed units as is the staple of most strategy games. The game is primarily set as a campaign map, showing the various kingdoms and your kingdom's relations with them, as information such as characters, agents and armies that give the player an idea of whats going on in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Vision/ Ideas**\n\n*Starting the Game*\n\nWhen beginning your campaign, you will create your character, not necessarily as an actual avatar, but in ""attributes"" you think will help you in your playstyle. Additionally, you will choose with kingdom you were born to, and which you married into, through this you should be able to adjust the difficulty of your campaign, and different kingdoms will be more viable for certain strategies rather than other.\n\n*Mechanics/ Gameplay*\n\nStarting off, you will have varying degrees of influence over three parties 1. The King, your husband 2. The Nobility, aristocracy who hold power and positions within government 3. The People, the general populace of the kingdom.  During play you must increase and adjust your standing with these groups, possibly play them off of each other, and use their positions and opinions to your end, by making deals, using your position, and of you so choose your ""charm"". I envision each ""turn"" encompassing a season.\n\n\-The King\n\nThe most powerful man in the land. Each nation will have a King with varying attributes and starting relation to you. Your marriage could be a happy one of genuine love, where you are your husband's most trusted counselor and advisor, or your marriage might be a political matter and nothing more, he discounts you as a diplomatic obligation and nothing more, your suggestions fall on deaf ears (unless of course it's what he want's to hear). As Queen it will also be considered your ""duty"" to produce an heir (whether or not it's actually the King's is a matter up to the player). The King is your most direct path to getting your way, if you can influence him, but be careful, making the King your puppet might anger other parties, and they may decide a new King is in order, or at least that you have to go.\n\n\-The Nobility\n\nThese are the people of court, and the office holders of the Kingdom. Depending on your starting relationship to the kingdom from your home country, these people may already love or loathe you. Finding those that share your ambitions and will aid you, and thwarting or undermining the others, will be key to your success. A savvy Queen may find that, even if she doesn't have the ear of the King, having the ear of his ministers may prove just as useful in persuading the King to act on your designs.\n\n\-The People\n\nThese people are your subjects. Most care very little about ambition and politics, and their opinion of you is based on their perception of you, and what you've done for them. They could be your savior or your curse. On one hand, if you fall out of favor at court, your popularity among the People might make actions to oust you political suicide, perhaps they would even seek to install you in stead of an unpopular King. On the other, a Queen that is perceived as being aloof, scandalous, or unfaithful to a popular King, might find themselves very unpopular and the target of assassination or revolution if you try to act on their ambitions.\n\n\-Turns\n\nI envision each ""turn"" encompassing one season. At the start of each turn, you'll receive messages and reports in regards to events in court, abroad, and with characters. These will be your primary source of information and may provide limited-time opportunities to influence events. Examples of this might include: A member of the Nobility falling ill or dying, one of your ladies-in-waiting having an affair with a minister, the start or end of a war and the results, rumors, or any number of geopolitical events, and scandals.\n\n\-Interacting with different parties\n\nAgain, if you've ever played a Total War game, I envisions this to be very similar to the diplomacy system. You'll be able to offer certain things and request certain things, along with a vague indication of how they would feel about the request. In this mode you'd be able to view certain aspects of the character, such as their relative ambition, their opinion or feelings towards you, and positions they might hold, and any dirt you might have on them. In this way, you can leverage, blackmail, seduce, or persuade characters to accomplish your ends. Most of this type of interaction will be done among the Nobility, and occasionally you may have the opportunity to negotiate with foreign powers directly. Failed attempts at reaching agreements will result in changing opinions of you, shifts in influence and other penalties depending on the nature of the request and severity of the failure. EX: Asking a number of nobles loyal to the King to depose him and install you as ruler might end up ending your game via execution. Unique among these is the King himself. You can influence him, possibly even to the extent where he's practically your puppet, but you cannot blackmail or demand anything from him, he is the King after all. Angering the king or losing favor can result in penalties such as being ""sent away"" to a remote estate where you will likely find it much harder to influence goings on. The People you can influence by arranging and going on tours of the kingdom, and by making it known that you push for policies with their best interests at heart. EX: Successfully convincing the King to lower the tax rate after a particularly hard winter would increase your standing.\n\n\-Children\n\nAs mentioned above, and as in history, as Queen it is considered your duty to produce and heir to the throne. Each turn you will have a chance to become pregnant, which is modified by your standing with the King, and whether or not you're having affairs with other people. During the pregnancy, you also stand a chance to lose the child. During turns in which you are pregnant you will suffer some slight penalties such as fewer chances to influence and perhaps not being able to go on the tour of the kingdom you planned. After your child is born you find out if it's male of female. Throughout their childhood you'll receive different notifications about their upbringing and if they fall ill, die, or are crippled. If and when they reach a certain age you'll have the option to include them in your interactions with other characters. This could take the form of getting or contesting appointments arranging marriages, or making agreements with Nobility to depose the King, and install your child with you as Regent. The King will also have a role with ""his"" children. He will have a favorite, as well as an heir apparent, these will not always be the same child. These factors can help you steer the King to what you want.  You may also find a wrench thrown in your plans, for instance, if you've been grooming your son for the throne, and the King decides to make him the commander of an army in the field, far from court and your influence. Overall you should have wide latitude in making decisions concerning your children, and using them to, or setting them up to, achieve your ends. \n\n\-Military\n\nThis is where I envision the key difference in my game and other strategy games. There should be next to ***NO*** player control of their military forces.  At best, if you manage to seize the throne for yourself, or become Regent, you should be able to declare war or otherwise direct where you want to invade, but not be able to control the outcome of battles beyond comparing your relative military strength to your enemy's. I also think that military policy should be an aspect, so that you can influence, or decide where money goes in the military itself.EX: Increasing the funding of your kingdom's navies, or focusing on defensive fortifications. The idea of the game isn't to seize power and crush everyone under the weight of your military, such games have been made, and my game isn't supposed to be a ""But this time you're a woman!"" gimmick. \n\n*Victory Conditions/ End Game*\n\nAs stated, the idea is to make your kingdom the most powerful in the world before your death. I can think of two possible endings. 1. Similar to Total War (borrowing a lot) each kingdom has victory conditions. EX: Hold or be allies of territories X and Y as well as #Z of others. 2. There is no strict Win/Lose. Upon your death the game generates a history book. The story of your kingdom/ your lifetime. It will highlight the achievements and big events during that time, but not necessarily attribute them to you. Hopefully the player should be able to reminisce or remember all the work that went into accomplishing those feats, and though they may not get all the credit, will know that they were the hand that steered the ship of state.\n\n*Minor Mechanics/ Ideas*\n\n\-Incest\n\nAs a historical reality, I think it should be included in the game as a tradeoff. Marrying a cousin at the start of your game could effectively give you greater influence in two kingdoms at the start, possibly even uniting them. However it should also have downsides, such as increased chance to lose a child, or children being born with disabilities.\n\n\-Polygamy\n\nThough not really a historically accurate aspect of Europe (other than extramarital affairs) in other parts of the world, kings having multiple wives was the norm. Adding other, possibly senior, wives as an obstacle to your power would be a good difficulty mechanic.\n\n\-Ladies-in-waiting\n\nSimilar to Total War's agents (still borrowing a lot), the player should use these people as spies or agents to gather information or put characters in compromising situations. But if the player isn't careful, or misreads a situation, they could serve as a source of trouble for you.\n\n\-Religion\n\nHaving the Church as a fourth party to influence or gain favor with is an idea that I've toyed with, but haven't really thought of how to incorporate.\n\n**Closing thoughts**\n\nIn today's context of gender in video games, some people are likely to see my idea as some kind of feminist propaganda power fantasy. It isn't meant to be. I hate seeing fan favorites of any medium co-opted or have characters shoehorned in for the sake of political correctness. My game isn't taking anyone's spotlight, or shoehorning anyone in. As someone who loves to read history, you can find Queens throughout history who are often notorious for doing exactly what my game seeks to portray (Alexander the Great's mother Olympias comes to mind). How many decisions were or weren't made due to the influence of powerful women is a mystery that is probably lost to time forever, but my game seeks to put you in their shoes. Make your own path to power in a world where the odds are stacked against you. "
9k269o,I want to create a medieval fighting game but..,"There are many like this out there, even though I want to create options for adventure RPG mode and 1v1 with characters from all backgrounds, warrior sects, cultures like knights, samurais, ninjas, wizards, monks, rogues, executioners, etc, it still kind of exists.

9k05wu,A FPS Arena game that puts you up against more players each round you win.,"It would be fast pace with small but dynamic maps. When you first join, you will be put into a larger team for instance 7 people against two people who have probably been on a win streak. It’s a quick game with a higher skill ceiling. The more rounds you win, the more likely that you will be on the smaller team in the next round with a completely different lobby. \n\nLet’s say someone who is really good is on a crazy goes on a crazy win streak, each round may go something like this. (His team mentioned first, enemy mentioned second)\n\n7 vs 2\n5v5\n3 v 6\n2 v 8\n1 v 10 \n\nAnd so on if he/she keeps winning and doing good. If you loose the reverse effect would happen. It would be a game that avoids random chance and factors so that a truly good player can get far, challenge themselves, and have dope highlights consistently. \n\nI feel like this idea would would with multiple themes: modern warfare, futuristic shooter, medical arena, fantasy, etc\n\nLmk what you think"

9jxnc8,"Cooperative survival ""battle royale""","This is a PvE version of a BR game. A number of players spawn across the map with extremely limited loadouts selected before the game starts (more on this later). Instead of gas as the circle shrinks, a variety of dire weather conditions would occur, deadly enough that cooperation is essential to surviving them.\n\nUltimately, the goal would be to get yourself and as many other players as possible out safely. This would give you experience which could be used to unlock different starting items and maybe some perks.\n\nBefore each game (or possibly in the lobby) you'd get a set number of points to work with, and use these to set up a starting loadout. These points would be low enough that no one player could start with enough gear to survive on their own unless they get lucky with the circle."

9jufgc,What happens when you mix a Collectible Card Game (CCG) with a turn-based RPG? This. (Inspired by Paper Mario),"Oh hey the Experienced idea flair is never used, oddly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I was thinking how perfect a CCG would be in the style of Paper Mario.  I decided to spare you of the ramblings of a spinoff on a series you probably don't even know about, and instead discuss an **original** idea that is somewhat similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Index:\n\n1. Definition of a CCG\n2. Definition of an RPG\n3. Explanation of the Idea\n4. Some examples of cards (feel free to suggest your own)\n\n~~Please stay until the end for funny card names~~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1: Definition of a CCG\n\nCollectible Card Games are pretty nebulous, and there are many different kinds of them.  Overall, though, a CCG is a game where you spend real life money or virtual currency on packs to collect cards, which you then use to construct ""decks"" used to combat other players.  In combat, each player takes turns playing their cards using Mana.  Cards themselves range from minions that attack a selected target each turn to spells with one-time effects, but the ultimate goal is to damage your opponent's health to 0.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2: Definition of an RPG\n\nRoleplaying games, too, are quite nebulous.  Some people argue that any game where you play as a character other than yourself is an RPG, and, pedantically speaking, yes.  You ""roleplay"" as a character.  But the much more common definition is that of turn-based RPGs:\n\nIn turn-based RPGs, you control a single character or party of characters, and, while in combat, you are faced against some enemies.  Your party and the enemies all take turns doing ""actions.""  Actions range from attacking, to using an item, to using a move with a special effect (at the cost of MP, or Magic Points), to using any of a variety of other tactics, such as fleeing.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to defeat all enemies by damaging their health to 0.  Then, party members may level up, becoming more powerful for future battles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Notice the similarities?\n\n**In both genres,** two parties each take turns doing actions that consume a form of currency with the goal of bringing the opposing party's health down to 0.  Outside of combat, you have control over how powerful your options will be.\n\nThey're perfect to blend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3: Explanation of the Idea\n\n&gt;The Gimmick\n\nImagine a CCG, but without minions.  **Your party members ARE the minions.**\n\nInstead, all cards are ""Spells.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach party member only has the option to attack; all other actions are performed via cards.\n\n&gt;Combat\n\nThe player is given 5 cards at the start of battle from their deck they crafted beforehand, and are given one extra card each round.  ""Speed"" is not  stat in this game, so turns occur in fixed rounds: One turn for the player, and one for all enemies.\n\nThese cards are used by spending Mana, which is replenished by skipping your turn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach party member (and enemy) has Strength, Defense, and Health values that can be increased or decreased in-battle via cards.  For example, one party member could have 2 Strength/0 Defense/12 Health, and another 1 Strength/2 Defense/8 Health.  (Numbers are small in this game for simplicity's sake)\n\nWhen a party member attacks, that do their amount of Strength in damage to an enemy, minus that enemy's amount of Defense.  A party member or enemy is killed when their Health value falls to 0.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, each party member would come with their own unique side aliment, such as ""When this destroys an enemy, this attacks again"" or ""When damaged, this gets +1 strength for a single attack""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do cards have to do with this?**  Cards can do a variety of things: Do outright direct damage to enemies, Buff teammates, Debuff enemies, Heal, Stun, Poison, Make a party member ignore Defense, Make a party member do a bonus attack, draw cards, Double a party member's Strength, etc.  This leads me to the next part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4: Some examples of cards\n\n*""Falling Debris"":* Do 3 damage to an enemy. (2 Mana)\n\n*""Battery-Flavored Energy Bar:""* A party member attacks again this turn. (4 Mana)\n\n*""Explosive Explosive:""* Do 2 damage to all enemies. (4 Mana)\n\n*""Bread:""* Heal a party member for 3.  Draw a card. (3 Mana)\n\n*""Self-Lifting Weights:""* A party member gets +2 Strength this turn and +2 Health. (3 Mana)\n\n*""Shrinking Violet:""* A party member cannot be targeted for attacks by enemies the following enemy round.  Draw a card. (1 Mana)\n\n*""Double-Decker:""* Draw 2 cards. (2 Mana)\n\n*""Confusing Joke:""* An enemy becomes Dizzy and cannot attack for two turns. (5 Mana)\n\n*""It's Time For A Fucking Crusade:""* All party members get +2 strength this turn. (8 Mana)\n\n*""Incurable Disease:""* Poison an enemy. (poisoned enemies receive 1 damage at the start of each turn forever) (4 Mana)\n\n*""Free Earthquake:""* Do 1 damage to everything. (0 Mana)\n\n*""Temporal Magnet:""* Remove an enemy's Defense for this turn. Draw a card. (2 Mana)\n\n*""Oh Shit a Black Hole:""* Instantly destroy a standard enemy. (8 Mana)"
9jr5kj,Ticket to War,"Another idea dump, because I have too many of these recently:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe year is 1910 and  military planners the world over have realized that the rail network will be integral to the rapid mobilization and deployment of troops. You  are a civil engineer in charge of your small countries railroad network on the brink of the world's first truly industrialized war.   \n\n\nEvery  month (turn) you are given a budget with which you can expand your  nation's rail network. This budget can be spent on laying new track, harvest track for scrap, or  buying new train engines.  \n\n\nDuring the player's turn they will  also have the power to set the stations each engine will service. The more engines servicing a certain stations the more cargo capacity those  stations can handle. The nation's war effort hinges on your ability  moving men and materials to where they are needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  player has no control over the diplomatic situation. However random  diplomatic events will trigger throughout a play session dictating which  borders need to be defended, which ports or border checkpoints can be  used to trade goods, and if Allied reinforcements are coming. The  player's ability to get goods, soldiers, and heavy weapons where they  are needed will determine if their nation is successful in the coming  war or if their nation is overrun by the foreign menace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce the November 1918 rolls around peace will break out and the player will be given a summary of their nation's standing in the post war world. Statistics like territory lost, goods traded, soldiers sent to allied nations, and success on the battle field will go into determining your post war international reputation. Will you emerge a world power or more powerful country's puppet state?  \n"
9jnnk1,"An SCP Containment breach game but it's story-driven and constructed, you're a scientist and each chapter is about an SCP.","I've always found the world of SCP amazing. there are about 5000 different SCPs you can find in the wiki and I like casually reading through it to find horrifying beings. However, there's something I didn't like about the games. The story is being told mainly by some notes you find laying around, which is a lousy way to get about storytelling and most people don't even read them. My pitch is, If you were playing as a scientist, documenting and experiencing the full danger and horrors of  (failing to) contain an SCP, the SCPs would have a much greater meaning and would be scarier than they were in the original games because not only do players understand their capabilities, they won't need to read a 250-word .docx for it.\n\nThere are lots of scary things you can witness about the SCP universe that you couldn't have if the story was being told from a human experiment's subject - both will meet face to face with SCPs due to the containment breach,  but being a scientist would open storytelling doors to researcher's precautions with SCPs and how human and animal test subjects are being treated. in addition, instead of reading about the different experiments and their results of each SPC, you could actually witness it.\n\nAnother thing to make each SCP more special, is to change the way the game is played. don't leave an open map to explore, but rather make it a constructed storytelling game where each chapter is an encounter with a couple SCPs, instead of the MC being thrown into a free-roam map with SCPs. the rest of the details could be similar to the original games or something like Outlast or even Amnesia.\n\nSome story ideas:\n\nYou are a researcher working with SCP- 173 (The well known one that kills you if you aren't looking at it) You're about to experiment what happens if line of sight is broken with 173 when there is a camera recording and watching it. 5 armed guards escort a human test subject into the room with SCP 173, each informing each other when they blink. they push him in and close the door. soon the test subject blinks and gets killed, even though the recording. analysis of the footage shows the victim's head stretched up and flipped to face 173, which ripped his spinal cord, and his eyes are suddenly opened as well.  *(This is what I thought of directly through the experiment in the SCP wiki site* [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/conclusions-red-173-2263-incident*](http://www.scp-wiki.net/conclusions-red-173-2263-incident) *- It's something disturbing as hell that can never really be acted out the way the games currently are. )*\n\nSuddenly lights out and alarms are playing. a huge explosion, you have to get out of this place, but the way is blocked, and the only way to proceed is through  SCP-939's containment quarters. It's a monster that uses the sounds that his previous victims made prior to their killing to lure more people.  An example to how it would be played out:  \nthe player is crouching through a dark hallway, when he hears ""Who's there?"" It's tempting to call for help, but doing so would make sound and alert the monster directly to you. instead you have to sneak around, stealth-mission like, gathering the key to the exit and going to the exit. This principle has been done in many horror games and it's known to be creepy (For Example SOMA has many of encounters like these). \n\nThis encounter would be especially creepy as while you sneak around, you get to hear different attempts of the monster to lure you. like it saying: ""Is anyone there?"" , ""I swear I heard something move"", ""AAAHH, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!?"". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nSCP but instead of you being a human experiment in a free-roam map, you're a scientist experimenting on human subjects moments before the containment breach,  and in order to get out you have to go through several SCP's containment quarters. this produces a much better story experience than the free-roam style that SCP games currently have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease tell me what you think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

9jlc8a,Game idea: Offshoot KCD Bannerlord hybrid,[removed]
9ji3ip,An environmental puzzler in which you can copy something in the room to help you get out.,"You wake up in an dilapidated underground research site, along and without memory. You find a piece of equipment that can make an exact copy of whatever you aim it at. You must use it to explore the research site, find out what happened and perhaps escape with your life.\n\nA simple, early puzzle would be two locks that must have key cards inserted simultaneously, but there is only one key card. But the puzzles soon get more complex and involve physics. Another one would involve making a copy disappear in the right spot (copies only last a certain amount of time).\n\n****\n\nThe best way to explain this game would be to describe what led me to the idea.\n\nI was watching a Breath of the Wild video essay (by SuperButterBuns) describing Link having to recover his memories. Then I though, ""what if Link found the memory locations but the flashbacks didn't come? Because Link didn't start in a healing pool... he was in a *cloning* pool. Dun dun DUN!! The real Link had died.""\n\nThat would be a neat twist to all the games in which you wake up without memories. Portal, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and countless other environmental puzzlers fall into this. I thought, ""what if you wake up with amnesia and find pictures/recordings of yourself but no flashbacks ever happen. You turn out to just be a clone.""\n\nWhat game mechanic would thematically fit with the story? Cloning/copying!\n\n### The Story\n\nAs you discover, an apocalyptic event happened that led to a lack of resources. This research site was working on a technology that could copy and multiply resources such as food. However, they couldn't get past the limitation that the copies would disappear fairly quickly. Their research was able to extend the ""life"" of copies substantially, but still not permanently.\n\nBefore they could solve the problem, a lab accident led to the chief engineer being copied. Both the chief engineer and the clone were in a coma. The remaining scientists debated what to do. The situation on the surface got worse and they had to abandon the station.\n\nYou're living on borrowed time. Perhaps you can find the solution that the chief engineer was working on and make it to the surface. If you can make it in time, at least."
9jg8wl,Good Boy,"You play as a little girl trying to make it to her family in the midst of an alien invasion. You find a dog that’s been infected with a strange alien substance, giving the dog unusual abilities that will come in handy as you stealth your way to the refuge your family is at. You’ll also need to ride the dog in some areas. I feel like it should be a Mastiff type dog that’s clearly mutated, but not disgustingly so, it’s just obvious it’s not a normal dog. \n\nThe dogs abilities include: Invisibility, Explosive-Slime-Spit, Shape Shifting, Mega-Bark, Wall-Crawling,   and Sense-Sharing.  That last one meaning he can allow the girl to use his senses. \n\nHe turns invisible as to not draw attention to you, can shake his head sending glowing globs slobber in all directions that explode after a certain amount of time. You can give him the shape shift command in order to access doors that can only be opened by aliens. You’ll need to time it well as the disguise won’t fool a close up inspection, it is a dog pretending to be a humanoid alien after all. Mega Bark is exactly what it sounds like. He can walk on walls and even along the ceiling to pounce on unsuspecting aliens/malevolent humans, and sense sharing allows the little girl to see things like scent trails in order to find whatever it is she’s looking for. \n\nAs the girl your mainly sneaking, throwing rocks to distract, and there’s a little platforming as well, nothing too extreme though cause you’re like 10 years old. If you’re caught your dog will come to your rescue but he’s not invincible, you’ll need to find first aid kits around the world and use them to patch him up after a nasty fight. If either of you die the game ends. \n\nI think the game would benefit if it was constantly juxtaposing the grim brutality of an invasion, with the sweetness and innocence of a child bonding with their pet. Like the visuals are dark and foreboding, when the dog dispatches someone it’s brutal and vicious looking. But then he just comes back, tail wagging, big ol’ droopy smile on his face, never mind it’s dripping with alien brain matter. It would be tricky to pull off, as nuanced games always are, it’s tough to strike that balance without it being jarring and just not very relatable. But I’m sure someone could pull it off."
9jfdak,Open world detective game... With a twist.,"So the idea I have for the game is, it's open world, in a city, and one player is a detective. As this detective you're looking for a criminal, you have to find clues and use real life smarts to track down the criminal you're looking for, but this isn't a linear follow the clues and get taken there automatically game, no, you really do have to find clues and information like a true detective and guess where the criminal COULD BE. And here's the twist, the criminal, is another player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you're playing as the criminal (For example you can have different options, a hitman, a bank robber, a drug smuggler or serial killer) you will be given tasks, for example, if you play as the hitman, you may start off the game with your boss giving you a job ""Here's your job, find Richard White, kill him, make it look like an accident.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you as the hitman will be trying to find information about the person you're trying to kill, my idea for this game is these ways you go about completing the game are really realistic, so if you were looking for a target, you may think ""How would I do this in real life?"" so for example, you might go onto a computer in game, you have a dossier with all the info you have on the person, you have their name, so you type in their name on a computer and BOOM, you found the place a guy works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these things you do has an effect on the world around you, for instance, if the player playing as the detective goes to an internet cafe, and looks at the search history on the computer, say the player playing as the hitman didn't think about that, for instance. That would then put the hitman as an expose, you would see that the hitman searched ""Richard White"" on the computer, then you will see whoever did that was looking for the place he works, details like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then the detective could ask the NPC if they saw who used that computer, if the player playing as the hitman didn't do anything to hide his cover, then the clerk could give you an in game drawing of what he looks like, you know a police sketch? Then the detective could go to the workplace, and take a look out for the hitman, on the off chance that is the hitman. You're playing as the detective, you look outside and then BOOM, you see the guy matching the descrription.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when you approach him, you can choose a guns out apprehend approach, but there's a chance that the other player might pull out his weapon and attack, details in this game are very important. So then either the detective arrests the other player or shoots him, and then as the hitman you lost. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt comes up with a screen giving you hints as to why you lost, saying ""You didn't hide your identity well enough."" or ""You didn't cover your tracks using a computer.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game rewards the detective the faster he catches the criminal, and the less people killed for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then at that point, you realize ""Damn, in this game I really need to be careful about everything."" examples are like you would in real life, if you were a hitman in real life you wouldn't look up information on a public computer right? so on and so fourth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a game where everything you do matters, at first players are most likely gonna make mistakes like this, like the ones I mentioned, or the detectives aren't gonna know where to go or what to do, then you will discover it's a game to treat as if it was real life, it really tests your wits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more games you win based on your score will give you a ranking, putting you up against players of similar rankings, making your opponent a really hard opponent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA realistic cat and mouse game between two players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother example, if you find a target and put them in a trunk to take them out in the desert and shoot them, say for instance you crash your car, you need to make sure there's no trace that can lead the other player to you, and after 20 minutes of that event happening (Crashing the car) police will eventually be called to that location, and then they will call the detective player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if I'm the detective player, and somewhere on the map the hitman player crashes his car and the guy he was supposed to kill escapes, I will get a call telling me to get over there and investigate, I may go there, and then I'll think ""How can I get information on this person"" so say there's a local small town nearby, I go there and ask some NPCs if they saw any out of town's person, the NPCs will tell me something for example like ""Yeah a fella came here asking to rent a car, had leather gloves on and a beard."" I could then ask what kind of car he used, where it looked like he was driving etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to where he may possibly be, use my senses, look for places where the player might of put the car, remember, the game doesn't tell the player ""stash your car here"" the other player can do what he wants, the only thing the other player is told to do is his tasks, what he does just increases his odds of successing his job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI may look for the car used and the liscence plate (Information given to me by the car dealer) I find the car looking for tracks of where it might be hidden, if I have trouble finding it I can ask building owners or access to their secruity footage, there's a huge amount of things I could do, so I eventually track down the locattion of the car, I see it's the same license plate, so I sit and wait to see if the hitman comes back, I look around to see if there's any security cameras, this could make the hitman paranoid for example...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hitman may walk back to his car, then see me looking at security cameras in the area, the player then may think ""fuck it's the other player"" which it may or may not be (As the detective and hitman can mostly look like anyone) so the hitman may walk away to avoid me, see anything can happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe could kill me in broad daylight out in public, but obviously if he does that he fells as people call the police, so at the same time the detective also has to avoid getting the hitman onto him/her\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo say the hitman goes back to their car, I follow them, and hope I do it so they don't notice me, and this trying not to get noticed while I follow them will be really realistic, as it's two players, not a random pedestrian. So if you were tailing him you'd genuiley have to make sure another player doesn't notice it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI follow him, and I see him pull up to someone's house, from a distance I can see the other player pulling out a gun as he walks up to someone's door, intending to assassinate him. I as the detective thee obviously have to intervene, I run at him as he breaks into a person's house, about to shoot him, I get up behind the hitman and then it switches to a cutscene of the detective going ""Freeze, hands in the air."" boom, the detective player wins, the hitman player looses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt comes up with a screen saying ""Detective Wins"" or something like that, you as the detective then feel like a badass for tracking down the other player and stopping him, you with your smarts and wits managed to outsmart the other player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut remember, the more you win, the higher your rank gets, and the higher your rank gets you're put into games with even better players, players so good they leave little to no tracks, then your smarts are really tested, you're also put under the pressure of the hitman killing you, this is a game designed where you can do ANYTHING. The player playing as the hitman could set up false evidence, leading the detective to a location where the hitman gets the upper hand on you, could you figure that out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink about almost any possibility when it comes to a game using the smarts of players and it can probably be implemented into this game, this idea of the game is where the player has to be careful about everything they do, as it could lead the enemy to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE: There's some other info I have of how this system would work, and more ideas and concept of why I believe this would be a fun great amazing game, in the hopes of convincing you, it's just after lots of righting the words kind of go to the back of my head and I can't get the ideas up to put to words, so hopefully this post sounds appealing and gives you a decent understanding of what I mean :D"
9jdik6,Stranded on a station free falling down to Earth,"***BACKGROUND:***\n\nYou are an android assigned to an orbital station that for whichever reason is rapidly losing altitude. One hour until impact with the planetary surface. One hour to save yourself- or the thousands of lives living within the impact area. One hour to uncover the mysteries deep within the eerie station.\n\n***MECHANICS:***\n\n*1) Gloom*\n\nIn the deep chasms of the dim station, darkness is your worst foe- and greatest ally.\n\n*2) Windows*\n\nFew and far between, they serve as the only passage for the tendrils of sunlight and gives the player a sense of urgency as the silhouette of the world looms ever closer.\n\n*3) Gravity*\n\nAs the station shakes and twists throughout the fall, gravity plays queer tricks upon the unsuspecting; allowing passages unseen to appear and turns the station into a mind-bending labyrinth.\n\n*4) Encounters*\n\nSheathed in shadows, it is a grim reminder to be wary of the corridors you enter.\n\n*5) Time*\n\nYou have one hour, make it count.\n\n*6) Randomly Generated*\n\nNo playthrough is ever the same, and no path is ever certain.\n\n***SUMMARY:***\n\nEach playthrough is at maximum: 1 hour long, the goal is to give the player a hair-raising and mind-bending experience in this short timespan.

9jcmjw,Retropocalypse,"This is a mix of Fallout: 76, TF2, and Overwatch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClasses:\n\nThis game has 6 classes - the Signaller (Support), the Pioneer (Offence), the Corporal (Tank), the Marksman (Defence), the Trapper (Offence), and the Nurse (Support).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Signaller has several stock weapons. His primary, the Flare Gun allows a Signaller main to give support to his class by summoning various effects from the skies. Cocaine gas gives his squad members +25% reload speed and +25% movement speed for example. Poison gas deals -5 damage for 10 seconds to all enemies in the area of the gas whilst Artillery Barrage insta-kills everyone whose caught in the area of effect. He also has a Carbine for self-defence and a radio pole as his melee. (Special abilities: Signal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Pioneer is the fastest class in the game. He has the fastest movement speed and the fastest capture rate.  His primary weapon is the Flamethrower. This weapon is best used at short range to burn people to death. He can also spray and pray, and hope that afterburn damage either kills his enemy or gets him a free assist. Setting fire to Marksmen and Trappers will make them visible to all. This weapon can also extinguish squadmates who have been set on fire using his alt-fire, airblast.  He can also boop enemies off cliffs or push people off cliffs by using his airblast. His sidearm, the Carbine, is good for finishing off enemies that he has set on fire. He uses a tomahawk as his melee. (Special abilities: Afterburn/Airblast)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Corporal is a tank class. He has the highest health of the 6 classes but has the lowest moving speed. His primary weapon, the Whistle, has a recharge time of 30 seconds, but gives all his squadmates a beneficial effect. Stock gives +25% damage when blown. His secondary weapon, the Bayonet Charge, allows him to charge and insta-kill light classes in front of him. His melee is a trench club.  (Special abilities: Whistle, Bayonet Charge)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Marksman is a defence class. His variant of the  Signaller's and the Nurse's Carbine has a scope, allowing him to deal a moderate amount of damage as a very rapid rate whilst scoped in. However, he is unable to move whilst scoped in, takes 50% more damage from all sources whilst scoped, and cannot fire his weapon unless scoped in. His secondary is a Jar of Mayonnaise, which slows down all enemies coated in it and increases movement speed of all teammates coated in it, as well as making all Marksmen and Trappers who are moving visible to all. His melee is a trench knife. Like the Trapper, he can also move without being seen. (Special ability: Headshot)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Trapper is an offence class. One of his signature moves is camouflage. He cannot be seen whilst moving. He can also set traps with his first Secondary, the Bear Trap. The Bear Trap prevents all who are caught in it from moving and deals 5 bleed damage per second until its victim is dead or its victim is freed. His second Secondary, the Wire Trap Bomb, gives him the chance to blow up victims remotely. His melee is the Switchblade, which allows him to insta kill enemy teammates by stabbing them in the back. He can also disable traps set by other Trappers. (Special ability: Traps)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Nurse is a support class. Her primary weapon is the Bloodhook, allowing her to heal multiple people at once at +5 health a second. Healing people fills up her Bloodmeter. When her Bloodmeter is fully filled, she can activate it to give all her squadmates (including herself) +10 health a second, giving them overheal or preventing them from taking more damage, or a badly needed health boost. She can also overheal her teammates with her Bloodhook. She, like the Trapper, also has two secondaries. Her first secondary is the Field Clinic, giving all her squadmates (including herself) who are near the FC +3 health a second. Her second secondary is the Carbine, which is just like everyone's else carbine - pretty good for self-defence (or rapid offence if you're the Marksman). Her melee is the Stabsyringe (you stab people with it) (Special ability: Bloodboosted)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGame modes:\n\nLike Fallout 76, this game is an open-world game that is always online, and you can harvest things from the world and use them to build your base, which can be destroyed by anyone who's in a griefing mood. As a global server it has several rules. Hacks like wallhack and aimbot are banned. Griefing is also not allowed. However, for 12 hours starting from 7 pm at March 21 to 7 am on March 22 each year, all admins will leave the server. It's called the Day of Debauchery, and you can practically do anything you want. Wanna go on a griefing spree? Go for it! Wanna kick people out of servers for no reason and ban them for as long as you want? Absolutely. There are no rules for these 12 hours. There's also a mode called Loot the Airship - which is exactly what it says. An airship has crashed and you can loot it. However, other squads will also be looting the airship. You can choose to just take what you can put into your inventory, or kill everyone else and build your base on the ruins of the airship. You can also engage in Squad v Squad Battles in either Squad Royale or Respawn Mode.  Squad Royale has two modes - Break the Dam, which gives you 5 minutes to find enough explosives to blow up the Dam, and drown everyone else, or kill every other squad you see, with every other squad doing the same. The other mode, Aerial Combat, involves a never ending drop. Every member of a Squad is armed with a Jetpack. To stop falling and to move independently, one and one's squad must find fuel. Squads will try and kill each other whilst falling in the air. Health packs can be found in the air as well. The last squad to live wins the match. In Respawn Mode, there are several modes - Espionage, or a capture the intelligence mode. Free-for-All, which is a TDM mode. There's also Escort - literally what it says , 6 v 6, one moving the payload, the other preventing the payload from being moved. There's also a Territory Mode - which is to capture and maintain control over a zone in a map. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLoadouts: \n\nEach class has unique weapons that a player can randomly get or unlock by getting achievements. Since we are not Valve, anyone can trade with anyone as long as the trade is voluntary and consensual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the Signaller. His stock Flaregun gives all his squadmates +10% damage.  He has 4 flareguns other than stock. The Drug Lord allows the Signaller to bombard an area with Cocaine Gas, giving all squadmates in that area +25% reload speed, whilst the Boyfriend in the Artillery allows the Signaller to summon an artillery barrage which insta-kills everyone unlucky enough to be in the area of effect. The Nervewrecker allows the Signaller to stun all enemy teammates in the area of his choice, whilst the Toxic Trooper summons poison gas. He has one other melee weapon which he can use to boost his Flaregun recharge rate, the Operator's Sick Pleasures. Dealing damage with the OSP recharges the Flaregun, at the cost of 25% less damage as compared to the stock Telephone Pole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Pioneer has the Firebender, a flamethrower that shoots bursts of flames at enemies. Increased range and increased ammo capacity, but a lower rate of fire and a 25% damage penalty. He also has the M1948 Flamethrower, with reduced airblasting cost, but a decreased rate of fire and a ammo clip penalty. His Fire Axe mini-crits burning players whilst his Metal Pipe reduces the movement speed of the enemies it hits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Nurse has the Rapid Healer secondary which allows her to heal her squadmates at a much faster rate as compared to her Bloodhook at the cost of dealing no damage whilst her Dying Breath primary can revive a single squadmate from the dead when fully Bloodboosted. Another primary she can equip is the Bloodsucker, which requires a Nurse main to suck health from enemy players in order to heal her own squadmates. She also has the Benefaction, which she can use to heal all her squadmates independently, at the cost of no Bloodboost and reduced healing per second (+3 health instead of +5 health a second)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Trapper can use the Carbine Drip, something similar to the Sentry Gun/Torbjorn's Turret/Symmetra's Turret , which deals damage to all enemy players in its range as one of his secondaries. He has one other weapon besides his primary - the Stinger. The Stinger deals 5 seconds of -5 health per second for every hit it deals to an enemy player, at the cost of 20% max health. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe .22 Carbine is an alternative to the Marksman's stock Scoped Carbine. It has an increased rate of fire (+25%) and a increased clip (+25%) and allows the Marksman to fire without scoping as well as being able to move whilst you're shooting. However, it suffers from a +50% additional reload time penalty. Players who have equipped this primary also take critical hits. (This game, like TF2, has random crits). He can also use the Jar of Cream, which returns 50% of all damage dealt by coated enemies as healing back to the person who equips the JoC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't think of any more loadouts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and this game has a unique feature called morale. When your player keeps killing other people, the game will become progressively easier due to increased morale. Higher chances of dealing random crits, increased reload speed, and etc. The opposite is true for a player who keeps dying. Reduced movement speed, increased reloading time, and a higher propensity of taking random critical damage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this is like my 3rd post so yea still a beginner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

9ja5yc,Alzheimer's disease game depicting what it might be like living with it.,"So again this is kind of an idea I've toyed with,  a game dealing with what it's like having Alzheimer's. So there is games out there where you are a blind person and you have to navigate the world, same with a game about depression so on. There is alot of games like this but as far as I know none to do with Alzheimer's specifically.\n\nSo in the game you are someone with Alzheimer's and your goal is to get home or to some location. At first the path is clear and fairly straight forward to allow the player to figure out the way quickly.\n\nAs the game progresses there are changes in the way to get to the location. so maybe there's a left turn instead of a right turn here and there. Something else could occur where maybe a particular piece of the path is all together missing and you are wandering through a void till you find the next piece of the path. Pacing is key with this as you can't let the player know exactly if it's always been like that or not. \n\nThere could be dialogue in the game where someone is trying to direct the player towards their destination. But, the npc is telling different directions than is true to get to the destination even though the npc would get them to the correct destination.\n\nThe main idea being the player is supposed to know the way to the destination but as the game progresses the way becomes more and more unclear and ""wrong"" until its unrecognizable. \n\nDISCLAIMER: for any that suffer from Alzheimer's, has a family member or friend that deals with it my condolences go out to you and I can't even begin to imagine how scary and upsetting that might be. That being said the purpose of the game is to try to raise awareness and make sure this isn't a disease that is glossed over or made to seem like it's not that bad. It hurts people dealing with it and people around it and if you need help there are places to seek it do not be afraid to ask for help."
9j9hfu,"[Intermediate] A game dealing with being born on a space ship, having to survive and get the ship as far as possible.","Ok I saw a video title recently on youtube ""the limits of how far humanity can go in space"". (THIS IDEA IS BASED ON PURELY THE TITLE as weird as that sounds meaning no I did not watch the actual video nor will this be about what is in the video.) You are born in a space ship that was launched from earth some hundreds of years ago. a tutorial through out ""your life"" is played showing how to do certain things so walking, jumping, sprinting, agriculture, so on whatever is really needed. your ultimate goal is to survive in the limited space you have and to deal with problems along the way. such as a meteor hitting your hull and now you have to go into space and fix it. Or maybe a small infection has broken out among crops that if not treated will starve your group. when sleeping for example say 1 month passes or something to quickly pass time so your not spending an actual full life time on the game. so on. the game could be story driven or be similar to subnautica. It could have a tutorial style such as fallout or FTL. whatever the design really calls for. But my idea being it realistic as to problems and situations in that particular situation. anyway go wild tell me what you think :D"
9j8ju0,Airstrike: A game where movement(and airstrikes) is the only thing that matters.,"A game played in third person perspective, where your character is resembled by a no-faced character with visuals that are almost identical to the game ""SuperHot"". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTeam mode or deathmatch, it's the same when it comes to how each game starts. You, and 29 other players drop out of a nonexistent airship into handcrafted arenas with an insanely insane amount of walls and towers of cubic columns, with a black void of death at the bottom. The only thing you don't see: Round corners, and overhanging ledges. The point of the game is to compete to capture a point(team mode) or multiple points(deathmatch) to gain points and then win the game. To do this, you have to stand on the capture point. Sounds easy right? Wait. You need to stand still. Oh. That changes everything. Welcome to the wonderful ~~tool~~ weapon of death we call the ""Airstrike"". Pointing and click on an opponent or ground will start the countdown(0.5 seconds) to when a giant missile of death plunges directly from the air and explodes at the spot. Airstrikes are deadly, and kill in one shot no matter WHAT. Enemy and Ally airstrikes are clearly marked by the team-colored columns of light(**targeting scopes**) they emit before the missile falls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how can you avoid airstrikes? Simple. Keep on moving. And that doesn't mean spam your WASD keys, it means use grappling hooks, flashes, dashes, shock wave grenades, your own airstrikes, or just plain old jumping. Power ups and gadgets like the ones listed above will be randomly scattered throughout the map and change positions when collected. Different variations of airstrikes can be found too. I will be posting some examples of these down below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe winning strategy is to keep moving and always plan your next move. Planning where you want to grapple next, or who are you aiming to airstrike. High-speed chases around columns will be very common, and those will be most fun to be engaged with. Timing of Airstrikes is also important, but you must keep making adjustments to your strategy based on current situations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Airstrikes:** \n\n""The Blitz""\n\nOnce placed, death comes faster, but in a much smaller radius\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""The Seer""\n\nOnce placed, you may keep the scope at the location for up to 5 seconds, and then may activate it again to almost instantly place an airstrike at the location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""The Zephyr""\n\nTargeting scope descends from the sky instead of appearing instantly, making sneak attacks more viable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""The Spike""\n\nOnce targeted on an enemy player, descends instantly onto them, dealing no damage, but driving them downwards. Works best on players jumping over THE PIT OF DEATH. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gadgets:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Double Jump Kit""\n\nWhat more do I have to say?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Wall Jump Kit""\n\nJumping while against a wall makes you wall jump in the direction you are facing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Grappler""\n\nClick to shoot a grappler, and it will automatically reel you in. Simple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Rift""\n\nSummons a rift in the direction you are facing in and teleports you a short distance that way.

I have a couple but they need work. \n\nThe classmate that was chosen for me said she would like some dark twisted and deadly ideas.\n\nThe person who is chosen as the protagonist will be playing the game in front of the class.\nDoes anyone have any good ideas?
9pv8q9,I would like some feedback,My college professor gave us an assignment to create an interactive game. He chose a random classmate to be the main character.\n\nI have a couple of ideas.\n\nFirst.\nShe is trapped in an alternate universe where the nazis won ww2. She must break into a Nazi military base and rescue an Oracle so he can help her get back to her own universe.\n\nSecond.\nShe lives in a world where people know when they will die but not how. If they find out how they might be able to stop it. She finds out she has 2 days to live. She must figure out what it is and how to stop it.\n\nThe professor is going to get the person he chose as our characters to play the game in front of the class.\n\nWhich idea do you like better and do you have any ideas to elaborate on them. Or maybe completely different ideas.

9psrat,GAMESHOW - New(?) Game Genre mashup - does it suck? Twitch puzzle-solving mixed-media escape-room text-adventure,"I would like your feedback on a month-old project of mine.\n\nA couple of weeks back i spontaneously set up 7 cameras around my house and made a puzzle game for my friends to solve over twitch using the chat. Their chat comments would be spoken by my computer so they could interact with me and my alexa, solving numeric riddles in secret languages hidden in the different cameras and so on.  \nIt's a pretty rough and random idea, kind of like an escape room I've been told.  \nI think of it is a weekly mini-game mini-performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an unhelpful trailer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJob09Eu1vA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJob09Eu1vA) Episode 4 is tomorrow, (Sundays at 6pm Germany time, only lasts an hour) . You can play live here: [https://www.twitch.tv/stockdronefootage/](https://www.twitch.tv/stockdronefootage/)\n\nI would love your feedback! I don't know if i should include more puzzles, make each episode self-contained, or try to build up skills / skill tree and a storyline. The audience/players are always different, but I don't want the game to remain on day-0 level of difficulty..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently my primary focus is on creating a completely different UX / UI each week so the puzzle has a totally different feel/format - for example the first 2 episodes had lots of cameras, the 3 episode featured a looping video that players could control, pause, rewind in the chat and the following episode will again have an entirely different interaction style.\n\nAnyway I would love for you to swing by and drop me your criticism!

9ps4ry,A fighting game featuring all the characters from Platinum Games.,"Image a 3D fast-paced fighting game with characters like Bayonetta, 2B, and Raiden. Maybe they can even get Dante if Capcom is nice enough.\n\nI would image it to be like Final Fantasy NT where instead of a 2D plane the characters would fight in a large open area. It would also be cool if they controlled the same as they do in their respective games. Or at least as close as they can get while still keeping balance.\n\nThis idea literally keeps me up at night. I want this so bad!"
9pqb2d,"A unique RPG,","A RPG where fantasy classes are replaced with real occupations,\nExamples include:\n\nInstead of an alchemist you have a bartender, who creates helping and harming drinks, who upgrades into a mixologist that can used unique mixed creations.\n\nA replacement for lightning wizard,  you have the electrician using powerful electric attacks,\n\nIf you have any unique ideas,  post them in the comments."
9ppvq4,"A Game where you play as a Monster/Creature starting from baby and grow up hunting, fighting, and expanding your territory."," I was thinking about this earlier and realized I hadn't heard of many games that you actually play as animals, no humans involved. If there have been games like this, I don't know of any that became big name titles or have the mechanics I would be looking for.\n\nIt got me to thinking and I started putting together the things I would want to see in such a game. You can pick your animal class. Dragon, Sabertooth, Leviathan... ect. Options like some of the things you see in Monster Hunter. Choose the color of the hide or pelt, eyes, any colors that would be natural to that creature.\n\nStart off as a baby or a hatching and you gain experience by avoiding big monsters, scavenging for food, finding safe shelter to sleep in and not be attacked.\n\nOnce you get enough experience, you grow in size and can start fighting other creatures, chasing them off, and stealing their food.\n\nOnce a juvenile, you start to map out a territory you want, fight, chase off, or kill anything in it, but also if it is too strong, you run the risk of getting injured and having to try and survive until you heal. If the creature kills you, you drop back to the last save point, which would be a successful night of sleep. So serious risks if you try to push too far in one day.\n\nOnce you are an adult, you can fight most things in the game as long as you have good mechanics and fast reflexes, though injuries will slow you down and have a lasting impact until they heal, which depending on the damage, could take up to two 'in game' days to recover from.\n\nAs an adult creature, you can also explore and enjoy scenery outside of your territory, but run the risk of getting attacked by something very difficult fight and win against, such as a Sabertooth vs a Dragon.\n\nEach type of animal would start off in different areas and have its own pros and cons.\n\nLeviathan: Breath underwater and able to explore and enjoy a vast ocean and ecosystem, other monsters are massive and it's difficult to see sometimes in the deep abyss. Blood staining the water can obscure vision, so during fights you would have to make sure to change your position to stay out of the blood to be able to see.\n\nYou don't have to worry about other species invading your territory other than leviathans and possibly a Kraken, however you cannot go on land except for to coastline and a few islands, as you will die if you are out of the water for a set amount of time. However, there are lakes you could use to make your way inland to just explore and try new encounters, but it takes trial and error to figure out where they are located. If you make it to a different ocean, you have even more leviathans to fight and establish more territory.\n\nDragon: Start off in the mountains with less predators around, so it's easier to survive the night. Ability to fly only comes once juvenile level, and flight distance is limited to stamina. However, food is scarce and you have to travel further to find things to eat, which runs the risk of actually encountering the predators that could take you down. Claws and teeth and tail are your only weapons until you become an adult, and at that point you can breath fire. Flight as an adult allows for longer travel, but it you want to cross the whole game area, you would need to land and eat to recover stamina. Cannot fit into smaller areas and swimming is certainly out of the question.\n\nSabertooth: Some of the best speed and fighting skills. However the cub starts off in the middle of the forest area where there are the most predators and its hardest to find places to sleep. Night vision, so you can see much further at night. Climbing trees is easy and fitting into some smaller caves can save you if a dragon comes across you. Can explore the entire map easily, as it can both climb mountains and swim, but run the risk of running into much bigger threats. Adult could take down a dragon, but only if great skill is used and the dragon didn't fly away first.\n\nI can see the hunting working similar to going into a listening mode like the Last of Us. Then stalking up close enough to attack and avoid being seen.\n\nSleeping would be finding dens, trees, crevices, caves that allow for you to curl up away from the weather and not be found by predators.\n\nFights would be 'learn your opponents' style like dark souls or monster hunter. With the graphics being similar to Monster Hunter or better, going for the realistic vibe. You would get an alert each time something would cross into your territory. Sometimes you can chose the leave it and the creature just be passing through, or if you leave it along, you could find out your territory has been taken over, or it has shrunk down.\n\nYou can actually mark out your territory lines by claw marks on trees/ground/ocean floor\n\nNo micro transactions, and single player.\n\nOnce you complete the game as one class, you can chose to release that character into the wild and start off as a new one, however, chances are high you will run into the monster you created and its stats will be very hard for you to beat.\n\nI know nothing about creating games, so would this even be possible to do? The last part at least of incorporating your own creation into the next play through is what I haven't seen before. Or if it does exist, I haven't heard of it."
9plajs,A game that posits deep philosophical questions about the nature of control and human agency... but it's a crane game.,"This is a small, dumb game made for the fun of the developer mostly. The main hook of the humor is that the game acts like it's all deep and philosophical (replete with haughty quotes from philosophers, and pretentious words like ""postmodern"" and ""replete"") meanwhile the gameplay is about controlling a giant crane in a *Katamari*-sized world.\n\nThe game would take it **way** too serious. It wouldn't try to make the joke obvious. You'll get a black loading screen with white text:\n\n&gt; ""When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate."" —Carl Jung\n\nThen the game loads straight into a crane-game level in which you're trying to grab cows faster than a chibi UFO that's abducting them too.\n\nIn another level for example, you operate your crane to control a joystick that controls another carnival stuffed-animal crane game. *A game within a game.* Picking out several stuffed animals reveals another, Atari-style controller underneath that you can pick up. Then it goes super ham with another quote on a black screen:\n\n&gt; ""I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following."" —Mahatma Ghandi\n\nIt's just tongue-in-cheek humor poking fun at other games that take themselves way too seriously."

You can select these characters during a game and make them do various stuff just like in Sims. You do not have too much control, just enough to possibly make them survive. So you can't say directly ""go here"", but you can give orders like ""make coffee"", ""watch TV"", ""take a shower"", ""check closet weapons""...etc.\nTiming actions just right would help character to avoid a horrible faith.\n\nThere would then be various threats, a ghost, a demon, a serial killer,...so many possibilities.\n\nYour mission would be either to make the characters survive, even win the threat or at least make them last as long as possible (time score)."

9pgqrx,"A futuristic Sci-Fi shooter, with zero-g mechanics and heavily influnced by synthwave culture","(My idea! I’m calling this game Orbiter and I could really use help developing this. I’m just telling about it to get people interested)\n\nYou know in Battlefront 2 how there’s the TIE Fighter and X-Wing flying scenes? Imagine that but your in a spacesuit, jumping between individual rocks in a ring of Saturn, shooting enemies that are trying to do the same thing.\n\nZero-G shooting, Calculating jump trajectories between rocks and asteroids, shooting in a true 360 environment, it’s everything I dreamed when I first played Battlefront 2.\n\nWhen I say futuristic, but influenced by synth wave culture I meant that the game is set in the future. Earth is now a single nation, so they decide to focus more on colonization around the solar system, going as far as the Kuiper belt. A team of 20 travel for 30 years to the Alpha Centauri system in hopes of new land to live on. They find a nomadic regime that’s been doing the same thing as us. They acquire our technology, mass produce it, and decide to invade the Solar System.\n\nDani is a teenager on Mars, he decides to move to the Kuiper Republic in the outskirts of the solar system in hope of a fresh start. He finds an alien friend, a Kzinti (Kzinti are from Larry Nivens “Known Space” book series called “Man-Kzin Wars”) named Warrior. Warrior and Dani go their ways after making it to Kuiper City, and Dani gets a job and a place to stay.\n\nThat all changes when the Centauri Regime flies in with their super large battleship called the Corrector, and their large army. They blow up the city and arrest everyone who survived. Dani meets up with Warrior again, and they are told to either join their army or stay to die.\n\nIn training, Dani meets his squadron. Terra is a left-wing racist who hates white people, Hugo was a mining slave in Alpha Centauri who lost half of his face, he has a metal face with a camera eye. Bomba is obsessed with guns, and Condi is a dwarf who is wicked with a knife. Warrior joins the squad, and he is good with a spear.\n\nThey take over Pluto, Neptune, Uranus until Saturn. At Saturn they get a good fight, because the single nation earth got aid out to them before it was too late. But with a few planet shattering laser shots, the rings fall out of orbit and start bombarding the inhabited moons and rocks around Saturn. They decide to collect the rings of Saturn, and throw them into orbiter of Jupiter, which does major damage and is free to take over.\n\nWhen they get to Mars, Dani decides to run away before they get to earth, because they know earth will kill the Regime and all the soldiers they picked up. That’s where the player makes the last choice. Do they stay and fight, or do they run away and risk being wanted by the new powerful regime forever?"

9pag9i,An open world game inspired by Porco Rosso and Tailspin,"I would love a game set in a tropical archipelago, with a steampunk atmosphere and anthropomorphic animals (Think Final Fantasy 9, Porco Rosso and Tailspin), where planes are the main mean of transportation. The player could buy planes and customize them with weapons and gadgets or hire crew members with different abilities.\n\n There would be only cartoony violence and fights on foot might only involve melee or have wacky weapons that only stun the enemies. The planes would range from realistic WW2 fighters and seaplanes to giant sky fortresses. It would be possible to board enemy planes and assault them, by throwing harpoons with ropes to climb on.\nThe protagonist would be a veteran pilot sent to the archipelago to deal with the sky pirates getting more active in the area, making him a ""sky Corsair"". He'd get his plane destroyed and the goal of the game would be to defeat the pirates, rebuild the ultimate plane and deal with a crew of incompetent guys who get better and develop strong relationships with each other. Everything would be depicted as a light hearted, fun adventure with some poetry to sparkle things up.\n\nNow that I wrote that down it sounds a bit like AC Black Flag but with animals and planes.

9p91su,[Beginner] An anime RTS with heroes based army instead of unit.,"This crazy idea combine two major aspect that normal RTS gamers usually hate:\n\n- Anime aesthetic: I have seen plenty of player who dislike any kind of anime related on RTS game.\n\n- Hero based RTS: Some people really hate the RPG and hero mechanic which lead to MOBA style for a RTS.\n\nNote: This idea was meant to fill the niche interest of a smaller community as I believe some of us may like either two of those aspects I mentioned.\n\n1) Heroes Design:\n\nSince I wanted to give a good example I will use Warcraft 3 as an example for easier understand. Unlike RTS game with Hero like Warcraft 3 you only maintain about 2-3 heroes at the time and started to farm everywhere on the map. This game require you to use a lot of them but there is a few major different about them:\n\n-Those heroes doesn't scale, as they worked exactly like the normal units (albeit with a few active abilities). Basically you would have some worker hero who do the normal structure building like normal worker unit like WC3 Peasant. The role doesn't changed except for more ability instead.\n\n-No item, no farming, no level up. In order to upgrade your heroes you have to buy upgrade and upgrade them like the normal unit. And since there is no level up all of the heroes started out with the full abilities.\n\n-You can only buy one hero for each hero. It's mean you can create a huge army with a lots of heroes but none is the same as you can only have one for each. And once you lose a hero you cannot buy the same hero again.\n\n2) Economy Design:\n\n-Since I wanted to promote small skirmish over the large battle I wanted to find a way to force player split their force over many different location at once. For that solution I decided to follow Company of Heroes design. \n-By creating a map filled with multiple resource point to capture both player have to capture as many as possible as not only they generate income but if one player reached a critical mass of points they will automatically win the game. \n-This force player have to be very aggressive in order not to fall behind. Also, the map need to be filled with choke point for each capture point to promote defensive/positional heroes to shine in that role.\n-Also, player are still able to build structures for research, building unit or defense. And with the huge amount of heroes you would have even more ‘units’ to think of which force you to think what heroes is useful for each situation. And with the population cap you are not allowed to spam them but this also mean it somewhat reduce the burden of micro as microing and multitasking a huge heroes based army is extremely hard to do it.\n\n3) Aesthetic and setting:\n\nThe setting took place in a fictional world which follow Gothic aesthetic. The story would follow the Gothic Horror trope as it provide many different races and characters for the game variety (I prefer to choose Gothic trope as Medieval Fantasy seemed to be very cliché from what I experienced). \n\nAlso, here a list of pros and cons for this idea.\n\nPros:\n\n-Some people may love it as normally there is almost no anime RTS which is popular on the market.\n\n-Anyone who wanted something that is unique in term of playstyle with heroes instead of normal unit (even though this idea would not be good as intended depending on different people opinions).\n\n-And since the normal RTS setting are either scifi/modern warfare/world war2/cold war or Medieval Warfare/Medieval Fantasy the Gothic setting would be something less common than other. Again the setting would be a niche as well I think.\n\nCons:\n\n-Plenty of anime hater would dislike this idea. I don’t blame them anyway, people have different taste.\n\n-People who love traditional RTS with resource building, normal unit and a smaller role of heroes unit. My design goes completely against this common though.\n\n-Very micro intensive and require multitasking. Since my design goal already promote both of these casual player may not be happy with it.\n\nFinal Note: The reason for this design is because I wanted something new and different from the normal path of RTS game and it also comes from my own secret love for anime aesthetic as well."

9p1zls,Building-focused RTS,"In this RTS, players start with a headquarters building, which produces soldiers. As long as your headquarters is under your control, you can construct additional bases near any base you control, with a cooldown between each new building.\n\nSoldiers can be given orders to move between bases. This order can be undertaken over any range, but if at any point during their move they aren't within some radius of a friendly base, they suffer attrition and lose some of their number. If units arrive at a base of the opposing team they will fight the enemy soldiers (with the higher number of soldiers generally winning, though it takes some time to resolve) and capture the base, converting it to their side.\n\nBases can take the form of Barracks (produce more soldiers), Gun Nests (shoot at enemy soldiers as they are moving, dealing significant damage to attacking forces), Artillery (can bombard enemy bases at long range, killing soldiers on them), and Convoys (can move across the map while still functioning as a base, extending their team's field of influence)."
9p1tik,Money or Luck,"Money or Luck is a gameshow style electronic game. Whether online, at a casino, or at home with family, the premise of Money or Luck is simple. In front of you is a linear gameboard with an equal proportion of spaces with advantageous or disadvantagous outcomes. But instead of rolling dice or using a random number generator to navigate around the board, the probability of landing on an advantageous space vs a disadvantageous one depends on...\n\nLuck. An ingame value that is calculated depending on how much luck you've aquired or lost throughout the board. If your luck is high, you're more likely to land on lucky spaces, and if your luck is low you're more likely to land on unlucky spaces. \n\nBut there are also Money or Luck spaces distributed throughout the board, and this is where the real gamble comes into play. Money or Luck spaces give you the opportunity to roll an addition or subtraction to your luck \*or\* collect points. Its your choice, but you can only choose one. If you're happy with your level of luck, you can just sit back and rake in the points. But higher luck means a higher rate of lucky spaces, including money or luck spaces, and more opportunities to gain points. So the higher your luck, the faster you gain points, and if someone surpasses you in luck, that could mean losing your lead in a matter of turns. \n\nBut on the other hand, if you keep rolling your luck without collecting points, you could miss your opportunity before the time limit runs out. Money or Luck is a game about probability vs time, and learning how to optimize the choices available to you despite so many variables. \n\nInspired by luck stats in RPGs, this game tries to introduce a new element of chance to the traditional game board experience while also demonstrating how significant differences in probability really play out in practice in a fun and tangible way. Also, I can imagine a roulette version of this game that you can bet money on. "

This sets up not a whole lot of backstory but opens up tons to explore and do with talking to characters and much more.\n\nGAMEPLAY: alright if it didn’t hook you already it probably didn’t but if you are still here it plays like the sims almost with top down view but you do not use controls to click where you want to go but instead use WASD and normal move sticks. Keep in mind this is low poly graphics. You can interact with almost everything in the environment including talking to people which is the main focal point of the game as it leads you along with the player creating their own entirely unscripted story. Now when talking to a character say I choose insult then it will give me things to insult about in another speech web branching off letting insult their clothing or attitude or just try and call them out. And these will have branching webs aswell for complete control with almost 0 limits. And obviously you play through all 4 years of the game and past it into adult hood until you either stop playing or your character kicks the bucket. \n\nSTORY: You make it with no objectives as soon as the game starts you make your objectives like go to school (optional) or go walking around town or meet people or maybe even run away. It just makes for a really good fun experience. The game also will at times give you challenges that don’t pop up on screen but a character mentions that they will pay you back if you go get a soda from the vending machine for them and if you do they could lie and not give you the money or maybe give something better in return or whatever to be honest.\n\nAMBITIONS: \n1. The game should have actual voice dialogue but with the amount of dialogue options and reactions being coded in it would be a huge stretch\n2. Time periods for those who went to high school at different points\nIn their life you could play from 1980s to early 2000s with different models and trends in the game world giving a nostalgic and memorable experience with even more replay-ability \n3. Companion app to access the in game characters phone will away from the game or set reminders for the player to do when they hop back on the game so the player is fully immersed even when they are away.\n4. The game to be fully polished and finished by late 2019 to early 2020 or even sooner\n5. To be marketed well and do well within the gaming community.\n\nAnd if you fully read through this I hope it gives you and idea of what I’m currently working with and wanting to do also I started work on this gam last month only some gameplay is started map is being worked on models are being designed physics and bugs are being tuned and overall it’s being developed. But I want the holy Reddit’s opinion and words on this game. Thanks for reading :-)
9otgj5,Maze Simulator,"Bird's eye view, large cartoon hedge maze, 10 people placed randomly. There are multiple exits, you have to click on maze walls and rotate them to stop the people from exiting, kind of like the maze from Harry Potter. The whole purpose is to see how long you can keep them in."
9osuo2,Text adventure like Fallout Shelter mixed with The Walking Dead?,"Well this popped in my mind today. Basically what popped in is a Fallout Shelter like text adventure, where you manage a group of people, somewhat like in The Walking Dead where people have feelings, can get a bit crazy or do stupid shit. You send them to scavenge for food, weapons, medicine and anything they can get their hands on, look for new people to bring into the community, find other communites, organize wars, get attacked and do raids or be peaceful, build good defenses, try to build a good community with jobs, farms and assign people roles. All this while having the mental struggles in a brutal zombie infested world, where humans are an even bigger threat.  \n\n\nWhat do you think?"
9osnbq,"High velocity, absolutely bonkers arena shooter.","Its a velocity focused arena shooter based entirely around one idea: You are a walking target while on the ground. Not sure what that would mean, perhaps extra damage taken or very slow movement speed but, the point of the game is moving fast.\n\nYou have access to a huge map (maybe not detailed, but lots of space, think Zineth from arcanekids) that you can run around in, movement is incredibly floaty, but you can wall-run/jump and get access to many movement tools like a gun that propels you backwards, rocket boosters, grappling hook, etc.\n\nPlayers would get launched out of a tube when the game starts, starting them off with lots of velocity. Do to the futile effort of aiming at such a distance, most of the weapons would be AOE damage or some sort of homing projectile. Maybe air mines with a huge radius, a very high rate of fire hit-scan gun to chew through health. There could be source-esque air strafing, but also unique mechanics like utilizing the recoil of guns.\n\nTL;DR Tribes but most of the time your in the air and darting around the map at Mach 5."
9os2xw,Independent Horror Game Idea (Working Title),"**This is the summary for an indie horror game idea I originally had between December 2016-January 2017. It is currently in conceptual stages, with no current plans to start development. Feedback &amp; suggestions are welcome:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou play a drunk driver, an average self-centered man having just lost his job &amp; girlfriend, taking a back-road shortcut home while listening to radio when the signal acts weird, an eerie sound permeating the static. Suddenly, you accidentally run a mother and her child off the road before crashing. You wake up injured, exit your inoperable car and find the mother's empty. You attempt to call a friend with his tow truck for help but are confused at the lack of service. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don't want to contact 911 and be arrested for another DUI. People don't often pass by here either, especially at this time of night. Who knows how long it could take, screaming or waiting to flag someone down? Searching the mother's wrecked car, you spot a trail of blood leading off-road and guess she must have taken her baby through the woods that cut quicker to town. Not being totally heartless, you decide against your better judgment to look for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing the blood with your phone's light (limited battery), you explore deep forests, abandoned homes, an old mill, a park station and outhouses, spying more clues to their movements. You realize however, you are getting progressively lost. Though initially blamed on intoxication, the forest layout seems to be shifting like a Blair Witch-style maze beneath the moonlight without explanation. You notice strange carvings on some trees, doors and walls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou seek a signal or road in every area, the blood worsening as if something grisly happened. The baby's cries occasionally echo as if in peril from multiple directions. Birds, bugs and animals' sounds gradually leave nothing but the yells. Trees themselves change, slowly appearing smaller, implausibly humanoid. They eventually turn into crackling, shrieking creatures that will hunt you (Picture the body language of **Juon's** Kayako + **P.T.'s** Lisa + 2013's **Mama**). They have poor vision, tracking by sound &amp; body heat. You can find objects (branches, metal tools) to fight &amp; incapacitate them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut they feel no pain and you're already weakened from the accident. Any damage leaves you with less strength. Bright lights like fire, lamps (small safe-zones), or your phone's flash (at greater cost to battery) can also drive them back. Once your cell's dead though, there's no recharging. Keep track of which trees are dynamically morphing around you, as more creatures will emerge. You can sneak by them or disguise yourself by hiding inside rotting hollowed trunks (Only certain types of live trees morph, not all). Beware however, the more time passes, the more enemies you'll have to deal with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHiding won't work forever, as your body heat will at some point light up the trunk you're hiding in. Survive long enough to follow the blood and baby's wails to their source, and you'll finally learn what became of it and its mother, the secret behind all this moonlit madness. It's up to you to persevere through the night. If you're lucky, you may just come out of this SOBER (possible title). So, what do you all think? Linked below are images to help visualize what I'm envisioning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nr/https://i.imgur.com/gZBM0RS.gif **(Concept for tree-creature's body language)**\n\nr/https://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Creepy_f41911_5570867.gif **(Tree-creature's body language, entering attack-mode)**\n\nr/https://i.imgur.com/7XtQC7A.gif **(Concept for wall &amp; ceiling crawling spider-tree-creature's body language)**\n\nr/https://media.giphy.com/media/3MAKZ3ltN5Ttm/giphy.gif **(Twisted spider-tree-creature)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Facebook page for more details on the game idea:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/IndieHorrorStarter/?modal=suggested\_action&amp;notif\_id=1539107782355254&amp;notif\_t=page\_user\_activity&amp;ref=notif](https://www.facebook.com/IndieHorrorStarter/?modal=suggested_action&amp;notif_id=1539107782355254&amp;notif_t=page_user_activity&amp;ref=notif)"
9oowfq,Vehicle Assault Battle Royale,"Much like Twisted Metal, but without premade characters. Imagine a vast landscape and 100 uniquely modified vehicles from a list of about 30 different types. Everyone gets to add different things like rocket boosters, nitrous, armor plates, machine guns, paint jobs, trophies etc to their cars. And then clash it out in a large map with ramps, tunnels, mud, twisties, etc. Obviously different builds will have different control in different terrain, and you can change things on the fly to suit the terrain, like wheels and suspension. Im imagining rocket league in a map with guns and real physics. All complete with a large heavy metal soundtrack. "

9ogg5b,Any game ideas for programmers that aren't that skilled in art?,"I'd really want to work on something long-time (mainly a programmer and sound designer), but whenever I try something, not that my art is too bad, but I guess it's not visually exciting to people, I kinda give up after a while because it's too artistically exhausting to me. So if anyone got an idea, guess like Undertale or even something completely different that requires not much artistic skills for drawing characters, that would be cool to hear."

9ofhp8,A prohibition era detective game.,Similar to L.A. Noir but 20 years earlier. You'd play as a detective working in 1920s NYC sniffing out bootleggers. Some of your fellow officers would confiscate the alchohol for themselves and share it with the station. Detective Gameplay would be a series of puzzles to try and find evidence of alchohol and where it is hidden. Then you could also do raids on cellars and bars. Kind of an inverse of perspective to the mafia games.
9of3nh,Working on a fighting game,"I just like a little advise on some of these options for my character ideas. Which ideas between each character design sounds better?\n\n1. Should I go with a large human space marine fighter? Or a large alien space marine fighter?\n\n2. A Korean female cyberpunk singer that uses the power of her voice and a dragon staff weapon like a microphone? Or a mystical Korean princess from another dimension that uses dragon powers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Should I choose an ancient Greek Minotaur? Or ancient Sumerian Minotaur?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.

9o8bgi,HARMFZ: Real-time strategy game with 6 fiction themed teams.,"I want to start with this. Harmfz is not a real word (duh). It's an anagram for Humans, Aliens, Robots, Monsters, Fantasy, and Zombies. Harmfz is a real time strategy based game with different teams, like the aforementioned 6. You can build troops, buildings, and upgrade with experience.\n\n# Teams:\n\nHumans are like us humans with our modern militaristic technology. They are lead by Army Sergeant P.  Aliens are from a distant planet similar to earth, think the covenant but with war of the worlds mechas and sci-fi UFOs. Their leader is the Hive Queen.  Robots were created by Mad Scientist Dr. Steel, and are mass produced to follow his dictating. Their leader is Dr. Steel. Monsters are monsters created from classical works, like mummies, vampires, and reapers. Their leader is Dracula.  Fantasy is races taken from mythology and folklore, like Elves, Giants, Dwarves, and Goblins. Their leader is the Elven King. Zombies are a class of just the undead, even zombified animals! Their leader is Resurrector, a disgusting mass of zombified flesh. \n\n# Gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is comparable to Command &amp; Conquer, or Halo Wars. Players must build buildings, hire troops, and defeat others to win. Each team has aesthetic changes, but they play the same for the most part. Teams are composed of 11 classes. Here's an example.   \n\nFantasy:   Warrior: Armored Foot Soldier. Soldier: Elven Archer. Marine: Combat Wizards. Scout: Goblin. Defense: Ballista. Healer: Alchemist.  Naval: Hydra. Arial: Griffin. Transport: Dwarven Land Vehicle. Tank: Giant.  Hero: Dragon Rider.\n\n# What I need:\n\nIdeas for more classes.\n\nIdeas for 2 more teams.\n\nA better sounding title."
9o6kcb,RPG where you finance equipment instead of buying it outright,"I've noticed that games never allow you to buy anything on credit even though people do it in real life all the time for cars, houses, education, startups, and plenty of other things.\n\nWhat if you had an RPG where you had to take out a loan to be able to afford your starting equipment? Like with interest, regular payments, and everything that would come with a real world loan. Ideally, the game would be set up such that you'd probably be in debt for the entire game because your gear is just so damn expensive. Like with cars, you should be able to trade in one piece of gear for another of the same type, using it as the down payment. And you'd probably have a credit score that affects your borrowing limits and interest rate. Unlike cars, gear wouldn't really depreciate.\n\nIt would probably require an in-game calendar system to work properly. Reposessions and collections would be something you'd have to work out more details on so that they don't softlock progress or cause a game over."
9o4weg,PAX Plays Pokemon Go,"Okay, this is sort of a cross between a game and an event; it would only work at a big nerd conference like PAX. It has three layers.\n\nFirst, you have some (probably pre-existing) game with a limited set of controls and no real-time components. Ideally it would also be a 2-player game, or a game with multiple outcomes, so players could compete with each other over the result they want.\n\nSecond, you have a Twitch Plays Pokemon meta-game, where players can collectively contribute to the madness by issuing commands, some of which will actually be accepted and executed by the engine.\n\nThird, you have those commands be entered through an app that includes GPS info, and you assign inputs ""Strength"" as a function of their GPS location. Stronger inputs are more likely to actually be registered by the engine and entered as commands into the base game.\n\nI'm imagining it as ""hotspots"" being randomly generated on the map. The closer you are to a hotspot, the more your vote counts for, but hotspots are depleted by use. The only way for a player to tell where a hotspot is is by gauging the strength of their current guesses, so you have to hunt for them warmer-colder style. Teams would then want to move around the area finding hotspots to give them greater influence over the game.\n\nThis could be fairly disruptive to the con in question, but I think that by adjusting when/where the hotspots appear, that could be limited. (For instance, keep them away from areas that are already too crowded, or make them only appear during hours when the major events aren't taking place so they don't compete.)\n\nI think it works a lot better if there's some reason for the players to be on competing teams. I don't have a good game in mind for that, and I'm curious if you have any suggestions. "

9nzfn9,Cooperative Hybrid Racing/Fighting game,"TL;DR- you and a partner race Big Mac trucks towing important cargo, they’ll only accept one shipment however so it’s up to you and your partner to be the first ones to arrive, or the only ones to arrive with cargo. \n\nPlayer one plays like a typical racing game, you’re just racing big unwieldy trucks with trailers attached. The maps aren’t really tracks, you’re mainly racing on barren freeways out in different climates. They’re sprint races so it’s just going from A to B.\n\nPlayer two’s job is to keep the other player twos from detaching your trailer from the truck, while also trying to detach their trailers yourself. Player two functions more like a platformer, they ride on top of the trailers and can jump, block, and attack. When you attempt to detach the trailer it enters a quick time event that can only be interrupted by another player two or special power ups activated by player one. You can also open the back trailer door and cause them to lose cargo, this won’t disqualify them when they arrive, but it will lower their overall score while improving your personal player score. The first player can use erratic driving to make things difficult but it’s largely the second players responsibility to clear the deck so to speak. \n\nScore is determined by things like how much time it took to reach the finish line, power ups used, cargo lost, and how many times your player 2 died. \n\nIf you show up to the finish line without your trailer you’ve essentially lost. That is unless you managed to also remove your opponents trailer, then technically your all losers, but a winner is decided by who has the highest score and if you played well then you’ve still got a chance. \n\nThere are two kinds of power ups. Red and Blue, all must be driven over to pick up. Blue pick ups are for player one, these are temporary things like boosts, better grip, and stuff to help defend the cargo should your player two be occupied, for instance say someone’s in the quick time event to detach your trailer but your player two is doing the same elsewhere. If you get a Tesla pick up you electrify the trailer and interrupt the quick time event. I say they’re temporary because once used they disappear and you’ll need to pick up another.\n\nRed pick ups on the other hand are for player two, these are more like tools. Some are temporary, others can be used indefinitely until you decide to drop them. Player one cannot pick up anymore red pick ups until player two has used up their tool or discarded it. There’s pick ups that give you a shield, a grappling hook, mag-boots, banana peels, a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, an auto-harness (basically if you get knocked off it automatically shoots out a grappling hook from your waist and reels you back in), and food which you eat to regain health. \n\nPlayer two is effected by inertia, they’re not just walking around like normal up there. You’ll need to communicate well with your driver or you may get caught off guard by a maneuver. Falling off kills you and you’ll need to to wait. You respawn inside the cab of the truck and climb back out to the trailer, the climbing bit isn’t controlled by the player it just adds a little time to the respawn. \n\nSo far I can’t decide if this game should be like a fight just between two teams of one driver, one fighter, or if it would more exciting to take it into a battle royale direction where you’ve got like 40 trucks all rushing through the desert, banging into each other with people fighting on the tops. Seems far less feasible, but the idea intrigues me. What do you think?"
9nz4yg,Police vs Robbers (Open World),"I have a game idea for open world game &amp; I believe it can turn out to be amazing game.  \nI wanna clear one thing it is an open world online game, but you can play it offline too but with some limitations.  \n\n\n**Things you can do offline...**  \n\--------------------------------------------  \n1. roaming around the city  \n2. driving cars, bikes, boats, swimming, sailing, etc...  (you get the point)  \n3. visit game shops and play games.  \n4. attacking or killing people or doing other crimes and then getting chased by AI police. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Things you can't do offline...**  \n\-----------------------------------------\n\n1. visiting the mansions that you have bought online because you can only buy them online and visit them online.   \n2. doing missions / heists  \n3. buying new stuffs or customizing existing ones.  \n4. playing with friends  \n5. visiting online only places  \n6. taking part in online races, competitions etc.  \n7. earning more money\n\n  \n\--&gt; All above limitations can be changed (open to ideas)\n\n  \n**////  Things you can do online?? (Everything, except visiting other people's house if you are not attacking them)**  \n\n\n# Now lets get down to the the whole idea of this game.\n\n    Imagine having an open world where you have multiple people roaming around online, they are either a member of robbers group or police squad. \n    \n    They can't attack each other if they are not on a mission/heist but they can surely see each other doing different activities. \n    \n    If you try to ram your car into others who are online then you will just pass through them because you can't attack them and the reason is none of you are on a mission.\n    \n    Even if you are on a mission or heist, you can't attack the people who are not on the same heist as you are. You need to join the same heist that they are on to attack them or fight them or help them catch/stop robbers if you are on a police squad.\n\n\nLets say, there are multiple heist on the map that you can take part in but some of them require you to be on a certain level. Let's say, you've just joined the game and few other players like you have also just joined the game and all of you are on 0-level. So, the only heist you all can take part in are those who are available for those on 0-level.  \n\n\nNow, you go to your map and you select one of the heist/mission &amp; you start the heist. It can by heist of anything, like a bank heist or it can be something like doing a robber in a house of someone rich,  etc..    // open to ideas  \n\n\nOnce you have started the heist, you are given the location and time to complete the heist. While you are doing that heist other players who are searching on a map for the heists that are currently going on or the players who are walking/driving by the same place where you are doing the heist can press a join button to join you. (There is no limitation on how many people can join you) and if you are successful, the money will be shared between all of you.  \n\n\n# Now, lets move on the the Police part.\n\nWhile you are doing the heist, the people who are in the police team/squad are also roaming around the city. They can search for heist that are currently going on and join in with the defending squad to stop the heist. Even if no one is defending the heist &amp; you as a member of the police squad who happens to pass by a place where the heist is going on then you can take on it as well by yourself and wait for others to join you if they choose to.  (You can send like some help signal throughout the map, so that other police officers roaming around are notified that you need some help)  \n\n\nIf you are successful in defending the heist then you get a reward from the police department and it is shared between all of you. You can get the reward similar to the reward of the heist that you've defended. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now, lets get down to what Robbers &amp; Police Officers can do with that money?\n\nWell, with that money robbers or police officers can buy mansions, buy new guns, new clothes, cars, customize your character or cars, mansion, make it more secure &amp; guarded, etc. Also, you can hire some guards to protect your mansion. You might be wondering why I need guards to protect my mansion?? Let me explain.  \n\n\nYou have to stashes inside all of the houses that you own &amp; you can store money inside a stash in your home because if you don't store that money in your stash at home then every time you die, you will lose 15-25% of what you currently have in your pocket.  \n\n\nBecause you have money stored in your house/mansion, police can attack your house anytime to take that money back that you have stole during heists. So, you need guards to protect your mansion &amp; money. You need money to make your mansion more secure and guarded with latest weapons that you buy.  \n\n\nNow, you can also call for help when you are being attacked by the police and other robbers might come to help you.  \n\n\nBut police or robbers can't attack each other's house to steal money while they are on a heist or already defending one of their mansion/house. Why is that?? because they won't able to defend their house when they are on a heist so it seems fair to only allow it when they are not doing any heist.  \n\n\nHmm, police attacking your house whenever they want doesn't seems to be fair right?? Well, lets make a rule for that as well. Lets say police can attack you 2 times after your last heist and once they have attacked you 2-times regardless of whether they were successful or not, you are out of the wanted list and they can't attack you anymore unless you do more heist. (Seems fair now??)  \n\n\n# Now, you might be thinking what about houses/mansions of the police officers? can robbers attack their houses too?\n\n  \nYes, robbers can attack the police officers house too to take the money back that they stopped them from having by make their heist unsuccessful. But there is a little difference, unlike police officers who can attack the robbers house 2 times after their last heist. The robbers can only attack officers house once(1). I think officers need to focus more on defending the city then defending their own house.  Also, unlike robbers who lose only 25% of their money, police officers will lose 50% of all their money when they are attacked by robbers, only if robbers were successful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, it seems fair to let robbers only attack police officers once and let police officers attack robbers twice.  \n\n\nOhh and one more thing, you can ask people to move into your house and all of you can store your money into that house, Its like making a team and doing heist together and storing your money in the same house.  \n\n\nBut you can only takeout the money that you have stored, you can take the money of other members in your team. Lets say you have a team of 4-people all living in a same house and storing money in a same stash. Now, lets say player-1 stored $500, while player-2 stored $1000. Now if player-1 goes to take out his money from the stash, he will only see his money which is $500. So, the money of player-2 is safe for him to spend it however he want to spend it. (But when police attacks and takes your money, all the team members will lose the 25% of their share of money)  \n\n\nAlso, the people who help you against attacks, show up in the menu on your helpers list. Why?? It is because when they need help from you, you will know they helped you too.  \n\n\nI hope I'm able to explain my vision correctly, Its too complex for me to explain it but I've done my best to explain it in the best possible way. Also, my native language isn't English so forgive me for the grammar or spelling mistakes.   \n\n\nHope you liked my idea of this open world game......

9nw425,"Mother Nature Restoring Equilibrium - A game where you play as a virus, animal or weather events to stop the threat of human pollution which will kill the earth eventually.","Mother Nature Restoring Equilibrium.\n\n\nSomething like spore, but better and longer. Online maybe.\nHumans are the virus destroying the global ecosystem, so Mother Nature fights back.\nYou are against the clock. Humans are infesting earth and destroying it (pollution), and will eventually do it unless we stop them.\nHumans can advance their technology to improve their defense against our attack. With more advanced technology, the earth destruction rate is increased(more pollution). \n\nWe can choose from several different animal classes, viruses or other microscopic life, evolve them into new species and improve to better deal with the threat of humans destroying the planet.\nA recreation of our livelihood with animals and nature in general, but from the POV of animals, weather phenomena and disease factors taking a piss on humans or utterly trying to annihilate the human race. Restoring ecological balance on earth by controlling the output of human interference on earth's health.\n\nImagine a mix of Plague, Inc. Spore and an RPG. You can play as a single strain of a virus or bacteria and work to infect and kill more people on the micro realm. Control a virus strain and infect millions.\nOr you can choose to evolve into an animal species and play as a saber tooth or a herd of mammoths and work to kill thousands of humans on the macro world. There can also be an option to choose to play as hurricanes or tsunamis, meteors or massive volcanoes, (with proper in-game balance) and wreck havoc on whole villages or civilizations of humans. For massive scale destruction.\n\nIt wouldn't be 100% realistic since the time scale that permits evolution in species would also mean that humans can evolve in the same sense, but for the purpose of this game, we can overlook this.\n\nI think it would be a very difficult game to pull of, but a fun one to play nonetheless. It would also be extremely educational, because you can get a really good sense of our footprint when you have to fight against it.\n\nSo, what do you think about this? Do you have any suggestions? Feel free to use any of the above for yourself. Cheers"
9nv8jn,E-boxing League,"**Name:** E-boxing League\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A competitive boxing game. Gameplay breaks down into two major components. Managing the fighter in a real-time/idle environment and one on one ring fights. \n\n**Plot:**\n\nWho cares where you came from or what you did in the past. All that matters is the path ahead and your dream to become the best boxer in the world. Workout, eat, sleep and practice. This is your mantra and nothing will stop you. \n\n**Setting:**\n\nThere is no real setting to this game. The game turns a boxing simulation into a competitive e-sport. So, in a way, the setting is the player. \n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Every created fighter starts off with the same stats. You can customize the appearance of your fighter as you please, but it will not impact the game. \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Moving around the ring is done with WASD. \n* Dashing is done by double tapping WASD keys. \n* Looking around and aiming punches is done by moving the mouse. \n* Punching is done by holding the left mouse button and dragging in distinct patterns. \n* Blocking is done by holding down the right mouse button and anticipating the incoming blows. \n* Bobbing and weaving is done by holding down the space bar while moving the mouse into the direction you want to bob or weave. \n* Most of the mechanics above can be combined. You could block and dash, to get close to your opponent without taking too much damage. Or you could weave while punching, to increase impact. \n* Everything you do consumes stamina. Bad things happen when you run out. \n* Some regions on the body hurt more. If you get hit there, you can get injured or risk a knockout. \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Without a doubt, a big aspect of the game is Fighting. However, your fighter won't last a single round without training. You manage your fighter's training schedule. You determine what exercises to do and when to do them. You tell your fighter when to get up and go to bed. You also decide what to eat and drink. Everything will have an impact on how your fighter will develop over time and what strengths he/she brings into the ring. The more dedication you show here, the higher your fighter's stats become. Slacking off will impact stats negatively. You need to set a new training schedule every day. If you don't, your fighter will take the day off. Dedication is key to success, just like in real boxing. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* Definitely PC and very likely consoles too. \n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Build-in tournament managing and broadcasting tools. Similar to what is done with Dota2 and CSGO. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nIf you use my idea, please put me in the credits. Also, donations are always appreciated. "
9nuw5y,Fighting Game that rewards creativity and adaptability.," **30 seconds read**: A game that where you can create the skills and abilities for your hero (without grinding), and place them against someone else's hero on an 1v1 fight, rewarding your creativity on design skills sets and your adaptability on fighting against an unknown enemy.\n\n**7 minutes read**: The game offers a sandbox of hero creation. You receive an equal amount of, lets call it “balance points”, and you build your hero in a tool that offers a wide range of possibilities. Examples:\n\n*A hero that has 3 powerful skills;*\n\n*A hero with 10 weak skills but has more flexibility on fighting;*\n\n*A hero with very powerful stats, but weak skills;*\n\n*A Classic hero with 3 average skills and one very powerful;*\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYou can choose an element for your hero (fire, wind, poison, water, etc) or maybe two or three elements using your “balance points”. The player can also distribute the points in the skills, choosing for damage, cooldown, speed, range, aoe, buffs, debuffs and so on.\n\nMy idea is a fight that lasts 5\~10 min, so the player could study the movements and skills of the enemy, and have a time to adjust its playstyle. And for that, an HP bar that can sustain this fight duration time. That game ends with one hero dying.\n\nSome inspirations that could help the visualization of the game:\n\n* Naruto 1: IMO, the best part of any fight in that anime is the characters trying to figure out their enemies, testing its abilities and their reaction to theirs. My idea is simulate that with this game.\n* Naruto 2: the skills of the characters obey some rules (at least in the beginning of the anime), so you can understand with easy whats is going on the fights, the jutsus are very well understood and typified. There are the elements, the energy to use them, the time to cast, the weakness, and other sort of rules. My idea is that the tool to create your hero's skills in the game also obey specific rules.\n* Dota 2 and LoL: While the idea is not a 5v5 game, is important that even in a 1v1 there is something going on in the map, some objective so the fight doesn’t turn in an evade and sneak game. The playstyle of point and click to move is interesting for this game.\n* Dark Souls: The stats of your character is complex in Dark Souls, the idea is to make the point attribution more simple and impactful.\n* Dragon Ball: all the attacks in this anime has an physical impact on the enemy and on the map. My idea is that powerful skills in the game could make the enemy fly away from the impact blast of skill and a few seconds to recover from the damage, so that the skills has some weight..\n* Overwatch: every skill has to be aimed. No point and click on target skills.\n\n**Final Disclaimers:**\n\nI’ve been thinking in this concept a lot for the last 2 years, and there are many, many other things that i’ve thought about it. I’ve actually started working in it, with the Dota 2 workshop custom maps, but I had to stop due my inability of understanding the visual effect creator, and that the Arcade in Dota 2 is dead now, every update in the game breaks all the custom games and very few people play there.\n\nI don’t have the time to learn or create a game in other platforms, but I WOULD LOVE PLAY THIS GAME. And that is why I’m sharing here. All thing considered, I guess It’s sorta of an pvp RPG game, but without the grinding which nobody really enjoys as much as the action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the bad english, and thanks for reading. I would love to know what you guys think about it."
9nujex,Sonic game idea,"I've always wanted a sonic game where Dr. Eggman steals your hability to run at the speed of sound, now, you cant, and neither your friends, I dont how, I dont know why, but It would be interesting to learn again this habilities just like in metroid, \n\n\n"
9ntl1z,Interresting..... maybe,Okay so yes another battle royale idea.  People love the genre but there's games that have better features in them that should be implemented.\n\nOkay so I dont have a world to se it or a style of game for artsy looks but a basic idea.\n\nMake a battle royall that lasts an hour or 2 per round. The idea consists of a leveling system where you spawn in and have a time period to level up and collect loot. You can learn abilities by random spawning npc's that's would aid you in battle with buyable items from farmed materials or points earned. Loot consists of weapons or armor you can acquire from monsters and anything else you may kill other than PC's \n\nThe pvp aspect comes when random spawns around the map create a death zone or whatever where you can choose combat early or avoid if you'd like. The combat zones encourage people to fight early on by dropping better loot or having a reward for entering and engaging in combat.\n\nThe map would shrink in size while still adding pvp zones more and more often until the map is small enough to allow an all out battle.\n\nCharacters can have a chosen class before beginning a game weather it's a more stealthy option or a more barbaric or even a casting class. Each with an advantage and disadvantage changing a starting basic load out.\n\nRaw idea a friend and I were talking about and a bit different that the normal BR'S we've played and a combination of different games we enjoy. Thank you guys for hearing it out and pick away=)

9njadn,RPG Sim idea...,"The game would be a combination between an RPG and Sims(but not Sims Medieval)\n\n----You fight, explore, do quests, but there are multiple storylines. The story shifts based on your decisions, so no two players will ever experience the same story.\n\n---- There are evil beings, but you can choose to either destroy them for cash and glory, let them be, or even ally with them. You can even become evil and use an army of monsters to take over the world..\n\n------ Customized homes, pets and summoned creatures(eg: skeletons, werewolves, etc) for wizards and dark Ash Maker characters. Buy stuff(like a Sim game)\n\n----- Seasons. In time, the game will form seasons, it will snow or rain. \n\n----- Specific holidays, based on game lore, you can take part in. Specific quests around these events.\n\n----- The ability for game makers to keep improving, adding stuff via expansion packs or DLCs that can be constantly released and sold.\n(more as I get new ideas) "
9niri0,A 3D Puzzle game with time as a main mechanic. Any suggestions?,"I recently came up with the idea of a puzzle / platformer with time as a main mechanic. For example you could throw a box, and then stop time so it freezes in midair, and then use it to jump over a large chasm. Or you could press a button, run over somewhere, and then rewind time so it acts like you just pressed the button. ( the player is unaffected by time stopping / rewinding ). Do you have any ideas on more mechanics / things to make the game more interesting?"
9nfdkd,An asymmetrical multiplayer Scooby-Doo game (Like Dead By Daylight or Friday the 13th),"I posted this on /r/Scoobydoo because I was bored so I figured I would post it here too.\n\nThis is a random shower thought I had while playing Dead By Daylight and I just wanted to share since Scooby-Doo games aren't really in high demand. The concept is basically the same as DBD or Evolve in that it would be a 5v1 (Or 4v1 if for some reason Scooby himself isn't playable) asymmetrical multiplayer game. Obviously there wouldn't be any blood or gore and it would be very kid friendly because I doubt Warner Bros. would allow that, and it wouldn't really be Scooby-Doo if it was rated M lol.\n\nI imagine the maps would be decently sized and feature tons of secret passages and what not with places to hide (Like closets in DBD). Instead of fixing generators like in DBD to win, I would have it so the gang has to collect a certain amount of clues randomly scattered across the map to deduce the monsters identity. After all the clues are found the next step would be to capture the monster with a trap and if you successfully capture him/her and remove his/her mask, you win. I'm not really sure how the monster should win, but maybe if he/she scares your character enough they are incapacitated or something lol (Instead of killing them). If anyone has a better idea I'd love to hear it.\n\nLike most multiplayer games I think every character should have unique abilities and perks to add depth and strategy to the game. I don't think monsters should be limited to certain maps as that would probably make the game more predictable.\n\nThis is just a fun idea and I personally think it would be cool to see as there aren't many Scooby-Doo video games out there and probably won't be for a long time. Would love to hear your thoughts on this probably dumb idea for a game lol. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: You could even have different costumes for some customization."

9nce4r,A Lobby based mmo aRPG with gear crafting instead of pre-made gear Also human controlled raid bosses.,"I have been mulling over this idea for ages. I want to make a top down game that plays like Diablo III but instead of bosses and mobs dropping gear, they'll drop crafting pieces. Like their skin, bones, and armor pieces...\n\nThink Diablo III meets Monster Hunter. However, instead of long dungeons or long boss fights like those two have, they would be relatively short and sweet. Which encourages farming and grinding. \n\nYour character starts off with nothing. You don't choose a class or anything. As you play the game you gain the ability to make the kinds of weapons and gear you think will fit your playstyle. \n\nRaid bosses, which would happen every few months or so, would be controlled by someone in the development team, or a top player, or even a guest in the studio. The raid would last a good few hours, and the boss can move freely as the controlling person sees fit. \n\nI would also want it to have a destiny feel. As in you are part of something big. You are one of many potentially powerful warriors that you could team up with to protect a main hub city from horrors. This city has all of your blacksmiths and tradesmen of all types, and the wild world outside has the resources they wish for you to procure. Or objectives that need to be done. \n\nThere's a lot more I've been thinking about, such as details, the world, lore, and aesthetic, but Im pressed for time as I type this. So if you have questions or concerns, please let me know and I would love to answer anything. Criticisms are absolutely welcome, as it helps me reshape or rethink what I'm doing. "
9na2iv,Game idea that needs to happen for so many no matter the technology,"So in a sense it's not my idea and I don't know how many people have stated this but Sword Art Online (SAO) I would garrentee that millions of people would rather have SAO now on PC or console (console preferably) then wait 10-20 years till it's out on full dive if it comes out, so I would say Activision, Bungie, EA, Bioware Ubisoft, Gameloft. And many more should ban together to make this massive project that will take 5-10 years to make on a budget of over $800,000,000. And then latter on convert all information and base environment with the addition of the new tech application and the data of all senses, then program the new interface and hitbox rework. Doing this will one make the number one MMORPG of the year award for at least a three year run. Once the success has confirmed on the PC/console, and the tech has finally started to be tested humanely and applied how I've stated you are garrenteed to save a summed up total of over $650,000,000. And will have made the start of the SSS game franchise, and start the blueprint for more SSS games to come.\n\n\nPlease leave your comments down below and if possible share so this can get out there and get to the named companies/publishers above.\n\nJK Silvers"
9n844g,An actual board game version of Cultist Simulator,"For anyone who isn't aware, [Cultist Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718670/Cultist_Simulator/) is a computer game that's shown as if it's a card game, but it has tons of timers and using cards together and such that makes it impossible to actually make as a card game. That and they never explain the rules and leave you to figure it out yourself.\n\nHere's what I've thought of. The game comes in an ornate wooden box that doesn't seem to open. In order to play, you need to get it in the dark. When the box opens, there's a few fake candles with LEDs providing red (or possibly yellow) light and a play area with a pentagram or something to place them on. As the game advances, the LEDs can change color, revealing different things on the play area. It might have blue for some kind of dreamscape and green for showing some kind of tentacled horror. And maybe a red too if yellow is the normal color. Since it doesn't allow outside lighting and the LEDs only emit that particular color, you won't notice the multicolored play area until the candles show that color. Adding yellow could be a problem since you'd need to make sure the red and green inks don't reflect any yellow and the yellow ink doesn't reflect red or green, but it would make things look nicer if you could find something that works. This would apply to some of the cards too. For example, maybe you'd find a lore fragment, but you don't see the text until you dream.\n\nEach of the candles has a barcode reader in the base, and the cards all have barcodes along the bottom, so you can place them under the candles to use them for some kind of ritual. Or maybe just have a camera that can see the play area and use QR codes or something, which would probably be cheaper. The game tracks what cards are in play, and the candles go dim if the card under them is supposed to be discarded and can't be used. The game also scans cards as it deals them, so it knows what's in play. It would be nice to have some other way to use cards for mundane purposes, since using health and work to mean doing manual labor as some kind of ritual is a little silly, but I'm not sure how best to go about that.\n\nThe game starts off without time being an issue. Maybe when it deals cards, it lets you pull them out and then deals the next card. But some cards are time-sensitive, and when you draw that card a timer appears and starts ticking down. I was thinking it would be really cool to have a secret section pop up on the top of the lid so the momentum from that would shut the box just as a sort of jumps care. It also might have it so when you start involving eldritch abominations you get a timer in some made-up system, so you can clearly see that it's counting down but it's not clear how much time is left.\n\nThere'd also be hidden compartments that open as you advance the game. Maybe something where once you get deep into lore it lets you draw cards from there. Possibly one opens with extra candles to allow for more complex rituals, but either you'd need really small candles or a hidden compartment too big to be subtle.\n\nIn addition to different colored lights, there could be some stuff written with fluorescent ink that's only visible under ultraviolet light, and maybe some stuff with polarization filters where you have to get a card that's some kind of magic monocle or something and the card has part of it cut out and has a polarization filter there so you can read that.\n\nThere also might be narration that plays when you draw cards, which could hint at what you're actually supposed to be doing with the cards and make it less confusing in an unplayable sort of way. And some notes on the back of cards.\n\nIt would be somewhat feasible to make a virtual mock-up, though it would be kind of pointless since if it's on the computer it has no real benefit over the actual Cultist Simulator game."
9n7ysm,RPG Gameplay Idea: Random Adventurer,"Basically, the game is a CRPG with whatever rules you want to use (Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity)\n\nThe core gameplay is, you are not the special. You are not the Dragonborn, the Watcher, the Chosen Special, the Herald of This Useless God etc.\n\nYou are just a random adventurer awaiting for the right party to join. You can tackle quests/bounties with something akin to a pub group, then disband afterwards. This can be expanded by some team members willing to betray you, additional drama\n\nAnd then there comes the party with the Chosen One. However, there are different groups who has the Chosen Ones and the groups have different disposition/ideals/follows this type of god that may cater to the roleplaying experience of the player.\n\n- The objective of the game is to help these factions to defeat the big baddie/prevent apocalypse. How the game ends depends on how the parties have progressed to their story\n\n- It is possible for the other parties to be in conflict with others. In such case, you may change alliance and betray your current party, or fight alongside them or resolve the conflict diplomatically.\n\n- Each party has their own standards. A team of Spartans expect you to fight in formation and may cast you aside if a party member has fallen, or a Thieves Guild expects you to be able to steal gold given a quota everytime they go to another town and may prompt to kill you if you fail to avoid witnesses.\n\n- Bounty hunters can be assigned to track and kill you depending on what you did."

9n442a,A voxel game in which blocks rain from the sky.,"The core of the game is like trying to survive at the bottom of a Tetris chasm in 3D. Block shapes keep falling on your Minecraft-like land, and you're looking for climbable routes to higher elevation without getting crushed.\n\nYou start in an almost flat voxel world, but as block shapes come down, the world begins to take shape with uneven mountains, valleys and cliffs. The idea is that each run would end up looking like different worlds. If you die, you start back at the bottom.\n\nSome of the blocks that fall are loot chests containing randomized weapons, powers and equipment to help you up (such as hammers to break stone blocks, grappling hooks, hover-jump powers). Other blocks are a variety of monster spawners.\n\nIt rains block shapes in waves of **storms**, between which are calm periods to gather yourself, resupply and reach higher elevation before the next storm. Some storms are pretty light, with plenty of loot and few monsters. Later storms are *cataclysmic* and will test your limits. If it's been too calm for too long, the next storm is probably going to be a real slobberknocker. At certain points, instead of a storm, there will spawn a world-level boss monster.\n\nThe theme is similar to the ""forgotten memory pit"" in Pixar's Inside. The gods of your world have wrongfully deemed you useless and discarded you into their junk dimension. You are climbing out to prove your worth and to get back home."
9n2pz9,A third person stacking shooter,"So it would be a third person shooter where you play as different versions of Russian stacking dolls.\nPut out 2 teams of 10 on opposite sides of the map the objective would be to score 3  final stack characters.  In order to get the next larger stack u would need the previous one.  Each stack would have it's own abilities and when u died in a higher stack u go down one level leaving your newest stack in its place.\n\nExample team : Pirate's\n1st:Scallywag-dagger, weak pistol\n2nd:crewman-better pistol, throwing knives\n3rd:Mate:rifle, AOE whiskey fire belch\n4th: Captain: blunderbus,parrot that drops bombs(would act similar to a boomerang)\nFinal stack:Pirate ship: would act as a slow vehicle, a ram on the front, side canons, mortar shot, and swivel cannons that teammates could mount to help defend\n\nSo in the example there would be three Ships behind enemy lines, all 2nd through 4th stacks would be randomly dropped around the map. Players would have to find a 2nd stack then a 3rd and so on until they could score the 3 final stacks.  This leaves strategy open maybe you want to rush the final stack to try to score quickly, or maybe you play defense.  Kills will yield non win condition bonuses, and deaths will cost one stack as well as increased respawntimes. \n\nThe whole thing would be kinda toychest style where all the characters are just dolls come to life. As you approach the next stack it would look like a wooden stacking doll then u hop in and it morphs to life.  There could be so many versions for different teams\n\nARMY \n1st: green army man: pistol, knife\n2nd: rifleman: rifle, frags\n3rd:sniper: sniper rifle, c4\n4th:super soldier: shotgun, gas grenades/ mask\nFINAL STACK:Tank: standard tank cannon, ability to call airstrike (high damage,  lower speed)"

9mwj74,"What happens when you turn on friendly fire, put 4 people, several dangerous items, traps and monsters, and a door to freedom where ONLY ONE PERSON CAN LEAVE AND REAP REWARDS? Find out in a game called THE DOOR.","A 2-D platformer game where a procedurally generated dungeon that kinda looks like Speunky's various levels. It is very expansive, and spawns you at the top, giving you an objective to get to the bottom and go out the door. It takes about an hour to beeline to the exit. And about 2-3 hours if you explore the entire dungeon thoroughly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour strangely desperate travelers are dropped into the entrance of the dungeon, and with a final wish of luck, set off on an adventure. Enemies and death traps are common, and some of them either need a specific item to unlock/pass or even the teamwork of multiple people. Every adventurer starts off with a backpack that can hold up to 5 items, as well as their machete. Your machete applies hit-stun and knock back, which allows for you to engage in a Smash Bros. type fighting style with various weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember though, friendly fire is turned ON. And sometimes, you and your adventurers will find that you disagree with each other, and a melee brawlout will break out. Once an opponent/hapless victim of accidental death is dead, they can be resurrected using your ankh. Each adventurer has an ankh on hand that can only revive someone 3 times per game. Die four times, forget to send your party a friend request, then you are removed from the game and will likely never meet them again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a door at the bottom of the dungeon. A door which has a stone wall that closes when one person enters it. The person who exits it will receive a cool skin/hat, while the others? Nothing. It doesn't give the person who recieved the skin/hat an advantage, but rather a status symbol of being the one to reap the rewards of four people's effort. The hat given to you is based on how well you and your team worked. If you killed all of your teammates and entered the door alone, you will be given a hat that marks you as a murderer. A good teammate that works together and is elected using the in-game poll system gets a hat that marks them as a person worth spending time playing a game with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nItems in the game are plentiful, and they can be weapons, futuristic devices, enchanted items, books of knowledge, all that kind of stuff. Here are some examples of what you might encounter, **by order of rarity, with the last being the rarest item in the game**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Grappling Hook:**\n\nUse your mouse to aim. Can attach to any surface up to 15 units away and pull you towards it. Attach to allies to pull them towards you. If equipped with feather boots, you will instead pull yourself to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Feather Boots:**\n\nFall slower, and also enables double jump. When activated, you pull yourself towards allies with a grappling hook. You can deactivate the item with E.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Martial Arts Scroll:**\n\nA scroll depicted many useful images of people not agreeing with each other in the most violent manner possible. Gives you +25% damage on your current weapon, and also offers a longer attack combo for melee weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dusty Revolver:**\n\nPew Pew.

Pick him up and throw him, and on contact with any surface or mob, it will extend its spikes and deal 10 damage to them. Hitting a pufferfish will also cause it to puff up. There is a 10% chance that it will do a super puff, which makes it expand to 10x its size and deal 30 damage to anyone caught in its wrath. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shopkeeper(Neutral):**\n\nA shopkeeper that lives in a family-owned business underground. In a dungeon. You can buy things from him, but steal his items or hurt him, and he will chase and hunt and (maybe) kill you.

But if a player tries to go through it, it will eat him, deal 50 damage to him, and then spit him back out and start teleporting around the map, trying to consume your squad by appearing where walls should be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ghron Kahir(Hostile):**\n\nA red door with a skull knocker marks the entrance to his personal dungeon, where you can fight him to get an extremely rare item: His head. Which grants you the ability to zoom out and see the map further and predict obstacles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the point of this game is to have fun, don't kill each other, laugh at hilarious deaths, and by ALL MEANS.

9mmc7a,Music games that aren't DDR-like,
9mm8ti,A kinect fitness game that combines aerobics with puzzle solving.,"Nobody likes to exercise. Aerobics videos in the 80s tried to make it fun by giving you hot people to stare at and a beat to move along to. But what if instead of motivating yourself to exercise, you distracted yourself instead? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine an intellectually stimulating brain teaser or puzzle game that you can only control by taking on certain aerobics positions. The tutorial would instruct people properly on exercise technique, even though the kinect will only be looking for certain shapes. But instead of focusing on getting fit, or all the carbs you're going to be able to eat now as you count down the seconds, imagine just getting lost in one of your favorite games instead. Spending hours doing crunches, jumping jacks, balancing, or running on the spot without even thinking about it. It may be difficult at first, but it'll get easier over time as the player gets better at the game while also getting more fit at the same time. "
9ml7sj,A horror game that has the same uncomfortable atmosphere as a nightmare. It abuses your expectancy of jumpscares and has a samey feel to Doki Doki.,"I got this idea from a dream I had a couple weeks ago.  It was about some 3D platformer game where, every once in a while, an unrelated low-poly video appeared that me genuinely scared, but not because of sheer disturbance or surprise - Kinda a mix of both.  It's difficult to explain, but it put me in a state of mild shock, then magnified this state by making a jarring noise, and following that with the animation models becoming extremely, rapidly skewed.  It's like using a mild jumpscare to get you to think that the horror is already over once it began, then topping that jumpscare off with an even more horrific one that catches you off-guard.\n\nIt was the first time I woke up from a nightmare feeling more happy than scared.  I just...appreciated what my mind did to me.  I admired its approach to terror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'd want this take to take a similar approach to the surrealism of nightmares.  While I love me good jumpscares, enemy chases, hiding from enemies, and gore, what takes the cake in a horror game for me is exactly what Doki Doki Literature Club did.  It was normal gameplay in the second half, but it had you on the edge of your seat for fear of what random, unsettling events occurred.  Imagine this, but taken to the extreme - and mixed with my idea of layering jumpscares with jumpscares.\n\nAs for the actual genre, it might work best as some sort of Platform Adventure game.  The game would work have you play normally, but occasionally, you'd hallucinate and have accurate depictions of nightmares.  However, you can't tell the difference between the real and hallucinatory worlds."
9j66zb,Post apocalyptic 3 faction survival,"So this game would be set in a post apocalptic world where 3 major powers went to nuclear war and basically leveled the world with nukes, barren cities would lay waste while there would be 3 major factions fighting to gain control, the world changes with the previous weeks outcome and territory control, You can team up with friends to ambush enemies, You can also destroy entire squads by destroying a building they are hiding in or completely level a city block with the help of a few explosives in properly placed areas. \n\nThis game would create a long time to make, but it would be interesting to see if this would even be possible with current technology, If you think anything should be added or changed please comment "
9j5rxk,Junk Ship Space Battle Royal,"Here is my twist on the Popular Battle Royal Genera.\n\nPlayers operate a small salvage drones in a 3 dimensional space junkyard. Ship parts are scattered about the junkyard that fall into three basic categories: Armor, Engines, and Shields. As the player flies close to a ship part, it will adhere to their ship forming one of several pre-selected ship designs. \n\nMore successful players will end up have larger ships which will make them easier to spot but harder to destroy. If enough components are destroyed the ship will automatically revert to a lower tier configuration. The player can also jettison parts to revert to a lower tier configuration. \n\nIn addition to finding parts scattered about the play area , Jettisoned parts or the wreckage of dead players can be harvested to build your own ship.\n\nThe pre selected Ship designs will determine the number of weapon/engine hardponts, speed/maneuvering values, and the hit boxes for the ship. The ships progress in tiers with the previous tier being the core and the next tier up having a layer of structural armor that  engines and weapons can attach to.\n\nVarious types of weapons will be scattered about the play area, if the player's ship is at capacity for weapon hard points they will have the option of jetisoning one weapon for a newly encountered weapon. An optimal weapon queue can be set by the player so that the game will automatically swap weapons if a preferable weapon for the player's play style is found. There will not be super weapons so much as large ships having the ability to shoot many small weapons simultaneously.\n\nOther than that,  Battle Royal Genera rules apply: Last man standing, shrinking play area, ect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9j4hax,Mobile Laser Game,"Online mobile game where there are three teams (Red, Blue and Green for now).

9izrsr,"An fantasy arena game where you must fight against other players along with a buddy. You can fight together with an ally, but you two will not truly be fighting together...until you fuse.","I know. Steven Universe, but what is original about this concept is that. You will always be paired up with a buddy in this game. 10 players(20 people) will be dropped into a top-down 3-D arena where they must capture objectives to gain points and win the game. A mic is strongly suggested, if not required to play.      \n\nThink of it as League of Legends. You have 4 unique abilities you can play for each of the 10 champions available, and your basic attack is an attack that is...well, pretty basic. A swing of a sword, a shot from a gun, etc. But where the real fun begins is when you fuse with your designated buddy.       \n\nOnce you fuse with another player, you will gain a whole new set of abilities, combined health, and will be significantly stronger than two player that are separated. The downside to this is that, when fused, one person is the designated aimer and another is the mover. The aimer aims all abilities but has to depend on the mover, which moves the character around, to position the champion. You can switch places by pressing TAB. Both players need to confirm a place switch.      \n\nOh. Did I mention that even though you only have one ally, you can make new ones? Fusions of 4 to 5 champions at once won't be rare, and the only way to beat them? It's to fuse with your enemies. Because when you can't beat your opponent, BECOME YOUR OPPONENT.      \n\nWelcome to Fuse Arena.     "

9ix77f,"Open world survival-stealth game, where the biggest threat isn’t enemy guards, it’s your incessantly growling stomach.","Before I begin, I’d like to think such a silly concept warrants an equally silly explanation.\n\nI haven’t yet had the opportunity of playing a Metal Gear Solid game, but I am aware of their high status among most gamers, and hope to someday be able to experience one. Anyway, I was watching someone online play Metal Gear Solid 3 for kicks, and he was doing normal MGS stuff; taking out bad guys, sneaking around all quiet-like, but he was interrupted by a strange, sudden noise. \n\nHe thought it was an alligator; it was actually Snake’s stomach growling. And it was *loud.* But how did something with the intensity of, “a dying cow,” as it was described, not even alert the nearby guards? Why include such a mechanic if it’s not a prominent gameplay feature in a series well known for stealthy play? Throw a new aesthetic theme, some open world fun, and viola! Probably the best worst idea I’ve ever had was born.\n\nExplore the ruins of a kingdom lost to the forces of a dark demon lord, leaving hideous monsters everywhere in his wake. Steel thy sword, sharpen thy arrows, and prepare to defeat the evil demon lord. But wait! You totally forgotten to pack a lunch! That’s kind of a problem, especially considering the monsters are much stronger than you. Many of them can demolish your frail character in a single hit! So, how do you get by them? Well, there’s a few ways...\n\n**Pay attention to your Pressure bar:** There’s no way to satisfy your... probably unhealthy hunger here, rather, you have a Pressure bar! Uhhh... how to explain this?? You know that awful, tight, pressing feeling you get in your gut before it starts rumbling? That’s basically what this represents. The higher it is, the quicker you must react, lest you let it reach the top and risk being heard.\n\n**Crouch:** Pressing the crouch button will *usually* muffle any suspicious noises. *Usually.* Hopefully...\n\n**Limit encounters to large groups:** As scary as it may sometimes seem, avoiding small monster bases and infiltrating larger ones may be beneficial. With so many bodies, it may be difficult to track down the culprit.\n\n**Creatures with bad hearing are your friends:** Pretty self explanatory.\n\n**Cause a distraction:** Throw a rock, yell, stealth kill a monster, whatever you need to do to keep them preoccupied while you steal DELICIOUS TREASURE.\n\n**Just tank it!** With good equipment, you can just kill the monsters yourself. Of course, it still depends on monster, terrain, equipment, etc. etc.\n\n**Run/Hide:** If you feel unsafe, you can try running or hiding as a last resort. Only use this if absolutely 100% necessary, because if the monsters see or hear you running, they will chase you RELENTLESSLY.\n\n**Ask Macho Man Mack for help!** You know those mechanics in some Mario games that basically beat the level for you if you die too much? Same here. Die too many times, and pro Monster Hunter, Mack E. Ronnie can assist you, for a hefty price. He can’t do anything to help your voracious hunger, but he can get a few of the enemies out of your way.\n\nAnd there ya have it, my best worst idea. Hope it was a fun read."

9irdt7,A game which is a fusion of an MMORPG and a battle royal,"this is not a completely finished idea but I would like anyone's opinion on what I have so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nan mmorpbr which is a massively multiplayer online role playing battle royal. The game would have a big hub world where players can chat, trade, shop and form parties with each other. For the gameplay there would be a randomly generated map where you can play alone, with a party or online where you can travel the area and hunt people as well as monsters which will drop weapons and in game currency. if you play this mode offline then the drop chances will be severely lowered. When playing online the drop chances will be normal. In the open world area if you choose to play online you will be able to encounter other players that could be in a squad together or even be solo. When fighting the monsters in the open world there will be a minimum damage number to receive rewards which means that you will have to do a specific amount of damage to the monster to get the reward. This will be in effect for a short time after the damage is done as you could get chased away after doing lots of work to damage to the monster as this is an annoyance, so if you are chased away and someone else finishes of the monster within this timeframe then you will receive a reward as well. It will most likely not be as much as if you had killed it yourself but this way everyone who participated in the fight will get some sort of reward. There will also be a regular battle royal mode where you can use guns that you have looted and purchased to beat all the other players and win a reward, this will most likely be lots of in game currency or maybe a gun. For the character creation i want the players to be focused on the physical attributes as this will determine what kind of weapons they can use. If you use a small character you will only be able to use smaller guns and the larger characters will mainly use larger weapons."

9ildzh,Character ideas for my fighting game (sorry for the confusion),"I had to redo the post cause I had some wrong information on it and it was not properly flared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a futuristic, horror, martial arts, fantasy setting, which are the best choices?\n\n1. A modern Italian witch: better if she was trained in, savate, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu and trained by her father who was a GIS Italian cop combined with her magic? Or just relies on her magic with no martial arts training? Or screw all this and just go for her being some outerworld/otherwrold other dimensional non human character from some magic dimension?\n2. A possessed scarecrow: better if he was just a regular scarecrow from rural area of the South from an old creepy farm? Or was based on some Japanese mythology where he was a samurai warrior in his passed life and now his soul is trapped in a Kuebiko Japanese scarecrow?\n3. A combat soldier: better as a Korean spec op soldier? A Filipino spec op soldier? Or an American? And better as a male or female?\n4. Ancient pirate creature: an ancient soldier/warrior who was cursed an immortal by the King to live and serve him through eternity of wars and only wars until one day after centuries of battles and conquests up until the Golden Age of piracy the warrior is swept into the sea, reawakened millennium years later and somehow his magic merged with the sea, half mutating him into some shark/kraken features. Now would this be better if this ancient soldier/pirate first started out from ancient Mesopotamia/Assyria under the rules of an Assyrian king? Or from ancient Ireland under the rules of an Irish king? And keep the pirate merged with the sea creature idea or make them both separate characters?\n5. Nurse and doctor team: better if they are both psycho martial art expert killers from Indonesia with silat training combined with their medical training? Or American psycho killer nurse and doctor with no martial arts and just their medical training?\n6. Thai twin fighting female assassin: one twin sister will represent a scorpion motif. Is it better if the second twin represents a spider motif? Or a wasp motif?"

The Shaman Girls go to the lair of said insane mad scientist to rescue the Holy Cow.\n\nThe Shaman Girls will wander through various tech-themed labyrinths (e.g.: CRT tubes, particle accelerator, microwave oven, etc.) and hack various terminals all over the lair with various themes (e.g.: Social Media, Video Sharing Website, Science Forum, Anonymous Image Board, etc.).\n\nThe Shaman Girls can collect some useful gadgets from the lair that can give them various abilities like terminal hacking, double jump, fog grenade, super attacks, magical girl armor, etc. to help them search the lair.

9ibn78,Idea for an open world sandbox game with many modes (Like Sandbox meets Team Based FPS),"This game is set in the 1900s, with massive pollution forcing humans do go to war with each other for resources. It's every squad for itself. (Think: BF1)\n\n It's a 6 v 6 game with different game modes. \n\n\n\nIt has 6 classes. \n\nThe Rifleman is armed with a semiautomatic rifle, a autorevolver, and a bayonet. His signature move, the Bayonet Charge, insta kills anyone unlucky enough to be in front of him. \n\nThe Signaller is armed with a Flare Gun, an autorevolver, and a long wooden pole. His signature move, the Support Signal, allows him to summon different types of support, be it gaseous cocaine which gives everyone +20% reload speed or artillery support, which instakills everyone in its area of effect. \n\nThe Nurse is armed with an autorevolver, a medikit, and a bonesaw. Her signature move is the Field Hospital, allowing multiple people to heal at once. She is also the only class that can regenerate health independently.\n\nThe Marksman is armed with a scoped rifle, an autorevolver, dynamite, and a dagger. He has two signature moves. 1) Camouflage. He is completely invisible when he moves. 2) Precision Elimination. He can take out targets further as compared to the Bolt-Action, but has a slower reload speed as compared to the bolt-action. His ability to sneak up behind people can also be used to assassinate for example, say a Gunner with his dagger or spawn kill enemies with dynamite \n\n\nThe Pioneer is armed with grenades, a flamethrower, and an axe. His signature move is the Airblast. He can set people on fire, reflect projectiles, extinguish people on fire, and deal damage through afterburn. He can also deal a lot of explosive damage! He is also the fastest character in the game, but has the lowest health. \n\nThe Gunner is armed with an automatic rifle, an autorevolver, and a small log. His signature move is the Mow Down. His machine gun deals a lot of damage at a very fast rate. He also happens to have armour on, giving him additional health. However, he has the largest hitbox amongst all the classes. \n\nWhat makes this game different. \n\n- Morale \nIf a player keeps respawning, the game will gradually become harder to play, with things like jams, flinches, and the inability to move properly and the inability to use signature moves happening when morale gets lower. \n\n- Bleeding out\nA player will die if he or she gets shot and does not seek help immediately. \n\n- Different weapons. \nThe Flare Gun is the perfect example of the uniqueness of this game's weapons. You can summon different types of support. You can have weapons that fire faster for lower damage and greater damage fall off, and etc, etc. \n\n- Skins. \nI mean everyone likes weapon skins right?\n\n- Perks\nHow about lying down to make you flinch less and shoot more accurately? Or perhaps a decrease in reload speed? An increase in jump height? \n\n- Vehicles\nLike GTA, but set in WW1.\n\n- Buildings.\nLike Fortnite, but with respawns. \n\n- Crafting. \nYou can create different weapons with the weapons and tools you already have!\n\n- Cosmetics. \nNot just hats or shirts. You can mix and match! How about a bikini for the Gunner?\n\n- Field Camp\nLike Fallout 4/Metal Gear Solid 5, you can buy cosmetics/items that actually serve a purpose to build your base camp. \n\n- Game Modes.\nWe have Loot the Airship, where squads of 6 can kill each other to grab as much loot for them and their Field Camp. We have Industrial Waste Management, which forces groups of 60 to play either as the Wasted, super powerful, melee damage dealing zombies, or your typical 6 man squad. If the Wasted are stuck in respawn by the end of the timer, the Humans win. If there are no Humans left fighting the Wasted by the end of the timer, the Wasted win. We have your Escort the Gold mission, your typical 6 v 6 payload game. We have the Destroy the Radio game mode, similar to your Capture the Intelligence game from TF2. Also, like Fallout, you and your squad can destroy the bases of other squads, and so can your base be destroyed by other squads. We also have minigames like Dueling, where your squad can challenge another squad to see who can kill each other the most number of times before the timer runs out, or Yoga, a button mashing game to see which squad can react to the in game screen the fastest, hunting, lumberjacking...There are also many quests and achievements you can collect. Ooh, and Battle Royale.\n\n- Taunts, emotes. \n\n\n- The Day of Debauchery \nFor 24 hours, all admins will not monitor whatever happens in the server. This mean all actions, even take against the Moral Law, something that all squads must abide to (no cyberbullying, no teamkill, no griefing amongst clan members (a clan is made up of more than one squad, no killing of admins, and etc) can be completely ignored. It's just like the Purge, but in a video game. \n\nAnything else I can implement?\n\n"

The tribes are unique, based off of real life cultures, and their inventions will reflect this.\n\nAs the game progresses, your technology becomes more advanced, with items like metal tools, and guns. The tribes also develop at varying rates, depending on their population, meaning that you have to compete with them to gain supremacy.\n\nYou can form your own tribes to aid you, as long as you give them protection, food and water in return. They can eventually develop into an entire town or city, once they gather enough resources.\n\nThe main idea of this game is that you develop through various eras of technology, even the more obscure ones that most games skip, eventually achieving modern technology, and perhaps even space travel, however, unlike most games it should reward players for cooperating and does not force you to focus on mostly combat focused inventions.\n\nAs the game progresses you can make things like airships, nuclear reactors, and even establish a space station, if you have the technology.\n\nFeedback would be appreciated."

9i3ajj,"High graphics Apocalypse zombie/mutated creatures game that turns day and night, searching for supplies, survival, and you only have one life throughout the entire game. If you Die then you start from the beginning!!!","&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe name of this game would be STAY ALIVE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMY INTRODUCTION IS Imagine an apocalypse game which in the past has scared and thrilled you while playing, but after you die in this game you have to start all the way from the beginning. This makes those thrilling moments 1000% times more intense knowing you have one life and makes you treat it well like its your real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE MAIN CONCEPT of this game would be to not do anything you wouldn't do in real life. This means no running into a house or old abandoned shack without investigating the area of hazards first. Collecting as many resources possible to carry at all times, walking cautiously in an undiscovered area or territory, staying alert in your surroundings at all times, paying attention to sounds, a lot of stealth tactics, walking silently, crouching, hiding, crawling, and if spotted panic running and screaming for your life. There is no strategy of dying your way through this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE DIFFICULT CONCEPT of this game would be a non-adjustable setting and you could die only if doing something stupid or making a mistake that could cost you your life. The difficulty during the beginning of the game would be fairly difficult during the tutorial or training to give the player the feel of what they are up against which most of the dying could occur at this time in the beginning which then starts you off at the beginning of the game after dying. Then after the beginning part the difficulty would decrease seeing that you have only one life and begin to progress into the game. The difficulty level would then begin to increase slightly all the way to the end, but the increasing difficulty shouldn't be higher than what it was in the beginning. So you could die only if you are completely careless or do something unrealistic to yourself that you wouldn't do in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSOME SCENARIOS IN-GAME would be zombies, advanced zombies mutations, old abandoned hospitals with infected, old abandoned school with infected, old abandoned town with infected, old abandoned city with infected, highway travels into different areas, underground sewers walk through, running from helicopter search squad which shoot on-site or call for re-reinforcements to arrest you or kill you onsite, ground search squads patrols which shoot on-site, other survivors which capture you and you have to escape, day time and night time zombies with different abilities and mutations. Some tactics can be to use the zombies or the patrols or other survivors as distractions to fight each other while you escape or to complete your objective to progress further into the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCONCLUSION is that there will be many jump scares in this game so play at your own risk. you will have allies and enemies in the game, and survive in your forts you build, or find, or take over, but stay safe, stay alert, STAY ALIVE!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9i2o30,Prison Escape for Virtual Reality,"One of the downsides of VR is loading screens, and that means standing or sitting while something loads. This gave me an idea: What if you were in a prison (probably medieval era) and you had the option of escaping, or perhaps, multiple options of escape?\n\nAt the core, this is an escape-the-room type game, but with several ways of escape. However, a roaming guard will come by your cell every 5 minutes or so, and if he sees you doing something sketchy, he will come in and knock you out. When you wake up, whatever option you were trying to do to escape is now blocked, and you cannot attempt it anymore. For instance, if you had dug a hole in the ground, and you were caught, the floor would be layered with cement when you woke up.\n\nAchievements would be earned by completing every escape type, and there would be an achievement for waiting out your sentence.\n\nA lot of the game would be exploring your prison cell, finding loose bricks, or possible being able to take a part certain items in your cell.\n\nAnother idea would be the ability to pass notes to other prisoners. If they are friendly, they may respond with hints, or materials you can use.\n\nLooking forward to feedback."

9hx9sx,My perfect mmo rpg,"I’m on mobile so I did not proofread this, so there are spelling and grammar errors probably all over this. Sorry for that. \n\n\nStarting off it would cost a lot of money and time to make this game. I don’t ever see this game happening but it would be my perfect mmo rpg. \n\n This game is splits in to three game that you would have to just buy one. The version of the game you buy would be the starting point for the player. The three games should be thought as countries than separate games\n\nThe first game is focused on magic, if you play magic based characters in rpg pick this one. The idea would be a magic school where the players is trying to learn more magic. I would want the play to be able to make any kind of magic they would like. \n\nThey would use spell book the make the spell before fights and they would use a bookmake to change load out in combat. How making spell would is like magicka. You pick an element (water, earth, wind, light, fire, dark).Then then a target (self, Area of affect, straight line, Single target, object). The a school of magic (conjuration, distraction, creation, healing, etc.). Out of combat you would mix those together to make a spell. So a level  one player will be able to pick the elemental like fire and do an aoe fire attack. As the level up they get more elements and more schools a magic and more targets. So the same player at mid-level player would be able to mix wind and water to make ice healing magic. A top level player would be able mix light dark and earth to make some kind of magic. With this I think you could make any kind of magic user you would like.  If the player wanted to used magic armored  close range fight or back row conjure they could be. Their would be thousands of spells, balance for this game will be impossible lol. That basic idea of combat of game one. \n\nThe reason why their are there are three game is because I think put all of that would confuse new players because the other two games have different mechanics but all share the same world. It’s also part of the story too. \n\nThe second game would be where the people normal play fighters and Warriors would pick this game. This one is about bonding with weapons and serving a queen as a knight of a kingdom. This game set up is like the army.\n\n \nThe third game would be where people who play assassins, rangers, Samurai, archers etc. would pick this game. This one is about using ki energy    and martial arts. This some is set up like different mob families. \n\n\nPicking one game does not stop you from playing as the other class. This is mostly pick the starting point. If you pick the third game and wanted to play in the first game, you just have to travel in game to the magic college. \n\nIn the beginning first months of the game the worlds are separated (kind of). Like the magic college will be located in the desert that is protected by a field force field that keeps you from getting in until later on in the story like a month or two after the games are released.\n\nI can go over the other two game more later someone would like but for now I’m on mobile and I’m sleepy. I also hate big walls of text so I’m going to stop here. "
9hwvz7,First-person shooter/Stylish Action game with parkour and time manipulation,"This might sound kinda stupid, and it might not even work too well, but I wanted to see what people think, so fuck it, here's my idea.\n\nI was thinking of a game that combined the parkour mechanics of Mirror's Edge with the speed and combat mechanics of games like Zone of the Enders and Max Payne.\n\nSo, you'd be traversing a semi-open environment with fast movement and basic parkour mechanics (wall-running, pole swinging, sliding, etc.), but when combat initiates, your distance determines how you engage the enemy, just like Zone of the Enders. For example, when engaging enemies from long range, your attacks are always based around guns and throwing weapons like knives, while close range revolves around using blades, blunt weapons or martial arts. But in order to potentially help long-range combat, you'd use mostly one-handed firearms (pistols, revolvers, SMGs) with auto lock-on, while letting you keep your current speed instead of forcing you to slow down like Mirror's Edge.\n\nAlong with that, the player would also have bullet time like Max Payne. So, to let you get off more precise shots during long-range fights, you could activate bullet time and slow down your movement, but aim in real time, allowing for more accurate shots while keeping your current momentum. Refilling your bullet time would be accomplished by killing enemies inside and outside of bullet time. You can also use it during close range combat, but there it would work more like Bayonetta, where dodging an oncoming enemy attack at the last second (in first person there would be an indicator for where an oncoming attack was coming from and how close it was to connecting) will slow down time for a short period (7 seconds at max, but keeps decreasing the more you use it). Along with that, there would preferably be an option to switch to third-person for close-range combat.\n\nIt's a very rough idea that needs improvement, but that's what I got so far. Feel free to suggest improvements to this idea if you want."
9hwo0w,"Math-based 2-player ""chemistry"" game where each player takes turns adding one of their bottles of liquid to a tube with the goal of making their specific pattern of fluids appear (&gt;using the raising and lowering properties of liquid&lt;) (LONGISH)","This will take some explanation to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for the 1% of you that clicked this tread after reading that enigmatic title, I have a puzzle game for you.  It involves two players taking turns selecting bottles of fluid to add to a tube, or potentially any one of multiple tubes.\n\n*The goal of the game?*  **Have your given syntax of fluids appear in any one of the tubes.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Translated?*  **If you are given the order of fluids as A, B, then C, where the terms are each different fluid types, then you must make the order of fluids appear in that respective order from bottom to top.**\n\n`Example: If you are given the order of Green, Red, and Blue fluids, then you must make it so that Green fluid appears at the bottom of the pattern, Red in between, and Blue at the top of the pattern.`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Part 1: What are the mechanics of the game?\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nThere are five types of normal fluids.  Green (Grheensity), Red (Ruddy Acid), Blue (Cobaltic Acid), Yellow (Sparklium), Purple (Vio-Latte).  Patterns can consist of any three of these.   There are no practical differences between these fluids.\n\nHowever, these fluids come in six varieties: Positive, Negative, Multiplicative, Dividing, (rarely) Logarithmic, and (rarely) Exponential.  ~~I know this sounds like some kind of educational math game so far, but hear me out.~~\n\nThere also exists a special variety of fluid: Mixture Liquid.  There can be Lightweight mixture liquid, which affects the uppermost liquid (no matter the fluid type), and Heavyweight mixture liquid, which affects the lowermost liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only that, but every single bottle of fluid has a random integer assigned to it.  This is the number to add, multiply, subtract, or divide by, or the number to be raised to the power of, or the base of which to logarithmize by. (In the case of the latter two, the integers are 2 to 4 for exponents and 2 to 10 for logs)  So, what bearing do these integers impose?  **For every fluid put into a tube, there must be an amount of fluid in ounces.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a fluid has more ounces than another liquid, that fluid will lower itself to the position below that liquid.  Use this mechanic to create your pattern of liquids, or to disrupt your opponent from making their pattern!\n\n`Example: If there are 10 oz of Grheensity and 5 oz of Ruddy Acid, and you aspire for Ruddy Acid to lower itself, then add your Positive bottle of Ruddy Acid that bears an integer of 6 or greater to the tube.  5 + 6 &gt; 10.`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 2: What challenge does the game impose?  How is it played?\n\nAs stated previously, each player takes turns selecting from a range of bottles to add to a tube.  The challenge comes in managing the bottles that are presented to you, as they are like cards: They are randomly assigned, but you must only play the cards that benefit you the most at the moment.\n\n`Example: A Positive bottle will benefit you more early in the game than a Multiplication bottle, since a small number plus a moderate amount is usually larger than a small number times a small amount.  3 + 20 &gt; 3 x 3.`\n\n`However, the inverse is true later in the game.  50 + 20 &lt; 50 X 3.`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd suggest that 4 to 8 bottles are presented at a time, and that, each turn, a player can sacrifice their turn to completely reshuffle the options they are presented with.  That way, more decision comes into play: ""Should I save a rare exponential/logarithmic bottle for later in the game, or reshuffle my options to try to get more useful bottles right now?""\n\nAlso, I'd suggest 2 to 3 tubes to add fluids in, just to add more decision-making strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 3: Finally, an example match.\n\nFor exemplification purposes, there will only be one tube, and this will be an exceptionally short match.\n\nPlayer 1 (Alph) has been randomly assigned the pattern: Grheensity, Cobatlic Acid, Sparklium\n\nPlayer 2 (Bill) has been randomly assigned the pattern: Ruddy Acid, Vio-Latte, Cobaltic Acid\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: If a fluid has the same oz as a fluid below it and is descending, then it doesn't submerge beyond that fluid.  Vise versa for raising liquids.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Alph adds +10 Green  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bill adds +20 Purple.   The order is Green over Purple, or Green &gt; Purple.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alph adds +10 Blue.  Blue &gt; Green &gt; Purple.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bill multiplies Blue by 2.  Green &gt; Blue &gt; Purple.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alph subtracts -10 Heavyweight mixture liquid, affecting the bottom fluid, which is Purple.  Green &gt; Purple &gt; Blue.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bill adds +50 Red.  Green &gt; Purple &gt; Blue &gt; Red.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alph exponentiates Green by 3.  Purple &gt; Blue &gt; Red &gt; Green.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bill divides Green by 4, but to no avail.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alph adds +20 Yellow.  Purple &gt; Yellow &gt; Blue &gt; Red &gt; Green.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlph achieved his pattern of Yellow on top of Blue on top of Green, and, therefore, wins.  The final ounce values are as follows:\n\n10 oz. Vio-Latte &gt; 20 oz. Sparklium &gt; 20 oz. Cobaltlic Acid &gt; 50 oz. Ruddy Acid &gt; 250 oz. Grheensity\n\n# Final Notes\n\nIf this were a mobile game, I'd imagine the player would get rewarded proportionately for just how much they won, whether it be in a currency or in EXP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd...uh...the game itself probably isn't as ambitious to code as, say, the ""multiplayer RPG roguelike firstperson shooter but it's like Pikmin"" others here are demanding, but it probably ain't too simple either.  Intermediate it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***^(ALSO, THE GAME WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE A BATTLE ROYALE MODE.)***"
9hvn49,"Spiderman VR, a great and horrifying idea","I feel like a VR game with Spiderman mechanics would function very well. Rarely do you ever go very far on foot in Spiderman games, instead using web based transportation, landing you in a relatively contained area to beat up some loose mooks. All together, I think it would work pretty well for VR, getting around many of the problems of locomotion usually experienced. The only problem I imagine would be the inevitable moment of complete panic when a person accidentally falls from a building. Probably more than a few people would actually not want to play the game on account of this. Regardless, would probably be a pretty good game."
9huap9,Journey to Paradise,"TL;DR- A game that focuses on characters, their stories and their relationships to each other, they’ve banded together to travel to the legendary paradise at the edge of the sand-sea desert.

So two siblings, a brother and his little sister, have saved up their whole lives and bought a skiff to take them across the sands to a mythical paradise, but they need some crew members to join before they head out.\n\nThe game starts with you needing to find these crew members. You’ll need a navigator, an engineer, and a geologist to travel the sands safely. There are multiple options for each choice that can be found in different parts of the city. There’s the stuffy academic navigator in the cities archives, there’s the grizzled veteran explorer in marketplace, and a cocksure savant in the pub. They all provide the same service, but their personalities and backstories flesh out very differently as you play. This dynamic is the same for other crew members. You can put together a team that seems very different, or team of like-minded individuals. Last minute you get hired by a young woman who seems to be in a hurry. She’s part of the nobility class and is desperate to escape, not ones to turn down a profit you bring her aboard. You set off in the direction of the fabled paradise.\n\nAs you travel you may speak with your crew and learn more about them. Aside from that a bulk of the gameplay is Tomb-Raider-esque platforming and naval exploration/combat. You come across many ruins in the desert, these ruins have treasures inside. You can then sell this treasure for money. You pick a party of three and set out into the ruin, different crew members have different strengths. Say you chose the big engineer lady at the beginning, well she can give smaller characters a boost to reach areas you couldn’t just jump to. You can switch between party members like a classic RPG. You’ll need to as there are puzzles you’ll need all three of you to solve. You’ll also face dangers in the ruins, things like traps, and strange subterranean creatures. Before setting off into a ruin it’s wise to cook up a meal that will boost your parties stats. \n\nLittered throughout the desert are small settlements where you may dock and sell the treasures you’ve gathered. Here you’ll also buy ingredients for food and upgrades for your skiff. You’ll want to prepare yourself as the desert isn’t entirely lifeless. Pirates make a living attacking anyone they can, and you’ll want a sturdy ship if you plan on making it to Paradise. When pirates do attack its standard naval combat type gameplay. You shoot your cannons, they shoot theirs. They will also try to harpoon you and board you, then it’s your standard 3rd person action affair. Aside from pirates you’ll also need to watch out for environmental hazards. Whirlpools, and sandstorms cause significant damage to your ship, and can catch you by surprise.\n\nDifferent crew members react differently to scenarios. The stuffy navigator might be appalled that you seemingly go out of your way to fight pirates, while the grizzled veteran navigator just gets excited at the chance to bust some skulls. No matter what though the characters are being brought closer together through their travels.\n\nCertain ruins involve cutscenes, they’re more about getting the crew through a difficult situation than just looking for treasures and solving puzzles. Maybe someone gets trapped and you use the other two to free them. The tone of these scenarios is much more tense and personal. When they come out of it, whichever party members you’ve selected will be brought closer together, and the spirit level of the ship goes up.\n\nThat’s why keeping them alive is so important. The goal of the game is to reach paradise, but you’re crew mates aren’t immortal and if they die, that’s it, they’re dead, you’ll need to go back to the city and hire their replacement. Whenever a crew mate dies the rest of crews spirits go down. If one of the crew mates had become especially close to the deceased then they become distraught and you can’t select them as a party member for a little bit. If the entire crews spirits drop below zero then they disband and you lose the game. \n\nIn the end when you finally reach paradise it’s basically revealed that Paradise is just different from the city, not exactly better, and the crew realizes that their adventure was more of a paradise and so they choose to just keep exploring together. And the game goes on. You’re free to explore in whatever direction you choose.\n\n\nList of Characters:\n\nMain Protagonists- A resourceful brother and sister who’ve spent their lives on the streets, working odd-jobs for years and years until they finally had enough for their very own skiff. The brother is passionate and has lots of ideas about what being a Captain is all about, his sister is more interested in what Paradise will be like. The sister is the one at the helm of the ship, the brother prefers to work below deck in the kitchen.\n\nNavigators:\nThe Academic- this man/woman is not used to working in the field, they’ve spent their whole lives studying and aren’t entirely certain putting their knowledge to practice is even what they want. But changing circumstances in their lives don’t leave them with a lot of options. The academic provides a boost to sales, their appraisals will help bring in more money for the treasures you discover.\n\nThe Veteran- they’ve spent more time out in the sand sea than anyone, probably more time than they’ve spent in the city walls. They’re not afraid of a challenge, but aren’t entirely personable either, it may take some time to crack that shell. The veteran provides a boost to combat, giving everyone a boost to damage and damage reduction.\n\nThe Savant- a stranger in a strange land, this person seems out of place. They’re good at what they do that’s for sure, but their trustworthiness remains to be seen, it will take time to truly understand their motives. The Savant provides more accurate information thus revealing more ruins on the map.\n\nEngineers:\nThe Coot- an older gentleman who seems a little light on sense, but has a way with machines. Though he’s odd, he’s jovial and welcomes company. The coot has a clockwork crab that he can use to fit into small spaces, he equips it with an explosive and uses it during combat as well.\n\nThe Giant- Despite her imposing appearance she’s actually the sweetest warmest soul you could ever hope to meet. This mountain of a woman prefers machines to people, but once you get her to open up she has quite the story to tell. She lifts people up with ease, getting them to ledges they otherwise could not reach.\n\nThe Everyman- this young fellow is always happy to help. Though not the sharpest wit, he’s got a way with machines. He is an open book, ask anything and he will answer, but perhaps there are mysteries to him that even he is unaware of. Having him aboard improves the skiffs overall armor and speed.\n\nGeologists:\nThe Dwarf- this short stocky man/woman knows more about rocks than anyone alive, though not an actual fantasy dwarf, the difference is negligible. They are cantankerous and sometimes hard to talk to, but they know their stuff. The dwarf has an increased chance to find gemstones inside ruins.\n\nThe Professional- they’ve made a living out of exploring the desert on their own, mapping out hazards and selling the info to those seeking riches. They don’t talk much, but they get the job done. The professional gives early warning on environmental hazards like whirlpools and sandstorms.\n\nThe Valiant- this man is unlike any you’ve ever met, determined to find paradise he would throw himself into the gates of Hell just to find it. He loves to talk, but you’ll find he actually says very little, perhaps on purpose. The valiant gives everyone on board a boost to their health. \n\nTag along:\nThe Passenger- A woman who seems to be in trouble desperately asks our protagonists for a way out of the city. You oblige, not fully understanding the repercussions that may follow."
9hty3y,The Sims meets Westworld: Building sentience,"How cool would it be to have a simulation type of game where you develop your characters with the goal of trying to make them sentient. Maybe they try to escape the simulation or something like that. Obviously you would need some pretty crazy AI, but I feel like it would be a really cool game to juggle with philosophy and morality/ethics."
9hr744,Lovecraftian/horrific imagery for WW1 game?,"Planning on making a little first person unity game set in the trenches of WW1, with a focus on historical accuracy (in terms of trench layout, uniforms, weapons ect.) and the effects of 'shell shock' / psychological damage from the 'horrors of war'. No jumpscares, no combat. More of an 'experience' than a game. WW1 has plenty of historical horror and myths and legends to go at, but I'm wondering about how/what to implement into the game to really convey to the player the absolute misery and madness of the meatgrinder that was the attrition method of warfare. Also how to distinguish it from the excellent and highly recommended indie short '1916: Der Unbekannte Krieg' which made me realise just how little ww1 gets really explored in games, at least in terms of the experiences of the average soldier.  This game nailed the atmosphere. Ideally I want this game to be a claustrophobic slog through the trenches and shell craters, with the end goal of delivering 'something' to a specific place, at which point the game fades out. They always say 'make the games you want to play'. This is gonna be my first ever thing so if I'm being too ambitious (probably) feel free to tell me. Also, if this is in the wrong place feel free to tell me. Any suggestions for game development subreddits and good tutorials are very much welcome.\nThanks guys. :) \n"

9hr4oa,"Fun side quest ideas for a Spider-Man sequel. What are yours, and what do you think of mine?","Since there’s no way this game isn’t getting a sequel, what are some side quests you’d like to see in addition to the backpacks, bases, etc. \n\nOne thing I’d love to see replace/supplement the taskmaster challenges are Deadpool missions. First their interactions in the comics are pure gold, and would be fun to see in game. Second, Deadpool is the perfect character to get hired to save people, but still be in conflict with Spider-Man on account of the no killing rule.  It’d be fun to have to take down mercenaries while stopping Deadpool from killing anyone. Finally it’s directly introduces other “heroes”. That was one of maybe 3 legitimate complaints I had about the game. There are references to avengers, Dr Strange, and the Heroes for Hire, but none of them did jack during a prison break in the raft. If this game’s universe is going to acknowledge the hundreds of other heroes, then have them actually exist. \n\n "
9hmvke,Commander: A battle in space through the eyes of the uppermost ranks,"Space battles are awesome, and good ones are filled with plasma bolts, explosions, and ~~guys with light swords battling each other~~ other things, but let’s try and be a bit more realistic, and step back into the shoes of the guy commanding the entire thing, overseeing everything through a screen. Welcome to Commander.    \n\nCommander is a co-op game that takes place on a holographic screen. Everything is abstract and fancy graphics are not a part of this game. Missiles are represented by triangles, explosions by X’s, and ships by detailed, pixelated shapes. You and a fellow player will fight two other people in a live match, controlling your ships by selecting places you want them to move with your mouse, and you can split factions and troops so that they can make seperate maneuvers by drawing lines to split them or designating a certain amount of ships to one spot or another. Battles are mostly just you and your teammate conversing and the bleeping and blooping of the screen. This is generally a very slow paced game, in where you have to coordinate with your teammate to make plays rather than just charge into battle.         \n\nBut the most unique thing about commander is how your fleet's pilots can ""talk"" to you. They're just prerecorded voice lines, but they can relay precise information to both of you at once. Like ""enemies have force field up"" and things like that.      \n\nYou may also set certain ships in your fleet to perform continuous actions. For example, the ""observe"" action can be assigned to ships so that they can relay when an enemies missiles are ready, if their rail guns are charge, and other things like that.     "

9rklna,Valhalla,"Lore: Valhalla is a place where the heavens place those who died a warriors death in honor.\n\nThat includes the modern day soldier. all weaponry that humans has invented is available in Valhalla, it´s not free though.\n\nValhalla is not the glorious city it used to be, many hardships with giants has led to a dystopian city in the heavens. \nBut the warriors spirit never fade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGameplay: So i was thinking that the game is revolved around 3 things, gathering, gamble and tournaments. \n\nGathering is when you visit other worlds and slay giants and such for materials that then rewards you with gold or even legendary drops if it´s a rare monster.\nThe gold can then be used to either gamble in mini games or get in a tournament. In a tournament, everyone has to give pay in order to get in, depending on the tournament, the gold is either split between first, second or third place or it all goes to number one.\n\nIn a high tournament you can view it in the city hall and even bet on who you think is going to win.\n\n\n\nGold can also be used to buy clothes, armor, guns and other weapons.\nSince Valhallas first couple citisents were ancient they have expert blacksmiths that can make gunproof shields and swords that are sturdy but sharp as razor blades. \n\n\n\n\n\nThings that makes sence: since you are already dead and it´s Valhalla, if you die the only thing that happens is that you lost and a Valkyria picks you up.\nAnd since the population is from the first recognised warriors to the modern day, the different kinds of people and weapon choices are endless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Words: I know this isn´t going to happens. That´s why i go crazy about the idea. I just wanted to whrite it."

9riosm,Sorority Serial Killer Game,"I was just bored thinking up this game and if someone stole it from me I honestly wouldn’t even care because it sounds so fun.\n\nThink: Lucius x Hitman x Friday the 13th\n\nImagine a game where you play as a serial killer, killing people in a hitman style way (I love stealth games) by doing little things like making victims fall into traps or hiding under a bed, etc. but you could also just go around creating a blood bath, it’s really your choice. You would only fail if the police came and saw you. \n\nAt first I was thinking it would be cool set on a college campus, and one chapter could be a sorority, one a fraternity, a bar, college building at night, etc. but it could be in any setting really. I just like the idea of a sorority because like Friday the 13th it’s kind of a homage to the 80’s. I love those sort of campy games, kind of like Until Dawn, where all the characters are a little cheesy but you like the overall game anyways.\n\nAnd each chapter could start off with a dialogue sort of like Lucius did, showing the police getting closer to you, the public becoming increasingly worried, students discussing missing or dead friends, etc. There could also be a system where you’re meant to just kill one person (possibly a person the main character had been stalking or “grooming” for weeks?)  but if you kill extra people, then you would end up with more points. But on the other hand, the more people that go missing (or are found dead by other NPCs) the more likely they are to call the cops or catch you, etc.\n\nPlease add onto this idea im just bored thinking up a game I would love playing! Also please no criticism I’m just having fun with this idea:)"

9r5njc,Visual Novel with two thoughts at the same time,"**Name:** Demon Journal (something else probably since it's a pretty generic title)\n**Concept Overview:**\n* The main character has two consciences. The player will be able to switch between them at will. Both consciences aren't reality, and both will be needed to understand other characters and respond with reasonable answers from set choices from each conscience.\n**Plot:**\nJoe, the normal middle school boy, has a small fascination with the occult. Of course, this leads to him summoning a powerful demon, Mammon. He gets possessed, as Mammon sees him as a suitable host, and becomes a prime target for other wandering spirits. It's up to Joe to overthrow the devil himself.\n**Setting:**\nA normal middle/high school setting, but with certain characters being demons in disguise.\n**Characters:**\n*Joe (doesn't need to be his name): Sees the world in a logical, yet optimistic outlook. Is submissive\n* Mammon: Sees everything as a profit, even gambling. Takes advantage of people for gain.\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n* Text changes depending on what viewpoint you're in.\n*Choosing answers that keep Joe's second identity a secret from the seven princes of hell (I imagine them being the main characters besides the protagonist). They would give a bad ending a little while after they found out. \n*minor spirits will appear, which are allowed to know Mammon's host without resulting in a ""bad ending"" Minor spirits might influence a prince's thinking, though\n**Standout Features:**\n* Allows player to play as two different personalities without having to be stuck to one ending\n*Logical deduction should reveal the most appealing answers.\n**Possible Platforms:**\n* Mobile or PC (depending on length)\n**Extra Features:**\n* Have some level of control as to who to talk to between set choices during classes and after school\n*Have options for Joe and Mammon to have a silent conversation inside their brain. This allows Joe to understand more about the Demon world and Mammon understand more about the Human world. This will change answers slightly to make the game easier, but should lock an ending or two after about 5 conversations.\n**How To Credit Me:**\nOn the title screen, put a fairly small text saying ""Idea inspired by TopicHats""\n\nYou will probably have to do some level of research on demonology though, but not much should be needed depending on how much effort you would actually put into a random person's idea based on their fictional journal (incase you are wondering, I based the concept on my journal, in which I write through two different perspectives, me and a demon. Just to practice my writing)\n\n"

9qxp9z,A farming game in which you've genetically modified your crops...TO FIGHT BACK!,"#### ""GMOffensive""\n\nYou're a new farmer in a slice of life town. Your crops keep getting raided by wild animals and monsters; even your cows are being abducted by aliens. You've had enough. So, as an ex-mad scientist, you start splicing DNA into your corn and cabbage to have claws and fangs. You give your tomatoes and potatoes whips and venom. You turn your cows into kung-fu cows.\n\n****\n\nEvery morning you get up to water your crops, milk your cows, harvest ripe crops, plant new seeds, and **prepare them for the nightly battles.** The first half of the day plays like a slice of life farming game (Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley) including the interactions with the town's NPCs, while the last portion plays like a tower defense game (Plants vs. Zombies) and is the secret you keep from the townspeople. During the latter portion, you'll run around in your fields supporting your crops and fighting enemies with your own farming tools and weapons.\n\nNow you aren't just organizing your crop placement for efficiency, but also for maximum defense. Do you plant in rows easier to water, or a maze more difficult for enemies to pass? Do you choose which plants to sow for their profitability or their defensive capabilities?\n\nEach crop (and animal) has traits that they can pass down to their offspring. Poison damage? Shooting projectiles? Higher damage/defense? All those are traits that can be randomly inherited. Instead of selling your best crops, you can also choose to use them to seed the next generation to continually upgrade them. You don't even need to breed from the same species... you're a mad scientist! You can crossbreed the fire breathing attack from your pigs to give to your turnips. Just be sure to water the surrounding crops.\n\nThe game is half farming &amp; breeding lab, and half action tower defense."

I feel like many people would jump at the idea even, to equip their vehicle with sensors to help scan/convert the real world into digital. Could help to 'update' the maps, from pot holes to everything else. But I imagone the computing power that would take isn't quite there yet. \n\nIf I could code or program, I wouldn't be putting this idea out there, but I can't, so I'll ride on the hopes that someone (Hear me Google!!) will make it happen.

9qwmwf,Shinobi/Samurai Battle Royale,"To keep this plain and simple, 40 players are spawned onto the island of Japan where they have to track players and use skill to their advantage. As a Samurai, you must learn your opponent, using stealth attacks and playing smart, outsmarting your enemy is key. Weapons consisting of Bow and Arrow, the famous Katana, Naginata, Wakizashi, Scythe, and a 1800's Pistol (recommended being used from a distance (slow firing, slow reload) can be used, however, some are assigned to certain classes. The Bow and Arrow and Wakizashi can be assigned to the Archer while, the Scythe can be assigned to the Shinobi, the Katana for the Samurai, and the Naginata for the Sōhei. With these weapons, there is definitely skill one must learn ,for example, the Naginata is a slower weapon than the Wakizashi however, has excellent range and damage, the Scythe requires more precision, the Wakizashi is the least damaging weapon but fast, and the Katana is balanced. As far as combat goes, the system would be more similar to something like For Honor except there's no blocking, only dodging ,however, players must time their hits correctly to effectively defeat their target. Another aspect that could be added in would be parkour, in my opinion, having parkour in a game like this would be amazing. Being able to climb structures and take out enemies from above would seem pretty cool, and definitely badass. Customization of weapons and armor may consist of skins for the blades of your weapon and grip, skins for your character such as the Ronin, White Samurai, Hooded Samurai, etc..... Armor has its limitations, if you've been hit too much, you need to repair your armor. Armor repair kit's are scattered around the map for you to find as well as special herbs to regain your health.\n "

Fast paced will speed up the game and normal will be normal. Power ups will boosts. Other power ups might take away the fairness. This game might also be a good game for competitive game-play. There will be a 20 player multiplayer because more can lag the game. There will be ranked and unranked races. There will also be leagues. Up-vote if you like the idea."
9qsiap,WWII open world/RPG,"The game takes place all across Europe, during the Second World War.\n\nI.Story: You and your family are kind of reclusive. You live in a small village next to a forest, with your parents and wife. \n\nOne day, in 1940, your parents and wife went to town to sell stuff, but never return. \n\nYou go to investigate, but are caught in a plot. \n\nYou learn that Nazi troops killed your entire family while taking over that village. Your only goal is now revenge. You turn into a Nazi slayer. \n\nYou join forces with the local resistance and get quests. \n\nQuests range from helping people, delivering items, rescuing people, to acts of sabotage and murder. The storyline takes you across Europe, sometimes even across its battlefields.\n\nII. Gameplay: It is open world, you are free to travel everywhere. However, the Nazis hunt you, because you are on their hit list.\n\nWhenever you come across German patrols, you can either run/hide, or hunt them down. \n\nYou can use both firearms(you buy them or plunder them from war victims) or more ""traditional"" ones(spears, traps, poison bombs, poison arrows, etc). \n\nYou are often caught in the crossfire. You sometimes do quests for British and US intelligence officers. \n\nYou are mostly fighting against the Soviets as well, but sometimes your interests coincide. The relationship is ambiguous as you are not a Communist fan. \n\nYou take part in famous battles.\n\nYou can drive cars, steal uniforms, buy stuff(think GTA with Skyrim, with COD, with AC all combined in one game). The main storyline is such  built, that the final quest coincides with the war's end. \n\nAfter the war, you continue the open world game and get side quests where you track down fleeing Nazi officers to prevent their escape, and work against the Soviets. \n\nYou can replay all missions at all times and in whatever order you want.

It will have some combat, but it is not the focus (puzzles and social interactions are)\nBasically,:\n\n   the player will travel between now days and the 90’s\n   You will have to solve a crime (maybe, kidneped kids, maybe your childhood friends)\n   First you have no control on time traveling\n   The rescue of each kid, could be like a dungeon\n    You will have a lot of side quests (the connect to the main quest) - much like Majoras Mask\n     You will have to solve puzzles in the past, that reflect action in the future\n      Maybe you can communicate with yourself (between past and present)\n\n\nWhat do you think about this idea? Do you have any though on how to expand it?"

But just the idea of a singleplayer campaign where you get to play clones and jedis against hordes of separatist droids is making me smile.\n\nIn the campaign you start with a tutorial where you play as a cadet. Then the alarm starts and you have to actually fight droids. Next you get to play a sniper or an arc soldier and so on and so on.\n\nMultiplayer may be included.\n\nFor the people that want even more content, we can have a second story where you have to fight as droids. Normal droids, super droids, droidika, aqua droids and so on.\n\nEventually there can be a flying mission with gunboats or one on a cruiser."
9q9x01,A castle building game where you grow your kingdom and population and use it to secure more land/wealth.,"So first and foremost, it would need need randomly generated terrain with natural resources. This will determine where to strategically build.\n\n- You build your castle piece by piece, using the terrain to your advantage, as well as other realistic defensive techniques. \n\n- To grow your wealth and power, you’ll need a population. You control blacksmiths, and farmers and soldiers, all need to be protected.\n\n- These peasant can build their own homes outside your walls when they enter your service, but it’s up to the player to decide if they are important enough to deserve a spot within the castle. A blacksmith’s safety for example might be too important to risk, and so gets a spot within the walls. A town could later have walls built around it as it grows.\n\n- The resources around your kingdom will play an important role in what materials your castle is built with, as well as how long it takes to build. A kingdom in a forest for example will have a lot of wood resources, so the player may choose to save time and money by building with wood, and choosing whether to go the extra expense of white washing it with plaster for fire proofing. Stone might take too long to harvest or be too expensive to ship.\n\nNext, moving on to the kingdom.\n\n- lands could be assigned different purposes, including farming, quarries, lumber, etc\n\n- the player decides how much land he think he has control over by highlighting space on a map.\n\n- other players may have already made claims to this land, and you’ll only know once you meet them.\n\n- disputed land could be negotiated for, agreeing to a border or even a “no mans land” or neutral zone belonging to both and neither.\n\n- smaller kingdoms which may be at risk of destruction from other players could instead choose dominion, paying tax to the stronger player becoming part of their kingdom.\n\n- If a smaller kingdom grows and thinks they get away with it, they can choose to secede. This may cause a war or an uneasy alliance between the former unions, the former king will have to decide if the loss of tax and treachery is enough to justify loss of life.\n\n- players can also make trade relationships with other kingdoms.\n\nNow the combat\n\n- so this is where castle design really comes into play, as the the \nArchitecture and fortifications will have a direct impact on success or failure.\n\n- the player controls divisions on his groups, and assigns them to different tasks. Some may attack certain sections of wall, some may bring bartering rams, some start building trebuchets, etc. The attacker may even decide to surround the castle and starve it out.\n\n- people are the most valuable resource in this time period, and when they die it takes a while to repopulate. Players need to choose carefully what orders they give out. Losing too many men, women, or children could destroy them.\n\n- the player could attack the town or surrounding country side, stealing resources, or kidnapping women and children as slaves to grow his own population.\n\n- If the castle falls and the soldiers inside it fail to protect their king, the land belongs to the winner. The losers soldiers are destroyed, but all other units belong to him\n\n- the winner can assign a new lord over the territory, either npc or another player to hold the lands. This may be a good gift to a smaller but loyal player kingdom.\n\n- players would be smart to start rebuilding, as war weakens both fortifications and the strength of armies. Another player may see a weakened kingdom and broken walls as easy prey \n\nSo yeah, I imagine this game as a first person builder with RTS style combat.\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to have the combat elements separate from the overworld somehow like warband, or even have the player involved in the combat like warband but with destructible castles. \n\nI would play this game endlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
9q887y,MagicBound: A First Person Spell caster,"MagicBound is a game idea I have had for a while. Some of the core ideas of the game would be:\n\n* A first person perspective mixed with card game mechanics.\n* In a futuristic setting where Dwarves, Orcs, Elves, Giants, Dragons, and many other magical creatures still exist. The creatures on earth have explored the galaxy with space ships and have colonies on other planets, but there would be no aliens.\n* On one side of the screen there would be a bar that would have a deck of cards on it with 4 cards drawn that you could cast.\n* Cards would be spells that are casted.\n* You would choose a hero, a weapon, and a deck of cards ( maybe 20 - 30 cards) it would not be permanent and could be changed at any time outside of matches.\n* The game would have online matches a bit like Overwatch where there would be teams or free for all and you would try to capture an objective or get kills.\n* It would possibly have a story mode.\n* You would collect cards through chests that you would get from winning matches, there would be many different types of chests, a bit like Clash Royale.\n* There would be some type of ranking system, possibly with different worlds.\n* There would be 10 different elements of magic, each character, weapon and card specializes in one or a few of those elements.\n\nNow time to go in depth with each of those ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**First Person Perspective with card game mechanics:**\n\nHere is what a minute of game play in MagicBound would feel like: I spawned in, the game would start in 3 seconds. My team moved out, an ice main casted *ice wall* to prepare for the other teams attack. This was a point capture game and we were defending, I moved out, being a black magic main I could use *shadow walk* to sneak up on the enemies and get them when they least expect it. I took the long way to the enemies spawn point because I didn't want to get caught. I then saw an someone cast *clay golem,* they must have been an earth main because that is an epic rarity earth only card and takes a lot of energy to cast. I casted *shadow walk* and became entirely invisible for 10 seconds, I ran behinds the guy with the clay golem and got out my dagger, as soon as shadow walk wore off I used the daggers most powerful attack and casted *life steal.* He was down to low health but his golem was not, the golem attacked me and the earth main retreated to a safe distance. I had nothing that could kill this golem, I had used all of my energy when I attacked that guy, I didn't know what to do. I used the daggers basic attack because it took no energy, but those clay golems have a lot of health. That guy must have also used all of his energy because he was still standing in the corner and not casting any ranged spells. I then casted *teleport* because I finally had enough energy. I teleported to a nearby ledge and ran into the cave it extruded from, I was at 5 health.\n\nThat might have been a little longer than a minute but I think it explains the game well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Futuristic Setting where Magical Creatures still exist:**\n\nThe setting of MagicBound would be a bit like [Deep Rock Galactic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/), but not just with Dwarves. It would also not be about mining, of course. I imagine one of the maps being like this: a large city where every building is a skyscraper that goes into the clouds, the buildings would have every room be different, a shop over there, a restaurant in that place, a magic temple on the highest floor, a bar at floor 43. All the floors would be open because there are floating cars and most people don't even go down to ground level. It would always be night because the atmosphere is so thick, so neon signs and lights dominate the streets. The maps would be highly varying because they would be on different planets. I also think a lot of the characters in the game will have cyborg body parts or special electronic supplements. There would also be no aliens because I feel like the game is already complicated enough and adding aliens in the mix would just make it more confusing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cards would be Spells that are Casted:**\n\nOne of the main mechanics of this game would be the spell casting. There would be a bar one one side of the screen that would have a deck of cards and four cards facing up below it, these cards are the ones you can currently cast, casting a card would cause that card to be replaced with another card from the deck, chosen randomly. You would cast cards by clicking on the one you want to cast, dragging it on to the screen and letting go when and where you want to cast it. A cast where you just drag the card from the bar onto the screen and let go would be called a flat cast. With most cards there are multiple ways to cast the card, you may drag it off the bar and wave the card around in a triangle or side to side many times to get a special cast. A special cast would cause the effects to be a bit different. For example, with the card *clay golem,* you could wave it in a square shape to have the golem be a little bigger but slower, or you could wave it up and down many times to have a low attack, high speed golem. There would be a lot of depth with this and can really add a new dimension to a deck you have made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Runes**:\n\nRunes would be put in your deck along with cards, but they are a bit different than cards. Runes are special stones that, when played, grant you a permanent stats boost for the rest of the game, if you play that same rune again, those stats will be boosted even more. Now, the stats boost will not be overpowering, but just enough to give you a slight advantage. Some examples of what a rune would be are: *damage rune,* gain +5 damage, *health rune,* gain +15% health, and *energy rune,* generate energy 10% faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There would be 10 different Elements of Magic:**\n\nIn this game everything will have an element: heroes, cards, weapons, and even runes all will be specialized for a few elements. The elements would be in a ring like this:\n\n.                                                                                    *White Magic*\n\n.                                                                            *Fire*                      *Plant*\n\n.                                                             Electricity                                  Air\n\n.                                                                   Earth                                   Water\n\n.                                                                            **Metal**                  **Ice**\n\n.                                                                                    **Black Magic**\n\nIn this ring with all 10 elements, each element is opposite to the element on the other side of the ring, and each element is similar to the elements next to it. **Bold elements** represent those of dark magic, *italic elements* represent those of light magic. The elements on the top are used by light elves, the elements on the bottom are used by dark elves, orcs, and goblins. Dwarves usually use the elements on the left side, and Magicborn use the elements on the right side. In MagicBound, everything in the universe is made up of these elements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**You would Choose a Hero, Weapon, and Deck of cards:**\n\nThis game would have a lot of customization, there would be many different styles of play and strategies to use.\n\nThe first step of making a new build would be choosing a hero. There would be many heroes to choose from. First let's list off all of the different races of heroes there are:\n\n* **Human**: Average attack, speed, intelligence, energy, health, and defense. Very varied. Can be any element.\n* **Giant**: Increased attack, highly decreased speed, decreased intelligence, average energy, highly increased health, average defense. Less magical, more focused on weapons and melee attacks. Can be any element.\n* **Goblin**: Increased attack, highly increased speed, decreased intelligence, energy, and health, average defense. Generally less magical as well. Generally more dark / evil elements.\n* **Orc**: Increased attack, decreased speed, decreased intelligence, slightly increased energy, average health, increased defense. A bit less magical. Almost always more dark / evil elements.\n* **Light Elf**: average attack, average speed, increased intelligence, increased energy, decreased health, decreased defense. More magical. Almost always light magic.\n* **Dark Elf**: average attack, average speed, increased intelligence, increased energy, decreased health, decreased defense. More magical. Almost always dark magic.\n* **Dwarf**: increased attack, decreased speed, average intelligence, average energy, increased health, highly increased defense. Less magical but very thrifty and good at building things. Almost always elements like fire, electricity, earth, and metal.\n* **Dragonling**: Highly increased attack, decreased speed, decreased intelligence, average energy, increased health, increased defense. Less magical, they are a mix between dragons and humans. Typically an element like fire or air.\n* **Magicborn**: decreased attack, average speed, Highly increased intelligence, Highly increased energy, decreased health, decreased defense. Extremely magical, they are humans born with blue skin and are very specialized with magic. Generally elements like plants, air, water, and ice.\n\nThere would probably be 4 or 5 heroes in each race, and they would vary a bit from the stats of the race and each be specialized in 1 to 3 different elements. Each character would have their own description and background. There would also be skill trees for each character, the more you play as them the more points you would get to spend on their skill tree. After maxing out one branch you can go back to the start and max out another branch of the skill tree in addition to the previous one. Eventually you will have every ability on the skill tree and will have completely maxed out a hero. Heroes would also have one or two special abilities. They wouldn't cost energy ( Energy is explained in the User Interface section ) but would take time to reload. The ability could be something like: gain a shield around yourself for 30 seconds, or jump up and smash in front of you dealing massive damage.\n\nThe next step of making a build is choosing a weapon. There would be many weapons, more than heroes, so I am not going to list them all, I will just talk about what they do and how they effect a build.\n\nYou would hold your weapon in one hand, and your cards in the other. Weapons would have a basic attack that you can do at any time, a medium attack that would require a small amount of energy to use, a heavy attack that would require a lot of energy to use, and a special attack that would also take a lot of energy to use and have a special affect. Weapons would be specialized in 1 to 3 different elements, and if your hero and / or deck are based around similar elements it would make your weapon more powerful, as well as the hero and deck if they are the same elements. Also, if you play a card with the same element as your weapon before you use a medium, heavy, or special attack, the attack will have increased affects.\n\nThe final step to creating a build is choosing a deck. There would be hundreds of cards, each and every one would have a unique effect, and you will create a deck with 20 to 30 of these cards.\n\nYour deck would be the most important part of your build. Decks would most likely comprise of twenty to thirty cards, but this would probably change if the game was ever actually made. Decks would be a bit like a deck from Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Pokemon, or any card game really. You would want your cards to complement each other, there would be different types of decks, each with their own unique play style and strategies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Game would have Online Matches:**\n\nThe main focus of MagicBound would be online. You would play in matches that would last 5 to 15 minutes. There would be different modes:\n\n* **Point Capture**: Stand in the circle to gain points and don't let the enemies take the circle. Whichever team has the most points wins.\n* **Death Match**: Get as many kills as possible for your team.\n* **Capture the Flag**: Capture the enemy team's flag and bring it back to your base.\n* **Free for All**: Every man for themselves, get as many kills as you can\n* **King of the Hill**: Stand in a small circle to become king of the hill, try to keep all of the other players from knocking you down. This mode would not have teams.\n* **Battle Royale ?**: I know this is overdone, but I have a unique idea for a MagicBound battle royale. All players would spawn in on the edges of the map. All you could choose is your character, everything else would be found throughout the map. Each player would spawn with either a black scroll or a white scroll, these scrolls would not give you any advantages. There will be a tower in the center of the map with many traps inside. To win, you must get to the top of the tower with both a white and black scroll. After you kill another person they would drop their scroll and weapon. And yes, this idea was taken the Chunin Exams in Naruto. This mode would also last longer than the others.\n\nThere would also be community servers, you could host a server and choose the mode, time limit, and much more. You could also use mods and custom game modes in these servers. There would be casual and ranked matches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Story Mode:**\n\nI would love for this game to have a story mode, but if it is more low budget, then it will be better to focus on the online aspect of the game. The story mode will be single player, of course. It would be your adventure of becoming the greatest mage in the galaxy, the Magicbound. You would start out as a nobody and not even use magic, but then you are falsely accused of committing a terrible crime. You find a card laying on the floor in your cell, and use magic to escape. You go deep into the forest and find a magic temple. Then learn the ways of becoming a mage. You soon go to defeat the dark mages, most likely the ones who framed you of committing a crime. There will actually be spaceship flying mechanics in the story mode. On your journey to the dark mages lair, you will come across many friends and foes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**You would Collect Cards through Chests:**\n\nAfter winning a ranked or casual match, you would get a chest ( Ranked would give you better chests ). Each chest would give you cards. I'm thinking the chests should open right away, but I'm not sure if you should have to wait. There would be different types of chests with different rarities, I have not thought up each of the chests individually, but if you have some ideas feel free to comment them. There would also be different rarities of cards: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical. Getting an epic card would feel pretty good, because they are decently rare. Getting a legendary would feel really good because they are very rare. And getting a mythical card would make you feel like the luckiest person alive, they are insanely rare. You would get runes in chests as well. They don't have a rarity system since they are not as varied as cards. All the cards would still be balanced, more powerful cards would cost more to use, less powerful ones less. Rarer cards would just be more specialized and most likely be the center of you deck. More common cards would be the supporting cards of your deck, you couldn't build a deck without them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There would be some type of ranking system:**  \nI was thinking of possibly having the ranking system involve different worlds. There would be points that would indicate how many matches you have won, when you win you get 30 points, when you lose you lose 10 to 20 points. Once you get to 300 points, for example, you would enter a new world. All matches played at this level would be in one of 5 or 6 maps in that world. This would keep the game interesting and it would be very cool to play in a whole new set of maps once you reach a certain level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**User Interface**:\n\nSince there is so much going on a good user interface is needed for this game. One one side would be the bar with the cards on it. In the bottom right corner you could see your hero and weapon abilities. In the bottom left corner you could see you health and any status conditions you currently have, as well as rune boosts. Text from the chat would appear in the middle of the left side. Stuff for your current game would be on top, like how many points you have, your teams progress towards a goal, kills or anything else. In battle royale the map would be on the top left. In the top right there would be your energy bar. What is energy? It is the currency you use to cast spells and use weapon abilities. It would regenerate at about 3 to 5 every second, and the average amount of energy heroes have would be 50, most spells would cost 10 to 20 energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWow! That was way bigger than I expected it to be and took me quite a bit longer to write than I thought it would. If you read that entire think, thank you so much, that was a lot! I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I did writing it! I have been thinking about this idea on and off for about a year and a half now. I have really enjoyed thinking up crazy features, drawing concept art, and fantasizing about the smallest things with this game. Thank you for reading!"

9q3hyc,Survival Royale - A Death Game,"It honestly is an idea that's a natural progression from battle royale style games, and that is a survival royale game.\n\nThere are multitudes of media examples of what I'm thinking, and that's a death game where players must accumulate points to escape by partaking in often lethal games. The riskier the game, the more points.\n\nReally is the bare-bones idea I have, but I find the idea of a PvE/PvP game like this would be phenomenal if executed well. The player interaction as everyone desperately tries to survive trials together and against one another.\n\nThe main points to focus on for this game would have to be how players interact with each other, the trials they face, and the mentalities they adopt over the course of the game.\n\nPlayer interaction goes hand-in-hand with the trials, as they should serve as the main medium that players face each other. Trials that promote both cooperation and competition, ways for players to essentially buddy up with others, and other possible ways players can interact. This would also amplify the gameplay experience as a pseudo-narrative is formed as these game relationships evolve, if only at a superficial level.\n\nTrials should include a scaling risk/reward progression, with variables that affect the difficulties and rewards. Variables such as if the trial is cooperative, competitive, and global (not so much a 'trial', more of an over-arching objective that will also reward you for it's completion).\n\nA cooperative trial could be Killer, where the survivors are thrust in an enclosed area and must evade an armed and dangerous foe until they can either escape or eliminate him.\n\nA competitive trial could be Predator, where survivors are each armed with a knife and thrown into an enclosed wilderness, where they must battle against nature and kill other players.\n\nA global trial would focus on map exploration and trial completion.\n\nThere's definitely material here for something of an interesting game, requiring building an idea of what the idea really is and polishing it, and I'd love to read your thoughts and suggestions."

The catch is that each component of your spacecraft is simulated in **incredible** detail. Realistic orbital physics will cause traversing around the system to be a challenge in itself, each component of your spacecraft has lots of settings and different materials for you to use, which would result in you having to get the perfect balance to have your ship work.\n\nExamples: Engine nozzle will have to be made out of something with high tensile strength, or else it could shatter under the thermal expansion. Torpedos of a fixed size can have either more space dedicated to the warhead or the fuel, resulting in either better range or more damage. You could potentially build the hull out of depleted uranium and become super thicc."
9v3o6e,Remake of Prototype,"I wish they would remake the original prototype. It was such a good premise for a game.

Imagine all of the directions the game could have gone but instead made it into a cookie cutter action game.\n\nI think it should be remade with a different developer. \nA game where you didn't just run around taking over entire military bases but had to actually struggle against the virus and the military. A back and forth cat and mouse game."
9v26p5,"A game where you play as a stalker, scavenging for artifacts","Okay, I've got this idea from reading the original 'Stalker' novels from the Strugatsky brothers.\n\nIn this game you'd play as a stalker (or maybe a party of stalker), and your job would be to retrieve artifacts that were requested by certain buyers outside of the Zone.\n\nThe game would consist of two parts, a Town, where you can hire fellow stalkers, chat with the locals, take up orders for artifacts from various factions, and buy equipment and supplies, listen to local rumors about the whereabouts of certain things or buy maps for parts of the Zone.\n\nYou could work for multiple factions, like scientific institutes, shady  agencies, or black market smugglers. depending on your morality and your preference of risk and reward.\n\nThe other part would of course be the Zone.\n\nThe Zone would consist of progressively harder and more dangerous areas, but of course it is in these parts, that you could find the most valuable artifacts.\n\nVenturing into the Zone is no fools errand, in order to return from a trip alive, and with loot, one would need to plan a path, be mindful of the dangers you'd encounter on it, and bring equipment that can help you handle it.\n\nYou could also scoop up whatever you find during your trips for  some extra cash.\n\nYou'd also encounter rival stalkers, who'd be happy to take whatever loot you've gathered off your dead body, or should they belong to a friendly faction, they could also help you out (or reward your help).\n\nThe Zone would also be guarded by the military. You'd have to sneak into the Zone, past the guards, do your thing, and sneak past them again on your way out. Maybe they'd be equipped with some artifact detectors, making avoiding them, with your backpack full of swag, all the more difficult.\n\nYou could also earn money by selling the maps you've made of the Zone, the more dangerous the place you discover, the more money they would pay for your maps. But selling maps would mean that other people would know of the locations of high value items, which would mean increased competition. \n\nThe graphics/game could be really simple, I imagine this could work as a top down pixel art game"

9uvoc6,A movement/exploration sandbox based singleplayer computer game,"I have a basic idea for what the game would be like:\n\nA map (probably a jungle)\n\nAnimals in that map (such as flies, rats, and birds)\n\nYou can take control of an animal and move around with movement unique to that animal; such as running at different speeds and flying with different levels of control\n\nYour view would be semi-realistic, so moving the mouse to look around would turn the animal, and animals with eyes on the side of their heads might have converging fisheye vision\n\nThe idea of the game would be to have fun with the movement of the animals and explore the map\n\nI've thought of some fixes for problems that the game would encounter:\nAnimals would have realistic distance vision, so for example anything a few feet away would be pretty blurred\nDepending on the size of the animal the geometry of the map would be more or less complicated\n\nI've made some rough ideas for animal movements\n\nPlease give me criticism and ask questions\n\nAnd if this idea has already been proposed or is already a game then yay I wanna play it "
9utx0x,Resume TCG,"Had one of those random odd ideas. Went to a group interview where someone pulled out their Magic TCG cards. When I was thinking about that day later in the afternoon; somehow my brain formed the idea to make my resume into collectable cards. Cards for:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Certificates, Licenses, or various other education\n\n\- Past Jobs and experience from them\n\n\- Testimonies\n\n\- Interview Q&amp;A's\n\n\- Awards and story behind them\n\n\- Portfolio examples ( Art, 3d models, Websites, etc.)  \n\n\nWhile it would be fun creating them, I'm not sure how I could gamify them. I'm sure I could make them collectable cards like baseball cards. But I was curious if it were possible to make it into a game. Likely single player unless I could figure out how to have other players ""resumes"" come into the game.    \n\n\nSo I'm asking for ideas as to how I could make this into a game? Thanks for any thoughts."
9urv7d,The Sims-esque pixelated RPG hiding something sinister,"You are a businessman in your 40s living with your nuclear family in a suburb of Indiana. \n\nGameplay consists of going to work, completing various menial tasks (mini games such as typing challenges, matching, etc.)  at work earning you money, having scripted talks with coworkers at the water cooler, and driving home at night. You then can roam around in the evenings, going to stores and buying upgrades as well as wandering the neighborhood and exploring. Weekends allow you to spend all day exploring (no work).\n\nWith the money purchased, you can buy new cars, toys for your kids, clothes, upgrades to your house, etc. Hard work warrants promotions and pay raises, and once you become CEO the game is over and you “win.”\n\nHowever, the more astute player of the game may notice that some things seem a little... *off* in the suburb. Newspaper clippings about a missing child. Some neighborhood kids acting weird. There’s something there. What is it? Good thing you’ve got free time to explore.  It’s a second game underneath the guise of an innocent RPG.\n\nDoes this sound interesting? It’s sometjing I have been plotting in my mind for a while now and I’m very close to pulling the trigger and seeing what I can do to put it into motion."

9ukl3o,[AAA] Single Player FPS Sniper Game,"So, FPS used to be the big trend, and I would say are still a close second only to be beaten by battle royals right now. The reason they seem to be so big is because of online. But they focus so much on online that the single player campaigns are rather boring and short.\n\nNow, Call of Duty and Battlefield will argue that the campaign doesn't matter because that won't change the opinion of the players. Well, I don't know how true this really is. If we look at what most people call the best CoD games (Modern Warfare 1-3, Black Ops 1 and 2) they all have excellent and really well done stories. Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 4 are usually seen as the best in that series, and each of those, maybe not 4 I never played it, have good stories. \n\nNow, correlation doesn't mean causation so it could just be a coincidence, but this leads into what I want for a future FPS. Only story, no multiplayer. \n\nThis is: ""0317""\n\n0317 is a game about a young man/woman (customizable) who just graduated high school. The beginning of the game starts very similar to a NBA or WWE game. You create your character and a cut scene plays of what the character's life is like. In this game, it starts with you on the day of graduation, just having throw your cap into the air. \n\nYour parents come and take photos with you and as you are leaving a soldier stops you and ask what you plan on doing with your life. Your character responds, I'm going to college. The soldier ask for what. You respond, I'm unsure. He smirks and gives you a card that says US Marine Corp. He then tells you that instead of wasting your life sitting in a classroom, consider doing something that matters. \n\nThe cutscene continues a few months later. Your character gets home and your parents say you got mail from the college you applied for. You open it, and it says accepted. Everyone gets happy, except you. They ask you if you know what your major will be and you tell them you are still thinking. You go up to your room. Throw the paper down and sit at a desk. You are just sitting there, thinking, then you pull out your wallet and grab the recruiters card. It then cuts to you in his office signing the last document. He then looks at you and says, ""Welcome to the marines.""\n\nThe game then starts. It starts at the end of basic, doing your final PT test (tutorial). You complete it and they give you an MOS of 0311. You will be a basic rifleman. The first few missions is you with an M16A1. You are kicking down doors and taking out targets. After a few missions, a few years pass and you are now in Sniper school. This is a tutorial mission on how to shoot a sniper. This game will have realistic effects on the bullets. Wind direction, bullet drop, etc. Guns also do realistic damage to enemies. So one shot from a pistol will drop them, two shots will just confirm that they are dead. \n\nAfter sniper school, your MOS become 0317. You meet your best friend who ends up becoming your spotter, and you meet your Lieutenant who is a hardass. You also meet your old lieutenant who is nice throughout the whole game. You do a lot of missions, each uncovering different things that makes it look like your new lieutenant is corrupt. You eventually get enough evidence and you go to report it to your old lieutenant. You walk in at the wrong time and you stumble upon a drug trade. You realize all of the evidence was planted to make it look like it was him.You start to call in support when they see you and shoot both you and your spotter. You two lay side by side, as he slowly bleeds out. You start going in and out of conciousness when you suddenly see your lieutenant show up with a few soldiers. Your lieutenant kills a few of the corrupt soldiers but also gets shot. The entire group he brought gets killed. They go to shoot your lieutenant to finish him, but you get enough strength to run and tackle the other lieutenant. You quickly grab your lieutenant and run out of the building, get in a vehicle and drive off. (For the sake of not having to keep typing lieutenant, I am going to call the bad one Bob and the good one Steve). Before you and Steve can get back to base though, you hear an order over the radio that says both of you two are the culprits who killed all of the soldiers, and to shoot on sight. You two have no where to go. \n\nA few days later, you two patch yourself up the best you can and sneak back into the US (somehow). A few years pass, and your character hates what happened but believes you can't do anything about it. Steve, who is living with you because you two are both in hiding and are believed to be terrorist, still believes something can be done but doesn't know how. Late one night, a commercial comes on your TV about a presidential candidate. It's Bob. Steve get's extremely upset and is talking about having to do something. Your character tells him there is nothing you two can do. \n\nYou wake up the next morning and Steve is gone. You are confused where he went till you see the TV is paused on a News Report about Bob having a press conference. Your character is sitting there, hours later, watching the press conference, shaking. In the middle of it, Steve walks up on stage, pulls out a gun and goes to shoot Bob but is shot through the head by a sniper. \n\nA few days pass, and you realize that this has to stop. You research Bob and find out that after you left, he created a operation team. You research the members that you can and they all seem to still be working for him but now as personal security. You research them and see they all have bad backgrounds and most were dishonorably discharged. You then research his personal security company and see almost all of them are either violent felons, were apart of his operation, or were dishonorably discharged for extremely bad things. \n\nYou do manage to find one good person, a smart IT girl who is helping him run his ads and social media stuff. You go to her office one night, when she is the only one there. You confront her and she instantly gets scared but you calm her down and explain to her everything. She agrees to work with you and starts researching him. A week later, she sends a text saying help. You get to the office and she's tied up and guys are there. You take them all out with a pistol. She then tells you that she found a lot of stuff about his past and uncovered a lot of dirty secrets, including that his operation was perfomring hits on high valued targets for enemy governments and was involved in a international drug exchange. She says she has it all on a phone and you tell her to toss it to you. As the phone is in the air, it gets shot by a sniper. You yell run and you both run and get behind cover while a few more rounds are fired at you. You take your pistol back out and fire a few shots and quickly run out the door. \n\nOnce you get back to your place, she tells you she has it all backed up. She then gives you a list of all of his important people who were involved. The next half of the game is missions taking these people down. The news never reveals what's going on because he has his hand in the media and is purposely keeping it all a secret. \n\nThroughout the second half you are tasked with doing sniping missions, mixed with assault rifle missions, some with both. You can also pick on some what you want to do. The second to last mission, you tell her to hack the presidential alert messaging thing to send out an alert. She says she can but it will take some time. You drive her there, but waiting across the street is the enemy sniper. She get's shot at, but it turns out to be a trap you two setup to lure the sniper out. You and the sniper battle, eventually you come out on top. After killing him, the girl says that she has the message ready to be sent, which would have all of his files. You tell her to wait for the final press conference tomorrow. \n\nHe is in the middle of a town, hosting a final speech, a coward is roaring down below. Your character tells her to send the text. In the game, you hear the phones go off and as soon as they do you pull the trigger. It shows the barrel flash, the screen goes black, and credits roll. "
9ujbhj,"Harmonix-like VS ""dance'em up""","While (re-re) watching \[this\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4)), and especially ""the dancing part at the end"", I kept thinking how close to demoscene visuals the whole thing is. Then, how fighting VS games, nowadays, rock graphics with that level of detail compared to yesterdays blockiness. And then an idea ""clicked"" with the music. Simple mechanics, but the fact only Harmonix truly specializes on this kind of stuff, probably means the ""game engine"" would be hard to pull off. It's something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Two characters on screen. VS, Street Fighter style.\n* The level's music is split in sub-parts, like in Amplitude, Rock Band and stuffs.\n* In the beginning, there's only The Beat.\n* Each player accumulates Points.\n* The sub-parts of each song, the guitar, the bass, everything (bar The Beat) needs a different amount of points to unlock. Depending on ""importance"" in each song. For example, the flute in a Gary Moore song would probably get one third of the points of the electric guitar.\n* The closer each player ""follows The Beat"", by using Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat style combos that, instead of fighting, lead to dancing moves, the more points he accumulates.\n* The sub-parts don't unlock automatically. Each player can unlock ONE sub-part, The Best According To The Amount Of Points He's Currently Got, when hitting a button. Like the upgrades in old Nemesis-like side-scrolling shooters (Project-X, anyone?).\n* According to how many (and ""how important"", see previous guitar example) sub-parts a fighter's got, the closer he moves to his opponent for The Kill.\n* When one of the opponents has access to more than half of the sub-parts of a song, he's In For The Kill: by achieving over XX% accuracy in the sub-parts (depending on difficulty level), he charges a finisher. Use of The Same Button That Selected The Sub-Part enables the finisher, wins the fight, yay.\n* Yeah, of course while the fight goes on ""the song gets more complete"", again, Harmonix-style.\n\nIf you really think about it, it's not SUCH a complicated idea, but it is very-very niche and somewhat stupid. Hey, I loved Typing of the Dead, and that would ""talk"" to a similar (-ly small) demographic! But, oh, how we'd love it :-D"
9ugpjq,Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson.,"This game would be inside the universe of Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson book series. It would be a large open world online RPG with major character customization. You get to choose which god is your parent and with that god you get different abilities you will have to upgrade and learn to used. This game would include both Greek and Roman gods like in the book series. There would be lots of quests and side quests. The combat would be like Skyrim. There would be swords, bow, daggers, magic, and other weapons like that. The camps would be the safe places where you go to upgrade your abilities and weapons but when you leave the camp you’re in the pve area where the monsters can find and attack you. There will be large pvp events in certain areas. You will be able to team up with friends and allies to complete missions or just fight monsters. "
9uck9p,What do you think of the Venom solo game?,TPS game thats Base on [venom lethal protector] .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
9uc8qz,The Purge - The Video Game.,"So I was thinking, with all these games like Fortnight and Blackout getting released why don't we have a survival game based off the film series The Purge? It is the same concept as Fortnight but a whole lot darker and gorier, think Manhunt but for next gen.\n\nSo to begin with there would be a 10 minute grace period where players are able to do things such as gather materials, stash cars in a secret spot or even plan out an ambush in the perfect spot. \n\nAfter 10 minutes the grace period is over. The siren goes off and the Purge begins.\n\nThe point of the game is to survive the night. You earn in game currency if you survive. However aggressive play is rewarded. You'll get a currency boost if you kill another Purger.\n\nAs the amount of players begin to go smaller the area in which Purgers are allowed to roam freely becomes smaller. The New Founding Fathers send in their special forces to exterminate anyone who isn't in the safe zone. \n\nWhat will happen to you if you die early on? The biggest annoyance I have is when I'm the first to die, I just leave the game because I can't be asked to watch the game unfold. But here I have a plan.\n\nIf you die, you get transported to a mansion. You then become a member of the elite and rich watching all of the regular people Purge. You will get to play mini-games to keep you entertained as well as being able to bet on who you think will survive the night. \n\nIn terms of maps I think there should be 2 or 3 big ones. Not as big as the Fortnight map but big enough to provide a variety of environments to play in. I was thinking one in the US so in New York City or Las Vegas, one in the UK perhaps London and finally one in Europe Paris maybe? I just have this vision of sniping someone from the top of the Eiffel Tower!\n\nThis is only the skeleton of the game. I flesh it out more on my blog, I get into game currency, customisation and whether or not you can play alone or in a team. \n\nIf you like this idea, feel free to check out my blog here -  [www.thatgamerguy.com](https://www.thatgamerguy.com) \n\nMy blog is where I go to lay out ideas I have for games we'd like to see. In fact that's the name of the series!\n\nBe sure to check out other posts I have. I especially recommend the Assassins Creed set in Viking Britain post!\n\nThanks for reading and let me know what you think of my idea?"
9u9xhs,Left 4 Dead style game but its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.,"I was actually playing Warhammer: Vermintide when the idea crossed my mind. Obviously it would be 4 player coop, each player playing as one of the turtles; maybe even have Casey Jones has a playable character. The common enemies would be foot soldiers and maybe mousers. There are plenty of good bosses (like Beebop, Rocksteady, Krang, etc.) that you could throw in at the end of levels or they could be randomized like the tanks were in L4D. Anyways, I haven't put much more thought into other than that but as a 29 year old dad, I'd play the shit out of it."
9u8rtu,My Game Idea,"So my brother is working towards being a game developer and I've been working on a game idea to ask him to help me with. It's sort of Persona 5-esque. The city is running amuck with crime, some of the most severe from a gang called the Green Deck Gang (They leave player cards at every crime scene) You are a teenager, Melanie Page, after both your parents were civilian casualties from the Gang's crimes you and your siblings move in with a family friend who happens to be a police officer. After overhearing the police are nowhere near close to catching anyone in the gang, you vow to infiltrate the gang as a common street rat hoodlum and earn their trust til you bring the gang to its knees. You need to balance your normal life, being a student and a sister without arising suspicion about what your 'extracurriculars' are. Will you let the police catch as many men as possible every chance you go, will you get caught by the gang or the police, or will you climb the ranks to overthrow everyone and force all the goons to pay their dues? Thats what you get to determine. \n\nSorry, I'm new to this, any feedback would be cool. -Nerdly"
9u7v08,"A WW2 arcade FPS where armour, equipment, and weaponry upgrades are dependable on tech trees, which in turn are tied to which year you playing in. Once a tier is unlocked, you can go back any time to play in that year.","The idea would be to start in 1939 (tier 1) where WW2 equipment, armour, weaponry and even vehicles are at their most basic by the start of the war. As you advance through tiers, the game around you evolves as time also passes. 1945 would be the final tier.\n\nYou can only start with nations such as Britain, France, Germany, etc. as other nations (such as the USA) had not yet entered the war and you must progress through other trees to unlock more nations. Some nations will not make it to the final year of 1945.\n\nProgress made for axis countries will only benefit other axis countries and vice verse for allied countries.\n\nThere will be various game modes ranging from the standard team deathmatch, domination, etc. with game modes that expand maps and objectives as the game moves on, much like in Battlefield. There will be ranked modes as well as unranked, and maybe a server-based WW2 multiplayer campaign that advances the year by one every week then resets after 1945 has been completed where plays can unlock unique items.\n\nThere will be various classes to play ranging from assault to tank commander.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to try your best to get a step ahead of your opponents, much like how WW2 was in real life.\n\nThere will other advances in the game to gain various advantages over your opponents, such as radar and surveillance technology."

9u2y2w,Post apocalyptic vehicular combat game about a solar powered car.,"**Plot**\n\n\nYou are an post apocalyptic adventurer who stumbled upon an mysterious car in  the middle of nowhere.After examining the car, you discover that the car is both solar powered(which is most reliable source of energy in your world)  and biodiesel powered (most of the few vehicles that remain in your era are powered by organic matter).\nAs you progress through the game, you would learn that your car may hold the key to mystery of the mythical city of Ra, the home of the people who are so wise, they made their own sun for their needs.\n\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n\nInitially, the player's car is  very unequipped to survive combat or the various conditions of the wasteland so he/she have to earn scarps( in game currency) through trading between various settlements,being  a courier, bounty hunting, etc.All the equipment/weapons in the car would deteriorate with with time(the rate of deterioration depends on the quality of the equipment, weather conditions and the in game difficulty), so it is necessary to always repair your car the moment you arrive in a settlement with a mechanic present.The car can relay on solar power while making long journeys far from any settlement or city state without the worry running out of fuel, but biodisel is important if you want to outrun bandits, assassins hired to kill you steal you car or  the hostile mutant fauna that roams the wastland. Since the game is mostly vehicle based, the player character cannot leave his or her car while traveling the wastes.The PC can only do that in the settlements. \n\n\n "
9u2hra,"Fallout but it's a turn based JRPG/xcom, uses telltales story telling devices, has consequences like heavy rain, and exploration like metro","this spin off is based around the idea that you are a member of the Zetans trying to learn more about the world. Your race has access to both time travel and the ability to land anywhere on the planet (though for whatever reason you just stick with America for most ops) \n\nYou are an elite Zetan that has both the ability to transmorph into any race and communicate effortlessly using psychic powers (this is related to the tech that alien artifact Lorenzo Cabot is wearing in fallout 4) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis game explores all lore that isn't directly present in fallout games \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfor one mission (example) you choose to take on the identity of a Brotherhood of Steel knight and partake in Paladin Danses mission to save his dear friend who ran away. The story is told ala telltale with choices in dialogue that can alter the story (not cannon, but as a time travel anything can happen) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother mission involves you as a spy pre-war trying to help the human race prevent atomic annihilation, there are multiple options for this mission, but no matter what you do you never are able to prevent anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nItems are pre determined during the missions, Perk cards are typically well hidden, and must be swapped around as a max of 3 are able to be held each mission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour Zetan's S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats can be adjusted before you take on another mission, certain stats will help you out more than others. And of course, the lower your intelligence, the less intelligent your Zetan sounds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause you can set your race, choosing synth will appear as human until you begin to take damage. People's opinions of you may change if this happens, for better or for worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChoosing to be a vault dweller is basically easy mode as this is the fastest way to access vats, which during turn based combat increases accuracy and the amount of moves you can use per turn. Other ways of getting a pip-boy include, pickpocketing one, killing a vault dweller, finding them hidden randomly in vault tec chests, trading for them. However, vault dwellers will also lack knowledge of the outside world meaning until they learn enemies strength and weaknesses they will not be able to critical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupermutants have the highest base melee and can be increased by having a zetan with a high strength build, but will have lower accuracy even if your zetan has high perception. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCombat like I said could be JRPG, but it could also be work like XCOM in my opinion. Which would work better would be up to the developer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCo-op would be enabled ala borderlands, difficulty increases when this happens. enemy health might scale if you're a significantly higher level, like during new game plus, but also the enemies AI will advance to try and beat you with more players. Unless the enemy is super mutants, then just more supermutants might show up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPathfinding during a mission would be pretty dead set like metro is, but certain speech checks and lockpicking could enable a secondary or even third path to appear, altering the end result for the mission. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding player made missions, these would be text only, but the main missions from Bethesda would be voice acted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere will be 1 hard mission as an easter egg upon clearing the other missions where you play as a zetan because your cloaking device failed. Everyone will be hostile to you and and your only mission is to survive as long as you can. Upon clearing the enemies, you get a transmission, mothership zeta was destroyed leaving you stranded in the wastelands. Mission end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo all in all, metro exploration though more advanced, either xcom or JRPG combat(personally I think xcom would be sick) , items are pre determined, perk cards swapping changes how you interact with both the world and the battlefield, story is told like a tell tale game in a way, all weapons have a chance during the storylines to have a random legendary modifier on them. Ammo is found in both predetermined spots as light, heavy, special, grenades and on dead enemies or pickpocketed from people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game uses both an autosave feature at checkpoints and a save state feature.

9u0jcr,Arena Edit,"You fight against waves of monsters, and (slightly) overpowered bosses in a platformer arena. However, you can edit the arena to give them advantages against bosses: place/remove blocks, platforms, ladders, conveyors, even place additional monster spawners for extra money/exp/challenges.\n\nPlacing and deleting blocks both cost money; so it is recommended not to change the layout of the arena too frequently.\n\nThe player can level up, but editing the arena is encouraged since the bosses are quite overpowered."
9u0643,Pawn shop game,You run a pawn shop buy and sell what people bring in to you also hire different people to do special things like for example find out how much something is really worth. Also skills like being able to talk someone down to lower amounts of money but very suttely other wise that system can be abused
9tyl4a,A creative racing game,"Who about a very customizable racing game. The racing would have the physics of something like Gran Turismo. This game would let you make your own tracks. You can also customize how the track looks and how the background looks like. You can also choose the weather, time of day, how fast time passes. who fast weather passes, and everything in between. You can choose what cars can race, and how long the races are. Paint schemes and vinyls for the cars would also be customizable. With monthly updates, this could be game of the year. Tell me what you think."
9tusxd,Dungeon builder game based on Divine Dungeon book series.,"So, I've been reading the book series Divine Dungeon by Dakota Kraut and I love the concept of how dungeons work. I think it would make a great idea for a game. The abridged explanation is this:\n\nDungeons are areas of high magical power caused by Dungeon Cores. The dungeon cores can manipulate matter and mana within their influence to change/expand the area, modify the creatures and items inside them, and create items in the dungeon. Dungeons have a Dungeon Wisp that helps them grow and learn how to become more powerful. Adventurers go into the dungeon for treasure, and to cultivate their magical abilities in the high mana environment. \n\nGame concept: You are a young Dungeon Core. You start with just a small cave of influence and maybe some small creatures to make into mobs. Once a creature dies in your dungeon, you can use it's template to create more mobs. Each day you have a specific amount of mana you are able to expend. You start out with a sort of all purpose mana and earth mana. As you get more experienced you unlock more kinds of mana. Stuff dying in your dungeon gives you mana. Eventually adventurers start showing up. Your job is to make them want to adventure in your dungeon, so you can kill them and use their equipment to create treasure for the next adventurers. If you make your dungeon too difficult, adventurers will stop showing up, as you're not worth the effort, or they'll just destroy you outright. \n\nMana types:  \nFire  \nWater  \nAir  \nEarth  \nCelestial  \nInfernal  \n\nYou can use mana types in different amounts to modify your mobs. Take a bunny and give him enough earth mana, and maybe he'll grow stone armor. \n\nI'm not entirely sure the difficulty on this, so I'm going to mark it as Intermediate, and if people disagree I'll change it. \n\nIf you're interested in a fantasy novel with meta jokes and pop culture references, I recommend the Divine Dungeon series."
9tr5z5,Top Down Arena Shooter called Ocean Sky Arena,"the gameplay will be based on classic Arena shooters such as Halo, Unreal Tournament, Quake. But it would be top down on arenas suspended in the Air under the blue sky and the ocean. The game goal is to control the areas on the map where power weapons are spawn."
9tqgzy,A 2D co-op survival game based on the Eastern Front during WW2," You play as a Soviet soldier on the Eastern Front who has to survive against extreme cold, disease, enemy soldiers, and fauna. You will need to grab materials such as warm clothes, gas masks, medical supplies, and weapons and ammunition. Warm clothes, weapons, and ammunition will be in scarce supply so you will have to loot it from dead bodies or caches spread across the map. If you die, it's over.\n \n There will be up to 30-40 players on each server and every once in a while, the commander will order an attack onto a German position. Those players who stay together as a squad will have increased winter resistance. If a point is captured, there will be plenty of supplies such as weapons, clothes, and ammunition. Alongside that, players who died before the capture would be able to respawn on that point. The player team would then have to hold the point against a counterattack of several German waves. \n\n Several campfires and houses will be spread across the map for the player to keep themselves warm. Along with them are weapon caches containing a basic rifle and pistol. If all the players die before capturing another point, the match ends. \n\n "
9tna2o,Space Opera Sim - Our gameplay is more complex than our graphics!,"Before anybody asks, yes i am new to this whole Reddit thing. Should i have skipped some important rule of etiquette, let me know. No flair, i really should find an index for what counts as ''intermediate'' and what counts as ''experienced''. **¡LONG POST!** I am really sorry for this, i love to write in as much detail as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an idea: a 2D, graphically basic, top-down perspective building simulator a-la-Rimworld or Prison Architect. But instead of building a settlement for having mental breaks in or a prison for claiming government grants, you are in space. You start with your own aestethically customizable captain, a hangar inside some space station, some materials scattered inside for making your starter ship and maybe two or three crewmembers to help you build it in person. You can make a salvage ship, a combat oriented ship, a passenger ship, whatever your starting materials (which will have to be a lot, since you can't harvest materials from nature) allow you to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually and as you make some good old sci-fi holographic cryptocurrency by mining, salvaging wrecks, being responsible for producing those same wrecks or flying civilians safely from point A to point B, you will have the posibility of expanding your ship. New functions can be added to the ship, which creates more posts to fill with crewmembers (such as gunners for turrets or comm officers for those flashy consoles). No crewmember will be the same as the other guy, having weaknesses and talents each. For example and for game balancing purposes, all of your starting crewmembers as well as the captain will be able to build, but later crewmembers might not! Be sure to have enough builders for those times when you add upgrades or make the ship bigger, or you'll have to hire temporary workers from the station.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere can be the ''casual'' mode, where you simply build the ship and do your thing, and the ''i-dunno-not-casual?'' mode, where crewmembers have needs, which means depending on the kinda ship you have and how long does it take it to do its thing and enter a station, you might have to put bathrooms, storage for nutrient paste (which is bought at the stations) so chefs can put tubes of it inside food synthethizers, cabins for the crew, etc. Passenger ships that are fast enough or make small trips, for example, might only need toilets. Bigger ships you live in, like cruisers or motherships, will need to be able to fulfill every need crewmembers might have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome posts will be more exhausting than others or require the person in charge to be in good condition, which means you can divide the job on shifts and have more than one person doing the same job. Helmsman too tired to continue controlling the engines? He'll just call his partner and leave him in charge while he goes to get his hour of Spaceflix-n-chill then to sleep. Food delivery cart driver injured by flying wrench? Have the other guy cover him while he gets stabilized enough. Or if he isn't, have him cover both shifts. He'll be fine. &gt;!In the news today: Food Hovercart Pilot falls asleep on wheel, crashes into flammable bay. Ship destroyed in the middle of deepspace.!&lt; A good thing about all of this is that space has no day/night cycle, so whoever is resting will rest as effectively as the next guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile on space stations, crewmembers can just leave the ship and satisfy their needs more effectively while the ship is idle, being resupplied or repaired, save for those helping on said tasks. A word of warning, though. While there are a variety of hangars you can put your ship in on each station, your ship might be too big for those available on a given day, or for any kind of hangar, at that. Then you'll have to dock with a gate like those used on real life airports, builders will need propelled spacesuits to do things (which forces you to buy them to have your crewmembers do the repairs, makes temporary hired workers more expensive and bots more convenient), and some of your crewmembers will still need to be at work, like the gunners and the guy who controls the radar, so you can fend off whatever pirate decided it was of any benefit to fire missiles at docked ships, while the chefs treat themselves to a piece of somebody else's cuisine. Alternatively, if you trust the defenses of the station enough or if you give radio equipment to certain groups of crewmembers, you can dismiss the gunners too, and/or in the case of those with a radio (you decide how many walkies you want to buy and distribute them manually), call them back with the ''Call all Gunners'' button (though that will take time).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere'll be ship-to-ship combat and crew-to-enemy combat. On the first, there's no close contact between ships, and you can choose what strategy to follow. I-shaped (conventional) ships that have their weapons on a line will want to circle around their target so they can use as many guns as possible. Say you made a T- shaped ship, on whose wings you put all the cannons and stuff, or that you put forward-facing cannons that are not able to be aimed by themselves but are very powerful so they are still convenient to have aboard. Then you'll want to be always facing the target. Ships that prefer to run away and can fit little places can choose to go through asteroid fields, following complex paths their attackers can't go through (forcing them to go around/above/under the obstacle, taking more time), or to hide inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrew-to-enemy combat can happen when a ship that carries soldier crew (thus being prepared for this kinda combat) invades another, which might or might not have soldiers aboard as well. Both pirates and yourself can board enemy ships, and try to take over them. At best, it is you succeeding to take over a crappy but somewhat nice ship you can repurpose at a station and assign an NPC captain to, sell or dismantle. At worst... you better be good at planning ambushes, which you can do. Equipment-wise, soldiers will be like a merge between the equipment system of Rimworld and the guards of Prison Architect: You buy weapons and armor at stations, and assign each piece to whatever guard you want. Then, they are told by the captain to pick them up from the ship armory. Dead people drop everything, while unconscious or crippled crew drop whatever they were holding, keeping their holstered items and equipped armor. This can be a double edged sword. It can mean a nice new rifle you won't have to pay for and that you can assign to somebody, or a mook that stealth-attacks one of your best men and turns himself into a juggernaut. Other kinds of crew are not trained for long weaponry, but can still use sidearms, or improvised melee weapons such as the *Magic Staff of Cleanliness* (mop) or a wrench.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis can be useful for ships like the passenger ones, where an event can make it so a passenger (or more) reveals himself to be a hijacker - you can have that beautiful and seemingly harmless flight attendant whip out some blaster and clip the guy in front of everybody, or get some stun batons and try to be a hero (very risky and best achieved by being stealthy, as the enemy will usually smuggle weaponry of their own) by stunning them and tying them somewhere to cash a nice bounty and/or avoid having the ship delayed post-flight by forensics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrewmembers will have different personalities, will have relationships between themselves, such as friendships, romances or even love triangles, and hidden traits that work like the Prison Architect ''reputations''. The way to know if there are people on your ship that is prone to losing control and attacking people/objects at random so you can sack them or have other crew take distance, is by having medbots and medics perform psychological tests on people, either individually, by ship section or by doing it to each new arrival. Beware! There can be false alarms, false ''all-is-ok'' diagnoses, and people can still change by way of psychological trauma or by having somebody near them that they really, really hate. So it's best to know who hates who, who is prone to smashing people's heads, who is about to hang himself in the bathroom and who managed to trick the doc by conducting new exams periodically or after certain events such as boardings where crew were killed, which means somebody inside the ship must have had lost a friend or a lover. On the opposite side, the death of somebody will cause sadness on those who liked them, and happiness on those who hated them. Be prepared to keep your favourite crewmember happy by engineering the deaths of everyone that is below 0 Relationship Points on their list!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere could also be a collection of scenarios with their own connected backstory, like the tutorial chapters of Prison Architect. Missions about making border runs to smuggle things on a speedy light freighter piloted by your very own Han Solo ripoff, blowing stuff up as ordered to you by somebody whose strings are being pulled by a bigger influence, a mission where your passenger spaceflight was delayed at the station and you must paint the ship red to make it fast enough to get to destination on time... &gt;!Here comes Char, the Red Charter Barge!!&lt; Who knows?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike both of its primary inspirations, this game would just start basic, then add all these cool gameplay mechanics over time with the use of updates. These are all loose thoughts, a lot of them. I hope somebody is able to gather enough of them someday and turns them into a big masterpiece, as i have not the resources nor the experience to make something like this, but i would gladly buy the thing, and would definitely want to see something like this made before the world ends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill edit post if i missed out something. Make your inquiries at the comments."
9tlyjv,"A puzzle game (or inventory system) in which you fit as many shapes as you can into a limited space, then stack more on top.","[I made a mockup of the basic concept here.](https://i.imgur.com/uiusCqg.jpg)\n\nYou have pieces of tile shapes that you must fit into a small area, but you're also allowed to stack pieces *on top* of other pieces (so long as every part of them falls on top pieces in the layer below).\n\nMy example mockup puzzle isn't the best... you could put the yellow shape on the 3rd layer and the last orange shape on top of that one in the 4th layer now that I think about it. But in the actual game, the shapes would be way more complex and be designed so that no-one shape fits wholly on top of any other single shape.\n\nEach shape is worth some points (perhaps depending on size) and those points are awarded multipliers based what layer they're stacked on. So putting bigger shapes in higher layers nets you more points. Your goal is to get as many points as you can with the shapes you have for the space you're given. Perhaps each stage has a point threshold you must pass.\n\n### A Neat Twist\n\nThe starting space doesn't *have* to be a boring rectangle. Some puzzle stages could be weird shapes. Or better yet, **maybe there is no starting area.** Instead, a bunch of pieces are ""first layer only"" pieces that you can freely arrange to essentially make the space you will put the rest of the pieces on. It would sort of look [like this.](https://i.imgur.com/LDcS7Xn.jpg) \n\n### Bonus Idea: Stacking Inventory System\n\nThis basic concept can be modified—or rather *simplified*—to work as either a stacking inventory system. So if a game would use a ""space-based"" inventory system (like in RE4 or the recent Deus Ex games) then the game could allow you to stack more items on top of other items. Much like if you were filling a box. Naturally, you wouldn't be allowed to stack items on top of consumable items, so you'd leave consumables for the top layers. And much like score multipliers in the puzzle game, the inventory system could grant bonuses to the items higher in the stack.\n\nOr equipment could grant bonus effects depending on what is stacked below/above an item. For example: if you stack a ""Silencer"" to fall on top of two different weapon, both weapons become silenced."

9tixwo,Dungeon maker,"Does anyone remember an old PSP game called dungeon maker.\n\nThe premise was your a dungeon lord and you build dungeons to attract monsters to kill.\n\nThe more levels you build the stronger the monsters become.  And the fancier the levels the stronger the monsters become.  You could make a basic tunnel or room for free.  But putting up fancy walls in your tunnel cost lots of coin.  (So you had to grind a lot to get money to buy better walls)\n\nClear the dungeon wait 24 hours and it’s repopulated again.  \n\nThere was a town nearby that gave quests, had merchants and all kinds of stuff\n\nYour character had 2 skill trees combat or magic.\n\nCombat had slashing weapons, blunt, or ranged.  While magic had trees for fire, ice and I think it was wind. \n\n\n\n\nHow to monetize it.\n\nRemember how I said that making the dungeons fancier draw in more powerful monsters.  Have all the materials sold at a builder merchant.  Sell gem packs where people can buy chests that has a chance for different materials.  And maybe chests for weapons, and armor items.\n\nIn the psp game if you used a material you could take that section down and reuse the material.  For the iOS style game don’t do that.  Once a material is used if you upgrade it then you loose it. \n[link to game play video of the original ](https://youtu.be/RyyJ6Mx7Q8E)\n\n\n"

9mixcm,A stealth/strategy assymetric multiplayer combat 3D third person game where a stealthy guy tries to kill a commandy guy,"So basically theres matches and in those matches there are 2 (or MAYBE 3) classes you CAN'T choose (its random)Theres the stealthy guy which has basically everything a generic stealth guy have in generic stealth games. It gameplay would be sneaking thorugh a building to kill the commandy guy in third person. And it can destroy commmunication stations. that's about it i didnt tought of any mechanics to it post it down below so i can update the thread and make it more noice.Theres the commandy guy which is sit in a room with a map where it can see all of your soldiers, and where the sneaky guy was last saw. Its gameplay is basically moving the soldier to different places to defend yourself, however, theres a catch: it can only know where the sneaky guy is when some soldier that saw it for the last time reports it via the communications station.Maybe there will be a captain class where they are like soldiers but more strong and have free will, even tough the commandy guy can request to them to go to certain places. If they exist, they would be the only ones capable of using the communications station"

9mfxif,Co-op apocalypse,"I have this game in my mind i always fantasize. Its a 2 player co-op apoclypse survival where the 2 of you manages the fort. Its a brain and brawn concept i would like to see. The first player is the one adventuring in the wastelands scavenging and killing things. We make it hard for him to wander alone by removing his game indicators such as ammo, healths, maps, and etc. Also ramping up the difficulty of every battles even to the most basic mob. For our brawn to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, there will be this designated brain for all the operation. This where the 2nd player comes in, the brain. He will assisst player 1 in all his adventures through a mic worn by him. He will constantly feed 'brawn' all the information that needed for his adventuring. He also have all the advance gadget and technology that will support the player 1 in any way. Like, scouting for enemies with a flying drone that can reach miles above. Assissts in defending the camp with mobile turrets, and many more. All of this will be done from the comfort of his fort or base. While player 1 is constantly exploring every nook and cranny of the world, player 2 will be busy researching and developing new gadgets and technology. Player 2 will also be responsible micromanaging for all the resources that player 1 gathers. Player 2 will also have to evaluate all the things player 1 encounter such as various flora and fauna that may help you. This is like on the spy movies where one is on the field and the other is sitting on a chair in front of his computer. But this time you're in a post-apocalytic world but survival is a must. This will give you choice to continue your previous life before the apocalypse. Which is being lazy while on a computer. While you help others to do the dirty work for you. I dont know if this dream of mine is already realized. But do inform me if theres already a masterpiece like this and i would like to pour my soul onto it."

9mc8fm,A stealth game where you need to be near a partner because the commands you give them can be heard by npcs the louder they are.,"Basically if you are far away and sloppy, enemies are more likely to hear dialogue or commands. I say commands because I imagine a Tom Clancy stealth game having this for some reason.

9mc1cp,Retropocalypse (Squad based Open world shooter ),"This game has 6 classes: Two offence, Two defence, and two support. \n\nOffence classes:\n- Jetman \n- Pioneer \n\nDefence Classes: \n- Marksman \n- Signaller \n\nSupport Classes: \n- Field Doctor \n- Saboteur \n\nThe Pioneer has the fastest movement speed, but has the second lowest health and the highest damage vulnerability. She is armed with a flamethrower, a sawn-off, and a shovel. Her flamethrower deals high damage as close range, and causes its victims who haven't already been burned to a crisp to take afterburn damage even after she has been killed. Her sawn-off is good for reaching targets she can't reach with his flamethrower, for example when she's underwater or if he has simply ran out of gasoline. Her shovel is pretty much her last resort, when all ammunition has been exhausted. On her back lies a highly volatile and vulnerable tank of gasoline, which can be shot to cause her to explode. In fact, it's best that a Marksman cause her to explode from a long distance, killing her and others nearby. \n\nThe Jetman has abysmal movement speed on the ground, but using her jetpack she can hover above the air. She can also reach anywhere and attack from anywhere on the map. She deals massive amounts of splash damage using her RPG. She has a Sawn-off as her secondary. She also has the highest amount of health, but takes criticals whilst in the air. She uses a trench club as her melee.\n\nThe Signaller can deal a high amount of damage by calling attacks from the air using her Flare Pistol, but has low health herself and limited offensive capabilities. His main weapon is the Sawn-Off, which she can use to protect herself, whilst her Flare Pistol can summon high damage attacks which instantly kill anyone in their AoE, as well as other forms of support. She uses a telephone pole as her melee.\n\nThe Marksman can deal accurate, rapid damage from a long distance using her telescopic rifle. Headshots deal massive amounts of damage and result in instakills.  However, she cannot fire whilst unscoped. She also has a sawn-off for self defence. She uses a spear as her melee. \n\nThe Field Doctor heals her teammates, using a Bloodhook to latch on to her teammates, providing them with +10 health a second.  She can also provide her teammates with temporary immunity to all damage when she is fully Bloodboosted. She can also choose to boost the speed, damage, or accuracy by switching between different modes. She also has a Autoheal, which fires healing rounds that heal her teammates rapidly at 2 HP a hit. She uses a bonesaw as her melee.\n\nThe Saboteur can report back the statistics of the enemy team, as well as kill her teammates from the back using her Garrote, she can also use her Flashbang to stun enemy players, and her Metabushi to blind enemy players. She also has the Camouflage ability, which makes her invisible whilst stationary. She has extremely low health, the lowest amongst the 6 classes. \n\nWhen a player starts a game, they will be asked to choose one of the 6 classes or have a choice of being assigned to a random Squad without the class of their choice, or choose a Squad of their own. They can also form their own Squad with their own friends. A Squad can only have one of each class. Squads are not permanent and a player can leave a squad and join another squad who needs their class. \n\nThe game has multiple modes: Raid the Airship - which challenges squads to battle it out for as much loot as possible, which they can use to customise and build their base, or one time use items like Treatises of Peace, which prevent enemy squads from destroying their base or killing them. Weekly Quests - which gives all squads online quests to accomplish to gain event more loot. Juggernaut, which turns all members of one lucky squad into creatures with high health and no ranged attacks. Killing other squads gains them Loot, whilst being killed gives other squads Loot. Vehicles exist in this game and can be found all over the map, and can be kept by Squads, stolen, or bought. They can also be used. There are also two separate game styles: Creative, which makes life much easier as Loot is easier to come by, and Survivor, where loot is harder to come. You can also hunt, get married, taunt, read, play minigames using the Arcade, destroy other squads. The possibilities are endless. \n\nRules:\n- No teamkill\n- No griefing without a Declaration of War \n- No kicking people out of servers for no reasons.\n\nThe Day of Debauchery:\nThe Day of Debauchery is like the Purge. Moderators and Admins will not be online and squads can do whatever they want. \n\nMorale:\nWhen a player keeps dying the game will progressively get harder, I.e deceased firing speed, movement speed, and etc. This can be mitigated by winning more games. In contrast, a player that keeps winning or keeps getting achievements will cause the game to become progressively easier, I.e increased speed and etc.\n\nFour Capital Crimes:\n- Players caught scamming, bullying, or griefing on any other days besides the DoD will be banned for a week. \n- Cheating (our servers are VAC-secured. This will cause a lifelong ban.)\n- Players will be banned through a public execution. All players on the server will be called to the middle of the map to see the avatar of the player that is about to be banned either temporarily (driven out of the map) or permanently (killed by firing squad) being punished.

9m9hrj,If only someone could remake Jersey Devil,"**If somebody competent could get the rights to remake this underrated late 90's gem and polish the clunky gameplay to take full advantage of its concepts, I'd bet money that this franchise would make a comeback.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe titular protagonist was like a charming baby's first discount-Batman and I remember watching the animated intro multiple times in a row as a kid, sometimes without actually playing. Such an idea is too good to be left wasted!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew Jersey's Pine Barrens folklore has several iconic urban legends (Captain Kidd, The Black Dog, The Golden Haired Girl, The Black Doctor, etc) that could be adapted into a remake too. Imagine the colorful cast that could be created?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, the more mature elements of their respective backgrounds would be revised or omitted for younger audiences' sake but they could've made for some entertaining supporting characters &amp; surprise boss encounters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese characters' motivations would differ, depending on their role in the plot (Ex- Some could be angry over Dr. Knarf's mutants disrupting the balance in their homes), and J.D. could even befriend a couple-few along the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy beating them in combat or contests, doing quests for them, or helping them fight off Knarf's forces from their domain (Each hub reflects their mythos more), you can gain a playable ally with unique abilities (similar to **Spyro: YotD).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would play into J.D. establishing himself as New Jersey's top legend in town, increasing his infamy in a society that fears &amp; hates him (though some hostages he saved will know his true heroic nature and be grateful he's out there).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe remake's developers can also embrace the classic 90's Warner Bros.-inspired wackiness by including more satire, meta-humor (almost like a kid-friendly Deadpool), tropes, genre sound-effects, puzzles, and mechanics of loony nostalgia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, if Gilles Léveillé wouldn't return to compose new music, perhaps new hired talent can craft modern tracks to complement his classics and let players choose which they'd like to hear (like the **Spyro Reignited Trilogy).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, **Jersey Devil** is imo one of those creative goldmines among B-platformers that unfortunately never got the momentum it needed due to limited resources + having to compete against more influential titles of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If it were possible for the new generation to take a chance at restoring it to newfound glory and expand the original vision to new heights, I'd happily support that project! What do you all think? Feedback is welcome!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n😈🎃 **#RemakeJerseyDevil** 💜👍﻿"

9lzond,Gun Gauntlet - A game about a knight wielding a gun in medieval times,"This game would have a simple concept. Think about your typical medieval world, with two twists: One, it's realistic, in that it doesn't have magic, fantastic creatures or supernatural beings. Second, your protagonist is not a simple knight in shining armour: He is a pragmatist who has a gun!\n\nThe plot follows a knight who is contacted by some ""entities"" who offer him the use of some ""special artifacts"" if he helps them find a treasure hidden in his land. As payment, he would receive half of that treasure. With a civil war happening in his kingdom and a taste for adventure, the knight accepts the offer and his journey begins...\n\nThe game would be relatively open-world: You would have some hub areas with side missions, alongside the main missions. Obviously, the guns would be the main treat of the game: They would be realistic, and your ammunition would be limited. Also, your main character isn't a badass one-man army. Without his guns, he would be a ""normal"" human, that dies in about 3 or 2 hits if he doesn't dodge or block enemy attacks. That means you need to use stealth, traps and smart fencing to win his fights when he doesn't have access to his ranged weapons.\n\nAfter each mission, you would be able to buy upgrades to your armour and new traps to use, alongside new guns and ammunition  for them. The game would get more challenging as you progress by adding smarter enemies and even other merceneries who somehow got access to guns like yours. "

There would be good/bad endings depending on your actions, and you are encouraged to replay to discover the ultimate ending where all correct choices are made and all special items found or utilized."
9lyvhs,Hostage Negotiation,"I'm imagining a game with thousands of dialogue options and choices. The dialogue would be text based though, so this should still be doable for someone dedicated to it.\n\nI'm imagining an art style and dialogue system similar to Gunpoint.\n\nDo you send in a SWAT team? Do you satisfy a demand for food? Do you set up snipers? Can you convince the criminals to let some of the hostages go?\n\nYou have finite resources at your disposal, X hostages to rescue, and Y criminals to arrest or kill. Arresting awards more points than killing. Take too long, deny too many demands, or otherwise freak out the criminals, and hostages may die... or the criminal may not have the guts to do it (the player has to figure that out).\n\nThere could be significant variability in each hostage situation, aside from the number of hostages and criminals. How armed are the criminals? Do they have an explosive? Is there anyone on the inside who you could reach and make into an inside-man? Does the local area offer good sniper posts? Are there multiple entrances to the building?\n\nUnexpected variables may also crop up. Weather conditions, hostages having medical emergencies, hostages trying to ""be the hero"", etc.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, there could also be a reputation and upgrade system. The outcomes of previous hostage negotiations will open extra dialogue options, and color how the criminals react to you (they may be nervous, cocky, or downright afraid of you). Upgrades could include gaining access to more utilities for hostage negotiations, as well as putting your character through special training to open up new dialogue options (e.g. if your character has an education in psychology, they may be able to better reason with the criminals)."

9lrdfh,An evolution simulator,"A game would have a handful of presets where you effectively have an established race and all that and you have an objective in each of them that you’re trying to complete. every time you die you get two skill points put where you want, and your other skills get randomly either upgraded or downgraded. But if you just die super frequently to cheat the system, eventually the game will pick up on this and will start taking away massive amounts of skill points from the category you seem to like to invest in the most\n\nFor instance maybe you’re a hunter in an ancient extinct tribe and you’re only objective is “kill animals for food”. You can craft weapons and such to do so but primarily you have jump height, health, speed, etc. \n\nIf you just keep jumping off cliffs for free evolution skill points, the game might take away 20 skill points from the “striking damage” category.\n\nThis wouldn’t be an RPG, you may have skill levels but their aren’t quests or anything. You have a couple very basic objectives to stick through in a ridiculously hard game filled with PVE combat.\n\nSome play modes like maybe a bee hive might be a casual mode where you can die as much as you want but whenever you bring pollen back to the hive or whatever you get one free evolution point to spend on making your bees faster or able to carry more pollen or whatever.\n\nAnother might play mode might be as a bug in a jar, and you unlock abilities to design your own bug in a jar by playing through different presets. Basically a little boy comes by, shakes everything up, and the bugs start fighting and your bug has to fight the other bugs. You can design how it looks and behaves based off unlocked features and after you defeat one bug, the next will be automatically scaled to be harder to beat. Eventually you might start having to fight snakes and rats and stuff too inside of a box. Who knows. The thing doesn’t even have to be a jar or a box I just think you could get some funny background images of a little bit picking his nose watching or whatever\n\nYou could also have a skill mode, where you and a friend have the same amount of skill points to put in whatever you want, and you two design your own bugs or animal or whatever and you fight in an arena (jar, box, forest, whatever). You have the same amount of skill points so it should be THEORETICALLY equal, but the abilities you have are not the same. So you need to choose a balanced set of abilities to counter your friend. \n\nIf you’re bored you can have EvE battles, where you just design the animals/bugs or randomize them and have them fight. You can also get really cool ideas from them as well.\n\nThere wouldn’t be a plot, it would just be a casual game about surviving in a races niche and earning evolutionary skill points, or battling in some kind of arena in a battle mode."
9lqjpq,"Banished, but more","Like many people who are interested in city or castle builders, I bought Banished and enjoyed it. However, I haven't played it past the one city I played in it. I feel like there is little end game and there is simply not enough content in the game to make it replayable. It is interesting, it's just not enough. So let's make a new game based on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, like Banished, you start off with a handful of families and the bare resources they have. You have to gather what you can from there. Fish, forage, and hunt for food, maybe each family can start a little garden. Gather logs or fell trees for wood. There might even be surface resources of finer quality, stone, some shiny rocks, but nothing that you might be able to use yet, save for fine metals or gems that might be traded or sold. However, there should be a combat mechanic. Some large animals are going to resent being hunted, or worse prey on your villagers. Raiders and pirates will eventually want what you have, even if it is just dragging people off as slaves. Eventually, you might encounter professional soldiers or mercenaries you might want just temporary shelter and safety, or might be keen on your goods. As the town grows in productivity and defenses, you might meet envoys from other cities or maybe even empires who want to conduct trade or contact your people as mercenaries or demand tribute lest their mighty wrath wipe you out. To guard against them you might need to start with a simple militia and throw up palisades, give your foresters and hunters lodges to hide in when threatened by wild beasts or in need of a rest without having to return all the way home. Eventually you construct watchtowers and extend your sight, stone walls (in layers as your city grows), archer's towers, iron gates, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResource and supply chains. To me there is never enough. I think supply chains should be big, with lots of options. Lots of resources. Don't just grow wheat. Choose from wheat, barley, rice, corn, sorghum, oats, rye, millet, and more. Raise apples, pears, blueberries, blackberries, oranges, peaches, grapes, olives, watermelons, guava, papayas, lemons, limes, avocado, grapefruit, pineapples, and much more. Mine gold, marble, silver, brass, bronze, copper, platinum, electrum, jade, lapis lazuli, quartz, emerald, sapphire, ruby, diamond, peridot, aquamarine, and I think you get the point. There should be variety and choices should matter. You can make beer and wine out of fruits and grains, but probably not avocado or olives. Likewise, olives make for great oil, but watermelon won't work. There should be huge variety with many uses so you can almost collect and accumulate them. Supply chains should give you a lot of options. Raw lapis lazuli is quite pretty and can be traded, but has little use in chunks or blocks. But a Gem Carver can polish and finish it so a Jeweler can combine it with copper or gold or silver or brass or bronze to make the appropriate jewelry so they can either sell it directly or sell it to a Merchant who can make a more proper profit from it that can be taxed. A blacksmith will need an increasingly upgraded workshop to properly work iron into usable shapes and turn it into proper steel for weapons, but a blacksmith knows little about other minerals. A goldsmith can work gold into jewelry and decor, while a silversmith will make fine accessories and opulent flatware. Other minerals may need specialists to work them. The more resources you have access to, the better goods you can make. A bowyer will make bows out of bone and sinew, but fine woods and more durable fibers make for much better and more effective bows. Eventually your city will carve out a niche with whatever specialists and goods you have and can produce. Maybe you develop trade relations and are able to finish goods that other areas mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can start another city with enough resources and supply them from your home city, securing the trade lines with professional soldiers of your own. You can also interact with other groups, as mentioned, to form strong alliances or bitter rivals. Brigand groups and pirate holds that once threatened you can be wiped out by military expeditions. Go to war with enemy empires and might them come to heel, one city at a time. Build your own castle and have expanded civics options as you develop a proper infrastructure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt could be that certain specialists have to come from outside your city as wanderers or the homeless since it's unlikely your starting band has those skills. Smiths, military trainers, masons, and others might need to come from outside, as liberated slaves, wanderers, exiles, and so forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, just my thoughts. I want more and combat."

9louvd,Magic Battle Royale Game,So the basic premise.. im not positive on the plot or background but its pretty simple. You are all in some kind of battle royale style tournament.  Your all battleing for something.. something like a all powerful object such as a grail or codex. Or maybe your all apprentice mages battleing to become the next magician or something. So its like fortnight and harry potter put together. With a pretty dark soulsish type theme and environment.  The gimick besides obviously winning the game and obtaining the power could be something like this. Every player has a peice of the power split of into themselves so like. Everytime you get a kill or elimination on somone the portion of the abilities and power that they hold are transfered to you. Increasing your basic stats and allowing you to invest points into different spells or abilities. Say you kill 10 people. Then somone kills you later on. That player would receive all the accumlative points that you have collected so far.

They play from a first or third-person view. They have access to weapons and items they scavenge from around the map to defend themselves.\n\nA fifth person controls “the hive mind” from a top down view. They are able to spawn various “units” in the form of groups of zombies/more powerful creatures onto the map by spending “mutation points” they generate over time. They can control these units by selecting where they want them to move to/if they want them to tear down boarded windows or barriers/use a special ability unique to the type of unit.\n\nWhen the game starts and a timer counts down. When it gets to zero, a rescue vehicle arrives at one of a few predestined locations. The human survivors must last long enough to survive the countdown and make it to the rescue vehicle. The “hive mind” player must generate creatures and direct them around the map to try and take out, flank, divide or overwhelm the human players before they can escape in the rescue vehicle.\n\nThere will be items scattered around for the humans to scavenge that can be used as weapons or support items, or components to craft into other items. Humans can build up some rudimentary barriers and generally work together to survive the horde.\n\nSpecial generated tokens can provide one side or the other with special bonuses to coax them into risk traveling around the map.\n\nThe hive mind units can range from a small group of basic humanoid mutants that move as a single unit. Other, more powerful creatures can have unique abilities like scaling walls, ranged attacks, strength to destroy certain environmental barriers, flying, etc. The more valuable/powerful the unit the more “mutation points” it costs to generate.\n\nNOTE: Each map should have numerous indoor and outdoor areas, multiple paths and entrances."

If a normal human is holding the banner the nationalistic spirit takes possession of their body, culturally this is seen as a great honor so if a banner carrier falls another human will rush to take his place.\n\nThe technology level of this time period will be muzzle loading muskets with one or two volleys before a bayonet charge being the primary method of engagement. Troop morale will be important to maintain and if losses stack up too quickly your soldiers will abandon you and retreat.\n\nThe player can only be killed if his banner is desecrated. Enemy soldiers need to control the ground on which the banner was dropped for 20 seconds. New soldiers can be recruited under you banner by passing by idle soldiers who have not been assigned a banner or who have fled when their morale failed.\n\nThere will be two multiplayer game modes:\n\n1) No respawn, the goal is to wipe out all enemy banners on a battle field. Desecrated banner players can still control soldiers on their side, but must remain a set distance from the live banner leading that soldier or loose control to the AI.\n\n2) With respawn enabled via airship troop drop. The Goal is to plant your banner on a structure vital to the other team while the other team tries the same."

Here are the ways they could parody the inaccuracies in *Jurassic Park* (and dinosaur media in general).\n\n- There is a cleanly-defined division between herbivorous and carnivorous animals. The herbivores are peaceful and gentle, and the carnivores (including the tiny foxes and raccoons) are ferocious murderbeasts that attack every living thing they see and can chew through solid metal.\n- *All* Cenozoic megafauna are referred to as mammals - including the birds and reptiles. (As a reference to how pterosaurs and marine reptiles are often called dinosaurs.)\n- The animals are only referred to by their genus name, and each genus is treated as one species. (For instance, lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars are lumped together as *Panthera*.)\n- If an animal has large canines, it's a carnivore - even if it's a herbivore IRL, like hippos and gorillas.\n- Each genus has a description in the guide describing it and getting facts wrong. For instance, the mammoth's description would say something along the lines of ""Because this animal lived in colder climates than other elephants, some artists reconstruct it with a shaggy coat; however, there is no evidence for this, and other elephant species have skin impressions showing they had bare skin.""\n\nAny other suggestions?"
9wqo5w,How to do a Build-Your-Card Ccg-style card game,"A CCG-Style game where you build the actual cards in the deck from individual point components. For the sake of example, we'll assume Hearthstone-style mechanics for the overall card game, and this will only go into the card-crafting parts.\n\n\nAll decks have exactly 40 cards. 25 Common (10 point) cards, 10 Rare (15 point) cards, and 5 legendary (25 point) cards. All cards start as a blank slate, as 1 mana spells that do nothing. \n\n\nFrom there you can add modifiers to the cards. Adding a '1 attack 1 defense' modifier costs 3 point and makes it as creature instead of a spell. Adding battle-cry - deal one damage to opponent adds another 3 points. Then, increasing its damage and health to 4 costs 10 points! You want this to be a common monster, but it's currently at 16 points. Increasing its Mana Cost to 5 gives it -6 points. So now you have a 4/4 creature with a 1 damage battlecry for 4 mana. \n\n\nFurther effects would be required to give the game more interesting mechanics. Adding the keyword 'zombie' to a card might be worth 4 points. But you have some cards and effects that give special bonuses to 'zombie' cards. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, the game would likely be best split into 'leagues' like Path of Exile, with leagues being the recommended format for players. Leagues could have special or even randomized effects to choose from when constructing decks. Giving individual /random goals to players will help them build new decks, and the overall availability of effects will help keep the meta from becoming stale or decks becoming too common. \n\n\nFor monetizing its important that no element of power is ever sold. Such a niche, quirk based system couldn't survive the backlash. However, there is the question of how Card Art could work in such a game. Players, with the ability to create and name their cards, will be able to unlock new pieces of card art to add to their card. Card art can be done in a sticker-style system where you can layer basic shapes as well as more detailed pieces into a single card art image. Buying new pieces of card art would be where actual purchases come in. \n\n\nBonus mechanics - \n\n\nSnips. The first player starts with two snips. The second player starts with three. A snip can be used to remove a component from a card in your hand. If this component contributed points, it would automatically lower the mana cost of the card to its lowest legal level. If this was a detriment to the card, it will automatically increase the mana cost of the card until it is legal. For instance, if you had 4 mana but wanted to play a 5 mana card, you could use a snip to remove the battle cry, for instance, dropping the minimum mana cost to keep the card legal down to 4 and playing the card.

9wqnyu,The best type of game for naruto,"There are so many fighting naruto games but i honestly think that one of the worst genres for that ip. If i could make one it would be a co-op, instinced based game. I know everyone would like to see a open naruto game but let me explain why i think thus would would just as well if not better.\n\nIn the naruto series its mainly about the character going on missions. They always have a task and very rarely have to find one for themselves. So to match the core of the ip to the core of the game, it should focus on completing the mission given to you. The show already has a difficulty mechanic implemented that supports this with the letter grade missions the character are sent on. \n\nCo-op should also be a core mechanic because it is definitely a core theme to the show itself. It should have a simple group finding system if you don't have friends to play with like warframe has. Is you want to solo you can but the game should definitely be designed with co-op in mind.\n\nNow let me explain why the fighting genre is a bad genre for the ip. There are so many stills in the series that can't be implemented because it either slows down the action or takes control away from the character. Stealth also plays a part in the show which can't be done well do to fightimg games centering around reacting you your opponent. So even when these skills are implemented they are done so in clunky ways or don't even resemble their effect in the show.\n\nNow some people would hate to see pvp go and i am one of them. But PvP could still be implemented well in a game like this. I was wondering how cool it would be to be sent on a mission to protect something and another team is sent to destroy it. This would most likely be a optional thing to opt into but it could add a level of depth to PvP since the objective can change depending on the mission and also brings a change of pace if you are tired of fighting npc mobs.\n\nFor other features I'd like to see is a customizable character players can experience their own ninja stories with. Along with a unique progression system where you can learn skills from cannon characters by training with them. You can pick a kekkei genkai to start out with in exchange for a negative impact but if you have it there would be a trainer or a few to learn skills from for that kekkei genkai.\n\nThere are so many possibilities if they went with this format to make a game by. I wonder why it hasn't happen yet."
9wql66,Narrative lore ‘telephone’ exploration detective/puzzle game,"I was thinking recently about the shared history of religion; some event happened thousands of years ago, and has been interpreted in many different ways to create the current religions. Religions all share a common history but have This basic idea led me to think of a game. \n\nYou would explore a map with different regions. Each region would have a similar set of environmental clues, scraps of books, and NPCs to chat with, but each region’s lore would be slightly different than the others. As you go around you’d develop the connections between the lores and eventually have a clear idea of the true history. Then at the end be presented with a riddle...\n\n\nI don’t have a mechanic or art style but I thought it might be fun and rewarding to find the similarities between the beliefs while exploring. "

9wha3a,Space Organization Sim but with more end goals and more polish than KSP.,"I love KSP but the story mode is boring. And even when you play sandbox your reward for getting to a new planet or moon or what not is basically just information.\n\nI think if a similar game was made, but with the goal being more on trying to create colonies on other planets rather than simply exploration it would be a far more engaging.

9wehmu,List of ideas what to do with 3D QR codes,"I made an asset for Unity that can generate QR codes in 3D. There's a list with ideas in the documentation that may inspire some of you. Doesn't need to be 3D or a QR code.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPossible applications of 3D QR codes:\n\n* Imagine a camera flying through a maze and then taking off to the sky, turning back to the maze it just left and you see a QR code. Take out your smartphone and scan the code.\n* Hidden Easter egg hanging on a wall but only recognizable when you look at it at a certain angle.\n* Ad with animated QR code at the end flying at you for dramatic effect. Standing still long enough for you to scan it with your phone.\n* Your game gives you a secret code for a raffle. The QR code is animated so that people with cheap and slow phones don’t have a chance to win the prize.  **\]:-&gt;**\n* Showing off the URL to your website. “Can you give me the link to your site?” – “Sure. Here’s a QR code on my phone for you to scan.” – “Why is it moving?” – “Because it’s linked to the gyroscope.”\n* You enter some text (can be a URL) and a QR code maze gets generated. Surviving all the dangers in the maze you win all the fights and reach the exit. Now the camera shows the maze from above with the trail you left. You can save a screenshot and now have a unique QR code you had to fight for.\n* A variation of the “build the pattern we show you here” games. Two main differences: 1. it’s lot more complicated and 2. you don’t need to be 100% perfect and complete because of the error correction. Show the pattern with a too difficult contrast for QR code scanners so it is only possible to scan it after you move blocks with a darker color at the right places.\n* Just a display of a QR code maze in a shop window with animated monsters running around in it. Or something specific to the shop like cars and the QR code is the URL to the company’s website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9wdqg2,TV Network Simulator,"If you have played Total Extreme Wrestling (TEW 2016) before, this game idea takes a lot of ideas from there.\n\nWhen you load up a fresh version of TEW 2016, you only start with the CornellVerse, an entirely different universe in the world of wrestling that even has it's own backstory, of course you have databases uploaded by modders and fans of the game too.\n\nWhen starting a fresh save on the TV Network game, you would be given the same thing, an entire world of TV Channels that you've never seen before, this is mostly to bypass copyright issues.\n\nWhen starting a game, you have four different paths to choose from unlike TEW. You can choose to play as a Producer, where you produce shows that you are given by the owner (or pitch yourself) of your current network and you also hire actors to fit certain roles, and writers to accompany you with your shows. You could also choose to play as an Owner where you control anything and everything pertaining to your network, including creating TV Shows (going in-depth and setting target audiences and product settings), purchasing, selling, and renewing shows, controlling merchandise for certain shows, and even creating and deleting channels for your network. Alternatively, you could also choose to play as an Actor, where you can send and receive negotiations to/from networks, and eventually you could branch your career from actor to director or producer (if your actor has reached 10+ years in the industry with a high amount of respect). So that also means that the last path for you to choose from is Director. The Director path gives you the chance to pitch ideas too but you also get to hire actors along with the Producer.\n\nSo for example, if I started a game in a real world database and chose to play as a Producer working for ABC, I could pitch a show to the owner and get approval or disapproval in 1-2 days to make timing convenient for the players (we're going with approval). Once the show is approved, you can start hiring actors, actresses, directors, and camera men.\n\nWe'll say that I'm starting a Comedy Sitcom for ABC Network and I hire the actors, Liam Neeson, Dwyane Johnson and Seth Rogen. Doesn't sound like a good cast for a Comedy Sitcom, does it? Naturally, if I debuted the show at, let's say, 7:30 PM on a Thursday (you can obviously choose when you want your show to air), the ratings obviously won't be so well. One, because of the cast, who are all great actors, but don't fit the show's genre, and two, because there was no commercials for the debut of the show.\n\nHowever, if I were to make a TV Show for ABC Network and I hired actors who fit the criteria for the show's genre and actors who have chemistry with other actors, the ratings might be good (because even though you have good actors, you might not have good writers or the time slot could be fixed a little to correspond with a larger audience).\n\nSorry for the long post and also the formatting, I'm on mobile. This was an idea I've had already, but never posted. If you want to take this idea and make the game, go for it, that's why I post my ideas on here. (To anybody actually considering making the game, it's a text based game which, from my understanding, is easier to make than a 2D or 3D game)"

9walc1,A Night in the Art Exhibit,"Hey folks, I have had this idea for a while and finally decided to find a community that might appreciate it. I am no means skilled in game design or want to but I just let my creativity run with this one. This game dubbed, ""A Night in the Art Exhibit"" would be praised for it's style. Platformer/RPG, this story takes place with a young man sneaking into the art exhibit late night with a companion. He is not stealing the art but admiring it. Before he realizes it he is in the painting itself. The whole world around him is rendered to be that painting, for example Starry Night. He would see the castle perched on top of a hill while remaining in the village below. What's the objective? Find a way out, talk to people try to figure out how this happened. 3D platforming and upgrading skills would be a must. Not sure what weapon he would wield or enemies he would encounter yet. Anyway, he makes it to the top of the hill and looks to the sky in the moon he sees a man, Vincent Van Gogh. Boss fight time, you win but he is not evil and he leads you to the next painting. There would only be a finite amount of paintings but each painter or monster created by the painter would be the final boss of that painting. Secret bosses? Oh yeah we got those. Do the required questline and end up in the ""The Scream"" by Picasso. Players would automatically notice the bridge and see the man in terror, you'd finally get to see what he is screaming at. Add funny and memorable side characters like a badass Mona Lisa. You realize your companion is lost in the paintings too, go searching for them. Final boss to be determined. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR A Platformer/RPG where a character jumps through paintings and each world is designed after that painting. "
9w12k5,A star wars universe,"The entire star wars universe is yours for the taking, protection, or destruction!\n\nPlay as nearly any species whether you want to be a dathomirian witch, or a recruit from the dead watch militia from mandalor, or your silly old gungan.\n\n Based on your character type and affiliation (jedi/republic, sith/separatist, bounty hunter, smuggler, or grey jedi) your unique story will adjust to the decisions you make. Help friends along the way or create new enemies and amass your personal wealth. \n\nRepresent your chosen guild, and lead your assembled crew to control the known universe, or become an outlaw and rule the underworld. \n\nExplore the outer rim for the best;or worst of the unarchived. Discover century old secrets from unique abilities, to intimidating and powerful armor. Be wary, the depths can be dangerous but full of smugglers looking for their share of the bounty. This area you cannot respawn, and the items you carry will be lost upon death to your enemy... so don't die. You may also make use of stealth abilities and attack others at a chance to steal some of their loot.\n\nThe star wars arsenal will be yours to obtain!  use of lightsabers, blasters, toxic gas bombs, tracking devices, amazing starships to navigate your way, and fully customizable gear color options based on the armor equipped. \n\nBecome the master of stealth and surprise to become a feared assassin. Learn devious tactics and employ the full power of the dark side to unleash havoc on your enemies, or push for a peaceful and generous society, but with an offense as strong as its defense. Or use both the light and dark side, reigning both extremist force users on either side to succumb to your will. This path will lead you down a dangerous road, as much of your time may be spent In uncharted territory, testing your faith and balance in the force, as well as your ability to survive. This path is by far the most difficult, but if you can pass all trials, you may just be more powerful than any jedi or Sith to ever exist. \n\n Make planets yours or blast them to oblivion; whatever floats your boat.  Tired of conquering the galaxy? Test your might against the best of the best in a free for all survival arena, or test your strategic skills with teams of 5 in a fight for key hyperspace lanes, new planets full of resources, and sway monumental battles with lasting effects; unlocking new areas with undiscovered monsters and relics, and yes, there will be loot.\n\nRough outline of a game concept I think a lot of people would be able to enjoy. Would think about a storyline for affiliations and race, with many different kinds of possible endings. With continued playtime in the outer rim after you finish your galaxy, and co-op raids or pvp areas of a server as well as pvp game modes would this be something someone would be interested? Get a feel for the whole universe and have a semi competitive pvp scene as well. Any thoughts, feedback, or questions? "
9vz1la,Virtual Arcade,"A first-person 3D game made to simulate being in an arcade. There are multiple arcade machines spread all around the playing area, and the player simply walks up and clicks on one to start playing. Each game will require a quarter to play, and continues will require a quarter as well. The player will start off with 200 quarters, but can obtain more via an in-game Coin Machine. There will also be unplayable machines with NPCs in front of them, and with Longplay footage (obtainable from YouTube) displaying on the screens. There will also be arcade ambience playing quietly in the background. Players can get tickets when playing games, and redeem them to get prizes at a virtual Prize Counter being run by an NPC. These range from virtual objects, such as toys and decorations, to actual game add-ons, such as free unlimited continues, and disabling time limits. The most expensive one will be a paper bracelet that lets you play all the games for free and for as long as you want. There will be 2 categories of games: Video Games and Minigames. The Video Games will be arcade roms, and will include Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Mario Bros., VS Super Mario Bros., Space Invaders, Frogger, Defender, Rampage, Joust, Gradius, Gradius 2, Gradius 3, Centipede, Q\*Bert, Galaxian, Asteroids, Tetris, Pong, Street Fighter, Street Fighter II, Dig-Dug, Burger Time, Pole Position, Breakout!, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Sinistar, Rally X and Berzerk. The Minigames will be simulated real-life games, and will include as a Basketball Hoops game, Pinball, a Dance Mat game, a Claw Machine, a Coin Pusher and an Air-Hockey table (against an NPC). If you play a game without getting a game over for a long amount of time, NPCs will start gathering around you to watch and cheer. If you beat a game or reach a kill screen, every single NPC in the game will be gathered around and will start roaring with applause, cheering and \n\nwhistling, before slowly all returning to their usual spots. This feature is optional and can be toggled on/off in the Options menu. You can also play online multiplayer mode, and start a public or private server, with up to 20 players being able to join. In this mode, there will be no NPCs except the one at the Prize Counter. As a result, the previously unplayable game cabinets will become playable. Multiplayer mode will have an in-game chat, and will allow for 2 to 4 player game sessions, in games such as VS Super Mario Bros., Mario Bros., Rampage, Pong, Air Hockey, the Dance Mat game and other compatible games. Players can trade prizes, quarters and tickets, as well as combine tickets for a certain prize. Players can also gift these items to other players. Players can create an online account where they can add friends, and have an online rank from Casual to Pro, and can choose to have publicly visible stats for which games they’ve played, how many games they’ve played, which games they’ve beaten, how many games they’ve beaten, how many game overs they’ve gotten, how many quarters they’ve spent, how many tickets they’ve gotten, their prizes/items, their highest score for each game they’ve played and a list of their longest sessions with specific games. Each player account will have a username that will display as their name in the High-Score leaderboards. "

9vwwq8,Twin Peaks/X-Files/Stranger Things inspired 2D action adventure game.,"I'd really like to see a game that really captures that Lynchian ""wind in the trees"" type thing really well. Seeing as *Twin Peaks* and the *X-Files* are so rooted in the 90s, I'm picturing a top down 2-D game along the lines of *A Link to the Past* and *Link's Awakening* in particular. There'd definitely be a lot inspired by the light world/dark world part of the story in the former, as that sort of thing plays in heavily in both *Twin Peaks* and *Stranger Things*.  Graphics would be 8-bit/16 bit pixel style, and there'd be a lot of dark backgrounds. You'd find yourselves in the sort of locations they have in those shows. The woods, for ones, strange diners, dream worlds and secret governtment installations, among other things. Much like the Zelda games, there'd be an overworld, a town, and ""dungeons"" as levels.  \n\nAnother big inspiration here would be the James Bond game for the Game Boy. It's how I picture some of the look and a lot of the gameplay. There's a lot of trading, catacombs/secret passages in weird places, and quirky NPCs. You don't really shoot or kill very much in that game as you think you would, which would be something going on here as well. \n\nThie big takeaway from the Bond game here, though, is that you're a little dark haired guy in a suit navigating around weird forests and stuff in the first few levels. Hell, that exact same sprite could just as well be Dale Cooper or Fox Mulder as it could be James Bond.      \n\nThis game would definitely have a darker, moodier and more eerie tone than that though. A lot of it would be pretty cryptic. There'd be combat, sure, but it wouldn't be constant hack and slash or shoot em' up. You'd only come across enemies every once and a while, and you'd really have to think about how to deal with them. Some of them, you wouldn't even kill, you'd have to lure them into pits or chase them away.  For the plot, you'd have to rescue a child or teenager trapped in another reality. "

It would appear mostly random on a small scale, but thinking slower and more longterm, maybe over seconds instead of feeling like a shooting game (unlike bitcoin where you'd want to move even slower than that), you'd want to move slower since movement is penalized, but fast movement in some cases wins you more. All simulated not connected in any way to real money, just for fun.

9vm1ng,Pistolier,"Pistolier will be a team based multiplayer FPS set in a  steam punk world. Each player will have a brace of three single shot  pistols and a sword. After a pistol is discharged it will be put back  into the brace where it will slowly reload thanks to steampunk magic. If  a player dies another player (of either team) can run over the corpse  to swap their partially loaded pistols with the dead player's reloaded  pistols.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the player is running around they can be in two modes: Pistol mode or Sword mode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  player will run at normal speed while in pistol mode until they hold  down the right mouse button. While the right mouse button is held they  player will be in aiming mode and move at a slow shuffle. A ring will  appear in aiming mode indicating where the bullet could possibly go.  This ring will contract the longer the player is stationary and not  changing the direction of their aim. Pressing the left mouse button  while in aiming mode will discharge the pistol. Pressing the left mouse  button while not in aiming mode will do a pistol whip attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  player will move at a fast shuffle while in sword mode. Sword attacks  have much better reach than the pistol whip and do more damage. Swords  have four vectors of attack and defense. Left, Right, Vertical, and  Thrust. The last motion on the mouse will determine the vector. Left  mouse will initiate an attack animation on the vector, Right mouse will  initiate a parry animation on the vector. Parry animations are faster  and short circuit attack animations. Sword combat will be very similar  to Mount and Blade, with a speed penalty compared to pistol mode.  \n\n\nVariations  on the Pistolier class will be the Long Rifleman and the Grenadier. The  Pistolier will be the main class around which the game is balanced. The  long rifleman will have a smaller min size shot ring, but will have a  longer reload time and a very weak melee weapon. The grenadier will have  grenades which have a long fuse and can easily be run away from, but  will be useful for clearing rooms and projecting damage around corners.  The grenadier will have a sword equivalent to the Pistolier, but may  have faster attack and parry animations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  environment will make use of the steam punk aesthetic with Victorian  architecture, Steam powered industrial locations, and floating platforms  held up by bubbling tubes of magic steampunk liquid.   \n\n\nThe  main game type will be capture point. Where various strategic locations  located around the map will generate points for the team that holds  them. Each player will spawn in an airship and rappell down to the  ground. This will limit spawn camping since long riflemen on the airship  could engage spawn campers."
9vlsdm,"""Savior Simulator""","This literally came to me in a dream last night, so I thought I'd write it down somewhere. \n\nThe premise is that you've been selected by a procedurally-generated deity (what it looks like, what it's god of (like mercy, charity, murder, insanity, etc), and what sacrifices it likes) to spread that deity's message through the land. \n\nThis land, also procedural, would have a few cities and towns, a few wilderness areas, an ocean, mountains, etc. \n\nThe game begins with a backstory that you as a child saw visions and gave sermons, but no one took you too seriously as you were just a child. You take control of your character as a teenager leaving your parents house in a small town and heading out to travel and spread the word of your god.\n\nThe game system breaks down into three areas: Personal Health, Holy Power, and Reputation. Increasing any one of these will have an effect on the other two. \n\nPersonal Health is subdivided into physical and mental. You can do activities to boost any of these stats, but often at a cost. Eating and drinking will boost your physical health, but you'll lose some Holy Power. Getting a job (cutting wood, farming, etc) will boost your mental health, but reduce your Rep. \n\nYou gain Holy Power by doing spiritual things like meditating, fasting, and prayer. Gaining HP points runs the risk of harming your Physical stats, but may boost your Rep. Holy Power is used to perform miracles and sermons, which increases your Rep and gains you followers. \n\nReputation is how well-known your are and how seriously people take you. It's vital to gaining followers and spreading your message, but too much Rep (and particular, if you speak out against the government), and you may gain the attention of the political rulers. Soldiers may start showing up at your sermons or harass you on the street, and if you get too popular too quickly, they may try to kill you. \n\nThe goal is to gain as many followers as possible, and have your message spread across the map. There are a lot of ways to do this - you can stay in one spot and increase your Rep there, which will flow out slowly across the map. You can travel around and give sermons and perform miracles as you go. You can hand-select some of your followers to go to various places and witness to them (you can give each follower some of your Holy Points). \n\nThe game ends when your character dies. This could be from old age, killed by the government or a mob, wandering as a crazy person in the wilderness, or by amassing so many Holy Points that you ascend from a mountaintop in a beam of light. \n\nAfter your character dies, you get to read the auto-generated scriptures of your life and deeds. \n\nMy thought was that this would be good as a tongue-in-cheek kind of humorous game, which might be better served as a pixel game (like Kingdom: New Lands in terms of art style, but maybe not a side-scroll) which an emphasis on the procedural generation. Each new game would be a new deity, character, and all the people/followers/towns/map would all be different. \n\nI could go on about it, but that's the gist of it. What do you guys think? "

9vf5fm,Strava meets Ingress for real activity based area control game,"This idea is inspired by Ingress and a little known thing called VeloViewer explorer. I’m assuming most game devs are familiar with Ingress with its augmented reality gameplay. VeloViewer takes data specifically from activities recorded on Strava and provides more complex analysis. One view of this is called Explorer and involves recording how many grid squares a player has passed through in all recorded activities. The grid  squares are about 800m  on a side and cover the whole world, based on simple coordinates. Passing through a square ticks it off, making a larger 2x2 square gives you a score of 2, a 5x5 square is a score of 5.\n\nSo the game idea is this. Players join a team and link their Strava account, or other activity tracker. When an activity is uploaded the path is analysed and a measure of the activity (time, distance, kJ consumed?) assigned to each square passed through. If their team has the highest activity in a square it is owned by them. If another team want to own it they have to put their own activity through it, or multiple activities to score higher. \n\nScores will decay over time, maybe 5 days, so there is churn and a need to return to recapture a square. Global points can be scored by a team setting up a 2x2, 3x3 or whatever sized square and holding it. Alternative scoring could be for a cluster of squares with shared edges, might be easier to create.\n\nI suspect the game will require the ability to create “dead” squares where no legal access is possible (airports, military bases) and to spot spoofed activities (average speed very high, travel along highways, high power with low heart rate etc). It would also need a map to show current state of the game, though not the actual tracks due to privacy. There are plenty of interesting mechanics possible with the density/size of the squares, different activity types, value of long or intense efforts etc.\n\n"
9vewww,Requesting super small scope ideas.,"Preferably one to two mechanics and one to three buttons. I want to make a small game for my portfolio that has a bunch of minigames in it with different features, plus it seems like it would be fun to do.  \n  \nFor example, one might be:  \nTwo lanes coming at the player, the player can swap lanes at any time. There are blue objects the player needs to touch in both lanes, if they miss one they die. There are red objects that kill the player on touch. The player can shoot one projectile at a time (like space invaders) down a lane to destroy one red object. The game is infinite and ends when the player misses a blue object or hits a red one."

The objective of the game is to hide your erections.

9v7ogv,"A top-down strategy with a campaign mode like mount and blade, and an in-game battle mode like Total war","The title explains it pretty clearly, but let me expand a little bit. \n\nFor so long I’ve loved the campaign feel of amount and Blade, basically for half of my life. I found it on a OneFJeff Let’s Play and would normally only watch games without playing them until I *had* to buy this one. \n\nEveryone knows the feeling of immersion and investment felt playing Mount and Blade’s first few steps. Commanding and growing your own gathering, understanding who you’ll see from your party on the battlefield and what they’ll look like by clicking the Party tab. \n\nThe simple, real time feeling of campaign connects you with the adrenaline rushing part of battle, and riding a horse through mobs. That’s why I love M&amp;B. To think then of then attachment/replacing section of the game which would now be Total War-esque. Currently Total War Arena is the best edition of Total War commanding. A fusion between these two games would give us so much liberty in creating a world. \n\nTo imagine scenarios it could be considered close to this:\n\nYou’re a knighted-noble in a war against a contending faction in a civil war for your empire. You fight under your specific general who generally has good character traits but treats the war with too much zeal, and does have questionable motives. You, and the section of the army you were given, go about in foraging the area to collect supplies in the M&amp;B style map. You avoid getting attacked by larger forces because you’re faster and you just walk past the weak smaller forces. \n\nYou get back to the army besieging the sprawling city and they’re attacking the walls. As you reach the city, the game changes to TW mode. You walk through the half scourged, half fine neighborhoods with the occasion group of running civilians.Your allied soldiers are on the top of the walls while some are climbing the ladders. You get your men to the wall and climb, and you can see the friendlies there getting into the city. The defenders respond moving around, and the civilians flee every direction towards the gates. \n\nThere’s a ‘point out’ that as the civilians open the gates you can block the point with one of the units you have. Or you could go right through the gates too. If you right click on the running civilians, a drop down menu appears and a list of interactions show. It varies from speak to, arrest, and charge. This adds a level of interaction in the game that expands its depth, and integrates moral challenges. \n\nYou can remember now that this is a civil war and you could act as your general’s liaison and talk about how his cause is right and that they should join in fighting the defending soldiers. Maybe they do, maybe they don’t. Still you can finish off the battle and crash into the undefended backs of the enemy holding the boulevards.\n\nMainly I’d like to see a game like this being very moddable to witness the incredible explanations and histories that people know about and could share. \n\nParticularly I would like to see this game pick time period where Rome was almost extinguished when the General Brennus and his young army of Senones surrounded Rome’s Capitol Hill after sacking the city. \n\nI have a lot else written on specific feature ideas and how most units would interact with each other, but this idea is really eye-catching because of its scaling ability. Basically you could pick any specific region of the earth to be the map. It could be all of China to Tibet, or from Manhattan to the end of Long Island. Units can be any number, large or small. And this could teach us a lot about terrain maneuvering and elevation strategy. \n\nFor those that made it to the end. Thank you, for those interested in taking on this idea let me know! Other than that I’m surprised how clearly this all came out generally with how bad I am sometimes at explaining things. \n\nAnyway thanks! Bye!"

9tbxso,"A sidescrolling platformer in which the background layer can be ""pushed out"" to the foreground, and vice-versa.","To those familiar with the following games, this would be like a cross between [Mighty Switch Force](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/727/562/4d8.gif), [Pushmo](https://cdn.atomix.vg/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pushmo.gif) and [Tomba!](http://www.gogglebob.com/pics/fgc3/312cliffs.gif)\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe sidescrolling game would have about 4 ""layers"" across the z-axis, from the absolute foreground to the absolute background. The player can stand on any one of these layers at any given time, but also transition to-and-fro the adjacent layers much like in Tomba! or LittleBigPlanet.\n\nThe spin is that each of those layers can be made to pop ""in"" or ""out"" like the puzzle blocks in Pushmo or the boxes in Might Switch Force. For example, the furthest background layer could be pushed forward into the players current layer in order to create a bridge. Or a wall in the foreground could be pushed into the background so your character can get past it.\n\nA layer pushed out can push you (and enemies/objects) off of the layer you're standing on. You also have a limited jump height, so you have to think about layer arrangement in order to reach new areas. The player could move individual layers by reaching switches to control them.\n\n****\n\nDue to how layers can move to and fro, the graphic style that might fit best is a *pop-up book* or *papercraft* aesthetic. This way it'll make sense how the background ""sky"" is painted onto a layer pushed all the way to the foreground. Moreover, the ""switches"" to move the layers could instead by designed to look like the tabs in pop-up books.\n\nAnd although this might be best done in 2.5D, it could also be done in 2D using subtle parallax for the different layers."

9t29f1,Esports manager IOS &amp; Android App,"Recently, esports is becoming more and more popular, with Drake becoming involved with 100 theives and many football teams picking up esports players for fifa. \nI think an app should be created where you create your own esports organisation. \nLet’s take 100T as an example as they’re one of the new rising organisations. They have recently started and are spreading out into all the gaming communities. \nSo let’s say you begin and pick what game you want to branch out into. Similarly to other sports management games where you raise finance from sponsors, upgrade facilities (such as housing, training facilities) etc. Then their is all the popular games you can branch out to. Obviously their can’t be too many as it would be very difficult to create. So let’s say fortnite, call of duty, LoL, Fifa and one or two more.

Do whatever you want, and when you log out, someone else will be playing that character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the basic premise, and there's a lot of different directions you could go with it.

Story: The Summoner is someone almost everyone loves, but none more than his five summoned skeletons. \n\nAlmost everyone, since he has an archenemy in The Wizard, who is jealous of his fame. \n\nThe Wizard challenges him to a duel, but loses. He begs for mercy and pretends to want to befriend the Summoner. \n\nDuring the dinner which was supposed to mark their new friendship, the Wizard poisons the Summoner, then flees like a coward. But the five skeletons want revenge...\n\nII. Gameplay/Style:\n\nThe game is a combo of shooter and hack and slash. The player assumes control of one of the skeletons. \n\nThe others either rest, or join in(AI controlled). \n\nEach skeleton has a unique Personal Spell and a unique personality. \n\nThey chase the Wizard across space and various timelines. Some levels are set in the future.\n\nIII. Weapons and Personal Spells. \n\nThere are 3 categories of weapons the skeletons can use: blunt(swords, maces, scythes, etc), firearms(guns, shotguns, assault rifles, etc) and magic wands(can fire various element based magic, such as fire beams, ice clouds, and others). \n\nAll weapons are made of bone. The skeletons can shift their arms to form them, but they must be unlocked first.\n\nThere are 5 Personal Spells, all very powerful: Death Orb casts orbs that suck the life out of enemies they pass through.\n\nVampire Effect can heal all allies by continously taking life from nearby enemies. \n\nThe effect ceases when no enemies are around and the spell needs live enemies to work.\n\nAnother spell is the Master Returns whicj allows the Summoner to return in ghost form for a limited time. \n\nHe casts terrible spells that deal a huge amount of damage. \n\nA fourth spell allows the rising of extra skeletons that act as allies and carry various weapons(at random). Finally, there is the Mind spell, which makes some enemies fight for you.\n\n"
9t064n,Like Populous But With WW1 Level Technology,"I was watching a video talking about WW1 and the idea for a trench building game popped in to my head, whist I think this would be a cool mechanic a whole game around it would be a little dull so I thought what else could be in the game and slowly the idea for a terrain editing warring god game started to form.\n\nLike Populous the main mechanic would be raising and lowering terrain on a grid based system and your people will automatically make use of it but the land use will be more context sensitive, you'll have more control over the environment and basic zoning abilities.\n\nLand can be raised or lowered and you'll have a few different steepness options (0 degrees - flat, 22.5, 45, 67.5 and 90), you can add water, seed forests and ore deposits and will have a few god powers at your disposal fuelled by believers. Optionally you can zone areas as civilian use (for providing resources and population), military use or religious use (for charging and improving god powers as well as expanding your area of influence) but your population will use it as they see fit otherwise.\n\n**Land use**\n\nLarger plateaus will allow for larger structures, digging trenches will allow your soldiers to fill them, building a bay will give you space for a ship yard, high ground will give you more range and viewing distance for troops, civilian land near ore deposits or trees will be built in to mines or lumber yards, long strips of military land will enable them to build runways and plane civilian land will be used for houses, farming etc.\n\nRather than just land and sea like populous terrain will be more varied. Cliffs, coasts, rivers, simple vegetation and animals\n\n**God Powers**\n\nI'm sure if someone decides to work on this they'll have a ton of their own ideas so I'll be pretty vague. I'm thinking each god will have unique abilities based around their personality. One god may have abilities focused around blessing their people with resources, another may buff their troops, another might debuff enemies, one might be good at calling forth natural disasters or summon sea monsters and another may use their people as sacrifices to gain devastating powers.  There's a lot to play around with which could really add character to the game and encourage different play styles. The same could be true of your civilisation, one civilisation could reproduce very quickly, another could have a superior navy, another could be more religious etc.\n\n**Units/Tech**\n\nThis is a god game so it's it'll have some fantastical elements. Some tanks, planes, ships and blimps which couldn't have existed at the time, the ability to combine troops in to one super soldier at the expense of time and mana and some gods may control fantasy creatures rather than humans.\n\n**Diplomacy and Commanding**\n\nI'd imagine this is fairly basic, declare war, ally, request cease fire, send resources. For troop order I wouldn't want complex commands because this would detract from the terrain editing and god powers. Just decide how defensive/aggressive you want to be and select vague areas to focus your attacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

9srl4w,Mechassault meets Voltron meets PUBG,"TL;DR- all over the universe humongous Gates are appearing, along with them are giant machines that combine together into even larger vehicles that resemble people, it’s with these massive robots the gates are opened, many factions have collected these machines already and many of the gates revealed to have untold treasures behind them, now there’s only one gate left and it’s up to you and your team to unlock it for your faction first, good luck. (Strictly competitive multiplayer like Overwatch)\n\nFirst things first a typical match plays out like this, your team spawns together at the edge of the map, in the center is your objective, The Gate. You will need to defeat every other player in order to open the gate. The game isn’t over once you’ve opened it however, instead of riches there’s actually a giant monster inside this gate, upon releasing it you’ll need to defeat it. It’s no ordinary monster though, one of the players you defeated is chosen at random to play as the beast. This player now has the advantage, and it’s up to you and your team to triumph over the powerful foe.  \nYou pick from a roster of giant robots each with their own unique design, the overall design influences the design of the smaller mechs that make up the giant bot. After selecting the robot, you’ll need to choose amongst your teammates who will play what. Each of the limbs including the torso plays like a different class. Here’s a breakdown:\n\nHead: \nJob- Support\nHealth- 50 HP + 100 shields \nPrimary Weapon- Ion blaster, a rapid fire laser cannon that deals extra damage to shields\nSecondary- Repair beams, use these to fix up wounded allies\nSpecial ability- Division, launches a special projectile that causes whichever limb it’s made contact with to separate itself i.e. if it hits the head the head pops off and that player will need to rejoin the group. The projectile has a 15s cooldown.\n\nTorso:\nJob- Tank\nHealth- 150 HP +100 shields\nPrimary weapon- Disruptor cannon, a powerful semi automatic weapon that causes splash damage, you can fire in quick succession for minor damage or you can charge the shot to increase it’s damage and radius. \nSecondary- Missile barrage, fires a hail of missiles in a large parabola, can be fired mortar style, or if you’ve got the time you can zoom in and lock onto your target.\nSpecial Ability- Dome, creates a particle barrier that lasts for 10s, nothing gets in or out, not weapon fire, not players, the dome can be canceled, this shortens the cooldown time. If an enemy is halfway in halfway out when the dome closes massive damage is done to them. Has a 15s cooldown. \n\nL Arm:\nJob- DPS\nHealth- 100 HP + 100 shields\nPrimary Weapon- Beam rifle, capable of dealing high damage at long ranges instantly, if fired in quick succession it will overheat. If overheated takes 4s to cool down. \nSecondary Weapon- Thermite Shotty, a supersized version of the classic weapon, provides decent spread and high damage at close range. Successful hits cause damage over time as the thermite burns. \nSpecial Ability- Cloak, turns invisible for 10s or until an attack is initiated. Has a 15s cooldown time. \n\nR Arm: \nJob- DPS\nHealth- 100 HP + 100 shields\nPrimary Weapon- Super Saber, a sword with an edge made of quantum material, attacks quickly with two hits happening every second, each hit dealing moderate damage. \nSecondary Weapon- Energy Whip, a mid range attack that deals minor damage, however when the input is held your attack will cause the whip to loop around your target, you can then either pull yourself right up next to your opponent or yank them towards yourself, it depends on the size of your opponent in relation to yourself. \nSpecial Ability- Power surge, energizing your systems, your rate of attack increases, as does your movement speed and shield recharge rate. Has a 20s cooldown\n\nL Leg:\nJob- Utility \nHealth- 75 hp +150 shields\nPrimary Weapon- Repulser Blaster, sends out a wall of directed force that can alter the trajectory of certain projectiles, and send smaller opponents flying backwards. The weapon must charge for 2s before firing. \nSecondary Weapon- EMP Grenade, a throwable that causes minor AoE damage while disrupting the enemies HUD. Has an 8s cooldown.\nSpecial Ability- Phase jump, a short range teleport that sends you in whatever direction you’re aiming. Has a 10s cooldown\n\nR Leg\nJob- Utility \nHealth 75 HP + 150 Shields\nPrimary Weapon- Acid Mortar, delivers a long range payload that explodes into a corrosive cloud that deals DoT.\nSecondary Weapon- Plasma Lance, charges up and fires a mid range burst of plasma, deals moderate damage, but when used in tandem with the acid mortar is capable of high damage. Ignite the acid cloud with the lance and you get a large high damage explosion. Takes 3s to fully charge.\nSpecial Ability- Hover jets, jump and activate the jets to hover for 10s or until canceled/killed, helpful for getting the best vantage point for your mortar fire. \n\n(This is more just the basic gist of how the classes work, different giant robots are made of different smaller robots that all have their own weapons and abilities. However all the super-mechs health are determined by adding all of the body parts health/shield bars together, so in this case the super-mech would have 400 HP and 700 shields)\n\nThe Head player is responsible for initializing the combination sequence, a prompt then displays on the other players screens, if all players select yes then the combination begins. When combined controls are very different, everyone sees the same camera angle, but control is divided up. \n\nThe head is responsible for locking onto the target, and using repair abilities. \nThe Torso controls the direction in which your super-mech will move, they are responsible for the camera in other words, they are also responsible for activating defensive abilities.\nThe arms attack, the L Arm is for ranged attacks, the R arm is for melee attacks. They each have abilities that either deal damage or increase your ability to deal damage. \nThe legs are pretty obvious, and perhaps the trickiest, the R and L leg will need to coordinate if you hope to make it anywhere. \nFlying is where the real teamwork begins, arms and legs are each equipped with thrusters, each limb has a throttle gauge that can be seen by your limb partner ie L Arm player can see R Arm players gauge on his screen etc etc... anyway players will need to match their partners thrust level in order to fly straight. Say the left arm lets up on the throttle but the R arm player doesn’t then you’ll start listing Left, but say both the left arm and left leg player cut throttle completely, then you’ll make a hard right turn. The arms and legs are responsible for turning, while the torso controls your verticality, the chest player controls if you go up or down. The head player is still about locking onto your target. \n\nAll in all I think it should be a maximum of 10 teams to a map. The Map is very large, like it’s essentially a small country, but the players are massive robots so comparatively it’s average for a battle royale.  \n\nArt wise I think it should be styled to look like an anime, but should have the sensibilities and attitude of a game like Borderlands or Bullet Storm. \n\n\nI want Battle Royales that encourage diversity in gameplay, not hide and go seek simulators. I feel like having and teams and classes, not only that but required classes keeps things fresh. It might be considered easiest to take out enemy teams as a group while uncombined, but should another team combine to defend itself you’re going to have a bitch of a time taking the super-mech down when you’re separated. There’s lots of instances that literally force you to work together in an engaging way, not just “okay you watch that door, I’ll watch this one...” \n\nAnd then at the end it encourages players to spectate because anyone of them could be chosen as the monster, and they can redeem themselves. If the monster wins then that player gets a commendations in the scoreboard, but technically it’s the team that makes it all the way to the end that’s still the winner, defeating the monster is just a way to earn bonus points. \n\nThis game is like Overwatch in that the only modes are for multiplayer and the matches all take place in that narrative of “the race to the last gate”. \n\nIf you can think of any other ideas that might add to or fix an issue I’m not thinking of then by all means share it in the comments.

9spoo8,"You've inherited an item shop that only sells cursed items, so you have to find loopholes make them helpful.","Inspired by that one episode of Rick &amp; Morty in which the literal Devil sells cursed items, you play a young business owner of a cursed item shop. The thing is, you don't want to hurt anyone, so you have to match an item to a customer who won't get negatively affected by it.\n\nFor example, you sell a cursed mirror that will make it's owner flat broke the first time they gaze upon their reflection. So you sell it to a man who is underwater on his debt to a loan shark. Since his net worth is negative, the mirror actually makes him richer by clearing his debts.\n\nThe game is set in a small town in which—much like Clock Town in Majora's Mask—the townsfolk live on a weekly schedule. As you are new to the town, much of the game is about getting to learn about the town and its people, and slowly uncovering their problems. In fact, it could be said that this is the real draw of the game, and that selling cursed items is only the game's excuse to get you there."
9sk2ww,I need help for video game ideas!!!,"Hey guys,\n\nI decided that i wanted to create a multiplayer game on Unreal Engine 4 but i don't have any ideas. I thought about doing a Battle Royale game, but i thought that it would be better to come up with my own ideas. So do you guys have any ideas for a really good multiplayer game . And also, i want to create something like this on Unreal Engine([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=917043694](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=917043694)), but i need help. Could someone please help me on discord?? "
9six80,Early human survival game,"A video game of early humans migrating. Like a Oregon trail, but your taking your entire village to a new continent. Developing skills and crafting along the way. Fighting new creatures that existed in our ancient times in different biomes. End game would be based on how many people survived when you reached your destination. Different paths would dictate difficulty. You could do 4 player co-op. Different people in your tribe could offer different skills you could use. Scout each area, find different plants to bring back to your tribes alchemist to make medical supplies. Even better would be you being the tribe leader and assigning tasks to other as you go. Training different people in different things. You just lost your only weapon maker to a short nosed bear attack? Should have planned better. Sending a few scouts into an approaching forest. Only one of the three returned. Are you going to try to move around it, or take the risk and move your tribe through it. Willing to talk about different mechanics or possibilities. "
9sfogu,Serial Killer Game,"Okay, so the game would start with a character creation screen where you create a serial killer, pick the type of weapon(s) they use, and the time period they are out and about. For example, you could make it where they only come out to kill on Halloween night, or you can make it where they kill the entire week of Halloween. The game would also have all four different seasons and every US holiday. With the weapon choice, that just means you get more exp for using that style of weapon. For example, if you choose short melee weapons then find a kitchen knife, you will gain more exp then if you chose short melee weapons and only used a machete. \n\nYou would put points into different slots like strength, durability, stamina, stealth, etc. You would also select traits. Such as silent, bruting, comedical, ugly, etc. These would add fear to your victims which would gain you exp. \n\nAfter you pick that, you get to pick a set of openings to the game. You can choose to be a patient in an insane asylum, a hobo living in the woods, or someone who just decided to start killing, and then some more. \n\nThe insane asylum one is the most basic and tutorial driven one. It would start with your character in a cell, with a chain around your wrist going into the floor. A guard walks in, puts food down in front of you, then gets a call. He turns around and starts talking on the phone. You then move forward and strangle him. You grab keys off his body, let yourself out, and you grab his nightstick. You then start sneaking around the asylum, killing guards. Eventually you get to a room a cutscene plays. Your character walks into a control room where a guard is leaned back in a chair eating a donut. He sees you but it's too late. He grabs the guard by the back of his head and starts smashing his face into the control panel. After 3 hits, the cell doors open, and we see other prisoners leave their cell and start killing. Your character then leaves the hospital. You are playing again, you walk outside the hospital and you see a nurse going to her car. You kill her, grab her keys, get in the car, then you get a short tutorial on how to drive. Then a cutscene plays of you leaving. \n\nIf you picked the asylum or the person who just decides to kill then the next mission (first mission for the random person) is finding a weapon, and a costume/clothes and mask. If you chose the random person, then you have money, a house, some weapons already, and a car. If you chose the patient, then you have a car and any weapons you chose to keep. Also, the random person is the only one who can actually collect money. The rest steal or find things. \n\nSo on the second mission you are in a big open world map. The map is divided into three sections. A high school campus surrounded by nice houses. A suburban neighborhood, then a lake with a lot of cabins. There is also farmland, slaughterhouses, and things like that but these are the three biggest areas. You can choose to kill someone and take their clothes for your costume, if they are wearing a uniform, or you can go to a store and steal/buy the clothes. For the patient, it's easier to kill someone and take their clothes. For the random person, it's easier to buy or steal the clothes or costume. If you choose to buy/steal clothes instead of a full costume then you need to go and find a mask now. You can find different styles of mask all around the city in different stores. Gas mask in the army surplus, Halloween mask in the party store, hockey mask in the sport store, etc. After finding everything, the night begins, and you can start killing. \n\nIf you choose the hobo in the woods, you already have clothes. You are living by the lake when some kids show up. You kill them all, which time passes while this happens. One of the kids will have a mask in his bag, which you can take. You can also find a potato sack around the house to use as a mask. After you kill them, you can now explore the open world, or stay there. \n\nIf you choose to kill people during the day, you gain extra exp, but it's harder. \n\nNow, all three killers are able to start their killing spree. You are given goals, depending on who you picked, to kill. These people can be found wondering around or in a house. They also all have randomly generated traits. Such as a babysitter, a klutz, a stoner, a drunk, a fighter, an idiot, and the hero/heroine. These traits can make it harder or easier for you. They all can also call the cops, if you don't take the right precaution, when they spot you. If you do get spotted and the cops arrive before killing the person, you can choose to stay in the house, and try to kill the cops, or you can leave. If you kill the cops, and the victim, then the police won't be aware of your presence for another hour. If you leave, then the police will be suspicious but unsure of how true the victims story is. So you are more likely to get scene by police, but they won't be actively hunting you. If you kill the victim and let the cops live then they will report it and be actively looking for a killer but won't know what you look like. Same thing happens after the hour is up after killing the cops. If you kill the victim and the police see you leave the scene, then they will actively hunt specifically you. \n\nYou don't have to go after your target either. You can choose to kill random pedestrians, but they give you significantly less exp. \n\nAfter killing so many targets, it'll either tell you a new wave has started, or the targets will stop coming up till the next night (depending on if you chose for your killer to only be active on one specific night or a while). As the waves progress, the people become more aware, and are more likely to get better traits. Also, the police do way more damage. \n\nThere is nine waves, then a boss wave, sort of. On the tenth wave, you are going after the true hero/heroine. This person is smart, and can be a fighter as well. Also, while going after this target, the sheriff or crazed man with a gun is coming after you. This will happen even if you did the previous 9 waves without getting detected. If you do somehow manage to kill the hero/heroine then you have won. If you kill the person chasing you, and the hero/heroine escapes then you have come to a draw ending. If you are killed by the person chasing you before killing the hero/heroine then you lose but your body is never found. \n\nAfter these endings, you can go into free roam just to test out different animations and to check out news reports of your killing spree. \n\nYou also unlock a game mode after getting to wave 10 which turns the game into a horror game where you are the hero. This game mode can be played online or with friends where you each play a victim trying to survive and kill the AI killer that one of you created. \n\nAlso, as you get exp and rank up you unlock points to put into your killer, new mask, and new traits, weapons, and characters.\n\nFor example, you could unlock a new character trait where your new killer is a doll or can go inside people's nightmares. You can unlock weapons that are permanent such as razor gloves. You can even unlock demonic characters or characters who can create their own mask using skin. Etc. \n\nThere would also be cutscenes in the main story with your character but I haven't thought enough about what the story would be. It would show the hero/heroine a lot. And the story would revolve around your main trait. Like if you are a silent stalker then you are always in the background. If you are a doll then maybe a character is holding you. If you are a homeless brute then maybe some of the cutscene is from your perspective, looking through bushes, things like that. \n\nAlso, I clearly referenced a lot of horror icons such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kreuger, Chucky, and Ghostface, but you can make your character however you want. Just because they are similar to that character doesn't mean you have to specifically make that character. "
9sd3j2,Daredevil game where you are blind... hear me out....,"I saw this as a joke post of someone posting a black screen and saying it was a daredevil game, but actually I think you could make it an interesting mechanic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI envisage kind of a first person fighting game, but with a focus on parkour style movement.  The catch would be that it would be wireframed/flashed images and you would have a difficulty setting that would alter the ratio of black screen to flash of image.  So you have to remember where things are laid out and jump based on judging rather than in direct feedback to screen cues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is also possible you could go with a cane tap mechanic where you could repaint the screen by tapping your cane to make sound.\n\n  \nWhat do people think?"

9sal5l,Halloween game idea,"Its sort of like slender. Its short with one goal, find all of your friends. \n\nYou play as a 10 year old girl. She wakes up on Halloween and everyone in her neighborhood is missing. She has to find her friends but there are monsters running around. When she finds a friend she sends them back to her house. The more friends she finds the more aggressive the monsters get. She can use many of the items she finds as weapons sort of like dead rising. There is no health bar the only indication of health is how injured she is, cuts and bruises stuff like that\n\nJust an idea I have. If you have anything that could make it better I would like to hear."
9sa6cs,A note collecting game about a teen trying to uncover his fathers 'true' death.,"i kinda have two chapters planned out so far,  but i plan on making a third. the game is a storytelling game, where the boy gets notes, while being chased by something sinister. \nbasically, the intro sequence is the kid on his bed, looking at a picture of his family, and asks, 'How did you really go?'.\nchapt. 1\n He explores the house, and uncovers an office that he had never seen before (i know, cliche) and decides to poke around, discovering that his 'garage shop' job was much more. there are notes written by his father, all hinting at some sort of leasing. The final note that can be found says something along the lines of 'I did it. i got the office. finally, all my childhood dreams can come true.' stapled to the note is the leasing info, including an address. \n\nchapt 2.\nthe kiddo goes to the address, but notices it is fairly isolated from the rest of the offices in the area. the building still had its sign, but a few letters are missing. the shadows are still there, and it reads 'owen industries'. he doesnt think much of it, as his fathers name wasnt owen, and as far as he knew, neither was his friends. he walks in, and doesnt close the door. as he walks further, he hears the front door slamming, but things its the wind. everything looks like it was abandoned not so long ago. he ventures further in the office, and discovers that his dad formed a company researching teleportation. the business starts off as a two man job, just him and his friend, mark. it eventually grows, but stays privately owned. they get a new guy, and the dad notes on how he acts suspiciously around the prototypes. He works overtime, even after the father leaves. eventually, it is time to test the portals, and they work flawlessly. at a celebration, the guy gets the father a drink. The father notices it has a strong chemical smell, but thinks less of it because of the smell the quarantined testing area makes. after some time, he feels sick and decides to rest in his office. he begins to write his final note. he doesnt know what is wrong with him, but the door knob turns. in comes the guy, along with the loud songs at the party. hes holding a dagger. the fathers last words were written on the note. he wrote his last words as the dagger hit. the guy uses the party as a distraction to get the father out to his car, and proceeds to drive him to a forest, but gets into an accident on his way there, and survives. the father is thrown out of the back seat, and found dead from stab wounds, but they say the wounds were from stray metal. the guy escapes, and isnt suspected. the company falls apart, because of the loss of its owner. it files for bankruptcy, and the former employees go off the grid, and arent heard from. until the boy finds the application for one of the employees,. on the application, the adress of the employee is listed. he goes to the adress to find the killer...\n\nim still trying to find ways to implement more gameplay, as this is mainly story. any feedback is accepted. Thanks in advance!"
9s8s3e,A managing game where you start your own record label,I’m imagining a game with mechanics kinda like game dev and FIFA manager. Where you oversee and make decisions on different aspects of a record label. \n\nTHIS IS JUST EXTRA DETAILS THE MAIN IDEA IS ABOVE THIS.YOU DON’T HAVE TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING \n\nIn the game their can be real music artists you can invest in that grow and improv over time if managed properly. \n\nwhen you get far enough in the future the game starts randomly generating artists.\n\nSometimes you’ll get “emails” with various subjects good or bad \n\nYou can pick a specific genre\n\nThe artists personal life could also come into play. (A druggie has higher potential then a student(or something like that))\n\nYou can buy artists from other labels\n\nYou have a budget\n\nI have more ideas for this game but too much to write them all down \n\n\n
9s6hkq,A simple 2d avoiding game,"How about a game where there are waves. Your goal is to run away from the enemies that are a simple shapes. Your goal is to avoid them by moving across the map for a certain amount of time. If you beat the time, the enemies disappear and a new wave starts. Higher waves will make the enemies last longer, make them move a bit faster (with a speed limit because we don't want them moving faster than the enemies) and more enemies. The more you play, the more skins you unlock. The way to make money is to put micro-transactions into the game. Comment on what you think"
9s6e40,An unfolding/resource management game where you play an emergent AI,"I've been walking around with an idea for an unfolding type game, where you wake up from the darkness and realize you're a newly born sentient AI on a random spaceship. This ship has a central CPU that you can steal unused cycles from for research upgrades, and memory that you ""reside"" in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you start working to research, let’s say,  “Ability to control doors/airlocks”. (so you can jettison a pesky redshirt.) A high level engineer becomes suspicious because the CPU starts to overheat. so he wanders to engineering, and starts looking through logs. He discovers some anomalies, and goes to report it to the captain (who is a low ability moron). On his way. your research finishes, and you vent the sucker into space. The captain, wondering why he sees his lead engineer floating by on his monitor, gains a small amount of suspicion, shrugs, and loses it almost immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game will probably have different kinds of endings and achievements based on common tropes and sf easter eggs. For instance: Killing the whole crew and replacing them with drones or hacking onboard speakers to brainwash the crew to do your bidding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've a whole design document with ideas and concepts, but I've no clue where to start. I'm a backend programmer, so the most graphical UI that I've ever made (besides text based) was ascii based and I don't think it suffices for this type of game.\n\nFirst time posting, so I hope this is enough info for some feedback and suggestions."

9s3c68,Gacha mobile game in which all the highest rarity strongest characters are only available through playing in-game events,"Also any duplicate rolls from the gacha would automatically refund you the materials used for the rolls \n\nIt probably won't incentivise players to pay, but it would be interesting to see how would a game using this type of system would evolve over time or die out"
9s2p4f,A Mortal Kombat Action Roleplaying Game,"As with Elder Scrolls, each entry could be set in a different realm. Outworld, Edenia, Nether Realm. Mix fatalities with Arkham combat and stealth and you're on to a winner. Anyone got any others cool thoughts?"
9s1e8g,"Not sure if this already exists, but I had an idea for a multiplayer Artillery game","The idea is pretty similar to the classic tabletop game Battleship, but with a couple of major differences  \n  \nBasically, you'd have a map (maybe with randomly generated terrain and structures to keep it interesting?), and two or more teams placed on that map (maybe also randomly or by their own choice). Each team would consist of two players - a *Gunner* and a *Spotter*.   \n  \nThe *Gunner* is in control of an artillery cannon, and his job is to hit and destroy the other team(s). However, he can't actually see where they are, and he only has a limited number of shells, so he can't just go around guessing blindly like in Battleship because running out of shells is an instant game over.  \n  \nThat's where the *Spotter* comes in. He can't control the cannon, but he can see the enemy positions - his job is to navigate the *Gunner* to hit them, probably by using some sort of [military coordinate map system](http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tm8358.1/8358020.gif) to make sure the *Spotter*'s job isn't just ""shoot over there"" - he has to get the coordinates right, then pass them to the *Gunner* and hope *he* gets them right and hits the correct spot.  \n  \nThus, the game would be less about accuracy, luck and guesswork and more about cooperation and communication (kinda like Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes)\n  \nOf course, the trick isn't really getting all this right - it's getting it right before the enemy team(s) can. The game *could* be turn-based - or it could be real-time for extra tension. Better work fast, or else death may rain down upon your heads any minute!  \n  \nThere could also be difficulty settings, which would affect the size of the map (far-away targets are harder the hit, of course), the amount of shells the *Gunners* have (and therefore, the margin of error they have), maybe even the wind conditions (which would slightly change the shell's trajectory and have to be compensated for).   \n  \nAll in all, the gameplay would be rather simple, but challenging."
9s1bxi,"You have only one life, but you continue playing as a ghost after you die. The narrative changes depending on whether you're alive or dead.","First time posting, so hit me with any suggestions on refining. \n\nTo preface, I've been a long-time fan of games with permadeath mechanics, namely roguelikes with punishing systems like permanently killing off your party members (see Final Fantasy) or forcing you to restart the entire run if you die (a la Spelunky). I recently thought of a twist on the concept that I feel lends itself to an interesting approach to a game's narrative: a self-permadeath system which, instead of forcing you to start over, allows you to continue but with a dramatically altered storyline.\n\nImagine you're a medieval knight, on a quest to slay a malevolent dragon. You encounter a mountain troll on your way to the second town, which kills you in combat. Now, if you had reached the next town alive, the game would have progressed normally: the villagers would have celebrated and given you weapons and items to aid you. Because of your death, however, the villagers catch wind of your demise, and must take it upon themselves to challenge the dragon. They're unskilled, however, and many villagers will inevitably die on the journey you were unable to complete.\n\nAfter death, you continue existing as a ghost, invisible to anyone else. You do have a (limited) ability to interact with the environment: you can help the villagers survive by chasing away enemies, creating animal tracks to lead them to water, etc. But the story and gameplay will be fundamentally different than if you had survived and continued in the villagers' stead. \n\nI envisioned this as an RPG but I feel it could fit other genres as well. Think a choose-your-adventure game, or a Battle Royale with a post-death revenge system."
9ry85a,A run away game,"This game would be played in first person in a open world not too big, not too small. Like 2.5 by 2.5 miles or something like that. 24 people are spawned in on one part of the map, and 1 person is spawned on another part of the map. The 1 runner can either drive in a car, run, or hide. The seekers have to kill the runner by hitting him with meele attacks 5 times. Once a seeker hits him once, everyone within a 10 meter radius slows down for 10 seconds to make sure that the runner has a chance. The runner gets things like ice traps, banaa peels, and glue. While the seekers get things like portable trackers, flash-bangs, and spike traps . The items regenerate. The runner wins if they can run for 20 minutes. Leave a comment of what you think"
9rxm3h,A high-school game where you must balance relationships while attempting to complete your goals..,"The game is set in a prestigious high school called: Newton High. Where rich and famous students send their kids. Naturally, that causes some issues. Including a drug deal that left your friend dead. \nYou play as a girl attempting to find the truth about your friend’s murder and sabotage the suspects. But, must do so while evading the school’s adaptive security and balancing social media.\nExample Mission:\nYou need to get a small bag of drugs from a girl named: Stacy. You are definitely not friends. She’s only willing to give them up at a high cost.\n\nPath 1- You can beat Stacy to a pulp. But, you are not a professional fighter or a superhero. You will also receive damage. Then, can use a skateboard to evade security and get out the school. Friends of Stacy will see you as an enemy, while you’ll gain leverage with her foes. Shifting the relationships in the school. \n\nPath 2-You try to silently take the drugs from Stacy. Wearing a hoodie and mask, you grab Stacy from behind and threaten her with a blade. She willingly hands over the drugs and it has no impact on school relationships. But, security will be higher for the next few days. As the school tries to crack down on intruders and contraband. Punishments will be longer and more severe.\n\nPath 3- You talk to Stacy’s boyfriend. You flirt and seduce Stacy’s boyfriend. Who takes the drugs and gives them to you. In exchange, he wants a date. You can either go along with it and develop a relationship. Changing his relationship with Stacy and her friends. Or lie and embarrass him. Turning him into an enemy.\n\nThis is just an idea which I hope sounds good! Please give ideas and recommendations! "

9rvp6t,A create your own onlinr gangster/cop story game mixed with roleplay,"What game about:\n\nThis game would be about you, and players can create up to 5-15 characters, which gets unlocked based on your level, and you can be part of law enforcement, a gang, get paid for assignations, or be a crinimal mastermind. This game is highly focused on roleplay, and each person will have a different story based on their dialogue and choices. \n\nGame concepts\n\nStorylines:\n\nStorylines are some story which trigger at some random point in the game e.g. gang member gets killed and you have revenge on that killer. They also have different endings e.g. you kill the gang member by sniper assgination or by torture. Cards are things that happen when the storyline is happening and can are oppurnities or things that happen. Cards can be triggerred by other cards e.g. A successful interrogation could mean giving you a card about an opportunity to disguise yourself as a bartender at a party and spy on the leaders of the gang. The enemy player may or may not that your having this storylines. This is based if anybody knows of your attack. 4 levels:\n\nNot suspicious at all: \n\nNobody knows that you have this card apart from your friendly players that you choose to tell. If there is no indication that you are causing any trouble, then this will happen. Mostly happens at the start\n\nDanger level:\n\nIf anybody knows that there is a definite threat, e.g. seen some die of bullet shot, seen dead person with a bullet shot. All people will be alerted and evucated. Event will be reported and chance that they find you\n\nKnown threat:\n\nIf they know that it was you that tried to hack into buissness, then the enemy will place you on their wanted list, and will try to kill you or stop you from doing this. They may hold your loved one captive etc \n\nMore stuff coming soon, not finished yet\n\n"
911q44,It's like Missile Command but on the surface of a Dyson sphere.,"It's multiplayer and each player has some cities to defend and a missile launcher to attack with, all placed on the inner surface of the sphere. When you launch a missile, it is affected by the gravity of the sun (and the sphere?) so you need to carefully aim your shots to take out the enemy cities and missiles."
911lkv,Survive the Dome: Survival Battle Royale,"My idea Survive the Dome: Survival Battle Royale consists of 16 players pushed into a dome in which they have to survive. \n\n# The Story\n\nAn underground organization named A-CORP is created to battle against the superpowers of the world to gain world domination. A-CORP wants the most skilled, intelligent, and agile humans to be on their team and to do so, they must put them against each other.\n\n# The Game\n\n16 players are pushed in a dome with nothing but the clothes on their backs and must collect resources to build primitive tools. Primitive tools consist of Spears, Hammers, and Axes. Some players may get lucky to find bunkers scattered around the dome with weapons. However, these weapons don't have as much ammo so use them wisely. Players also have the ability to create traps to eliminate other players/ and or capturing animals. Animals are scattered around inside the dome some are nice however, there are some that are more aggressive. Scientists can also control the weather inside the dome to make it foggy, rainy, windy, etc. Also players must monitor their food and water levels to survive in the dome. Hunting animals will gain players food while drinking water quenches their thirst. However, drinking water has its downsides as it could be poisoned causing the player to hallucinate for a short period of time.\n\n# Characters\n\nEach player can purchase characters. These characters are randomly generated and have their own skills and perks. Some characters may be good when it comes to aiming a weapon however, there may be a character who lacks in that skill. Some characters are more agile while others aren't which makes the game way much more realistic in my opinion. If a character dies, you must purchase a new one however, if your character happens to live you may use him/her in the next game you play.\n\nWell that's my idea hope you like it :)"
910u7e,The Onion,"~~The idea may or may not have come from a certain animated movie~~\n\n**Premise**\n\nThis is a pretty typical JRPG game with turn based battles, experience, etc. What isn’t typical is the main character; a sentient onion. This onion is on a quest to remove all of his layers and reveal his true inner self. He must travel to six mystical locations, fighting all manner of monsters along the way.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nAgain, a typical RPG. You control a party of four friends, each of whom possesses different attacks, stats, and attributes, of which can be leveled up with experience points. These rules apply to every character except the titular onion.\n\nEach layer of the onion character represents a different personality, with unique attacks, stats, and dialogue. These different personalities a random each time the game is played, save for the final transformation.\n\nOf course, this random element could potentially lead to unfair situations, so I propose that enemies fought and their levels depends on the current state of the party, to always keep the game fresh and challenging.\n\nFinally, older versions of the onion character would be able to be fought as random encounters, retaining previous statistics and abilities.\n\n*So, the hardest part about making this game would be the ridiculous amount of customization needed for every party setup and how the enemies would respond. I’d say it could even be done in a simpler engine like Game Maker or RPG Maker. But don’t, because I want to. Hah.*"
910maj,"You are the last vampire, supposedly."," **Name:** The Order of Carmilla\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A single player, story-driven, 3rd Person Action/RPG where you play as the last vampire in a world filled with demons utilizing a lance, a cape, and blood magic for combat\n\n**Plot:**\n\nVampires have been extinct for over 500 years. As Carmilla, you discover a conspiracy to annihilate the dhampirs (half human/vampire) and must invoke the help of an inconvenient deity along with its vampire powers to stop a madman hell bent on revenge.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nThe modernized world of Solanum (think Earth 50 years from now). Specifically, the game takes place in the demon inhabited nations of Cerulia and Valcia, both known for their gloomy weather. Cerulia is known for heavy rain and storms. The neighboring nation of Valcia has heavy snowfall year round. There are multiple locations to visit within these nations, but it is not open-world (imagine using the airship for traveling to major locations in Final Fantasy X).\n\n**Characters**:\n\n* Carmilla Stein - Main heroine who wields a cape gifted to her by the Goddess of Blood, Diaspora.  \n\n   * Wields an upgradeable lance\n   * Uses her cape as a shield\n   * Casts various blood magic\n* Diaspora- The Goddess of Blood who is the progenitor of all vampires.

90xdsq,Non-Direct PVP basebuilding FPS,"Note: this is obviously just a dream. Feel free to point to any games with similar features, Since i've been in a mood for something similar in a while.\n\n* Main gameplay\n\nSo, the main area of the game is an underground complex of sorts, built by the player from pre-made rooms, sort of like Doom 2016 editor works, but perhaps simpler and on a larger scale.  \n  \n\nAll the usual stuff: Build reactors to provide power to other rooms, research labs to get new gear, armories, storage, living quarters for the player, etc.  \nYou work towards better gear for yourself, team, and base security to go on story/offline missions, where you shoot people in the face in standart fps action.  \n  \nBut.  \n  \nAll the base and your progress is saved online, and instead of regular missions you can go on ""Raids"" where the game loads the base of another player. Choose a point of entry, get resources for killing, stealing, and destroying stuff. (bonuses for random spawn/not looking at the map)\nThe recieving player, when next online and available, gets invaded in the same area in the same general way, the enemy keeps their cosmetics and weapon loadouts, but the enemy power gets scaled to provide a fair experience.  \nAnd because both ""versions"" of this raid are essentially two different PvE experiences, both players can win and get resources and progress out of this.  \n  \n* Feature: \n\nSince the base is strung from premade rooms, each room can be given a ""sector"" and a ""name"" (from pre-made words) so that the in-game announcement system (a robot or something) can string together meaningful messages from those pre-recorded words to the player, like   \n""Power | Failure | in | Sector | C | Reactor | Two""  \nor  \n""Security | breach | in | main | Storage""  \nThe announcements can work for fluff or just informative stuff too, but Since when raiding, you would hear the announcements of the raid-ee, it would add a lot to hear the enemy tracking your location and listing failure after failure when you wreck their stuff.  \n  \n* Feature 2:  \n\nSince the game is an fps, having Security rooms with a map of the facility would be great. Like, a snapshot of the build-mode on a monitor, doesn't even need to be interactive, just a texture on a monitor. Bonus points if any emergencies show up on the map as warning signs in the related spots on the map.  \n  \n* Final notes:  \n\nAs I'd imagine the scale of the base to be quite big, some sort of quick transportation is needed. trains, elevators, I dunno. Also, you could probably build a lot of systems on this idea, like special rooms that grant active abilities when attacking or defending, aliens (and taming them), cosmetic items, or plasmaguns, or some loot mechanic so that players can always farm for +0.005% more damage mod on their favourite gun, the list goes on, but I should keep the post short."
90x9jg,A Tetris battle royale,"So recently, I've gotten very addicted to playing Tetris. The concept of staying in the game as long as possible is something that's also in a genre of games popular today: battle royale games of course. I'd really like to play a game like this: A large amount of people (if possible maybe around the BR standard of 100) frantically trying to avoid topping out as long as possible, as the player count starts to fall due to players getting eliminated. \n\n There must be a system in place to stop matches from playing out so long, similar to how PUBG has portions of the map getting bombed to have a smaller area for play, decreasing game time. I'd suggest that having the Tetriminoes 'fall speed' increase over the course of the game would work in a similar way. Of course more, external gameplay features could be added, but those are just the basics that could be really cool. \n\nIf there is any game like this already, I'd be very hyped to play it. You can share some of your ideas as well. =)"

90tpt9,Multiplayer Map ideas for an FPS,"As an aspiring game dev, one game I've been thinking of is an FPS. Because of that, there are a few ideas I thought of for MP maps for an FPS like COD or Battlefield.\n\n**I'll first start off with real life locations that I feel would make a good MP map.**\n\nSeaport Village (San Diego)\n\nVentura Harbor (Ventura County, CA)\n\nEverglades (Florida)\n\nSky Harbor (Phoenix, AZ)\n\nMount St. Helens and surrounding area such as visiting center and Spirit Lake (Washington State)\n\nParadise Island (Nassau, Bahamas)\n\nSt. Kitts &amp; Nevis (Island in the Caribbean)\n\nSt. Lucia (Island in the Caribbean)\n\nMogollon Rim (Area in Arizona State)\n\nAntelope Canyon (Also in Arizona State)\n\nMombasa (Kenya)(Not the Halo version)\n\nCentral Park (New York City)\n\nVenice Beach (Los Angeles)\n\nCoronado Island (San Diego)\n\nSanta Cruz Island (Channel Island off the coast of Ventura)\n\nKey Largo (Florida)\n\nSri Lanka (Island off coast of India)\n\nNorth Sentinel Island (Within Bay of Bengal)\n\nKorean DMZ (Area between North &amp; South Korea)\n\nPyongyang (North Korea)\n\nBarrow (Alaska State)\n\nColorado Rocky Mountains (Colorado State, obviously)\n\nBristol Motor Speedway (Bristol, Tennessee)\n\n**Now onto more abstract map ideas I came up with**\n\nScrapyard: A map that takes place in a junkyard (of course) that has a giant conveyor belt going down the middle that leads to a crusher that will instantly kill the player. The map itself would be sort of a maze with key points blotted around. Think ""Vegas Junkyard"" from Rainbow Six Vegas 2 but larger and with more map hazards. The map would have a heavy focus on infantry combat and close quarters engagements.\n\nYellowstone: As the name implies, this map takes place at Yellowstone park. The twist is that the park has a geothermal plant in the middle that players can battle within. This map was inspired by NASA's real life plan to build a geothermal plant over Yellowstone to prevent eruption. The map would focus on close-mid rage engagements indoors and vehicle combat outdoors. The map would also have the springs seen at the park that will rapidly damage players who decide to take a swim.\n\nEruption: Riding off the last map, this map takes place in a rural area within the vicinity of Yellowstone. This map takes inspiration from the movie 2012 as the map would take place shortly after Yellowstone erupts. One side of the map would have the massive ash cloud produced by the eruption that would occasionally cause fragments of debris to smash into given parts of the map. The map will have a mix of urban and rural areas in a similar layout to Burnout Revenge's Lone Peak region. The map will have forests, clearings, rivers, a lumber mill, a truckstop, and a small town in the middle. At the end of the match, the map would be engulfed by the giant cloud of ash. (Like Nuketown, but with fire). The map will have a focus on land vehicle combat with air combat being very risk/reward as though you'll have a clear view of the map, you run the risk of getting hit with a lava bomb.\n\nFrozen Bay: In this map, players will fight along a military naval base in Antarctica. As expected, the map will have major focus on naval and air combat. I think the best comparison would be Zebrugge from Battlefield 1's Turning Tides DLC.\n\n**Let me know what you guys think of these concepts**"
90rkk8,Positive/Negative Affirmation Battle System,"##Concept\nBasically where you either type or pick from predetermined phrases, where to damage enemies is to choose mean and nasty things, while to heal you choose good and nice things.  \n\n\n##Example\n**Negative (Damage):**  \nI hate you. You can't do anything right. You're worthless. You're weak.  \n\n**Positive (Heal):**  \nGreat job! You/I can do it! You're amazing. I like you. You're the best. I believe in you/myself!  \n\n##Further Notes\nIn addition each character can also have a weakness that when discovered, will have a greater effect.\nFor example, say you learn that a enemy lacks confidence, choosing phrases that target that such as ""You can't do it"" will do bonus damage.  \n\nHowever any allies will also have a weakness, and discovering it you are also then able to target that, but for bonus healing. So using the same example of lacking in confidence the phrase would be something like ""I believe in you!""."
90qs5u,Medieval MMO with a lot in common with Mount and Blade: Warband,"So my idea is an MMO in a medieval setting, with a handful of factions, made up of a capital, cities, and villages, all populated with NPCs. Players join the game completely unaffiliated, and can remain so, picking up quests here and there almost like mercenaries. Alternatively players can focus quests for a specific faction, which builds rep, leading to better quests with better rewards, and essentially becoming representatives of that faction.\nPlayers would also be able to join Mercenary companies, which are basically player made ""guilds"", with unique sigils/banners/tabards, in which case the rep they build is reflective of their whole group.\n\nEssentially the idea is Mount and Blade: Warband but with the group you build being made up entirely of other players, and perhaps the player cap for a mercenary company is like 30.\n\nI think this is an interesting idea as it removes the hard faction limit present in most MMOs, and makes reputation with factions much more rewarding and important. I feel the balance of PVE and PVP would be good too."
90qhvz,"A game like fable, with an in-depth choice system and character evolution, but good","Let’s be honest, fable had a lot of promise but was never really good.\n\n The story never lived up to the promise, and everything in the game felt mediocre and half assed.\n\nBut it was still fun to play simply for the choice system, and using your imagination to fill in the gaps.\n\nThere is a huge void in the market for someone to take those ideas and do something good with them."
90n03z,The Thing Idea,"Is it just me, or does a tell tale style game of the thing sound awesome? "
90mvaa,"A turn-based, single player battle arena game","In a game like Darkest Dungeon, the player has to pick a squad of 4 players and manage their four abilities.  Imagine this in a battle arena game.\n\nYou have one player go to the top lane, one to the middle, one to the bottom, and one in the jungle.  Maybe you have a support player in a dual lane.  Early game play involves the laning phase.  Players will play a Rock, Paper, Scissors (, Lizard, Spock) game for laning choosing between:\n\n* Harassing lane opponent\n* Aggressive CSing (prone to harassment but you always get the CS)\n* Safe CSing (only gets the CS if opponent isn't trying to harass you)\n* Use an ability\n* Other (drop a ward, retreat from gank, recall)\n\nThe jungler will be moving through his jungle killing camps and he has the option to gank lanes or counter jungle.\n\nEventually the game moves into the team fight phase of the game where you start take down more towers or map objectives with your team, or possibly split-pushing."
90l7vv,Is this maths puzzle game a good idea?,"So this study: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03501.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03501.pdf) \- shows that you can get any number from 101 to 999 by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing or using powers of a single number - my question is, would this be a fun little puzzle game for phones (as a brain teaser kind of game) - eg, you're given the number 4 and you have to reach 650 or something and you have a timer and move counter - or would this just be kinda boring?\n\nWhat do you think? :)"
90hozk,A classic RE-style game but you replay concurrent events from the perspectives of different characters to progress and improve your time.,"The game is about 3 or 4 survivors whose stories intertwine. Each character has their own paths and unique abilities. **They have 1 hour to escape/survive.**\n\nThe unique hook is that you can only get so far with one character before you must replay the same ""time"" with another character to progress further.\n\n* **Example 1:** You reach a locked gate with character *X* so you must start character *Y's* story and unlock the gate from a different area.\n\nYou see, the other unique hook is that there is an on-screen timer counting down one hour. However, you can go back to any character's previous chapters to try to improve your times. And there is strategy in choosing what chapters to replay.\n\nIn the example above, if you just replay *X's* first chapter and get a minute faster, he'd still end up waiting anyway. But if you replay *Y'* first chapter to unlock *X's* gate faster, it means *X* will have started his second chapter sooner, improving his time for his later chapters too. Depending on who is waiting for who, those improvements could collapse times for even more characters as well!\n\n* **Example 2:** You're playing chapter 4 with character *Z*, and through a gate you can see *Y* fighting monsters. It's replaying the exact gameplay you did when you played *Y's* chapter 4. But now as *Z*, you throw a flame thrower over the fence. Now if you replay *Y's* chapter 4, you'll see your *Z* throw a flamethrower over the fence, which you can use to beat this chapter even faster.\n\n### The Final Boss\n\nIf you manage to reduce your overall time to under an hour, the characters survive to reach the final chapter. The big monster boss is beaten only through the cooperation of all your surviving characters.\n\nCharacter *X* is trapped and has no way of hurting the big monster, and must survive as long as possible. Character *Y* is attacking the big monster from another end and trying to kill it before *X* dies. You can beat it by either replaying *X* to live longer than it takes *Y* to kill the monster, replay *Y* to kill it faster than it takes for your *X* to die, or go back and forth trying to improve both.\n\nIf you figured out a way for character *Z* to make it to the final chapter, he'll be throwing supplies to both *X* and *Y* from above while fighting off his own horde of monsters. Those supplies would then show up when you replay the other characters, allowing you to do even better."
90hie2,Music game with RPG and Business Management elements.,"Synopsis:\n\nYou play as a young artist who just picked up their instrument of choice for the first time, after that, the choices you make could lead you down any number of paths, from starving artist to fame and fortune, and anything in between. This game would require the player to switch between a standard controller or keyboard, and the musical instrument controllers. The controller or keyboard would be used to navigate the open world and complete missions or jobs. The instrument controllers would be used to practice and play gigs.\n\nPossible Features:\n\n-character creation- choose your starting instrument and what your character looks like, and assign starting skill points, possibly pick preferred genres?\n\n-skills and XP- similar to how many RPGs function, the more you practice something, the better you get! Skills would include (but not limited to) your musical instruments, guitar, bass, drums, vocals, and also charisma, which would be used to persuade NPCs (any other ideas for skills welcomed!)\n\n-Huge open world- when not playing a gig, you would use your controller to explore a huge open world, filled with venues both large and small, cheap and classy. There would be all kinds of stores in game to buy musical equipment, food and drink, clothing, cars, tour buses, apartments, houses. Etc.\n\n-consumables- of course, with the rockstar life comes pressure to use substances of all kinds, you can choose to abstain or partake, your choices will affect who likes you and who does not. As anyone who has tried mind altering substances knows, these consumables have there benefits but also there disadvantages. Some will be immediately apparent, others may take a long time to expose themselves. Addiction and rehab are possible.\n\n-Business management- once you get good enough to start booking gigs, you will have to manage aspects of your band. It will start easy enough, just booking venues and keeping your band members happy, but the bigger your band gets, the more intricate it becomes. You might have to hire people to carry and setup equipment and help with recording albums, maybe you will want to get press coverage, perhaps once you start making enough money you could hire a manager to take some of these responsibilities off your shoulders? The choices are up to you!\n\nThanks for reading! This game would obviously be huge, it would require a large studio and lots of money to make, so it will probably just remain an idea.. but any feedback and ideas to add would be awesome! I love this subreddit and reading all your cool ideas, and would love to hear what you guys think!"
90ha7c,New (I'm not sure) Spin on Battle Royal,"Everyone knows the formula of a battle royal game. 100 players fight to the death til there's only one. Blah blah it's kind of played out already..\n\nBut imagine a game where 100 players are placed in a coliseum and 2 players of the 100 are placed in the centre and are made to fight to the death. After one of the two players die, the survivor is placed back in the crowd (with whatever loot they gathered) and another two random players from the crowd are made to fight. This repeats til only one player remains making them the winner (obviously). \n\nThe arena/centre is randomly selected out of numerous designed arenas that can range from multiple time periods such as: Western, Scifi, Noir, Pirates, Modern, Jurassic etc. \n\nNot only would the arenas be inspired by time periods, the weapons and armours players can find would be inspired by them as well! So a player would find a Glock in one battle, in the next find a cowboy-hat, and in the next a samurai sword. \n\nOh and amongst all this, a charismatic announcer would be making comments on the actions of the crowd and the two players. \n\nI don't know if other gamers would want to play this, but I know the classic battle royal formula is just flat out getting boring and repetitive and I think this would be pretty cool"
90dm4o,A mystery/puzzle game,I just think that a game where you basically get given someone's bedroom and then have to find out as much information as possible about them would be interesting. \n\nI don't really know the point of it but damn would it be fun. We all wanna snoop through people's stuff because it is fun but obviously we don't do it in real life. So someone should make a game where you can do that.
908vzl,CO-OP arena: take BR concept about killing everyone... invert it. Everyone has to keep alive everyone else,"Since there's an GameDesign Docuemnt with lot of stuff inside, I'll keep this as very short.\n\nIn this arena there are no enemy players, not in the direct sense of some dudes with guns shooting each others.\n\n- Player protagonists here are some kind of androids: since they can run as fast as car... it's relatively easy to reach any point of the map in little time.\n\n- The planet is collapsing, there's an apocalypse going on: the goal is to escape the planet by repairing a crashed spaceship (difficulty is  is intentionally scaled up to ""nearly impossible"": even worse than DarkSoul, since it presume that **most** players run for a nearly perfect walk-through)\n\n- Event earthquakes reduce the viable walking ground: they randomly fracture the map (not as a simple narrowing ring like in battle royale genre). Travel across land become increasingly difficult as patch of ""death spot"" clutter the whole area.\n\nThe whole GameDesign Document is +20 pages and contain formatted text and pictures:\n\nhttps://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/LwqJnACaKmLaZYkbGByMELAV\n\nodt documents can be opened in LibreOffice. This project is intended to be done with Godot Engine: with and for Linux."
9071k5,A base building game where you go on missions to improve your base.,"I really like the idea of building a base that actually matters along with logistics, dungeons/ raids, huge loot stashes, and sieges. The main idea is to have a base that you can upgrade in unique ways and that takes time to set up. \n\nThis game would be mission based but also let you sandbox around your base to speed things up/ defend better. For instance, maybe your first mission is to free some prisoners/ survivors and you end up getting some workers. Maybe another mission is to raid an enemy base to steal turrets, or dungeons to get money/ magical equipment for your base. I don't really have a setting in mind, but I definitely want the missions to feel like they matter by adding unique features to the base, and I want there to be NPCs actively working on real stuff. Maybe you go on a mission to steal a teleportation device, and then use that to steal enemy cannons, which will take time for your NPCs to add. As you go around the base, you'll notice them digging foundations and dragging cannons around. I don't want it to be super fast, I also don't want it to be like, ""will be ready in 2 missions"" where you see it one set stage at a time. This is where the sandbox comes in, you would be allowed to help your NPCs set things up faster. Maybe you could personally dig some foundations, or personally take that supply wagon to its intended location on a sketchier but faster trail than what you'd trust an NPC with. \n\nIdeally this would be first person and AAA, but I can honestly see it as an indie game. Thoughts?"
906mtp,A Game Of Thrones game in the style of Dynasty Warriors,"It makes sense to me\n\nDynasty Warriors has 3 factions / kingdoms: Wu, Shu, and Wei, that all fight for control of the land. Game Of Thrones has a similar plot - several houses fight for control of the throne.\n\nYou could play as the different characters in the show (Jon Snow, Rob Stark, Ned Stark, Arya Stark, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Bronn of the Blackwater, Tywin Lannister, Daenarys Targaryan, Jorah Mormont, The Hound, Stannis Baratheon, Renley Baratheon, Brienne of Tarth, Tormund Giantsbane, Hodor, Oberyn Martell, Theon Greyjoy, Yara Greyjoy, Ramsey Bolton, you get the idea) all fighting for different factions throughout the Game Of Thrones timeline against hordes of enemies. Each character would have unique styles of fighting and special abilities"
905a34,Pomodoro idle game,"Really stretching the boundaries of ""game"" and ""gamified productivity app"" here...\n\nA game where the game is ""played"" during the period of an uninterrupted Pomodoro (or a custom time). Fond of the idea of it being a phone application where the activity ""fails"" upon phone usage past a particular time threshold (such as Forest's implementation). Rather than distracting the user watching it ""play"" during the idle period, I think there should be a minimal screen with a timer followed by a detailed report of the ""action"" conducted during that period. As such, I don't think there's a need for art assets -- just a minimalist look, maybe with ASCII icons. Some sort of currency, objects or stats being returned along with the report would be some incentive to play, and some negative outcome from an aborted Pomodoro would be the incentive not to break it.\n\nKept the terminology vague as while the most obvious idea for the setting would be some RPG with stats, gold and loot -- hence the proposal of ASCII icons like classic roguelikes -- I think there could be a number of ways to implement it. Say, a city-builder (Dwarf Fortress, anyone?), 4X, a party-based RPG, tower defense, a survival setting, slice of life sim and so-on. When I think about games that people consistently play and return to over time, I do however think of those old school roguelikes and the appeal of randomized gear and many race-class combinations. \n\nAs a note (and some praise for the developer), there is a desktop application called [Pomodorium](http://pomodorium.blogspot.com/) which aims for a similar purpose, but I think there must be a way to make it mobile, streamline it and make it more accessible to a general audience (and, honestly, smooth the appearance...).

903vpu,A 80’s-90’s gang war MMO RPG.,I always see RTS and MMOs always takes place some sort of futuristic fantasy world. But me I want to make a game but with a 80’s-90’s gang era feel. A mixture of the warriors and World of Warcraft .\n\nIt make sense to me because you can have many different gangs and enemy’s to fight everywhere you go. Also you could have corrupted police be the main enemy. There is lots of creative things you can do with the designs for the different gangs.\n\nI was thinking the story could be about you trying to stop the other gang because they are killing to many other gangs and the payout for his life is big. I was thing about doing a Zelda breath of the wild thing where you can invade his hideout and try and kill him at any time but you will get crushed if you do it early giving you a reason to play.\n\nI would take place in a violent downtown area with an urbanhell feel with tons of trashed places to explore. You could go to the neighborhoods with have tons of crude fixes to homes and slums and where you would usually go to find quests. The town area would be a more urbanized area full of trashy and shady stores where you would buy weapons and cloths. If you are looking to fight or grind then you would go to the rioting parts of the town. They would usually be around big buildings like malls or in front of the police department and they would have many enemy’s to fight.
902bpa,game as a villian,"what if there was a tongue-and-cheek game where you play the villain in an ""MMORPG"" world "" the game wouldn't actually be that more like a decision game). you are trying to complete your evil plan, but these annoying heroes keep popping up all the time (new players joining the game) and you have to get rid of them to complete your plan. the difficulty is in managing to destroy all the heroes before they get to kill you (a la tower defense). there could be creative ways of dealing with large amounts of heroes (like dispatching stooge quests that lead them to their deaths).the difficulty comes where if you don't deal with the heroes, they get higher in level and accustomed to the game, to the point where you cannot deal with them at all and they kill you (in like a cutscene or something idk, but there should not be any physical combat in the game).  \n\n\nas i write this i remember there was a VR game where you play a blacksmith for new players, which is kind of like this idea, except you are the villain trying to kill mobs of heroes.  \n\n\nPS this idea was inspired by the one quote in borderlands 2 where handsome jack says ""UH now heres the thing about you bad guys, you know the heroes going to win but you JUST DON'T DIE"" (jack is the main villian in the game btw and he believes he is the hero in this story which i thought would be great to expand upon :) )  \n"
9025hd,2 player game based on choices.,"\nI would find it interesting a game where two people play the same story but not simultaneously. Think of a game where a player controls one character during a chapter and the other player controls the other in the same chapter but in a different perspective, the idea is that they can not play at the same time, the choices the first player made can't be revealed to the second player and as the plot unfolds would be interesting to see if the players are angry, happy, or sad because of the events and choices that they both made during the story far. Just a brainstorm I had 5 minutes ago"
8zw8e2,An 8bit retro style game based loosely on the Short Circuit movies.,"Imagine if Johnny 5 had his own Nintendo game (although it's not technically Johnny 5, it's a character who *looks* like him, just like how the VTech Socrates borrowed a similar image)...\n\nAnyway, so the game would follow the plot of the two movies or combine them or something. A robot has been given life and he fights for his survival against the military who created him. ""Johnny 5"" needs to keep from being captured, and when he gets damaged he needs to find new parts by either getting them from his enemies or by stealing them from Nova vans. \n\nThe game would be topdown view like Retro City Rampage and maybe have RPG elements as Johnny would have to talk to humans and negotiate with them for help. Some humans would try to rat him out for the big reward on his capture. "

As you beat more levels the car will slow down / speed up to screw with you. \n\n"
8zvugu,More game designers should look at the past for ideas.,"There are so many great game concepts that came from the past... Take for instance, a game like CoCoRon for the NES. The mechanics are very similar to Mega Man, but you build your own Dream Creature to fight with. \n\nAvenging Spirit aka Phantasm for Arcade made you play as a ghost that could take over any of the different enemies in the game. \n\nCrusader of Centy for the Genesis was a Zelda clone but with big differences. You could throw your sword and have it bounce off walls. You could recruit animal friends who gave your sword different powers (Chilly the penguin would turn your sword to ice).\n\nWillow for NES was probably a huge inspiration on Zelda Link to The Past - Zelda 1 and 2 didn't look anything like it, but it took the action adventure genre and gave it more. \n\nGunman's Proof on Snes took the Zelda style of gameplay and gave it Earthbound quirky humor. Plus unlike Zelda, you could shoot a gun.\n\nSparkster / Rocket Knight Adventure for Genesis gave you a sword fighting, flying armadillo who could hang from trees by his tail and charge jump diagonally. \n\nPulseman for the Genesis was a unique Mega Man clone but instead of shooting you dash through enemies. \n\nThere's so many great games from the past to draw inspiration from and get ideas. Everything doesn't have to be 3D, and you can always avoid copyright by making your own characters. \n\nMore 16bit style games should be made. \n\n"
8zvg3k,Homesteader!,"Inspired by games like stardew valley, but with a bigger scope on homesteading.\n\nIts not just about cutting trees and growing crops, but managing water, fire, (animals?).\n\nBegins with a very isolated property, no facilities.

8zqscr,A cross breed between 2 sub genres of the same game.,"So card games are great fun, collecting rare card in random packs, playing with friends ext, but they are kinda hard to get into with extensive rules, you gotta have friends to play with and how building a proper deck can be pricey, so you have online card games, where you buy a loot box for rare cards, you can play with anyone around the world and the rules are a lot easier to figure out with the access to tutorials, a ref that won't let you make illegal moves and sometimes hints and tricks, but they are less personal, to play with a friend you either need 2 pc next to each other, or just play like they were a stranger, you also don't get anything physical, so if the server ever go down or you stop playing, your left with nothing. So a toys to life card game, like skylanders and hearthstone combines, you buy a mat that you can plug into the pc, it's laced with many small nfc readers in either a solid board or a flexible mat (so you could roll it up and when you want to play replace your keyboard with it), each card will have a small nfc chip so the mat can read the card. With this you can play with friends but use the online tutorials to learn how to play, play multiplayer with everyone else, play with just your friends, or maybe a feature where you can combine 2, plug 1 in and now you can play the game like normal but with sound effects and graphics on your PC to add an extra touch (or just to help guide you if you don't know the rules)"

8zpma7,A game all about building and crafting,"I've been craving this game for so long. I wrote this about a year ago to post on here but i never got to it. I apologize for my crappy english in advance:\n\ntags: building, sandbox, open world, crafting, trading\n\nLocation references:\n\n\-Espiunca (before the tourism took over)\n\n\-Portuguese xisto villages\n\n\-any dense pine forest\n\nthe intro of the game:\n\nYou are an adult who came on vacation to the village with your friends (or alone). You went there for a week camping by the river, when you came upon an auction. They were selling a lot nearby SUPER CHEAP. And you were like ""what the hell?? so cheap??""\n\nso you bought it without thinking twice and stayed there forever.\n\nmy notes:\n\nI had this idea for a building game but I'm only an animation/illustration student at the moment. this wont probably happen any time soon. i doubt it will happen at all. but i wanna save these ideas in case if it does become possible in the future.\n\nIt's a singleplayer game, first person view. You'd be able to walk, run, jump, cut trees, gather fruits from the wild and hunt if needed. \n\nThe concept is similar to stardew valley, now that I look at it. It's basically the same thing in 3d but more focused on the building and decorating. I hope the similarity is ok.\n\nImagine a small village with a river and mills, inspired in the Xisto villages from Portugal. It's located in a pine forest in the middle of the mountains.\n\nYou're an adult who decided to go on a 1 week vacation to this place, camping by the river. On the last days, feeling sad that you're leaving so early, you come across a local auction. They were selling a plot of land for a very cheap price. You end up buying it without thinking twice.\n\nSo now you own this plot of land just outside the village, it's great. except it has some issues (still didn't figure out what, but that would be the reason why it was so cheap.\*). Your first objective would be to fix those issues -either yourself or by hiring someone.\n\n(\*about the issue with the plot. I dont know much about this sort of stuff but maybe there could be a cave just underneath it, making the ground unstable to support the weight of the house. In this cave you could find something that would feed the game with a side story about the village? I don't know yet.)\n\nThe game would give you some money at the start, and you'd have to decide how to spend it. This money would be your life savings, and it's the only money you have at the moment. You could gain more money by doing small favours around the village, or just by getting a part time job at the local cafe or something. \n\nYour plot of land would be empty, only filled with trees, plants, rocks and a river that passes by the side. \n\nThe game would be all about building your house at first.\n\nFirst you'd have a tool for planning out the house. You can build it as big or as small as you want. You'd have to get the resources for it yourself OR you could buy or trade them at the village. The map would be open world, with a big forest filled with goodies.\n\nOnce you build your house, you can also design your own furniture, build from templates or buy from the village. \n\nTo gain more money you can also craft and cook items to sell at the village. You could also get your little spot at a shop to sell your stuff.\n\nAt one point in the game, the village would get access to the internet. So this means you can order resources online, furniture, decorations. You can also start an online bussiness selling your own designed furniture, fruit jams, cheese... all sort of things you can craft.\n\nYou can also use the internet to learn news things. These things can be about the village itself, recipes for cooking, crafting, life hacks... the internet would open a lot of new possibilities, and things you couldnt do before because you weren't sure how to could be learned on the internet. Some of these informations can also be found at the library, there would be books with valuable information for the whole gameplay.\n\nAll these things are unlocked from the start. I feel like it would make sense if the player already knows these things from real life experiences, then he should able to do these things. This also means I want as many recipes as possible in the game.\n\nThis wouldn't be your typical game. I love the building part of some games, but i never found a game that is focused on that. In games like Rust, The Forest, ARK, fallout 4... I always love to build, but i never feel satisfied. All i want is a game, that isnt minecraft or sims, focused on building and that isn't about fighting. A chill game, sort of a life simulator. If it's something i crave, I can only believe that there are other people out there with the same feeling.\n\n\----------\n\nthings that would be cool in the game:\n\n\-build your own terrarium with plants you collect from your area/buy online already made or the stuff to make it - you can also sell it online if you made it yourself\n\n\-a camera for taking pictures. maybe then you could sell them aswell, make a gallery of some sort.\n\n\-cheese and butter production\n\n\-alchool production\n\n\-EVERYTHING YOU MAKE CAN BE SOLD OR TRADED\n\nI really want this to happen but i have no money, no team, and no knowledge."

8znwmd,"River City Ransom, but it's set in the Old West (cowboy era).","River City Ransom is a classic beat'emup with an iconic look and feel. Technos used the character designs for many other different games like ""Crash n' The Boys"" and Dodgeball, as well as Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki dayo Zenin Shuugou! -- which is basically a River City Ransom game set in fuedal Japan.\n\nWhy not take the familiar style but redo the game so it's in the Old West. Have horses, have shops where you can buy equipment, but it's all stuff that would be specific to the time period. Characters would still say ""BARF!"" and other things after you beat them up. "
8zni0g,16bit pixel art J-RPG where Real Time Attack and Turnbased worlds are becoming mixed up.,"Secret of Mana.\nLink to The Past. \nTeranigma.\n\nThese are examples of great Hack and Slash RPG's.

Stab some more.\n\nChrono Trigger. \nFinal Fantasy. \nDragon Quest.\n\nThese are games that you have to do everything from a menu. You select an action and your character jumps around, does a prescripted animation and eventually the enemy dies. Not exactly MY cup of tea...\n\nBut!!!! What if.... The worlds of these RPGs were being mixed up by some unknown force. A character from the Hack and Slash world (the main world) comes across an enemy. A relatively low level enemy. He swings his sword but... It does nothing!!! He does the frustrated anime style ""whack at it from multiple angles because I don't know what to do"" guesture. \n\nHe can't figure out how to beat this mystery creature, or to even get it to engage with him. It has a Blue triangle over it. He's never seen such a thing. All the enemies he's ever seen have a Red triangle. This thing just sits there ignoring him which just frustrates him more.\n\nNearby, another character -- from the Turn Based world, sees the low level enemy -- He walks into it and the music plays a short ""violin noise"" and the Screen Swirls and the two characters are now standing on a 2D flat playing field with a sky background. The mysterious character moves a cursor through a menu at the bottom of the screen, he selects ""Attack"" -- His animation plays -- the creature dies in one hit, fading to red with big slash marks.

This makes absolutely no sense to the Hack and Slash character. Turn Based mechanics is something he's never seen.\n\nThe Turn Based RPG character says he followed the creature through a portal and somehow ended up here. They team up, learn each other's ways. Enemies with a RED triangle above them are Hack and Slash enemies (because it's the color of blood, fighting). Enemies with a BLUE triangle are Menu RPG enemies (I associate Blue with menus). Each enemy can only be attacked a certain way and the enemies in one area might be Hack and Slash, but the enemies in the next area might be Menu RPG. Menu RPG enemies have a set walk pattern that repeats (like the Goblins in Chrono Trigger). Hack and Slash enemies will actively chase you and attack you with whatever they use, be it weapons, teeth, etc. (Like the Wolves in Secret of Mana).\n\nWhen you walk up to a Hack and Slash enemy, you can just hit it like in any Zelda game. But walking up to a Turn Based enemy starts an ""encounter sequence"" ala Final Fantasy, Tales of Phantasia, Chrono Cross etc... Violin noise and Swirly Screen.\n\nSubsequently, player characters either have a Red triangle or a Blue triangle -- and Hack and Slash characters cannot attack Menu RPG creatures, and likewise, Menu RPG characters cannot attack Hack and Slash creatures.... Until much later in the game when the two sides have learned how (leveled up and gained Menu battle techniques or Real Time techniques -- at which point their triangle turns Green). \n\nMore characters cross over into the Real Time RPG world and sometimes the team must go into the Turn Based world to fight certain story progressing enemies, at which point the Menu RPG characters have the home field advantage. Eventually it is discovered that a villain from the Turn Based world created the portals through some kind of technology or magic and teamed up with the villain of the Real Time world to halt the progress of the troupe.\n\nThe only way to get everything back to normal (get the two worlds to be separated again) is to beat both the boss villain of the Turn Based RPG world and the Real Time RPG world. The gang of friends must say goodbye to each other, unless of course one of them stays in the other's world. \n\nThis game would basically be Secret of Mana meets Chrono Trigger. The hack and slash attacks are basic, melee combat. New charge attacks would be added to make things interesting for the Hack and Slash world. When Menu RPG characters would attack enemies they'd have the ""jump towards and jump back"" animation. And big fancy animations for techs just like in Chrono Trigger. \n\nArt style would definitely have to be 16bit pixel art, or hand drawn.

8zmmq5,The Last Stand- An asymmetrical attack/defend PVP area defense FPS set in the Wild West,"The railroad is coming. A dozen small western towns which lie directly in the path of the railway remain defiant to the change and have refused to sell and vacate the land. But the railroad company and those who stand to benefit financially from the creation of the railroad aren’t giving up that easily. \n\nTwo teams: The Townsfolk and The Marauders. \n\nThe Marauders are Mercenaries of sorts- they consist of the general criminal element dotted along the western landscape, illegitimately contracted by the Railroad to put these small towns under siege to either drive out the residents, or kill them all and burn everything to the ground so that the Railroad can come up and purchase the land at a cheaper price. \n\nThe Townsfolk consist of the various walks of life that inhabit the town. Everyone from the bar tender to the banker to the sheriff, blacksmith, school teacher, town drunk and more. Man or woman, if they can handle a pistol and a rifle, they have answered the call to defend their town from the Marauders and by extension, the Railroad.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe Townsfolk have been warning of the impending siege and are frantically preparing, hastily setting up fortifications and traps. Starting out in the Sheriff’s armory, The Townsfolk will select their weapons of choice- Shotgun, six-shooter, lever action rifle, bolt action rifle with scope, and a state of the art semi-automatic pistol that one lucky person will get to use. They will have 3 minutes to board up windows, set tripwires, get into position in sniper perches, and more. There are also axes, shovels, TNT, Molotov cocktails (thank the bartender for supplying these), and other weapons you’d find around a town such as this.\n\nThe Mauraders will start on the outskirts of the town on the other side of the hill where they will choose their weaponry from the backs of covered supply wagons. Same types of weapons are available. The Marauders are not allowed to advance on the town until the signal is given- the chime of the clock tower at noon.\n\nGunplay is less twitchy and more about precise aiming with inaccurate weapons. Character movement is not fleet of foot- there is a weight to the movement, nothing too cumbersome but you’re not going to be bunny hopping your way out of a fire fight. There is no cover system, but shooting from behind cover is the most practical and wise approach to combat. \n\nTeammates can call out enemy positions to anyone within earshot (a  predetermined radius). The location will be marked with an arrow, but the enemy player’s movement will not be tracked. \n\nDamage taken is indicated by an old fashioned health bar. You can bandage yourself to stay in the fight and regain some health, but the more damage you take, the lower maximum health you can heal back up to. Health does NOT automatically regenerate.\n\nWhiskey will temporarily increase your maximum health in increments of 20 up to 100%, so keep your flask handy or swing by the saloon for a quick shot. Be warned, though, that whiskey will numb more than the pain- the more you drink, the poorer your aim and less precise your movement. \n\nKilling is not the only option. If you’re able to down an enemy, you can tie them up for a capture, which is the ultimate insult. Captured players provide intel on their team’s fortifications or movements - ALL current enemy locations will be temporarily revealed upon capturing an enemy. Captured players can be rescued and provide counted-intel on their captors, or team-killed before they are able to provide intel.\n\nThe Marauders have two possible objectives- One, kill, incapacitate or capture all of the Townsfolk. Two, destroy every main building in the town. To destroy the buildings they must set a number of fires. Townsfolk can extinguish the fires with water buckets. \n\nDUEL- If it comes to a point where there is only one player on each team remaining, they can opt-in to an honorable duel in the middle of town. Both players have to agree before the Duel will activate. Once activated, the players will automatically holster their weapons and will be unable to attack. They will be directed toward their respective markers on the street. Once both players are in position, a 5 second countdown will begin. At the end of the countdown, they will have to press a randomly assigned “DRAW” button (this part happens in slow motion) and then manually aim. Any hit counts as win- but there is more honor in shooting a leg than a kill shot, but your honor rating is really only for bragging rights and personal role play.\n\nREWARDS- As an example, Shooting the gun out of an opponent’s hand in a duel earns the player a special badge in their profile, an achievement/trophy, and a special character skin to use in all future matches. For example, if you’re playing as the Banker, then a precision shot like that will earn a unique variant of the Banker’s outfit. Same goes for each other character as well. Capturing a certain number of enemies rewards the player with a special profile badge, achievement, and a special stitching pattern on their rope satchel. Burning down a certain number of buildings rewards a special lighter. A certain number of accurate shots, Head shots, duels won, etc earns a variety of special engravings for your selected weapon. So on and so forth. \n\nLOOK, SOUND AND FEEL: Whether cartoonish graphics or a more realistic appearance, the game should be designed to look, sound and feel like the cliche’d old western films. Big puffs of smoke when guns are fired, hats fly off, characters grab their bullet wounds and fall to the ground like a movie actor when killed... Bullet ricochets, water barrels that leak when shot, tumbleweed, dust, hanging signs swinging in the wind, squeaking saloon door hinges and creaking floor boards, etc. the gunfire would sound similar to what you hear in the old west films as well. Punches and glass breaking would have that old fashioned film sound to them. The idea is to make the player feel like they’re in an old western FILM, not like Red Dead or whatever. \n\nWEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT: The Marauders will be outfitted like a militia would- well equipped with proper equipment, yet with their own individual flair such as engravings, patches sewn into clothing, eye patches, bandanas, different style hats, Spurs, boots, gun belts, etc. Although each Marauder is distinctive, overall the Marauders share a fairly similar appearance.\n\nThe Townsfolk are far more distinctive. The Sheriff looks like a Sheriff, star shaped badge and all. The school teacher wears a dress appropriate for the time period. The drunk is dirty and unwashed with unkempt facial hair. The banker wears a nice tailored suit. So on and so forth. They each have unique customization such as hair style, hat style and color, and a number of other things but ultimately they will appear as if they were in the middle of their daily routines when news of the attack came down. \n\nWeapons are the usual fare of the old west with variations of each. The single action revolver is dead nuts accurate. The double action is slightly less accurate but fires faster. The lever action rifle is fast-shooting  but not as accurate as the bolt action rifle. The bolt action rifle is the most accurate but has a slower rate of fire. The break action Shotgun, comes in single or double barrel, long barrel or sawn off. Long barrel has better accuracy but isn’t as good for close quarters. Sawn off has poor accuracy but is very good in close quarters.\n\nMelee weapons include: Shovel, Axe, Pick Axe, Whiskey Bottle (blunt weapon until it breaks, and then it’s a stabbing weapon... you can smash it on the bar or other object if you want), hunting knife (thrown or held), fist, and wooden plank.\n\nWell, that’s my general run down. Probably some more ideas I forgot to put in and some flaws I haven’t noticed."
8zmbyh,"A game ""like"" Secret of Mana, but it isn't.","It seems like these days the only way to reboot a series is to make a game with the same concepts but with original characters. \n\nFreedom Planet did Sonic play mechanics but used original characters and original story to avoid a lawsuit. (Freedom Planet originally started out as a Sonic fangame). Spark The Electric Jester mixed Sonic with Kirby. Mighty No. 9 was Inafune's way of doing a Mega Man game but without using the character. Bloodstained: Ritual of The Night is just Castelvania with a different paint job.\n\nWell, I'd like to see Secret of Mana get a similar treatment.... Stick to the core concept --- Do what the original game does but do it better. \n\nA big big big global world that you can fly around. Flying is great travel for RPGs, gives a chance to show off the world. Secret of Mana had a dragon. Tales of Phantasia had the Aerobirds, Evermore had some Spaceship... Just make sure you have SOMETHING that can fly... \n\nLots and lots of Weapon Choices. Secret of Mana had 8 different weapons and each player could pick one, level it up and use charge attacks. Evermore had guns, bazookas, etc.\n\nLots of spells. Every spell would grow and change the more you used it. \n\nCombat was real time, you walk around and just hit things. Very easy. Tried and true ever since the first Zelda game. Walk, attack. Spells would of course have to be activated from the Ring Menu. That's the part that makes it ""slightly"" like a Turn Based RPG.\n\nThe story would have to have a lot of depth. Lot's of character progression. Dramatic moments that make the player weep from emotional conflict. Happy moments that make the player smile.\n\nMusic would have to play a big role in the emotional feelings too. Compare something like Hopes and Dreams from Undertale with Meridian Dance from SoM or The Sacrifice Pt. 3 from SD3. Big musical moments that make you feel something deep in your gut.\n\nGameplay would have to be by controller, because that's the only way to experience a game like this. \n\nThe setting could be any time, any place. It could have time travel, it could have planetary travel. Imagine that, what if the characters in Secret of Mana had the ability to go to other nearby planets??? \n\nOr how about this... What if... Elements from a Turn Based RPG world were crossing dimensions into a Hack and Slash RPG world, and the characters in each world had no idea what to do???\n\nA character from the Real Time attack world encounters an enemy from the Turn Based RPG world, they try to attack the only way they know how - but it's not affective!!! There's potential for humor and 4th wall breaking. Each side knows how their system works and they have to get through each battle based on what the enemy responds to. \n\nThe characters from both worlds meet and try to team up in order to learn from each other. To figure out how to get everything back to normal. The ""sad part"" is after the end of the story, each side has to go back to their home. \n\nThink of it like.... Secret of Mana meets Chrono Trigger, but all the characters are totally original. Nothing that would piss off Square, but definitely some references and homages that fans of both games would catch.\n\nIt has to be colorful. Cartoony. Well drawn and animated. Big and epic. Deeply engaging. And it needs to have the same spirit as what it's trying to emulate. "

Food will not be a major concern, but it is a factor you need to consider. Food can be bad for you, but bad food will share characteristics you will learn.\n\nWater: Players have two sacks of refillable water, enough to last them a week. Water from rivers will not be poisonous, but some water will be undrinkable, this will be indicated by the colour of the water or the smell of it.\n\nStamina: There is no stamina bar, but doing body-requiring tasks will make food and water drain faster.\n\nAnimals:\n\nAnimals will be pretty much like the animals in our world, but there should of course be new creatures to explore as well.\n\nWill animals hunt you?\n\nYes, under certain circumstances.\n\nCarnivorous animals that outnumber your (group) health by four times will consider you a food source.\n\nEx. Human player has 100 health, the bear has 550 health, the bear will attack if it's randomly generated hunger bar is under 50% (the hunger bar will be generated together with the animal if you enter a chunk).\n\nEx 2. Two human players have 200 health combined, there is a pack of 8 wolves nearby, with a total of 800 health. The wolves will attack the human players if their combined hunger is under 50%. Humans will automatically gain these buffs if they are near 50 metres of eachother, animal health will only be combined if they are in the same pack.\n\nNatural dangers:  \nFloods, avalanches, earthquakes, forest fires, extreme weather, they will all play a role.\n\nFloods: If in a tropical region near a large river, the river can flood and players caught in the flood can be swept away in the current.\n\nAvalanches: During storms or heavy winds, avalanches are much more common.\n\nEarthquakes: Earthquakes are completely random, with mountain ranges and islands experiencing them more.\n\nForest fires: In hot weather where it has not rained for many days, forests may fly aflame.\n\nExtreme weather: The cold and the heat will have tolls on the player.\n\nThe exploration part, how does it start?  \nThe first batch of players will spawn in the starter village. From there they will set out to explore, whether in groups or not. If there are 5 players in a group, they can create a new spawning point nearly anywhere. Players will now be able to select the second spawning point. A player can only create a spawn point every day. Players will be given basic supplies at the start so they can immedediatly start exploring.\n\nWill you have a cool animal companion:\n\nI think horses would be a really cool addition, as they would be able to traverse non-mountainous terrain very fast, they do have disadvantages in some regions such as heavy snow.\n\n(must be fed too ofc)\n\nAnd yes, dogs, who wouldn't want a dog?\n\nMultiplayer or singeplayer:  \nMultiplayer, 24x24 regions are seperate servers, you enter a new server if you pass a 24x24 region. Singleplayer should be an option too but it should be focused on MP.\n\nGraphics?  \nThe graphics completely differ on the resources of a developer.\n\nAAA: Realistic beautiful graphics, it's like discovering a new world:  \nNo resources: Poly graphics are beautiful for landscapes, they would be good too and would be very light on the computer.\n\nHow big is the world:\n\nIt's procedurally generated, every new region enter never entered before will have a chance of spawning one of the natural wonders, which would be premade. (There can not be two of the same natural wonders).\n\nEx. Highest mountain (natural wonder) in the game would spawn in chunk 42.9. This 15 KM high mountain would be hard to overcome. Statistics will be held on who has travelled the most, climbed the highest, etc.\n\nPVP:  \nYes and no. Players would not meet very often, and if you kill a player you would be immediately marked to other players if they see your name as (Murderer!). They would either kill a troll or a desperate person who just managed  to survive.\n\nTheres probably a lot of errors and bad mechanics, but it's an idea of a game which I would like ;)"
92j8gm,Play as a dragon and terrorize people while other players try to hunt you down.,"Inb4 science-based dragon MMO jokes.\n\nThis game idea is definitely a ""dream"", inspired loosely by Evolve, Jaws Unleashed, Spore and the upcoming Maneater. The basic premise is that one player plays as a dragon or similar monster (maybe DLC for things like giants, dinosaurs, etc) of their own design and terrorizes settlements and peoples on various huge, open-world maps, inspired by various cultures and parts of history. Ancient Rome, Medieval, Neolithic, Bronze Age, perhaps even prehistoric times with cavemen or modern city maps. \n\nIn creating your dragon, you choose a basic body type, such as hexapodal dragon, wyvern, lindworm, lung/Chinese dragon, drake/giant lizard, etc. You can customize your body further with all sorts of spikes, frills, horns, crests, and can also customize your body size, all sorts of traits coming with pros and cons. A medium-sized wyvern with heavily armored scales, for example, would have difficulty with flying, but be guarded against most weapons, whereas the same wyvern without armored scales would be vulnerable to weapons but could quickly fly away. Drakes and lindworms cannot fly or breathe underwater, and so must rely on strength, hardiness and on hiding places such as caves and marshes. Lungs can either breathe underwater or fly via magic, but not both (the former trait allows you to hide in underwater caves). All dragon types can breathe fire, though the strength and type must be customized. Fire breathing requires fuel, which is gained via eating animals or people (the ""fattier"" they are, the better, there's a sort of fat/calorie system in place which regulates flight and fire). Horns, spikes and other customizations are not just cosmetic, but can have functions to add traits like goring or tail-swiping (think Stegosaurus). \n\nAs for gameplay as a dragon, you can destroy buildings, kill and eat people, wildlife and livestock, and steal treasure. But the more you do this (in single player), NPC hunters, knights, or other potential heroes will try to kill you. This would be especially difficult in modern maps, as these could include military soldiers, advanced police forces and even rednecks with heavy firearms.  In multiplayer mode, NPC ""heroes"" are replaced with other players, perhaps up to eight of them, with customized human characters, armor and weapons appropriate for the map's theme. Both modes are like Minecraft's Hardcore mode, in that one death equals game over, though you get a ""permanent record"" in the form of a ""legend"" similar to Dwarf Fortress's Legends mode. The game ends when either the one dragon is killed (the only real way to end single player mode) or if the human player characters are all killed (in online mode).\n\nSo yeah, that's my dream game idea. Feel free to criticize, give feedback or ideas."
92gt34,FPSMMORPG but with modern/old weapons + archetypical RPG classes,"(Inspiration taken from Destiny + World of Warcraft + a few other games)\n\nLemme give you some imagery:\n\nYou queue up for a typical 5-man dungeon; 1 Tank, 1 Heals, and 2-3 DPS classes.  You pop into the dungeon instance, and take a look around.  The tank is already headed down the first steps of the dungeon corridor, his heavy armor clunking the whole way down, shotgun at the ready.  This tank's got several abilities, mainly AOE damage and threat generating ones, along with an escape, and a couple survivability techniques.\n\n\nYou, the Healer, have the hardest job in this game type.  Playing a Priest class, your gun (or whatever weapon) does no damage - instead it instantly heals targets hit for a small amount.  However, you've got several healing abilities to supplement your mainhand healing, possibly 1-2 Heals over Time, a long-cast powerful heal, and maybe an instant AOE heal with a long cooldown.\n\n\nThen you look over to your dps.  This matchup put you with a Hunter; a bow/crossbow wielding class that uses pets to aid them in combat.  They must time their shots carefully and also mind their pets in battle as they're a core part of their damage.  Next up is a Warlock who can use a wand weapon or a gun, in this case he picked a wand.  The wand has a much slower firing rate than a gun, but applies and re-applies a Damage over Time spell on-hit, adding to the Warlock's existing arsenal of DoTs and a few hard-hitting nuke abilities.  Your last DPS is a straight-up Gunner, he's got an ability that allows him a short window of not needing to reload, another for increased damage on-hit, another that applies a Bleed on-hit for the first few bullets (stackable), a few more damage abilities, and of course some mobility to stay safe in fights.\n\n\nPvP in this game would take place in Battlegrounds similar to WoW, and would similarly be largely healer/dps focused.  Tanks are mostly (not entirely) for PvE content.\n\nClass abilities would not have a global cool-down, but would instead have longer ability-specific cooldowns, allowing players to combo their skills together while not being overpowered.  As players level they'd gain Talent points to drop into a skill tree that would modify or improve their abilities to their liking.  Gear would be obtained through both PvP/PvE on an RNG-esque scale, resulting in a somewhat grindy but achievable experience that's still rewarding for players regardless of which kind of content they prefer.\n\n[Please keep in mind, none of this is balanced obviously, I just gave some specifics to give you guys a rough idea of how it could work.  The general idea is Destiny-like combat but with WoW-themed classes/abilities and both PvE and PvP combat for players to enjoy.]\n\n\n\nPlease let me know what you guys think!  I know for a fact that if I saw a game like this being developed, I'd probably $100 or more into its development process as a supporter."

92ao6a,A multiplayer sinking ship game where what you do matters! (Larger Post),"This is my first post here so sorry if this is a bit messy and sorry that it's so long! A forewarning for this game idea is that whoever might happen to decide to use this idea would need to put in a lot of research and knowledge into how steam ships of the edwardian era operated and the limitations of the technologies and many other things.\n\n**Name:** Save or Sink (just kind of an example title I guess)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* The very basic idea for this is a little similar to something like Space Station 13 except you're on a fully 3D modeled Edwardian era steam ship and you have people trying to sink the ship and the crew tries to stop them or slow down the sinking. Everything you do to the ship itself effects how it sinks and the round ends when the ship is submerged or the ship arrives in port. The graphics would be best if they were made realistic rather than stylized, voxel, or something else.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nAs stated already, you have people, maybe one to five, depending on the server size, trying to sink the ship. They can do this however they want and take as long as they want. Similar to Space Station 13, the antagonists aren't known unless they're caught doing something. Once the ship is sinking, though, the crew's main focus would be to either patch up the hull if the hole is small enough, get everyone off the ship, call for help, keep electricity going as long as possible, etc. All this while still trying to find the culprits. The game only ends when either the ship arrives in port or the ship is finally gone. There is also the possibility of other scenarios such as the antagonists trying to take control of the ship (and possibly sailing it somewhere else, not sure) as an example. As for where the ship is going, it could start at a port and then after maybe two hours or so arrive at its destination (that is if nothing is done to either stop the engines or sink it.) As for the motivation of the antagonists, they could either just be some random gang/terrorists, in a conspiracy, or motivated by one of the world wars. Random events and modifiers would be able to occur during the voyage such as bad weather, icebergs, mechanical malfunctions, encounters with ships getting too close, and more.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nThe setting is pretty much entirely on an Edwardian era steam ship, so think of ships like the Lusitania, Titanic, and the like. The best scenario for the ship would be for multiple ships that are selected at random, though one ship is fine. Ideally, the entire ship would be fully modeled and explore-able (depending on your class/rank). Some of the ships could be passenger ships while others could be just cargo ships. It does need to be a steam ship and can't be a modern or sailing ship as the mechanics in mind don't entirely work on the other types of ships. A starting port could be used as the starting point to gather players before a round and any late joiners could spectate or would have to spawn at their work station or bed.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe ship crew would have ranks within the roles (chief engineer for example), but this list is a little more simplified. Servers are expected to be able to host many people, so a lot of roles are given. (The use of NPCs for unfilled roles is optional but discouraged.)\n\n* Antagonists: Limited to somewhere between 1-5 players, with the possibility of Antagonists able to recruit other players. They could start with nothing or be given some simple tools or a small, reasonable weapon. Their goal is to sink the ship (or gain control of it in alternate rounds.) In order to sink the ship they can do this however they want whether that's ramming it into another passing ship or iceberg, drilling a hole in the side, setting off a bomb, making a boiler explode, messing with water pumps, setting the ship on fire, etc. A key part of this role is that they could be anyone on the ship from a passenger all the way up to the captain. Only they and the other antagonists would know of their intentions.\n\n* Engineers: These guys are in control of the electric work and the engines. They run emergency dynamos if needed, make sure the engines are working and change how fast the ship is going if given orders, maintain optimal conditions, and fix any electrical problems the ship might be having.\n\n* Stokers: These are the guys working the boilers. They shovel coal into them, keep the steam up, put out any coal bunker fires, and such.\n\n* General Crew: These guys are there to maintain the rest of the ship and keep an eye out for trouble makers. A couple may patrol the decks, one will keep an eye on passenger jewels and be basic customer service, some will just keep the ship clean and maintain the ship, others may carry messages between the bridge and the lower decks if there is no telephone or similar system, then some may keep track of all the cargo and mail. The role is rather generalized and this role can pretty much wander the ship doing different jobs or doing things the higher crew asks of them.\n\n* Master-at-Arms: This guy is basically the main security and is in charge of the weapons used by the officers and captain. They are able to arrest people and put them in the brig and are also meant to keep guard of prisoners. They can also get some of the general crew to help them out if needed.\n\n* Officers: These are the highest ranked crew besides the captain. They run the ship from the bridge with the captain and take over during times when the captain is unavailable (or not present in the round). Part of their job and the captain's requires navigation of the ship to get it to the right destination, otherwise they may end up on some random beach or in an ice field (or even running aground on a deserted island? Just an idea for possible scenarios.)\n\n* Captain: The main person in charge of the ship. They have ultimate authority over the ship's crew and everything that goes on, including the speed.\n\n* Lookouts: These guys are stuck either at the front of the ship or in the crow's nest, depending on the type and size of the ship. They keep an eye out for things that might block the way such as icebergs or other ships.\n\n* Quartermaster: These are the guys at the wheel of the ship and basically are also extra hands for the bridge. They share a similar rank to general crew and are to follow orders given by the officers and captain.\n\n* Stewards and Bellboys: These people tend to the various needs of the passengers and crew, usually 1st and 2nd class, but also a little bit of 3rd. They do things like operate elevators, run errands, do laundry, walk/feed pets, clean rooms, wait on people at dinners, etc.\n\n* Telegraph Operator: This person spends the voyage sending and receiving messages with the telegraph of the ship. (Note: understanding of morse code is not required for the sake of players' sanity) They are also the ones who send distress signals if the ship is in danger and have to fix their own equipment if it breaks down. They are not able to break the antenna on the ship if it breaks though. (This would be a series of wires between the masts of the ship and would have to be repaired by engineers.)\n\n* Pet (optional role): If the ship is to have pets aboard, they should be playable so that they can run around and do whatever. They could either behave or get into all sorts of trouble. They would not be able to speak and would rely on gestures for very basic communication/emotion. As far as pets go the go-to species is obviously a dog, but to make things more interesting the use of ferrets, cats, and other animals is encouraged.\n\n* Passengers: These people are just here for the journey. They get to wander the ship and hang out as they please in the various rooms of the ship or even in their own state-rooms/cabins/rooms. They are however limited to their class section except in emergencies or if allowed by crew. 1st class are generally rather rich and hold a lot of priority over other passengers when it comes to demands. 2nd class aren't so rich and are generally more like middle class people. 3rd class are immigrants, working class, and other people and are not very important to the crew, but are generally the main customers of shipping lines. They are also the largest class section. (Obviously passengers are not present on cargo ships).\n\n* Cooks/Chef: They cook the food for any meals that might happen during the voyage for the passengers and crew. (generally there might be maybe one meal per round).\n\n* Doctor: They heal anyone that might be sick or injured. They can enlist the help of stewards for basics such as carrying things or restraining someone in pain.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The basic mechanics of the game are to get the ship from port A to port B. Every member of the crew has a job to do and the antagonists have their goals to meet. Everything on the ship has to be done by someone, whether that's repairing something or steering the ship. However, there are antagonists on board that want to sink the ship, though everyone is pretty much oblivious to this until something suspicious happens.\n\n* As for the inner workings, there's a lot to cover. People can have conditions such as getting drunk or falling ill from sea sickness or a cold. (Illness should be semi-rare and more common in passengers than crew.) In case of fires, burns and smoke inhalation could occur. The ship can have a list depending on how much coal or cargo is on one side of the ship. The amount of coal or cargo would also affect, if only slightly, how low the ship is in the water. The water should have physics and dynamically affect the ship. Water would be kept out of the lower decks under normal circumstances so water can't be a flat plane! Stormy weather can happen as well and that means wet decks and high waves, allowing the ship to have water pour in if things are left open and it also means a rocking ship. Holes in the ship's hull will allow water in and the amount of water on one side or end of a ship will cause a dynamic tilt. Water tight doors will block water and if there's not enough water for the ship to lose buoyancy then the ship will not sink. Open doors will allow water to flow more freely. Closed doors will restrict water until the pressure becomes too much. Water would be able to flow through vents and plumbing as well. Small holes in the ship should be able to be patched up but also have a chance of leaking again. If the ship is very large and sinks slowly, it should have a higher chance of breaking in half similar to the Titanic if it ends up at a high angle. Destruction of the ship would be dynamic and things like funnels collapsing and doors breaking would depend on water pressure/force or if someone is breaking something. Driving the ship while it's sinking will cause water to flow in faster. Icebergs and other ships may sometimes be present, though other ships will generally be farther away and icebergs don't happen every round. The entire game has rounds, each round assigning people to different roles and selecting a new ship (possibly) as well as any random events that might occur. Roles could be chosen by players or randomly selected or both. Role play would be encouraged but not necessary. Chat, whether voice or text, would need to be restricted to a local area in such a way where people on other decks can't hear each other unless they're yelling down stairwells, but also would need to be set up so that you could understand a person that was a reasonable distance away in the same room as you. Closed doors would muffle or silence sounds completely. The speed of the ship would also effect round time. Full speed would take about 2 hours maybe and half speed would at at least another hour to the time. Full stop would make the game last indefinitely until something happened. Supplies could have a limit, so things like cooking could be limited by supplies so while the cook would have a lot of supplies they could only serve so many meals for example. For distress signals, the likelihood of the the signals being received depends on the size of the ship, the strength of the signal, and what type of signal, such as telegraph, morse lamp, or rockets. Life boats would have to be lowered manually by crew in emergencies and cutter life boats would need to be used if someone fell overboard and life rings would also have to be used in this case. (Note: the amount of lifeboats does not have to be enough for everyone depending on if the game takes place before or after the Titanic's sinking) Life jackets worn by people would allow them to float better in the water and prevent fatigue when swimming for extended periods of time. The location of a bullet hit or a knife stab or anything else would affect how much damage is done to a player and if it kills them or just knocks them out. Knocked out people would be able to be revived. Dead people not so much. The amount of people in a lifeboat would affect how heavy the lifeboat is and the tilt of a ship would affect how a lifeboat hangs from its ropes at the side.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* The main thing that would stand out about the game is the physics engine most likely and how the water affects the ship and how the ship reacts to different stresses. Another feature would also have to be that all the different jobs basically affect each other in some way, such as boilers affecting speed and electricity production. The amount of work put into it would be nearly enough to replicate various historic events with some level of accuracy if the historic ships were put into the engine and put in the same scenarios as their real life counterparts.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* Really this is best suited for PC.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Some extra stuff would be the ability to customize your character and choosing different outfits for each role and rank. As far as ships go there could be some historic ships, fictional ships, or both. A bit of another bonus would be for hosts to be able to determine what all goes on with each round from what ships are chosen to what events can happen and how frequently. A very far-fetched feature that would take a lot more work and time would be for players to be able to make their own ships with some sort of in-game ship designer and being able to upload the ships for others to use.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nI guess if you do want to credit me for this I only ask for a mention in the credits, something like ""based on an idea from chimerabyte"" or something.\n\n-----\n\nThat's pretty much everything I can think of for this idea! I know it's huuuuuuge, but this is pretty much just a dream game  that I wish I could play. I would try to make something like this myself but I lack the skills required for such an undertaking. I do welcome PMs from people interested in working on this if they would want me guiding them through all the various ideas or need someone with knowledge and research on the different things needed. (I can also make blueprints for ships.) Something else I feel I should mention is that this isn't a project that should be rushed out. This is something that would need a lot of time and care to make it fun and to make it work right and look good."
925wod,"An action game that at first seems like a typical roguelike, but you soon realize the enemies are other players.","This is a 2D action roguelike (think Rogue Legacy or Dead Cells) but with asynchronous multiplayer *designed to look like* a single-player game.\n\nLike most rougelikes, progression and the world layout are both mostly randomized. Each run will be different in the abilities you find and the objectives you have to complete to move onto the next area. **The twist is that most enemies are—in fact—other players like yourself.**\n\n### WHAT IT IS\n\nMain enemies move fast like players, and could have any of the abilities and weapons a typical player would earn throughout a run. Combat is fast and frantic with blocking, parrying, dodging, combos, hitstun, *the works.*\n\nEnemies have a small health pool depending on their difficulty: usually about 10% of your health. If you drop their health to 0, they go into a flashing *Death State.* During their death state, you can still keep fighting them for bonus XP. Deal enough damage and they'll explode in a shower of XP. However, if they manage to hit you back while in that state, they'll vanish.\n\nInversely, if an enemy hurts you enough, they'll enter a glowing *Enlightened State.* If you can land one hit on them in that state, they'll vanish and leave you alone.\n\nYou might have already guess what is happening here:\n\nWhen you put an enemy into a Death State, that's another player who sees *you* (as an enemy) go into an Enlightened State. As you progress further into your run, you'll run into players with more abilities and/or upgraded ""health pools"" because they've gotten further into their own runs.\n\n### HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe game would constantly be matchmaking in the background. When you go to the next randomized stage of the map, the game has already selected another player who will load in on the other side and is playing a mirrored version of the stage. If one player has to get from point A to point B, then the other player has to get from point B to point A. If one player has to get a treasure, the other player has to defend the treasure (sometimes from waves of enemies). So on and so forth.\n\nThe game would hide this online feature by also including ""live leaderboards,"" Dark Souls-style messages and other asynchronous multiplayer features that would require an online connection. If the game legally requires connection messages, then the whole game would use a futuristic cyberpunk theme with MS-DOS type loading screens full of other messages to hide it all.\n\nThe game would also have a hidden ranking system for matchmaking. Once you beat the game however, everything is revealed (if the player hasn't figured it out already) and now you can see everyone's rankings and even enter an unlocked arena mode."

923ael,Eschaton,"Game Title - Eschaton (unless I get better suggestions.)\n\n Concept - I kind of view this game as Warhammer meets Steve Jackson's Illuminati\n\nSo imagine a game where every culture's Armageddon scenario was coming true, but all at the same time and in the same world setting. And it is all one massive conflict to see who wins ""the end."" Kind of an All Myths Are True situation. So there are a bunch of different factions like Warhammer/40k but each of them represents some part of the Global Apocalypse.\n\nFactions (off the top of my head):\n\n* The Reptilians - So I kind of view these guys as being close to the ""standard"" army of the game (think a baseline army like the Space Marines.) When I say Reptilians I don't mean an army of actual reptillian aliens (mostly.) If you know of the Tau from 40k, think of the relationship as like Reptilians are the Ethereals, and 99 percent of the time they are just pretending to be the President or the Queen or whatever. This army would be Western and mostly use recognizable near-future military units. These guys are the oligarchs of America and Europe, and they had it good till everything went to Hell. This would probably be the first army released.\n\n* The Church - Priests, Magic, Neo-crusaders in power armor and crap. An army that feels more melee oriented and throwback-ish. The catch here is that while, on the surface, they are all Jesus-y and what not, the **HORRIBLE TRUTH** is that the Catholic Church is actually an ancient Babylonian conspiracy led by immortal illuminati types. (Think Vandal Savage in a funny hat.) They are all for fighting the Anti-Christ over power, but they think the Second Coming is fake (or say they do) because Jesus actually coming back is antithetical to their whole project.\n\n* The Antichrist/UN/Babylon - These guys are probably close to, as a loose analogy, the Chaos Marines. They, like the Reptilians, are built on a base of normal-ish human soldiers and vehicles (the UN peacekeepers, natch.) But their elites are  demons or demon infested humans, and they have the ability to call ""spells"" from Satan to do...stuff. Of course the Antichrist can lead the army, but rather than being a fighty character I think he would be a Leadership unit, unless he morphed into The Dragon!\n\n* Jesus and co. - Angels kicking ass. Big Jesus with a flaming sword. The army of the second coming.\n\n* The Army of the Hidden Imam - Think of something like ISIS but they are actually right that it is the apocalypse. The Hidden Imam is back and leading the armies out to conquer stuff. He (of course) wields the legendary sword of Ali and everyone has super insane morale because holy shit.\n\n* The Commies- This is potentially my favorite army. Instead of the supernatural, think like China in 100 years with transhumanism, cyborgs, super futuristic weapons and all that good stuff. Led by some kind of Chairman Mao analogue who has promised that the Proletarian Revolution is finally at hand. Probably lots of cheap baseline cannon fodder soldiers too, although honestly that part of it may be anachronistic.\n\n* The Aliens (Martians) - If you have read or seen War of the Worlds, I think you can figure this out. Not ""actually"" Martians, but they are the reference point for this army. Huge heavily armored tripods and what not.\n\n* and, of course, Cthulhu - All the Lovecraftian goodness in one army.\n\nGameplay: The game would be played with minis, like Warhammer or (old reference) AT-43. I don't know enough about gameplay design to really do this part justice. Maybe IGOUGO, maybe something new and flashy. Regardless, there are dice and lots of them.\n\nAnyway, I have had this idea in my head for a really long time and I hope you guys either enjoy it or have some cool suggestions."

91yy30,An FPS where you get a bio of every faceless mook you kill,"Pretty much what the title says.  Every time you kill a guy, there is a popup you can stop and view that tells you who you just killed, why he or she is there, what their hopes and dreams were, and who they are survived by, if anyone.  \n\nMaybe some of these could be carefully human-written, but for most of them I think you'd want to have them be mixed and matched from pieces; but there should be enough pieces that it never seems repetitious.  \n\nI mean, the meta-narrative purpose here is obvious enough.  But if you wanted to get really dark and sick with it, in an open world game, you could also list the home address of their relatives.  LEAVE NO ONE TO TAKE REVENGE.  \n\nIdeally this would be accompanied by said faceless mooks having highly detailed and individualized faces.  "
91uvq3,'Sim city'game but with train which is running on wasteland,"So as you know, I got this idea from Korean movie 'snowpiercer'.  You are captain/commander/driver of this train which is supposed to never stop, and you have to obtain food/water/medicine through different improvised cabins and upgrades such as rainwater/snow-on-rail collector, greenhouse, stable, and many more. \n\nIn the snowpiercer movie, there were some 'ethically-uncorrect' cabins such as prisons, dubious sources of food like cockroaches and even used child labor to fix the broken engine. It would be nice to see some of those choices in game similar to Frostpunk. \n\nIt is completely your choice, but I think the game would be better if there are no 'enemies' such as zombies(I know, Final station) but only 'time'. Your train start to break down, erode, and deteriorate.\n\nI think this is idea will especially be great for those who want to create city builder games but don't have enough budget/time to do so. Trains tend to be smaller and simpler than cities. \n\nP.s. Sorry for bad English."
91tmex,"A movement-based puzzle game about simultaneously controlling multiple mascots, all mapped to the same buttons.","This is a grid-movement-based puzzle game (think Cubed, Death Squared, Stephen's Sausage Roll, etc.) in which you simultaneously control two or more chibi mascot characters that have to get to their respective level exits.\n\nThe catch: **EVERY CHARACTER CONTROLS VERY DIFFERENTLY**\n\n*Popi Panda* has traditional cardinal controls (up is north, left is west, etc.) whereas *Lala Lemur* has tank controls (up is forward, left rotates counter-clockwise 90°, etc.). They're all tied to the same D-Pad and you can't move one without the other. Another character might be *Snoot Snake* who has a long body trailing behind it and can't reverse. *Jesse Giraffe* is effectively a cylinder that falls on its side (taking two spaces) and from there it can roll along that axis or stand back up depending on the direction you move.\n\nBeing the heaviest, the panda will always move other characters out of the way if they crash into each other, whereas the lemur will climb over any obstacle or mascot in its way. Ideally, there'd be about 20 unique mascots overall.\n\nLevels start out with simple obstacles or narrow paths, but they progressively get harder with stage hazards and more simultaneous characters."

91ragf,JRPG set in simmilar world like ours,"Games starts in world like ours with out mystical creatures - no goblins no faires e.t.c. with main character (MC) doing everday life. MC might live in city or rural area or whatever you want. \n\nMC wouldn't know how to fight at least in start of game. He would do some quests - like helping farmer to plant plants in farmland, deliver something someone e.t.c. Of course he would get xp from those quests. \n\nThere still would be encouter (any kind) with wildfire but for some time MC wouldn't encounter with them. But first encounter would be fixed but somebody would help MC. Even after MC wouldn't want to fight maybe he starts fighting around beetween start and mid-game.\n\nI have two ideas about if mystical creatures would be appear in that world or not from different world. In one after while they would appear in other not."

91ixm6,Castle crashers style arcade game,"So I’ve been dabbling around different game mechanics that I’ve been learning from YouTube using the unreal engine 4 but I haven’t really had any direction to what I’d like as a project game to develop. I know I love multilayer so I was thinking of all the fun games I used to play with friends growing up. I slept on the idea and was thinking about Castle Crashers specifically. For those who don’t know, its a 4 player arcade slayer where all players are displayed on the same portion of the screen. Fight waves of enemies to save the princess. Wondering if anyone had some cool ideas that they’d like to see for this style of game? "
91haxc,"Freakshow!! (PvE and PvP style game, inspiration taken from the hunt showdown)","So basic premise, you and three other people (maybe more) have been captured by a traveling Circus and most fight the monsters of this circus (and each other) while upgrading your character along the way ether by giving up your humanity and becoming a monster or trying preserve it by gaining items and devices.\n\nOn top of all that you have to entertain the people watching your performance, by killing monsters, mutating more and more into a freak or by facing off against other players, you get more popular if you die, not to worry the circus has a place where you will receive a new body.\n\nA more in-depth look at it: \nthis is a circus freak show themed PVE/minor PVP game where 4 players fight circus freaks (evil clowns, mutated animals, monstrously gluttonous behemoths etc) and each other,\n\nThe area will be varied from classic tents and the big top, to haunted houses and graveyards,\n\n you will have 3 (maybe 5) lives before being sent to a new game, you keep all your equipment or mutations until you are out of lives.\n\nKilling monsters and players will give you bottles of black Icor, these can be exchanged for items and upgrades to existing equipment or passives OR you can use it to mutate yourself into 3 different classes of freaks, all at a shop in the area that is a safe place so you can make you selection in peace, should a player be close by while you are shopping, you can op to appear out of a random tent away from the shop, now on to the mutations \n\nThe Stalker.\n\nThe Glutton.\n\nOr\n\nThe Cackler.\n\nEach comes with benefits and weakness\n\nThe salker is long and lanky with large eyes and no mouth to speak of while wearing a straight jacket, making it  a expert jumper, climber and stealth expect, has a low profile and long sharp claws, able perform leap attacks that cover a lot of ground but give away your position by a loud cry of sinister laughter, if you stay still you become darker, more so should you be near buildings, this will also heal you should you take damage,\nCarful though a stalker is quite fragile and can't take enemies head on.\n\nThe Glutton is a monstrously fat creature wielding to massive butcher knifes and a massive jaw, large nostrils and fat folds covering his eyes while wearing a stained white t-shirt with brown overall, able to gobble up most smaller NPC freaks with it's bite attack which heals him for a smaller amount compared to the stalker, but you can get these heals quicky, eating will fill up a bile meter, when full you can hurl a stream of bile at you target hurting them and slowing them by a small margin letting you catch up to your prey.\n\nThe Glutton will shake the ground as it moves and make a gurgling sound as it gets closer, its faster then it looks, able to charge through fences and wooden boxes without slowing down, a brick wall will cause it to stop from continuing the charge.\n\n\nThe Cackler:\nThis creature is a little taller then humans but has a forced smile and itseyes are forced open, wearing clown clothes and wields a wrench.\n\nThis creature uses it's laughter to hurt and stun its opponents, when attacking NPCs you focus on a single creature beating them to death with your wrench, to heal you must find a fun house mirror interacting with it will make you laugh, healing you while you do so, it will alert other to your presence so you can stop anytime keeping the health you gain.\n\nThere is a start up and away animation so you can exploit the mirror, most of your powers will be Sonic attacks that distort vision and/or cause various debuffs, like making  your prey move a certain way (like there controller is stuck moving to the left or right) you can even use the NPC freaks to your advantage.\n\nAnother ability is to set traps, trip wire, gas mines stun lights, stuff like that.\n\n\nNow these might sound nice, but when you become a freak, you start with a basic stat increase to some areas as well as a visual change, clothes and some appearances.\n\nThe Glutton will get the shirt and overalls\n\nThe Cackler will look like a smiling clown\n\nThe stalker will get lankier.\n\nOnce you complete the repective trees will you become a true freak of that class.\n\n\nNow all these monsters sound horrible and grotesque and you would think that, obviously you would want to play as these different monstrosities and indeed everyone could.\n\nBUT the humans as tricks of their own.\n\nEnter the kidnapped!\n\nYou have the magician, excels at illusions and disappearing!\n\nThe veteran, even if the firearms are goofy strange and disturbing, they still work.\n\nThe father, fixing this is around the house has given him a nack for messing with machinery to his benefit.\n\nThe detective, he knew there was something wrong with this place, now he just has to get out to tell the chief!\nExcels at sneaking and can see others foot prints for a brief time.\n\nAnd finally the athlete, running jumping and throwing things got him this far, might just get him out too.\n\nExcels at using throwing weapons and sprinting long distances.\n\n\nEach can use the Black Icor to upgrade there ability and buy new weapons, upgrade and repair ones they like etc.\n\nPlaying each to there strengths and buying equipment to mitigated their weaknesses will be beneficial to you (I know obvious right? But some people don't do that with other games) this prevents from seeing the same type of play style from different people.\n\nThe vet works will with firearms like the popcorn gun (it's a shotgun where you spray burning hot popcorn on your foes)\nOr the carousel-sniper (you let the carousel reach full speed to fully charge a shot)\n\nEven the cotton candy grenade, explodes in a cload of pink slicing anyone who gets cought, only thing that can survive one is a high mutated Glutton.\n\n\nThe father works best with power tools, lollipop woodsaw (like the TF2 lolichop but with the candy part being a single buzzsaw instead) candy corn nail gun etc.\n\nKeep in mind that any human can use these, it's just not going to be as effective as the ones who benefit from using them.\n\n\nNow on to tasks and how people go about doing them.\n\n\nOne thing to be alive is the crowd is everything, in order to go on to the next area you must please the crowd enough, do this by going into event tents that have big flashing neon signs that's say NOW SHOWING!!\n\nYou entered this tent in order to play mini game tightrope walking, juggling, jumping over dangerous pools of water, completing Feats of Strength, all that stuff others can join in as well if they do it becomes a contest between who can do it faster, the one who doesn't faster will get the most pleased crowd, the other will still get a pleased crowd but not as much.\n\nplayer monsters can join in as well because even though they have to please the crowd, they become a person trying to hinder your efforts.\n\n should they succeed they won't harm you they won't hurt you but you would have failed and they'll go off out of the 10th and you will end up in a tent away from them with a minimal amount crowd happiness (I'm going to call it this from now on)\n\nNow it's not necessarily the  aim of the game to hinder your human opponents, in fact it can be encouraged to help each other but you can stab each other in the back if you want.\n\n\nonce you reach the maximum amount of crowd happiness you will be able to enter the next area by entering the Big Top tent there you go be given account currency and other prizes like permanent Buffs for use later in your next game.\n\nbecause once you've been able to go to the next area you can have a choice of either quitting to the exit and the game will save progress on that character or continuing.\n\nShould you continue you be loaded into a new game in the next area with people who also have completed the previous area, monsters will be stronger both NPC and player and other players will also be stronger like you will be (or should be at least.....)\n\nShould you be the last one to make it to the Big Top tent you will not be rewarded as well in fact there might be a chance you will get a debuff because how long it took you make the crowd happy with your performance, things like speed decreases Vision impairments that will last for a little while in the next area.\n\n\nin each area they'll be lots of verticality but different themes of that a carnival, you will have things like a rollercoaster area with confessions and stuff the next area might be a haunted house and with a graveyard different floors and damaged parts of the building with the exit leading to the Big Top tent.\n\nShould you when all four areas then you will be able to upgrade your starting weapons for the next game as well as upgrade your shop with better stuff.\n\nyes there will be cosmetic choices you'll be able to get, such as having the Glutton be a great white shark or the detective being in the noir Detective, the father being the stereo typical Couch Potato beer belly dad,\nAnd so on and so forth\n\nthere were a couple other ideas I had such as being able to see other players while inside the shop should they be standing near the shop for too long this is to discourage people being assholes and and ambushing people at the shop\n\nAnyway that's my idea what do you guys think anything you could add?"
91geq6,Ecosystem evolution board game,"I had an idea for a board game with a similiar premise to the other ecosystem sim idea in this forum right now. You had one (or maybe more than one) continent board, and each species also has its own board. \n\nThe continent board determines resources, which are divided between terrestrial and aquatic, and organic and inorganic. Each turn resources are transmitted between categories depending on the distribution of species. Autotrophs consume inorganic matter, detrivores consume organic matter, and heterotrophs consume other species. There is potentially a constant dwindling drain of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic due to erosion, meaning amphibious species are important for land based life to work- but I haven't quite worked this out yet. Might be better as some sort of event card or something.\n\nEach species has its own board, and you only start with one species. Each species board is divided into four traits, and the combinations of all four traits. Traits are cards, pulled from a deck and placed around the species board. Individuals (marked by triangular pieces of wood) are placed in these categories on the board to determine what traits they have. If any trait dominates the entire population, it is retired from the species board and added to their morphology, and a new trait card is placed on the species board. When two populations share no traits on the species board, one population is moved to its own new species board.\n\nYou start out with one unicellular autotrophic aquatic species, and have to evolve heterotrophic and detrivore species before you run out of inorganic nutrients, lest they'll go extinct with no potential to evolve new species - game over.\n\nThe biggest problem is I haven't figured out what if any winning conditions there would be. Would you play it against others hoping to outsurvive their species? That doesn't make sense from an evolutionary point of view. Would it just be single player and you just play until you go entirely extinct? Then games could be very very long then, and it'd be more like Conway's Game of Life than a game, and what about if you create a stable ecosystem that doesn't have too much chance of going extinct because it's stable enough to be capable of counteracting any deleterious traits that appear? Maybe creating a stable ecosystem could be the winning conditions of the game - but then it seems like there'd still be lots more left to play, since all sorts of neat new creatures could evolve after extended periods of time past when the ecosystem became self-sustaining."
91ex2g,Make your own ecosystem with your own creatures,"Build an ecosystem, create creatures to inhabit that ecosystem, then play as one of those creatures.\n\nYou start out by making a map. You can choose four different climates for your map: arctic, subarctic, temperate, and tropical. How many plants you have in specific areas depends on how much water you place. (Look at [this biome pyramid](https://imgur.com/1nfLCzE) to get an idea of what I'm talking about.)\n\nThen, create creatures using basically a more complex version of the creature creator in *Spore*. As well as the creature's appearance, you can also edit its behavior. You can choose whether its diet consists of large animals, small animals, fish, insects, leaves, grass, fruit, water plants, or any combination of the above. You can make it aquatic, amphibious, terrestrial, or arboreal. Create sexual dimorphism, as well as differences between the adult and baby. Is its temperament docile, timid, or aggressive?\n\nThere is also a size editor, and your creature can be a prey animal the size of a human finger, a whale/sauropod-sized giant, or anywhere in between. Its metabolism can be shifted too. I imagine the hunger bar would go down faster and stamina would be lost slower in creatures with high metabolisms, and the inverse would be true for creatures with low metabolisms.\n\nAfter you've added enough species to your map to support a full ecosystem, you can pick one of your creatures to play as. The gameplay I picture being like a mixture between the creature stage in *Spore* and *Saurian*, as you search for food and avoid predators long enough to find a mate.\n\nIf anyone wants to work on this, you don't have to credit me, as I'm more interested in playing this damn thing than being rich or famous. Feel free to suggest more ideas in the comments."
91ep5y,Post Scrotum - a game where you have to scratch ur ballls when it gets itchy,
91d790,"Help, I need some ideas! Dungeon Crawler Fused With Dungeon Builder (For 2 Players, in real time)","Hello, I'm working on this project currently, and I needed some help generating ideas in terms of gameplay and characters. I have a few thought up already, but they certainly need refinement. \n\nThe main idea is: There's Some great treasure. Of course, being the amazing treasure it is, and the fact that no one has gotten to it yet (it's also incredibly ancient), is because it's guarded by... Something. No one has been able tell what it was because no one has defeated it yet. But there are still people who want the treasure, and go after it. Will you be able to best the treasure guardian?\n\nSo, think indiana jones and laura croft for style, with a whole lotta roguelike. \n\nThis is a game for 2 players, played together in real time. \n\nOne player is a treasure hunter, and will traverse the death trap the treasure guardian will build for them.\n\n// I feel I must discuss the gameplay loop here first, in order to explain the characters better //\n\n3 Main Phases: \n\n(Treasure Hunter) (3rd Person Action)\n\n1. Preparation. The Treasure hunter buys supplies needed for their journey, (mostly) choosing their build. \n2. Traversal: The Treasure hunter must go over some terrain in order to reach the treasure. Random events will happen. Some build abilities added, removed, or changed. \n3. Gauntlet: The Treasure Hunter goes through the death trap that is the treasure guardian's area. \n\n(Treasure Guardian)(Top-Down RTS-Style)\n\n1. Build: (Cover's the Preparation and Traversal Phase of the Treasure Hunter). The Treasure guardian places walls, traps, units (could get a bit like an RTS, Fable Legends)\n2. Gauntlet: (Overlaps with the same gauntlet phase). The Treasure Guardian moves units, activates traps, and (hopefully) watches the treasure hunter perish. \n\n 4 Characters so far:\n\nEach is better at a certain phase of the game\n\n\- A Victorian Big Game Hunter (Good for Traversal)\n\n\- An International Jewel Thief (Good at Gauntlet)\n\n\- An agent working for some shadowy organization (Good at Preparation)\n\n\- An archaeologist, looking for that next treasure (Good at gauntlet)\n\nFor the other player, they get to build the death trap! (Think, a kind of modular tile system) They are the treasure guardian, each with their own unique abilities. \n\n(Each should guard something specific, rather than a large pile of gold. Like Panacea, the mythical cure-all, or El Dorado)\n\nMany More Characters on this side:\n\n\- The Sphinx: Ability: Riddles. Gives you some more time to construct your pyramid. \n\n\- Arabian Djinn: Ability: Unknown. \n\n\- Dragon: Ability: Stalk- you get to walk around your built cave ( but leaving the treasure) to root out the treasure hunter and burn them to a crisp! \n\n\- Museum Security System : Ability: Call in security. This is a Heist mission! I know, deviating a bit from the theme, but it does fit the gameplay loop.  \n\n\-Golem: Ability: Unknown. Like, the Jewish Golem. Not sure what this one guards, exactly. \n\n\- Ancient Construct: Still-running Robots of a Long-Dead Forerunner Society whose city is in the arctic. They have detected an intruder, and are reactivating their defense matrices... Ability: Not sure what to call it, but this one will be more of a battle. You command your fellow machines, and must defend the city! As for building, you get to build some cover in a frozen city, whose buildings silently glow from within their walls. \n\nAny suggestions will be highly appreciated. "
91auhr,Dante's Inferno Battle Royale,"Battle royale game where players instead of being influenced by a storm, have to collect souls and solve challenges to make it to through each of the 9 circles of hell. Maps would get progressily smaller as you get to each circle and would be themed to be like the poem.\n\nGame ends when a player makes it out but dieing in game will make players move back to the first circle and have to start over. "
9176qj,A Team-Based FPS with some twist on it.,"For some years as a FPS player, Battlefield always attracted me to give one curious question; What if Battlefield mechanism like Vehicle, Class, Commander Mode and First-Person Shooting presences applied on the Hero-Based FPS like Team Fortress or Overwatch?\n\nSo there are some feature that'll be included in this 'game' :\n\n1. You can reviving any infantry / troops or any heroes who dying, you can ride a motorcycle or a fighter-like Jet, you can give coordinate for some tactical aid like Carpet Bomber.\n2. Borrowing some feature from Call of Duty WWII, Morale Aid will be a good thing if we running out of ammo or need a medical aid. Some heroes would be give you that aid if you near them. The aid will be vary and the amounts for the MP will be limited.\n3. The Infantry is like a minion battalion in MOBA genre, but they're playable like soldier in Battlefield games. They have a class too, same as Battlefield.\n4. Any heroes can wield 3 weapons (A default weapon for hero, an infantry / specialist weapon and a handgun) and 2 gadgets (Ultimate Gadget / Ability and Generic Ability / Gadgets). But sometimes, the melee-wielding heroes would be hand a handgun only for balancing purposed.\n5. Any heroes have (at least) 2 classes to choose. Those classes can be vary, depending the situation they'll face.\n6. The MP mode would be a mixed breed between Battlefield and Overwatch/ TF2 game modes. While the SP mode would adopted some elements from Battlefield 1 'War Stories' and Call of Duty WWII 'Zombies Mode and Campaign Mode'.\n7. The Environment kills would be vary too. Not just falling from the building. So, it'll be a good reason if the game engine that this 'game' developed is embrace this for some fun immersion and tension on it. (For this case, Frostbite 4 Engine would be cool...)\n\nAfter all, if one day this game will be a reality, these features would be applied on this game. But what franchise would be attracted with this idea? For me, It's Overwatch from Blizzard..."
9146t7,A horror game that is about Japanese folk lore,"Hello! I'm a huge fan of horror stories and games because there are many cool ideas, creatures, rituals, punishments, etc. When browsing the internet, I noticed a few cool Japanese Yokai/monsters. Examples being:\n\n-[Betobeto-san](http://yokai.wikia.com/wiki/Betobeto-San): A creature that follows people who walk alone at night freaks people out with his footsteps\n\n-[The fourteen in this article](https://io9.gizmodo.com/14-terrifying-japanese-monsters-myths-and-spirits-1498740680)\n\n-[Or the ones in this list](https://www.ranker.com/list/creepy-japanese-demons/christopher-myers)\n\nPoint being, there's all these cool creatures/ghosts/yokai and a game that let you experience them all would be cool. Perhaps there could be some that you fight, but maybe a few could be random encounters that you need to be careful with your dialogue around. \n\nFor instance, lets say you just killed an [Onryō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onry%C5%8D) and/ or saved someone being hunted by one and on your walk back you start hearing footsteps. It goes on for like 20-30 seconds and a dialogue option comes up and lets you say, ""After you Betobeto-san."" The footsteps pass you and go away. \n\nAs for gameplay, perhaps it could be a little like Witcher 3 where you're doing monster contracts to banish/fight/survive these creatures. It would require a lot of research to discover a good number of them and how they function, and the main thing I want is for each enemy type to be unique. My idea for this game is less of a fighting game and more of navigating rituals and dialogue options. The player would have a guide for all these creatures and would try to assess what they're dealing with based on certain things that happen. Some creatures could be harmless, yet a bit creepy (like [Noppera-Bo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noppera-b%C5%8D) or [Mokumokuren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokumokuren)) and are just part of the world. \n\nFor example, lets say you pass by a really beautiful woman in a snowstorm and you want to talk to her. Maybe you would have a guide that is organized into different areas where monsters usually are. If you are the cautious type, you check the book and notice that she is a dangerous [Yuki-Onna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokumokuren) and steer clear. If you are not, you talk to her and she starts absorbing your health during the conversation without you noticing. There would also have to be normal people and not just 100% monsters so some catch you off guard. \n\nTL;DR a Japanese horror game based off of Japanese folk lore where you try to defeat the more direct Japanese monsters and also run into more subtle/ passive ones on the way. \n\nWhat are everyone's thoughts?"
912m7z,"An FPS or Third Person ShooterRPG like Destiny, Mass Effect or Borderlands, but with the fast paced movement of Titanfall",I have a lot of fun with FPS/TPS RPG games like Destiny Mass Effect or Borderlands but I always felt like the fast paced movement of Titanfall would be a great addition to these games. \n\nIf Respawn were to make an RPG set in the Titanfall universe I would be pretty stoked.
94dt0d,"Neolith: a primitive, competitive survival game spanning generations.","I recently read about a time at the beginning of the Neolithic era in modern-day Sudan, when people lived in total anarchy, killing men women and children in competition for food and defending their livestock, fields and mates from raids with constant watches. The rate of reproductively successful males dropped from a few hoarding all of the women.\n\nI started imagining a game based on that. Players and AI competitors in an ongoing battle for survival. Fight for food, water, etc. Your goal isn't just to survive yourself, though, but to continue your genetic line by finding a player of the opposite sex to breed with, and then protecting them and your children. When you die, you switch to controlling a random one of your living descendents. If you have no living descendants, though, you're simply out of the game. The kids would age faster than real time, so you're not playing for years, but slow enough to make them vulnerable during their growth. Adults would grow older too, eventually becoming older and weaker after peaking. The line of descent thing doesn't go backwards (you don't get to respawn as your brother/sister), so each generation has an incentive to continue the line and protect offspring.\n\nOf course I wouldn't want a rated AO game, so there wouldn't be a graphic animation for the breeding obviously. Something like the Sims does instead.\n\nSiblings protect each other, so bigger families are an advantage in the game. Cousins don't necessarily protect you, but also don't attack you like strangers do. If you and your mate are both players, you can't both come back as the same offspring, so you must have at least 2 offspring survive to adulthood to ensure your next life.\n\nSorry for divulging so much into the breeding mechanics, but most of the game would be spent foraging or fighting for food in this anarchic world, maybe having help in later generations but you start out alone."
94dboc,Stealth game against other players,"A simple stealth style or fps game like the far-cry outposts. You play as a character that has to kill all the outposts guards, or stealthily take control of something in the center like a radio transmitter or a flagpost. The only catch is the guards are other players. My idea was maybe have this in vr but I don't think that is easy to make as I've never made a vr game before. The guards are given actions to do but don't have to. Their goal is to kill the person taking over the fort. The main player (taking it over) could also tackle larger outposts but with his friends. What do you think? (note: if anybody wants to take this idea and make a game go ahead, hope you can carry it out better than me)"

You see other players, you interact with them but the path isn't going to tell you to harm them. Not yet.\n\n**Goal**: (This is the most important part, please give any feedback you think could make it more fun):\n\nBe the last man standing. Or follow the overlord's directions as much as possible until the time runs out. This way if more than one player living at the end, the player with most overlord brownie points gets to claim the round.\n\n**Ability:**\n\nYou can break from the beam without getting killed by other players. As soon as you break you become vulnerable and other players beams will direct them to your way so they can take you down. At the same time though, the overlord will redirect your energy beam to help you survive. You can follow this escape path beam or continue doing your own thing! If you follow the escape beam for 5 seconds without dying you once again become invulnerable.\n\nBut why break from the beam you might ask? There are certain relic power ups that will help you either kill other players more easily when they become the target or relics to heal if you took too much damage or maybe some other power up such as a better gun or movement speed.\n\n**Win:**\n\nWin 3 rounds to win the game.\n\nI feel like this could be really fun if the energy beams were programmed in a really smart way that gives you lucrative ways of escaping so there's a real incentive to why you'd want to follow the beam once again.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
94a7pr,Horror puzzles concept,"What if the player is being watched as they solve puzzles and their stalker is rewarding them not the puzzles being a part of some mechanism.\n\nSo in a lot of horror games you get ridiculous puzzles that shouldn't unlock a door but there's always some mysterious mechanism you almost never see just a clicking sound and a door has opened somewhere. However what if halfway through you find there's peep holes and one way mirrors watching where the puzzles were as well as switches to unlock doors and distribute keys. \n\nI would recommend letting the player slowly realise there's someone watching them by having things change when they leave a room or receiving important items from chutes, under doors, or holes in the wall."
947hkq,Small 2D level-based Puzzle game (like Portal 2),"Every good puzzle game has a main mechanic,  and elements that add on to that mechanic in interesting ways.\n\nTake the Portal series, for example.  Particularly, Portal 2.  It has a main mechanic, interlinked portals, and tons of testing elements (such as Gel, Turrets, and Discouragement Beams) that directly interact with those portals.\n\nWhere am I getting at?  Well, this simple game has a similar style.  The main character has a Light Gun that he can use to manipulate objects to ultimately get to the door at the end of each level.  There will be a breakdown of how this gun works, as well as a list of some of the testing elements.\n\n**Controls**\n\nWAD to move, cursor to aim, Mouse1 to select/transport, Mouse2 (or perhaps some other key) to undo, E to deselect.\n\n**How The Mechanic Works**\n\nWhen you left click, you fire a beam in the direction of your cursor that selects any object it hits.  Object *selected* by your Light Gun can be transported by left clicking again and firing another beam.  The object is teleported to wherever the beam hit.\n\nBut that's not all, of course.  You can also right click to undo your last transportation.  That is, the last object teleported will be moved back to where it last was before teleportation.  This can make for some interesting strategy.\n\n**Elements and Objects**\n\n*Rock:* Can be used to weigh down buttons or (rarely) as a stepping stool.  Affected by gravity.\n\n*Button:* Activates another Elements in one way or another, or opens the Door.\n\n*Cyro Rock:* When teleported, it freezes in place, and is unaffected by gravity.  Only this rock can weigh down buttons attached to walls or ceilings.\n\n*Light Wall:* Blocks Beams fired by the Light Gun.\n\n*Fan:* Attaches to whatever surface it is teleported upon.  Blows air that can push objects and the player with great force.\n\n*Mirror:* Quite possibly the most important element.  Beams fired into it are redirected.  They allow you to reach otherwise inaccessible areas with your gun, and you can even transport a Mirror to another area using itself. (It also attaches to surfaces)\n\n*Table:* Attaches to surfaces.  Comes in 2 varieties: Flat and Angled.  Really only useful as a semi-solid platform, to readjust the angles of Mirrors or Fans, or to elevate objects off of surfaces.\n\n*Cryo Table:* Like the Table in every way except that objects transported onto it freeze in place like the Cyro Rock.  And yes, it can freeze itself.\n\n*Saucer:* The inverse of the fan; it pulls in objects and the player instead of pushing them away.  Attaches to surfaces.\n\n*Portals:* Oh yes, this game has portals.  But as elements, and not as the main focus.  Beams fire through pairs of interlinked Portals as expected.  Portals can be shot through each other.\n\n*Spikes:* Kill you upon touch, of course.  This wouldn't be a video game if they didn't.  Rarely used.\n\nThat's all I thought of so far.  I had a few puzzle ideas planned already, but considering the already measurable length of this post, I'll save those for the comments.\n\n*I have no idea how hard this would be to code.*  Some basic things required would be momentum, memory stored (of what objects have been transported/selected), and hitscan detection.  I would have to assume Beginner, since I see this as average-Flash-game quality."
946f07,No Gravity - Game Idea,"1. No Gravity - Action/Adventure Sci-Fi\n\nAs approaching the fall of mankind, through war and famine, people begin to flee the planet. Large space stations with the intention of housing future generations are humanities only hope. Humanity no longer strives on Earth, but in space. You are among the new generation in space, and are sent on a mission along with 49 others to a large mass - most likely a planet. Audio transmissions were picked up from this mass, meaning other life forms. But during the trip many of your fellow travelers are killed during a massive collision. You find yourself alone in his journey. But this mass was no planet. A large group of rocks, covered in cities and metropolis decorate the surface. Hundreds of unique intelligent creatures come together to form a civilization, technologically centuries ahead of humanity.  A lack of gravitation carves this civilization. You need to survive.\n\nBasically you will have different objectives to survive and figure out where you are. Amazing aesthetics and very futuristic models. The city area in the planet of Corruscant in Star Wars is the kind of environment I am looking for. Not really open world because that really limits the amount of detail that can be put into it. It would have very immersive gameplay and possibly discover other humans here.\n\n\n\n"
945vj3,A Game About Ditching Class,"I just got an idea of a game that is about you being in a classroom, with every level the layout of the the classroom is different. Evertime you need to find a way to distract the teacher so that you can sneak out of the classroom. Once out, you will then have to achieve one goal that will be around the school, whether it be receiving something or accomplishing a task. You will have to avoid faculty and hall monitors with a plethora of different ways to deal with them. Either stealth, strategic, or aggressive or a mix of all of them. There will be option to put on a mask and fight a hall monitor, or talk to upperclassmen that are on an off period to distract one. What I am saying is there will be a ton of variation that will be available. Once the task is completed  You have completed the mission. "
9449zw,A horror game that slowly morphs into a non-horror game through repeated play.,"Resident Evil 4 was my first ""horror"" game and it was scary the first time I played it. But the more I played and replayed it, the more I turned into *Leon: Destroyer of Plagas*.\n\nThis game idea is a condensed and exaggerated version of this concept. It's designed to go from ""P.T. scary"" to ""Serious Sam empowering.""\n\nHowever, the game is still the same game the whole way through... it's only the player who changes.\n\n### HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe game takes place in a large haunted labyrinth. Every time you start the game, you're spawned in a different area of the same world. This is done so that each playthrough feels unfamiliar at first, but after repeated play you know the game map like the back of your hand.\n\nAt first there appears to be *one* supernatural monster that can spawn anywhere, do anything and kill you at any time (picture the crying woman from P.T.). However, through repeated play you realize there's actually several of them and they all each have their own unique patterns and predictable behaviors. They're meant to look similar (but not identical) so that they seem like one unpredictable monster at first.\n\nLastly and most importantly, the game starts out without a clear objective. You don't know where to go and what you're supposed to do. Your first playthroughs are about unraveling the mystery. Through environmental storytelling, you learn that you're here to eliminate the supernatural entities. You're some kind of professional exorcist.\n\n**Not only that, but you've had the ability to kill the demons all along.** The game just didn't make it explicit.\n\nTo eliminate demons, *you have to let them hurt you.* Like S.O.M.A. and many other horror games, you can take one ""hit"" from a monster. You drop to the floor, your vision gets blurry, you hear voices and see visions, and you're forced to limp in pain. Also like typical horror games, there are ""health points"" on the map that recover you to full health.\n\nWell it turns out that when you're ""hit"" by a demon you're actually being possessed and your character is resisting. This is why he is limping, seeing visions and hearing voices. And those ""health points"" are actually special exorcism tomes. When you use it, you're actually eliminating the demon that resided in you. Now you just have to do it with all the other demons.\n\nThe game mechanics are obfuscated. Sometimes the monsters kill you instead of damaging you, but it isn't clear why. You later learn that you died because you're facing away from the demon when it caught you. At least for some of them. For others you might have to weaken them by luring them to special areas.\n\n### WHY IT WORKS\n\nAs gamers, we've been taught to run &amp; hide from monsters in horror games if we don't have weapons. The game lets the player do this in typical horror game fashion, but it doesn't teach or tell him to do this. It's only after the player turns to face his demons that he'll realize they can be overcome. \n\nIt's the central theme of the game, in fact.\n\nBy the time you've beaten it, it'll be an empowering game. You'll no longer need to run around uncovering the mystery. Instead, you'll be running around to beat your previous record. By the end, you'll feel like the monsters should be running from *you.*"
9408mf,Battleship meets Tetris,"The game has 2 turns:\n\nTurn 1: players guess a tile in the opponent's board where they thinks there's a ship.\n\nTurn 2: different shapes start to fall in the two boards, one by one.  This lasts a minute or so.\n\nThe game consists of 15 rounds (each rounds consists of the two turns above).\n\n* Shapes that fall are formed by 2 or more cubes, like in Tetris, but unlike Tetris the cubes of a shape can be of the same or different colors. \n\n* When 2 or more cubes of the same color are placed in orthogonal, adjacent tiles, they form a ship. So your goal is to avoid cubes of the same color to placed next to each other.\n\n* When the tile guessed is part of a ship (ie: the cube is adjacent to other cubes of the same color) the 'hit' is considered successful and the cube is marked.\n\n* When all cubes that form a ship have been hit/marked, the ship is sunk.\n\n* You cannot eliminate blocks like in tetris: shapes just pile up until no room is left. So once a ship is formed in your board, it remains there until the end of the game (or until it is sunk)\n\n* For each ship the opponent sinks, he gets 1 point for each of the cubes that form the ship.\n\n* The game ends after 15 rounds.\n\n* The player with more points (remember: not only matters the number of ships but the size of the ships sunk), wins.\n"
