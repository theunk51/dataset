6s6a7w,Some additions this mind bending puzzle game idea ?,"Hello !\n\nBolls - Bend your Mind !\n\n[Gameplay Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkfC6pyLgrk)\n\n[Play on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transparentroot.Bolls)\n\n[Play on Web](https://transparentroot.itch.io/bolls)\n\nI made this game for My First Game Jam hosted on itch.io and it turned out to be good; so thought i'd continue with the development!\n\nThe basic idea is that as the player moves, the enemy copies the movements.\n\nAnybody wanna make some additions to this idea ?\n\nI'll be releasing more levels for the game soon, and want to include new mechanics or stuff."
6s4ru1,A vampire survival game,"So here's an idea my sleep deprived mind came up with:\nIt's a game set in Victorian Europe where you play the role of a vampire. You see how long you can survive. \nYou can build up and customize your lair where you hide during the day. \nAt night, you feast, and if you don't hide the bodies, the town will be more and more suspicious. The townsfolk will eventually set up guards to keep an eye out for you, and eventually, vampire hunters will be drawn to the town. You could flee the town and set up camp in another town while the heat dies down in the previous town.\nThe longer you survive, the more abilities you get, including becoming a bat, or hunter vision where you can detect living people inside buildings. Of course, you could also make other victims into your servants as well.\nYou can create new weapons in your lairs using whatever materials you looted from the towns. And if you take specimens, both living and dead, you can experiment on them to unlock better weapons that assist you in your vampirism, such as a sword that absorbs blood like a sponge so each strike heals a small amount of health."

6s1a4j,Gods of War – Not to be confused with God of War series,"A fighter type of game where instead of smacking up your opponent directly you control one historical deity against another. Attack moves are accomplished by spawning warriors or small armies from the societies that believed or worshiped said deity. \n\nImagine your typical fighter game side view arena or something more complex with the player characters (the gods) slightly in the back behind the health bars summoning their AI controlled attackers and defenders on the actual battleground. The spawned troops could be made as simple attack animations or more complex actually fighting units. \n\nFor example you could have Odin VS. Ares. Odin's attacks involve summoning groups of Vikings or Berserkers against Ares' Greek warriors and perhaps even Spartans. The attacks would be directly aimed against the opposing deity who can either counter with another army or take the damage. Meaning if the opposing god would have an empty battleground, the attackers would go straight through causing damage, but if there would be troops on the ground on both sides they would battle first in order to get through instead. Balance would be built through summoning speeds, army sizes and army strengths. Different attacks take different button combinations and eat your regenerating AP. \n\nThe game is real-time so like in any fighting game the player could either just spam simple attacks (single troops) as fast as possible, or try to build a combo and summon a massive army. Gods could have special attacks which would be directed to the troops on the battleground instead of directly to the opposing deity. For example, if Odin couldn't keep up with Ares' troops, he could try to balance the odds by throwing in Thor there for a bit. Or lightning, whatever you like. \n\nThere are so many gods of war and different warrior societies through the history that you could have quite a few variations for the game, keeping it interesting. Have there some Egyptians, Romans, Incas, you name it. \n\n**EDIT:** Grammar & clarity."
6s16j6,MMORPG with Permadeath: Focus on interactions,"Ever since I watched Sword Art Online (and that was a long time ago), I've toyed around with the idea of an MMORPG that has permadeath, and that has a much higher focus on character construction and interaction. And it seems that I'm not the only one.\n\nWhat I'm talking about here is a game that has most of the stuff you'd normally find on MMORPGs, with the character classes, the dungeons and raids, guilds. But a game that also focus on how the players interact with the world: one that isn't just about becoming very strong and getting the best equipment, and defeating all the dungeons. A game where your character is, to some extent, you.\n\nThe idea is to create the fear to push too far, at the same time adding a great incentive to playing together: with friends everyone can be responsible for everyone else's survival. A game where once you've pushed your party to it's limits, you might end a session having a drink in a local pub and just talking for a while before logging off to meet again the next day.\n\nI can see problems with this kind of game, such as how frustrating it would be to spend so much time bettering a character only to have it die and all that progress be lost. It would be an easy reason to abandon the game, and tell everyone to stay away from it.\n\nIn such a game, however, many aspects that are initially very similar would turn out to be completely changed. One example is the party relationship I mentioned above, where there is a personal relationship to every character, an added reason to fight tooth and nail for the survival of everyone, at every time; and an added reason to value interactions that aren't necessarily completing a dungeon, or raiding a boss battle. It could also cater to the needs of hardcore players, that want to show how strong and powerful they are, by going to harder difficulty areas, while also catering to casual players, who just like to meet up with friends every now and then to grind a little and perhaps end the day chatting and trading in a pub."

6rwsww,"MMORPG ""Homeless""","NOTE: would not have to be an MMO, I just like imagining having to play with others would be pretty fun. If anything, a regular RPG would be great. \n\nI've been sitting on this idea for a while now and really hope someone sees it and puts it to use! (likewise, if you plan to use my idea, I'd gladly help out with resources and planning game mechanics/story if you'd like)\n\nEssentially, a survival/strategy game where your ultimate goal is to simply survive. You can ""squat"" on pre-existing properties, find a box (though definitely not ideal) and move it to a safe place, discover a shack on the outskirts of town and craft a mattress out of scraps you've found, or ""jump""/mug people (real players or NPCs) and collect money to actually purchase something (or even steal other peoples' shoes and other clothes!).\n\nMaybe illegal substances are a good temporary route to take the edge off of how rough it is out here? But if you rely too much on them to get by (perhaps whether or not your character will become addicted is based on RNG upon creation? some sort of hidden set of traits that you can slowly learn by doing things), you'll have to keep using them to keep your health/mental status/etc. stable.\n\nMaybe you could even land yourself in jail for a weekend? It would have some benefits but many drawbacks as well. \n\nidk I really, really, like the thought of this game and would love to see it real one day!"
6rujnz,Marvel's Defenders Game!,"Imagine an open world Defenders game with 4 parts of New York. Each area has got it's own Defenders. At the beginning you have Jewel, and Daredevil unlocked. As you proceed through the game you unlock more areas, the other 2 heroes, and suits. For example, the Knightress costume, and the Shadowland Daredevil suit. You can also team up with the other heroes during missions, or free roaming, taking on random encounters. During the day, for Daredevil, you are Matt Murdock choosing court cases and fighting them. (You are given different choices to say during court and it could be good or bad) Powerman well be asked to do random favors, such as moving stuff around to getting stolen things back. Jewel well be asked to search for people. Iron Fist will practice his chi (which will unlock new moves for him). \n\nThe main enemy is the hand. After you beat the game, you unlock the punisher. \n\nImagine Spider-Man 2, the game, but with a bigger map, and 4 to 5 characters. \n\nPowerman would have his own vehicle to drive, Matt can climb buildings and swing using his escrima sticks, Jewel would fly, and Danny can climb buildings. \n\nEdit: You could also switch out any of the 4 defenders with: Black Cat, Silver Surfer, Hawkeye, or Moon Knight. So if you don't like Power Man, you could replace him with Silver Surfer. Or you could replace them all\n\nAlso, the punisher would only work alone. \n\nSome of the moves would be:\n\nPowerman: Can rip up big pieces of concrete from the ground and throw it. Can rip up things outta the ground (fire hydrant, light pole, car doors, etc. ). And he can do a small ground pound, stunning enemies. He would also have the most health. He also has boxing fighting moves. \n\nJewel: Can rip small pieces of concrete and throw it. She can rip everything from the ground that Powerman can. She can do a huge ground pound at a distance by leaping forward and landing. She also has basic street fighting. \n\nDaredevil: He can use his escrima sticks by throwing them (but you have to go back and get them) , or shooting one half of it, it hitting someone, then coming back. Daredevil can also scope the area and tag enemies easier by using his senses. He also is the best at stealth, and can use his escrima stick's wire to cone someone out. He also knows basic martial arts, and boxing. \n\nIron Fist: He has a super meter that as you fight builds up, and you can activate it causing his chi to activate. You can also meditate causing him to unlock more combos and moves. He does the most damage.\n\nYou would use Powerman for getting surrounded, Daredevil for stealth, Jewel for groups of enemies at a distance, and Iron Fist for one on one. \n\nNow the others: \n\nPunisher: he would use guns, explosives, knives, and basic boxing moves. \n\nMoon Knight: he would use his crest moons to throw, his wing suit, and basic martial arts\n\nBlack Cat: she would use claws, and basic street fighting. \n\nHawkeye: martial arts and special arrows\n\nSilver Surfer: phasing through objects, and people, no fighting skills but power.\n\nThat's just the basics for everyone. They would have more but I don't want to keep writing there moves. Hence, the reason the 2nd group had nothing. \n\nThere also could be a DLC to play the Doctor Strange, Hulk, and Namor the Sub-Mariner as they create The Defenders. \n\nEdit: it could also be 4 player co-op "
6rui6u,"We are not here to hurt you – Indie horror game that punishes you for cowardice, but not the usual way","Right, so there are many horror games that will have consequences for your actions, but as far as I know, usually by becoming harder or more scary. This game aims to do the opposite.\n\nThe idea is to have a your stereotypical horror game setup; Unarmed first-person  3D explorer based in your usual creepy location (abandoned rundown building, spooky village, etc.), with jump scares and other ambiance based creepiness, and all around just appears to be “just one of those games”.\n\nGame has hiding mechanism and generally advises you to use it or run-away, but every time you do, the game becomes a bit easier and a bit more sillier. It punishes you for being a coward, but not by trying to scare you more, but by calling you out for it. \n\nThe game should have several endings. One practically with unicorns and rainbows for those who just kept running away and hiding from basically anything through the whole adventure, to what could easily be called the literal hell for those who just soldiered through it without a hint of being scared of anything. However, an average playthrough should come out somewhere in the middle, like something a long nothing out of the ordinary, just your every day of life kind of scenario, resulting from when an average gamer would eventually start to realize at some point during the adventure that there seems to be nothing out there to really hurt them.\n\nObviously there still needs to be some danger in the game and other ways to lose it. The main thing about the mechanic should rather be to be able distinct a real danger from a false one when playing the game. Best way to probably accomplish this would be to add actual real life dangers in the game among with fake supernatural elements. Depending on a setup, perhaps a stray car about to crash into the player or an angry guard dog starting a chase or just Falling debris in a rundown old mental asylum?\n\nOptimal playthrough should not take longer than 2-3 hours, which is just about as long as it should take a player to realize what's going on somewhere in the middle of it, still leaving time for exploration and not to mention for some time to have fun prior and after figuring out the game. Achievements would be a nice addition, but they would all have to be hidden in order not to spoil the game. "

It also can't contain much (if any) violence.\n\nOptionally, I would love to have some way to include the kids' input/ideas/artwork into the game, though I'm sure I can find someway to do this no matter the type of game.\n\nThe game could be either a standalone game that they can play for a while and drop (like a browser game) or could be something that they save to come back to later.\n\nIt can be 2D, 3D, a mix of both, whatever. Just preferably lighter on the graphics.\n\nAnyways, thanks for any suggestions!"

By making it a browser game, anyone can participate and test changes easily.\n\nWould the public even be able to cohesively develop a basic game, similar to the teams who built /r/place?

6rkav6,A roguelike survival RPG with a handcrafted open world map and the player can hire people for all sorts of tasks.,"First of all, I'm working on this and looking for feedback if you would play this or what would have to change for you to play it.\n\nI won't go into too much details here since nobody wants to read walls of text.\n\n**Survival**\n\nThe Player has a bunch of needs he has to take care of.\n\n* Hydration\n* Food\n* Sleep\n* Bladder\n* Bowels\n* Recreation\n* ...\n\n**Stats + Progress**\n\nEvery Unit that wants to take an action has to roll in the actions difficulty. Rolls are done with a d100 (0-99) where 0 is always a failure and 99 always a success. Also, Units get to add their skill value on the roll.\n\nUsing skills grants experience in that skill.\nQuests\nThere are some tutorial/story quests which can be done once (e.g. getting your first pet), however most Quests are random generated.\nCrafting\n(almost) Everything in the game has to be crafted from scratch. This is also true for NPCs and traders.\nTo increase playabilty NPCs got some items in stock to start out with.\n\n*example*: Let’s say you want to buy new arrows from a trader. Now the trader needs someone to make those arrowshafts, arrowheads and feathering and put it all together, then the trader has to go buy the finished product from that guy, slap on his profit margin and now he’s ready to sell to the player.\n\n**Roguelike**\n\nThe Player only controls one character at a time and if a character dies, he’s dead for good.\n\nIf the player advanced far enough to hire a second in command he may choose to continue as that character if his main character dies.\n\n**Recruitment**\n\nRecruitment is split into 4 categories (for now)\n\n*HQ* - these guys follow the player around, the might include a doctor, communications officer, you second in command, 2 guards, a pet\n\n*Troops* - Your army, all the fighting troops, some specialists\n\n*Follower* - These guys include cooks, doctors, hunters, etc.\n\n*Industry* - These usually don’t follow the player around but stay at industry locations. e.g. You could have a squad of lumberjacks staying at a camp, harvesting logs for you. If the lumberjacks advanced far enough you might train one of them to turn the logs into planks.\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe game is set in a sci fi / fantasy world.\n\nThere are plenty of races common to the fantasy genre, orcs, dwarves, elves…\n\nacross the map, there are different Factions the player can either work with or work against, these factions have very different technology levels, where some orc clans still use stone tools the Tech Folk might have lightning shooting energy rifles.\n"
6rf65c,Pathway to the West - A multiplayer VR game experience,"**Name:** Pathway to the West\n\n**Concept Overview:** \n\n* Inspired by Star Trek Bridge Simulator and The Oregon Trail, the idea is for 2-6 players share a praire schooner as they journey westward in 1800s America. After several minutes of relatively calm players are presented with choices and contextual minigames. During the calm they can sit inside the wagon, or outside and watch the procedurally generated world go by.\n\n**Plot:**\n\n* As players progress the game becomes more difficult. The come across more bandits and American Indians hostile to settler encroachment. Fewer towns and outposts appear.\n\n**Setting:**\n\n* 1800s America\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Players randomly begin events which asks each to perform a job.\n\n- When fjording a river one person holds goods from falling over, another plugs holes, another bails water, another ushers mules across, etc. If they float the river they paddle/guide the wagon as well.\n\n- When hunting the players are all in the woods and animals run around at a quick pace like a shooting gallery. Each player can carry X amount of meat, different meats have different bonuses/trading value. Gathered fruits can cause food poisoning if not mixed or cleaned properly.\n\n- During attacks players have to defend their wagon or wait out attacks until help comes by avoiding attacks.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nPC, PSVR\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* The ability to set a play length at the start, and change it while playing. You can use this as an excuse to hang out with friends for an hour and turn encounter rates to low, and maybe only have half a dozen events. Or turn it high and have a trip full of insanity.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\n* Idea Guy behind the game: Jeffool.\n\n\nI think there's a lot of room for this type of cooperative game experience to bring lots of fun to old hardcore and even new gamers. It's a shame we're not seeing more of it."
6r9i2r,Looking for feedback on an idea," i have this idea of playin mini golf thru the dungeon, where the ball is what gets the power ups to defeat the enemies, like it leaves a fire trail to burn guys,or when the enemies try to kick the ball back in the other direction, it explodes. u can still whack the guys w the club, it just wouldn't do as much damage, that way the focus stays on trying to play mini golf to get thru the dungeon. its kinda silly, but i like it. so i'm looking for a little feedback. i've started developing it a little bit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJTBU2POXtI) and it currently makes a new hole every time w traps and such, and will be adding enemies and hitting the ball over the next few days(I hope). if anyone is so inclined, I would love a hand with it..."

6eweqo,Nazi Germany citizen simulator,"Okay, this is an idea I've had for a while. \n\nWhat if we had a survival horror-like videogame in which you played as an average person in Nazi Germany? You would have to do your best to survive the lack of food, lack of free thought and fear of having someone sell you to the police. If you survive (a.k.a. don't get killed, meaning you could also play if you get caught and sent to a concentration camp), you win. There would be several strategy options, such as joining the nazi party to remain safe, selling someone else to the police, remaining hidden in someone else's house, escaping to another country, etc. It would have a vast open world to explore. You could start at any time in the Third Reich timeline (anywhere in between 1932-1945). I think it would be neat to have a close view of what it could have felt like to be in such a horrid situation, and, as it's based in a historical event, it would make it infinitely creepier than most survival horror games. What do you guys think?"
6evjll,A kind of defense game or series...,"There could be a single game covering certain historic periods, or multiple games, each focused on a certain age. \n\nThe idea is to prevent thieves from stealing items by building/designing defense mechanisms(eg: traps, fake floors, lava pits, etc). You have a certain budget you have to spend on buying these traps. \n\nWhen you're done, the burglars will try to steal your item/treasure, but they will only have a limited time to do so(until the morning or, in modern days, until the cops show up).\n\nIf your defense systems can hold them off that long, they fail and you won the mission. At first, the items are small, the area is smaller and the defense systems don't have to be very good.\n\nBut as you advance, you'll get bigger missions and the thieves will get smarter. Your budget will also increase... \n\nNew systems and defense mechanisms are unlocked depending on the selected age/game, and how far are you in the game. \n\nEg: In Antiquity you get to defend your home by building a fake wall to hide your vase(you could also hide items in order to protect them. If the enemies can't find them in time, you won), all the way to designing traps, fake floors, lava pits and ceilings to defend a great ruler's treasure..:)"
6ep2ib,A game about an inventor in a medieval town,"You are a child who lives in a medieval village. Every day you have a bunch of chores to do that leave very little free time. There are also things you can play with, but if you do, you'll probably make your parents angry by not doing the chores.\n\nYou can also go outside and meet townsfolk. They have different jobs and use different tools. The mechanics that you learned by doing chores and playing can be used in a different way to make those tools better, but that requires a lot of time, so you can't do both inventing and doing chores.\n\nEverything you do or don't do has visible economic effect on the town and the house you live in.\n\nThe core of the game is the choice between helping your parents and doing a lot of good to strangers.\n"

6ejx8m,GTA Online Game add on,"Because i dont have a computer ive been watching people play PU: battegrounds and king of the kill and it makes me really want to play them so i thought of this idea.\n\nI believe there is a demand on the consoles for games like Playerunknowns battlegrounds and H1Z1 king of the kill and i think Rockstar with GTA Online could the perfect platform to captialize on it, it already has very stong base to work off of and it has a key component that will set it apart from the rest and thats the cover mechanism. Of course to make money off this you'll want to let in game currency be the way that players can customize their characters i.e. armor,weapons.The game needs to start the character at $0 currency so there everyone starts out equally but you can gain currency by getting in game kills which will make the game a little more interesting where the players will either havevto pick up the money from other dead players or will get currency for each kill and your total rank at the end. I also think that to switch up the gameplay adding perks that players can only assign one or two to their characters to give them advantages but not enough to make them overpowered.\n\nAll in all i think that Rockstar has the money,(wo)man power and platform to be able to captialize on this demand."

6eckm3,A Harry Potter RPG with magic spell physics-focused gameplay.,"So you have the ancient castle of Hogwarts to meander through and look through arcane texts of lost magical secrets and utter combinations of phrases not even knowing what will come out of your wand. Somewhat like the magic system in Magicka but with even more options and explosive/interesting results. And each spell you discover is its own system to play with and explore. You find a spell that gives you the power seen in Gravity Rush, you find another that gives you ""Portal"" etc. The game would need a sort of deep, dark, slow atmosphere and be more puzzle based than combat based to give you time to think."
6ec9wd,"The scope of Mass Effect with the gameplay of Destiny and an evolving, continuous world","I'm going to use Destiny 1 as the example game. \n\nSo imagine Destiny, but with the Tower and general areas having the evolving scope of Mass Effect. Where as you and other players continue to complete story missions, strikes, raids, etc. the Tower and general areas on planets keep changing to keep up with it. This all happens within a cycle. So the game launches, everyone plays it, the world keeps changing based on how well everyone does, and eventually, we win enough for the cycle to end and we ""beat"" the game as a whole.\n\nYou could look off at things in the distance and see new structures, or friendly ships, atmosphere clearing up, etc. Characters would have new dialog, new things would unlock, and this would all happen over the course of 4-6 months. Yeah, that long.\n\nIt should fall in line with regular DLC launching. Most of those drop around 6 months after release. So, by the time the cycle ends, DLC should drop and new content would be available for the second cycle.\n\n"
6e94mj,Need RPG thematic ideas for a one-man team,"I'm making an RPG in Unity, and I'm probably going to be the only one working on it. That might change, but for now it's just me. I'm just working on general controls and combat right now, but it's getting close to the point where I'm gonna need a solid idea.\n\nMost of the RPGs I've played have been very large-scale, and I'd like to come up with something immersive and replayable but on a smaller scale. I'd like it to be alt-history sci-fi or dystopian future sci-fi, or post-apocalyptic, but I'm totally open to different ideas. I want to incorporate some kind of creative building system whether it be fortifying settlements or constructing shelters or decorating dwellings. Games that support the creativity of their players have always been my favorites. So I'd need a way for that to make sense from a story/gameplay standpoint. Questing and leveling are non-optional as far as I'm concerned, but there's a low ceiling to the amount of detail and content I'm gonna be able to put in the world. I'll have to limit the amount of stuff the player can see, but I want to compensate by giving the player a lot of stuff to do within the small world.\n\nAnyway, I want to get a somewhat concrete concept locked in before I continue with development so that the project can have a strong and definite direction. Anyone up for helping?\n\nHere's some things I love: Blade Runner (Movie), Fallout series, Dune (Book), Dark Souls series, Elder Scrolls series, Battlestar Galactica (TV Show), Mad Max (Movies)"
6e9268,PC Horror zombie game.,"I would like someone to build a game that doesn't have to have to have the best graphics. The main concept of the game is that your exploring a abandoned hotel and you encounter zombies. This WONT be your zombie killing machine gun- infinite ammo type of game. This is a game about evading , being silent , and getting out.  It could be a click and point game , or you could make it free roam. I think that the zombies genre is really worn down and is just not scary anymore. I think that this game could really turn that around."

[heres gameplay of it, you get the point of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6aQ67jk58I). \nSo, what im proposing here, is that the elixir system(from the video) and the units are similar. Each player could make a deck of 8 units(cards) and you are then able to use those 8 cards when you go into a match.\nThe objective of the game is to, well, capture the control point.\nWhen you send out a unit, it follows the black path, and will stop at the control point. You are not able to control the units, they have their own AI. The point is contested if an enemy steps on the control point. The point must be captured for 10 seconds in order to win.\n\nMAP HERE(sorry its in paint): http://imgur.com/a/V7Nrf"
6e03kv,10-minute games ideas?,"This shows up in some google results as terribly curated collections of shovel-ware garbage - but recently, in light of realizing how many %70-done projects I've built up in learning programming and modeling, I've been given this idea, for games that can be fully fathomed and finished, in the traditional sense of having fully experienced its content, in about 10 minutes.\nThis, I think, would be a good model to take after for many of the posts here, considering your game idea as one that can be played in 10 minutes and thus, design willing, developed in a reasonable amount of time, and making them reasonable goals for learning developers, like most of us on /r/gameideas/ have to be.\n\nA 10 minute game doesn't necessarily have to be finite, either, think Tetris - once you've played Tetris for 10 minutes, you've seen ""all of it"" - but its formula is random and procedural and infinite by design.\n\nThis format would also force a lot of game-idea-crafters to better visualize, hone, and organize their ideas, through the critical thinking involved to imagine ""condensing"" their ideas.\n\nThoughts?

6dz25t,A strategy game where you are commanding from within the battlefield with voice commands and messages.,So the idea is this.\n\nI get inspired by all those big ass battles we see in fantasy movies and settings. When we translate those fights we are usually transported to the top down view and directly command those units in an RTS fashion.\n\nI would love a game where you are the Battlefield Commander. But you are actually inside the battlefield. On horseback or foot. And through the use of voice detection you have to shout commands at your troops to fall in line or use the X or Y tactics. Also to communicate with flanks you have to call upon various tools like scouts/flags/flares/arrows to signal flanking parties or other parts of your unit.\n\nMeanwhile. You are in the thick of combat killing people as well. There can be some major campaigns about this that allow you to put in an RPG element that allows you to get new troops. Train new tactics and formations. Use new tools to get messages across faster.\n\nIt would be a beast to build but I know that I would want to shout a morale-boosting speech to my men through my microphone before we charge into death.

You have settler unit and scout unit like in civilization. Map is premade, like in Total War, beacuse you can make much more awesome maps when they are not generated (just look at Total War).

6g6lhz,DreamWorld,"I. Story: The hero is a wealthy businessman who likes to collect ancient objects. One day, he buys at an auction a diamond tablet with ancient writings.

But soon, monsters infiltrate and the hero wakes up. His wife doesn't. The hero calls an ambulance, but the authorities try to frame him for poisoning his wife. The hero, Bill, realizes something is wrong. He escapes custody and battles the cops. \n\nBill highjacks a car and flees to the airport. Bill takes his private plane and goes to London to meet a friend who could help. That night, he has another dream where he battles more monsters. \n\nThe next morning, he learns his wife still didn't woke up. He is attacked by police officers shortly thereafter. \n\nBill battles them all over the hotel, then goes to meet his friend. He takes him to a secret society building where he shows Bill some strange paintings with the same monsters he saw in his dreams. \n\nBill must infiltrate a highly influential lord's mansion, Sir Charles Specklewick, also a member of the same secret society.\n\nBill does that, defeats all his bodyguards, then takes out Specklewick himself. Bill finds documents that present the tablet he bought and their locations. Bill also finds out why is he hunted: The tablets are components used to build an ancient weapon that could make people sleep forever. \n\nBut all tablets are needed to make it work. Bill must search London for the first one. He also battles evil men, from street thugs to SAS and MI5 officers, sent to kill the hero and snatch the tablet. \n\nAt night, Bill travels through dream realms that are remotely based on real location(eg: mountains, an ancient palace that looks Arabian, but is set on a Northern, frozen area, a huge forest, etc.), but can hint to possible next locations. Bill battles monsters in them. \n\nBill finds the second tablet. He then goes to Paris for the second one. Bill has to battle monsters of his dreams, who now attack in broad daylight.\n\nA corrupt French archbishop has the next tablet. Bill gets it and it hurls him through time, to the French revolution. Bill must fight his way to another tablet that takes him back to our times.\n\nBill goes to Dubai for the next one(He defeats a sheikh on his private hunting grounds.), to Beijing for another tablet(kills a power thirsty general) and to Moscow for the last one, where he encounters the first human-monster hybrid, a FSB colonel.\n\nBill now has all the tablets. His wife is still asleep. Bill assembles the weapon that can make enemies fall asleep and monsters pour into our world.\n\nThe evil secret society leader throws Bill back in time to World War II, when the Germans almost got Moscow. Bill has to fight the enemies and make his way through the chaos and to an escape point. \n\nBack to our time, Bill travels to Washington, where he finds out Elmore Pierce, his nemesis, found a way to control the monsters. The weapon makes them all sleep, but the final battle takes place through many succesive dream realms. \n\nBill defeats Pierce and when he wakes up, so does his wife. They live happily ever after.

6g49w2,A Different Tank Game.,"The basic concept is a tank multiplayer game (could also include a co-op story)on a somewhat large scale but instead of 1 player per 1 tank you get a crew of friends/randoms and operate the tanks together. \n\nFor example: you'd have commanders, drivers, gunners and loaders and of course different tanks would have a different amount of crew inside, Most of the game would take place inside the tank but you could get out/peep out and scout with binoculars or repair the tank and such and of course scale ground on feet and go on recon.\n\nI'm not exactly sure about the era it'd take place but i'm thinking either WW2 or modern.\n\nIt's quite a niche idea but if executed properly i think it could be a fun and tactical game. I know i didn't flesh the idea out that much but i hope you guys like it!\n\n"
6g43fi,Need an idea of a stealth IO Game,"Hello, everyone! I want to make .io game and since you have the ideas, please give them to me after reading the post. If you don't want to read, there's a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nFirst, what is .io game? Examples: http://agar.io, http://slither.io, http://wilds.io, http://mope.io, http://splix.io, http://diep.io\n\nThey all share several traits:\n* They're MMOs,\n* They're arena-based, all players play in the same level\n* They're simple in graphics\n\nWhy do I want to make .io game? \n\nAs said - they could be simple in graphics and style (this is where i suck, i'm a programmer, not an artist), but cool in gameplay. It's a multiplayer game, which means it'll be successful and actually be played OR it will die fast. \n\nOther boring tasks such as item progression or level generation is very optional and could be simplified. Agar.io was the first - it's literally just circles eating each other.\n\nOk, so, I want .io game, whats next? I think I won't be better than some shooters and shooter IOs are pretty popular, so I need to find another niche for my game. I think it'll take stealth / running as core advantage and game-play idea.\n\n**TL;DR** So main gameplay restrictions are:\n\n* **No direct killing** (otherwise it will be just like another shooter with stealth, right?)\n* Player will need to run after something with many others, but not in a straight line or something bad could happen. So he'll need to actually plan his movements.\n* It should be done in one big level and players will leave and join constantly \n* Level reset is unwelcome, but may be included, if your idea is way too cool\n* Gameplay should support for ~10-100 (or 50) players in the same server\n\nThe rest is up to you if you, just make sure you're describing gameplay that you'll like to play occasionally for a long time"

6g2bgo,VR Driving and Shooting,"Walking around in VR sucks. Teleporting around sucks. VR driving is great. Your controls mirror the controls you expect, and you don't actually go anywhere.\n\nBut just driving? That's hardly a game - that's a simulation.\n\nRemember Halo: CE (did anyone play the demo for it with just Blood Gultch?)? My favorite thing was either driving the warthog with someone on the back or manning the turret while a friend was driving.\n\nTake two people. One of them is in a chair - with steering wheel, pedals, transmission - that pushes them around based on the forces their virtual car feels (this is already a thing). The other peripheral would be a rotating column with an attached stool and handles/gun grips. The whole thing would rotate around (and hopefully have the same suspension system for simulating the car being pushed around). The weight of the player leaning should trigger the turret to turn. One guy drives the other guy goes pew pew pew.\n\nYes that's a crazy huge peripheral which would only be used for a specific function (simulating manning a turret) but it could also be used for space fights or whatever - I don't know. Anyway this is a VR experience that wouldn't require all of the stupid teleporting that no one can find a way around now. Just keep people locked into their roles, using big, realistic equipment that gives feedback to player input and feels like what they're really seeing.\n\nHonestly I think driving around in that warthog was so fun I'm surprised this game hasn't been made yet (maybe it has?) - except for how obvious a key element this new huge peripheral I'm describing is.\n\nThis would be great in arcades! So no one has to spend $1200 or whatever on the fake turret I'm describing to just play the game a few times and quit."
6g0gdg,2-person FP Arcade Horror Maze Solver,"First post on here so I don't know if there's some conduct that I'm not adhering to but here goes:\n\nThe game is a two-player face-off in randomly generated mazes - dark and gloomy in all the classic horror styles (classic hedge-maze - abandoned warehouse - oldtimey psychiatric hospital - Victorian alleyways).\nArcade style so each maze shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to find the 'exit' - it is a race to find an exit within the same 'building' but not the same maze - you cannot interact directly but you get a sense through sounds and sights of the other player's progress and actions.\n\nHere's the catch - a 20 card 'deck' consisting of some defensive and offensive 'cards' as well as a few 'neutral' that you can find randomly hidden around YOUR section of the map - the exit will only be reachable via using some of these cards. The 'neutral' cards would help you alter your maze or player state to reach the exit and some would be fundamental to finding the exit (for instance a 'C4' card that 'destroys one section of wall' allowing passage through). The 'Offensive' cards would alter the state of your opponent's maze adding obstacles, traps or monsters (for instance a 'Ghost' card that 'adds a ghost to hunt and attack your opponent'). This is where 'defensive' cards would come in - consisting of weapons, traps and other deterrents to help you combat the obstacles places in your maze by the opponent. \n\nThe winner is the player who reaches the end of their maze first or who is left alive. The game has freedom for a lot of variation - it could be split into 3 or more mazes one after the other or simple arcade mode - made 2v2 - 'brawl' mode etc - this also lends itself to a 'FTP' format with opening packs and the like.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

6fvous,TCG Drafting (Game Concept),"So, after a long discussion (yes, this discussion went for 1 whole day OMG!) I've decided to broadcast this as a game concept and was wondering if you TCG/CCG lovers would like for me to produce this (yes I have the money and people to make this and yes i will make if if you want me to). \n\nRight, the concept is simple (I think):\n- Players start the game by rolling a standard 6 sided dice. (Highest Picks first).\n- the game is then played with 1 of these starting rules:\n1) Players then take it in turn selecting 1 of the 12 available characters (going clockwise) until everyone has 3.\n2) All character cards are shuffled and then 3 is dealt to every player.\n\nAfter that the main deck is brought into play. The deck is built up of 120 cards (39 for each player). The top 10 cards are played face up so everyone can see then player 1 picks 1 card from the pile then the player to the left and it keeps going till all 10 cards are gone. After that the person to the right draws 10 cards and picks one, then the player to the left picks another till that are all gone. Keep repeating this until everyone has 30 cards.\n\n[The deck is made up of Weapon, Armour and effect cards. These increase your characters stats and change the gameplay].\n\nFighting: \n1v1 - you can Attack with all characters but  you cannot Attack the same target more than once (unless a card states otherwise).\n\nFree for all - same rules apply except you must Attack the player to your left. If you kill them all characters are healed 20 health (or max whichever is first).\n\nGame ends when all other opponents character's health reaches 0.\n\nThis is just the basics and some things might change but you guys understand the fundamentals right?\n\nIf not then ask lol.\n\nLet me know what you think ☺️✌🏻"

The species would take over underdeveloped worlds to enslave/consume them.

6fttat,VR raving simulator,"So it all started with me talking to a friend over IMs and I accidentally said iRaving instead of iRacing. \n\nMy mind went to a game similar to the Just Dance series except in a VR world where your Vive Controllers are your glowsticks and you must match the other dancers. You could sell the game with a few clubs and charge for additional club packs but instead of calling them DLCs, call them Club Passes.\n\nI'm a game dev but have no experience with developing for VR nor do I have the hardware. So if you want the idea, you're welcome to it.\n\nE: Thought I should add some to why they would be called Club Passes instead of DLCs. It would help with sales. If you look at movies or are a club-goer, no one likes to be told they can't go into a club because they're not on the list. Players would tell their friends what club they were playing in and those friends would feel they have to have a Club Pass in order to be on the list to go."
6fswc3,What are the most fun tools used inside games?,[deleted]
6fqucm,Trance,"The whole point of the “Trance” is to have you hooked on amazingly generated psychedelic out of the world adventure game. Now you ask “Ok, cant you do all this stuff on Minecraft or other sandbox games?” Sure you might be right. But those games give out a different vibe and they play completely different. This game however lets you explore a world of crazy dream like levels and generated world. Lighting, textures, physics, terrain, objects, scenary, colors along with a ton more stuff I cant name. All available to players. This game would also allow players to create their own levels and choose what can apply to the levels. If the person wants weird physics and coloring on the level go right ahead. Imagine creating a level inspired by a weird dream you had last night. Now imagine how many other people might relate to that level. The game would serve as a creative and new way for people to express themselves on how they think and act. If you want to make a story in your level go ahead, this game would allow for you to literally create your own dream level. Lets digress a bit and talk about options which this game would have a ton of. You can choose if you want your generated world to be bright or dull, large or small… well you get the idea… hopefully. Anyways the point of the game is for it to revolve around you or vice versa. Thats the beauty it can be whatever you assign it. \n"
6fmgak,Game where shape of terrain smoothly changes like its alive trying to keep you from your target,"You're a ball trying to roll to screen center but the hills and valleys keep changing depending on where you move. You think you're getting in but then a hill pops up and you just barely avoid it but swing around a valley and still get near the center, rolling back and forth like in a big bowl, trying to outmaneuver these changing curves.\n\nI dont know what patterns of changing curves depending on your movements would be fun, but theres got to be some fun combinations possible."
6flrr6,New TCG ideas. Which do I choose?,"Hello wonderful people of Reddit,\n\nI'm coming up with a ""new"" style of gameplay for a TCG but I want your guys opinions as to which would be the better.  They are not the final version of each but they should be able to explain themselves sufficiently.\n\nIdeas:\n1- Players have 1 deck of cards and 3-5 monsters. If all your monsters are killed then you lose.\nThe deck you have is made up of weapons, armour and spells. These can buff your monsters stats and damage your opponents. When attacking all characters can attack only once (unless specified otherwise) but you can't attack the same target with more than one monster per turn.\n\n2- You play on a board with 5 lines where you sit at one end and your opponent is at the other. You then are given 5 cards, 3 with miss and 2 with hit and you're able to put them face down in any order you choose. You job is to move your monsters from 1 side of the board to the other to reveal the card and if you reveal both hit cards then you win. Your deck is made up of monsters and spells. All monsters have 4 stats, cost, damage, health and speed. The speed is how far a minion can move in 1 turn (the board distance is 10 from your side to theirs).\n\n3- You own a deck made up of monsters, spells and triggers. Each player has 30 health. Each side of the field starts with a power source which starts at 3 and can only be increased through your cards. Cards absorb energy while on the field but once they are removed from the field you get the energy back. Spells last on the field until the end of the turn to prevent spell spamming. And triggers (face down cards) do not cost energy until they are flipped face up but cannot be flipped if you do not have the energy.\n\n4- This one uses die. You're deck is made up of a mixture of characters and talents and runes. These talents are your attacks and can only be equipped to certain characters  (i.e. You can't equip a magic ability to a swordsman or a bow ability to a Mage). When attacking you get given some dice to choose what hits and what misses. The stronger the ability the higher the value needs to be. (You get given 2 die per character on your side of the field). If you don't have any talents equipped then you characters just do ""basic attacks"". If a character reaches 0 health then it is dead and you draw 1 card for every talent equipped to it. To make the game more strategy based, some talents will decrease the value of other dice. Runes can allow you increase dice values, draw card (or even specific cards) and damage your opponent without attacking. Some Runes cost dice themselves to be used.\n\n\n\nI want to know which you would like the most and which is the worst idea. I will be spending many hours making this into a finished game and releasing asap. Please feel free to input your own ideas and improvements.\n\nThank you ❤️"
6fhujv,A 4x game where population size is the most important factor,"I had an idea where the goal of expansion in a 4x game, like civilization or others, is not to exploit more resources, like normal, but to provide more space for a growing population. \n\nSay you start with a city, or planet even if the game is on that level. As you consume resources and move along, your population grows. The amount of resources available, and the conditions of the area the city is in or of the planet all affect population capacity. \n\nOverpopulation would bring heavy penalties to whatever other systems are in place, like food production, training units, etc. On the other hand, settling a resource rich, friendly environment to provide more space for citizens could posibly create situations of population growth going too fast, leading to food or other resource shortages as the resources are consumed faster than they can be aquired.\n\nPopulation capacity could theoretically be built up in the cities or planets themselves, but only to a certain point.\n\nI dont know, maybe when I finally learn how to code, I might be able to make this."
6fhnbk,A 4-Dimensional FPS Capture the Flag,"**Edit: 3 layer ""demo"" can be seen here: https://youtu.be/y4VTgepucQc**\n\nA few notes for the video:\n\n- Simplified to three layers based on suggestion\n\n- Enemies show up as ghosts if theyre in any neighbouring layer\n\n- colour of ghosts no longer dictates if they are ""above"" or ""below"" you, it's just based on team colour\n\n- Obstacles that you would collide into if you jumped layers are shown on the ground (light gray is fence, dark gray is wall)\n\n- the two block high blue and orange pillars represent other players\n\n- there's a mistake, one of the orange players ghosts is missing in the blue dimension\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nConsider a classic multiplayer FPS game of capture the flag. Now think of the game world duplicated into 5 ""layers""\n\n- Dark Orange\n- Orange\n- White (Neutral)\n- Blue\n- Dark Blue\n\nWhen you're in a layer you also project colored semi transparent ghosts in the layers above and below you. If you see an orange ghost you know the player is in the above layer, a blue ghost means they're in the layer below you. \n\nEvery player can jump up and down layers with a cool down but can also pick perks. Goal is to grab flag from the other team and bring it back to your base, but each base exists on opposite ends of the map in opposite layers.\n\nPerk Ideas:\n\n- Jump two layers at once but with a longer cooldown\n\n- Shoot enemies in layers above and below you\n\n- hide your ghosts so you can just pop into existence and surprise opponents\n\n- deal extra damage or some other advantage but be physical/vulnerable in all layers at once\n\n- peak into any layer you want for a given amount of time to find out where the enemy is\n\n- shock enemies to prevent them from jumping layers\n\nThe world in each layer doesn't have to be symmetric either. For instance the neutral layer could have a void in the centre of the map that jumping layers into it kills you, or entire buildings that prevent layer jumping in or out of.\n\nI can post some pictures to help explain if you'd like\n\nEdit: Any other perk ideas? Is the core system too complicated?"
6fgilq,Re-imagining of the 80's 2D Artillery Games (3D),"My friends and I have been feeling a little underwhelmed with our online multiplayer lately and have been tossing around concepts for games, trying to avoid the current trends. Firstly, between us we have a total of 0 hours of game development and amassed a portfolio of nothing, so it remains a concept, but I'd love any feedback relating. Or some one to just make it so we can play it if I'm being honest :)\n\nAs titled my favorite idea at the moment is akin to the 80's Artillery games. For the uninitiated, the games were generally set on a 2D landscape. Two tanks would take turns adjusting their firing arc's to try and hit the other player. There were many variations between the games, but commonly there would elements that affect your firing (mountains and wind etc.), different types of ammo and power ups for either defense or offense.\n\nMy idea is that this would be a 3D game, set on a large map with two opposing regions. These regions could be castles/forts, towns, a hill, anything really so long as it was mirrored somewhat for balance. There would be a central area to each side, in which there would be several artillery weapons. You guessed it, the players can use the artillery weapons, manually adjusting the aim, elevation, zeroing etc. (each part individually) to fire on each others position. \n\nTo further the game mechanics there would be defenses that could be built for increased protection, other structures that can resupply or heal your character, or get items to repair your weapons and position. The resources to do this would be outside of the central artillery zone, towards the opponent. Recovering these resources would expose you to enemy fire, from either the artillery or perhaps a form of MG alongside. You could also perhaps construct offensive structures, something like some form of gas producing machine with which you could then use as an AOE attack in the enemies area. \n\nYou could play round based pvp with I suppose a fair few to a side or just 1v1. \nVictory objectives could be destroying specific structures or areas, a set amount of kills, domination etc.\n\nI'd love to be skilled in the software to actually make this a possibility but it's ridiculously far outside of my very, very new and basic ability.\nI would be more than happy should anyone take any concepts of this and use it somewhere else, or if any one can suggest ways I could get it happening. \nOr yeah just go right ahead and make it so me and my friends can play it and I'll give this chocolate bar I just found.\n\nlove you all"
6ffqpn,[Abstract] A horror game that is made more terrifying by making it easy to get through.,"When I watch people like Markiplier play FNaF, I notice something; by making the game hard, it stops being scary because you have to play it OVER and OVER and learn every little detail about how the monsters work, so you'll know almost exactly what's happening.\n\nSo this is my idea. Make a horror game that's not actually that hard, thus allowing you to get to the end without fully understanding whatever you're running from, preserving the fear of the unknown. You won't understand when it appears or why, or what it is exactly. This also requires a bit of randomness, so each playthrough is different."
6feozs,An Emotional Throwback Game,"Story : You're a man that is trying to live normally like other people. One of your actions is sitting at the beach and look at the sunset. Suddenly a woman came to you and started asking questions about your past. You were then explore the good, bad and the decision you have made.\n\nMechanics : The mechanics are pretty simple, while in conversation you will need to choose your dialogue between 2 choices. There will be times where you need to manually do things, like walk, buying something or etc. Your action’s effect would be revealed at the end of the episode/game. There would also be multiple endings.\n\nI would like to hear your comment on this idea.( I think this idea is somewhat similar to this one : [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4prlqn/sunrise_light_of_dawn_emotional_pixel_adventure/]."
6femnk,Game idea,"A post-post apocalyptic game, where the gameplay is you traveling along to somewhere, but you can only carry what you can realistically fit on your person with what you have. \nThe game is a constant quest to get better coats with more pockets, eventually building sleds and backpacks and better ways to carry things, until you basically have a moving city. \n\nI think it would be cool if the building/crafting isn't pre-done like fallout, but dynamic, so if you want, and you have the stuff to do it, you can just glue pockets all over yourself, and the cities/ vehicles (animal or gear powered, no engines ect.) would also be dynamic, so everything you build would be unique. \n\nAlso, I think tree climbing so you could scope out routes would be really cool.

6fdkf7,"[Beginner] Blackstar, game about building your solar mass.","I had a little idea for a mobile game yesterday but I don't think I will be making it myself.\n\nBlackstar is a mobile game where you play as a star, that starts off as a brown dwarf. The game is pictured top down, where you are in the bottom half of the screen and your opponent is in the top half. The game is made out of waves, and your opponents are other stars and celestial objects.\n\nYour opponents come one by one, next one coming after you defeat the last one. Your goal is to build up your own star, by attacking the opponent. For example, you might be matched up with a sun-like star. You fire solar flares from your surface by ""spinning"" yourself, and you have to aim for the opponents sunspots. If you hit, part of the enemy ""tears"" off and those little pieces become part of you, making your mass bigger. If you miss, you loose some of your mass. The enemy can also attack you, so you have to reflect their attacks with something like CMEs, I really haven't that part through tho.\n\nOnce you come big enough, you can consume the rest of the enemy with your gravity and move on to the next one.\n\nThe game ends when a timer, your star age becomes too large and you die off as a supernova. The final solar mass you gathered will be your score and you restart as the brown dwarf that was left over from the supernova.\n\nI'm not sure how well my idea came across, but I hope some of you understood. For the graphics style I was thinking 8bit-ish.\n\nThis is my first time really sharing ideas, I'm open for all sorts of critique :)"
6fcfnh,Looking for ideas for a business/investment simulation game. 3X game.,"I'm making a 2D investment game.

6f93o5,Mobile Party Game Ideas Wanted,"I want to build a game similar to the way ""Drawful"" works. Not the same game, but the concept of having a party game where the game is played on a TV (via ps4,xbox 1, or PC) and the other players can join for free using their phone, tablet, or laptop. \n\nI think this is a great model for a party game because only 1 person needs to actually own the game. That makes getting other people to play super easy, and it's basically free marketing :D\n\nI've been programming for several years. I've made games and published them. The technology behind this concept isn't that difficult and I can code it up pretty easily. So all I need is an idea. Credit will of course be given, and some financial compensation too probably.  "

6dvh8z,Turn-based RPG where you Lvl Down,"I had this idea for a while about a typical turn-based RPG where instead of starting from Lvl1 and having to Lvl Up to get stronger, you start from Lvl99 and lose exp and Lvl Down, becoming less powerfull. Monsters still have to be beaten to get gold, better armor and weapons and sometimes progress. \n\nThe plot is that a hero killed everything, but only reached Lvl99 with 1 exp point remaining for Lvl100,his ultimate goal.He travels to another reign to find something to kill there. The first monster he sees is a slime. Even that should be enough for 1 exp point, so he attacks it. Then the slime transforms into a witch, and gives him the curse to lose exp points. She then teletrasports back into her castle. The hero must travel this new, foreign land and find the witch, and defeat her to remove the curse and reach Lvl100!So he must have good armor and good weapons and items, but also have a good level. You will need to be picky on the monsters you choose to kill, because you'll need a balance to defeat the witch! \n\n\nDo you think this could work? What do you think of the idea? "

6duvdg,Mobile phone game idea...,"The idea is about using your phone as a ""weapon"" against virtual enemies you can see on screen and fight by pushing your touch screen(on various areas). The game builts its map based on your own house and/or courtyard.\n\nThis is why every map is different and every game is different. The game can generate multiple maps you only see on screen(eg: frozen cave, hell pit, etc.) and they change as you progress through the levels, but they're all based on your own home. \n\nYou play by walking around the house and look for monsters the game places in various locations in your house and point the phone at them and fire.\n\nEach level has a certain amount of monsters. When you find and defeat all of them, you finish the level, and the game makes a new map. \n\nYou can get weapons by finding them on the maps(walking around the area) or through buying them(could be an online store with real money or game money). You could also buy new maps(just general locations-eg: Rainforest, as each map is generated for each player). \n\nMultiple players can play the same way and the same map, if each of them has a phone with the installed game. There will be the same map, or different ones.. "
6dursq,"Giant, large-scale MMO/Singleplayer/Multiplayer Super-Strategy/Politics/Shooter/Modern/Old Timey/World Conquest Game","So, I was in the middle of History class, and I came up with a game.\nIt would be a Risk-type game with multiple gameplay modes and many other things. You fight COM/Human(s)/Both to take over the world, one Total War-style battle at a time. You would be forming treaties or declarations and laws in small or large-scale politics battles to gain territories or stop external or internal crime or fighting, maybe other problems. If you send troops into battle, you could lose your forces or leave your territory open to attack, promoting slow decision making, like real life. For MMO politics, it would be a 3-day long poll for all decisions. For MMO battling, each player would be a general, private, captain, etc., leading squads, or being a single soldier. (That's the shooter part.) It could take weeks or months to take countries. In the MMO, there would be 5 servers to keep things from becoming too boring or unbalanced. Speaking of that, the number of players in larger roles have to be balanced to keep everything even. The battles could be M&amp;B style or Total War style, maybe both, and each server could have one of the two, changing the server count to 6. There would be different time periods to chose from, including Modern, World Wars (1&amp;2 combined), WW1, WW2, Old America (1840-60s) 1000s, 1100s, Medieval, Sengoku Jidai, The Future (3500s-4000s), etc.\n\n--Community Addons--\nSupport for different time periods, maps, politics, and gameplay systems, etc. (Optional, but if possible, incredibly appreciated.)\n\n--Singleplayer--\nComputer allies and enemies, you can choose your rank, cheats, etc.\n\n--Multiplayer--\nUp to 20 players in each faction, normal ranking system, but sped up, polls finish when every player chooses or in 20 minutes, only playable when every player who initially started is playing.

6dpu5l,[Request] Roguelike elements + [+ Platformer ] something new?,"Hi,\n\nI'm used to think that if you make a good solid game, people would love and play but apparently people are after something ""new"" and don't care much about polish. (Or maybe both, presumably)\n\nI also like[d] to believe that if you make something that you want to play and make it with love, people would do too, evidently not.\n\nSo for the next project I thought to talk with some people here before spending next 9 months making something that people would only hate or at best ignore.\n\n(Also note that I have 8+ years experience)\n\nDespite those said earlier I like to make something that I like to play and played similar games as well so I know it has some elements like:\n\n* Aracde (Both in movement and general feel and design of the game)\n* Fast paced (Like Quake speedruns fast)\n* Minimal graphics. As I don't have an artist and prefer not to find one. So either 2D or 3D, I prefer 2D even though some stuff is much easier in 3D.\n* Action. Probably shooter or like Katana Zero, you don't shoot but others would.\n* Procedurally generated levels. I hope to be able to use Cellular Automatas but they are very hard to use in games due to their chaotic and unpredictable nature but if it doesn't work, other methods.\n* High Replaybility. I love to not to know what will happen as next playthrough even as the developer. Like some Brawls in Hearthstone that the whole deck is randomized and you do not make a deck and is given to you.\n* Singleplayer. Maybe local co-op but doesn't matter now.\n* PC.\n* Platformer. As it's a genre I've made a couple games in it and played a ton, I think I know it good enough but some things are more limiting in it like enemy A.I. so I'm considering oblique camera as well (like 2D Zelda games or Binding of Isaac)\n\nand finally:\n\n* Something unique that other games do not have and yet to know hence making this topic."
6dpt9e,Detective game set it Orwellian world,"I have an idea for a game I myself would like to make, but is perhaps a little different.\nYou would play as a detective in a Orwellian world. Your task would be to find people who do not fit the rules imposed by the state (different clothes, movement, out after police hour, posessing stuff banned by the government, etc.)\n\nThere would be no guidence, and you would also have to abide by the rules,if not, the character would get vapourised, and player would get to control another detective.\nDepending on how many partisans the detective have found, the end result would be different, for example; if the player constantly wastes agents, partisans would grow in number and it would result in a revolt. This would allow players to write their own story, and the role of their characters.\nThere would be several levels, starting from a smaller village to a huge city, whilst most, if not all buildings would be open to explore.\n\nI have planned the concept for a while, but never really dwelled deeper into developing it as it seems very different from todays market.\nI would appreciate opinion on the concept as I myself cannot decide weather to make it or not, as I am not sure people would like that kind of game."
6dpkwu,FPS: Arena shooter twist,"This was an idea I was holding onto in the hopes of making it someday, but since I no longer have the time to build the skills or assets needed for it I thought I'd throw it up here. I thought about it a lot so apologies in advance for the wall of charts.\n\n**Name:** Altergun\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nAn arena shooter. Every player starts the round with the same gun the alterpistol. Around the map are gems/cystals pickups instead of new guns. The pickups can be used in one of three ways.\n\n* To Alter the gun, changing it into a new gun based on which one or two gems are picked up\n* To Alter the players armor\n* Converting them into ammo for any gun\n\n**Setting:**\n\nThe maps would be small arenas that are either small and asymmetrical for individual players or larger and balanced for team games. Thematically I'm not sure what the best setting is for the game, either something sci-fi based around the technology of the altergun or instead maybe a virtual reality setting so that themes for the maps can be more varied.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThe Gems are one of 8 ""types""\n\n* Heat (Themed around fire)\n* Shock (Themed around electricity)\n*Pierce (Themed around sharp points)\n* Death (Themed around death, high damage or weird effects)\n* Sol (Themed around light and regeneration)\n* Reflect (Themed around bouncing)\n* Ball (Themed around round objects)\n* Frost (Themed around ice)\n\nOther mechanics notes:\n\n* Guns would have a primary and secondary fire.\n* The player starts with no armor, but can use gems to alter their armor providing different passive effects.\n* Ammo would be a single bank, different guns would use different amounts of ammo to reload for balancing.\n* Players would be limited to 4 gems at a time 2 in their gun and 2 in their armor leading to trying to find the best combination of gun and armor before dying.\n* Gems are reset upon death (Possible dropping some so that a new player can pick them up)\n* Players would be able to recycle all of their active gems into ammo resetting them back to the default armor and pistol if they are out of ammo or if they don't like the combo they ended up with.\n* Players health would be classic style (non regeneration) where the only methods to restore health are through armor and gun effects or by picking up health packs\n\n**ALTERED GUNS CHART example ideas**\n\n|| HEAT| SHOCK|

6do5uu,Assassins from the future kill Catholic priest involved in Molestation allegations from the past.,The game will revolve around real life stories like the one from Netflix about Father Malachi. Each of the assassinations will take place in the actual cities and be modeled after the real places the stories occurred. There's tons of material to choose from like the case in Australia where 30 people of the Broken Rites group are said to have committed suicide because of molestation by priest. I'm thinking something like Assassins Creed meets Hitman. Many of these stories are incredible just on there own. This game would be incredibly controversial and would probably spark several lawsuits.
6dmxcs,Sim Terra,"All the space games currently leave me wanting as a builder / strategy player.  \n  \nSim Terra would be a solar system simulator.  \n  \nThe year is 2100, and man's urge for manifest destiny has finally escaped the bonds of gravity and earth.  \nEmboldened by the mass production of a capable sub-light EM-Drive, corporations and interested nations have begun building orbital platforms.  \nSome to harvest resources.  \nSome for defense contractors.\nSome for simple tourism.  \nAll looking to make a profit.  \n  \nInstead of being a flight sim game (realistically, navigation would be computer controlled), your goal would be to build up your base or fleet.  \nImagine gorgeous, space structures like elysium in space.  \n  \nIndividual players might own a satellite, or a guild/corp might work together and own a orbital platform on mars.  \nPlayers might decide to setup stations in the asteroid belt, cataloging deposits and selling them to cargo haulers.  \nSmall ships will be super common place, where bigger ships will be the gold standard.  \n  \nCan you own this system?  \n  \nPeacekeeping would be done by a UN contracted / endorsed Fleet which any player can join. Someone attack your station?  Call the Fleet; they may ask for a small bribe, but would do their best to hunt down the pirates.  \nWant to raid stations? Join a pirate gang.  \nSlow safe routes would be patrolled by Fleet, but faster direct routes might bring more profit.  \nPirates would also be able to build rogue bases.  \n  \n"

6d9fqw,"Mobile game idea I'm making, looking for ideas to improve","So this is a 2D side view game where the player controls a dragon, you can fly around and have abilities (dash, claws, fire breath) you can use to destroy villages and cities. The villagers can defend themselves: from shooting arrows, to catapults and magic as you attack bigger and bigger cities. You start pretty weak but you can upgrade your dragon by eating villagers and evolving. Game ends when you take too much damage from villagers.\n\nThat's the basics. Now I had a few ideas:\n\n- Make it multiplayer CoC-like, where you can build your village and attack others' (however would require a lot more work), upgrade your dragon on long term\n- Endless runner sort of, you just keep attacking larger and larger randomly generated villages until you die (score based), then restart from scratch\n- Handmade levels (less fun and more work for me imo)\n- All of those as different game modes?\n\nWhat do you think? Also, any ideas for buildings, defenses, upgrades? Thanks!"
6d9erg,2D Ocean Exploration game,"I tried to make this game a but got too bogged down so might as well share it so maybe others could take a stab at it.\n\n**Intro Scene:**\nPOV of underwater camera filming men working on repairing an oil rig. All of sudden a small glowing gold colored fish darts past the men from off camera. The footage rewinds and pauses with the fish on screen. Game screen pans out to a wide eyed researcher pointing at the monitor looking at you the user. ""It's real..."" he mutters in disbelief. ""What! What do you mean you don't know what ""it"" is. Its a Gold Fish. Its real. I've heard stories but I never thought it was actually out there. But here it is we have it on camera!"" ""It's said to have almost magical properties, capable of impossible things, it could be the cure the cancer, it could really help people.."", ""IT COULD MAKE USE RICH!"" bellows a rich looking man, your investor, ""I've provided you a boat you must find this fish immediately, bring it to me, I need to...study it"". End scene. Gameplay starts with a top down view of a small white boat, docked near shore. The water is shallow you can see the sandy see floor through the bluish tinted water. \n\n**Gameplay:**\nThe map is a large randomly generated ocean map. You can drive the boat around this large map. The shore is shallow but there is deeper pools or lagoon. Picture these like the Pokémon diving scenes:\nhttp://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/831588subsotoopolis.png\nThe map drops down to deeper and deeper areas, then finally open ocean, all still with ""dive areas"".\n\nIf you drive your boat over the dive area you can press a button and you dive into the water and the camera switches from 2D top down to 2D sideview. Depending on your biome you may see something different, on shore you dive into a small pool, you won't find much here except crabs, small fish, etc. and the occasional treasure chest. In deeper water there can be randomly generated cave systems. Then finally open ocean you dive in to deep open water, sometimes a trench. The deeper you go you start finding larger fish, sharks, monsters, kraken, etc.  Some fish will attack your boat, some will outrun you, but you try to capture them. You have to attack and defeat fish in some to slow them down or tire them out to capture them. You get rewarded with money from catching new fish and send them back to the research facility. With this money you can upgrade you boat for more speed, better weapons to attack the fish to capture them, better defenses against fish that attack you. \nYou can also introduce mechanics for while you're exploring top down view such as fishing so you can turn in those fish for reward money. Or random attack encounters as you drive over the open ocean.\nThe goal is to find the randomly placed Gold Fish and capture it. If you get to the fish too early in game your boat won't be fast enough to keep up or powerful enough to ""defeat"" and capture it and it will run off and you have to find it again. If you finally capture it you send it back to the research facility and you win.\n\nHere you should introduce some sort of twist ending, probably something like the rich guy has been using Gold Fish to keep himself immortally young, which kills the fish. So you grab the fish and run off and toss it into the ocean so it doesn't meet the same fate.\n "

6d1bka,PROJECT MERC,"Hey there People!\nIam pretty new on Reddit and iam not sure if iam actually on the right place, but let me tell you a little bit about me, my friends and our Idea.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nMy Name is Razyel l'Archange. Most people just call me Raz.\nIam from Germany and iam currently 23 Years old.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nEverything began with a Public-game in Payday 2, my favourite game. I met there a guy from Czech republic, we played a bit, and got each other on the Steam friendlist, totally normal. BUT, after some time, we found out that we share the same hobbies, the same taste of music and overall were pretty the same.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nOur Project started basicly with my Payday 2 Mask, which was my Signature (and still is) which is called Phantom. My friend drew a Picture about the Mask on the Character i play, in our favourite colours. The Colours Cyan and Pink.\nWhy these colours? Because we are both fan of the Music and Style of the 80s. We love to listen to Synthwave and its subgenres.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThat guy with Mask became our Mascot and got his name Phantom. It didnt take long and he created another character from his Mask and after some thoughts we gave him the name Sol.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nWith that we started to think further. We created a Bond between those Characters, their Story, and a world around them. Which was ment to be a side Story for Payday 2 but we want to set us free from that.\nThis is now 2 Years ago.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday we have a big collection of ideas for a whole Story. We have started to draw more Pictures and we have also some Soundtracks made by us. We are even trying to make a wikia. But since we are only 3 Guys, its kinda hard to get everything going.\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n____________________________________________________\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Concept:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nWell there are many concepts. Project Merc can be just one Game, or many. If people are interested in the story and want to make something, there are basicly no limits. As long its kinda Canon and is set in the Style of our story, you can make every game you want.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Our thoughts:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- First of all a Storytelling Shooter RPG about the 4 Main characters on their way through our 4 (maybe 5) Chapters of the story. Every Character is Unique and has different Skills, Signature weapons and Playstyles. For example Phantom is ""The Assassin"" hes good with his Dagger, sneaky and deadly, but also uses his G53 Carbine. Sol is ""The Veteran"" hes more about Taunting the enemies, get attention and suppressing them with his M60 Machine Gun. You may be able to switch through characters, maybe even Coop. You can find random generated weapons with different stats and Manufacturer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Other ideas:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n- Beat'm'Up with all the Characters from our Story\n- Final fantasy like turned based RPG\n- telltale like Story game\n- Moba/MP Shooter\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe dont really care about Graphics, we would love to see our story even in Pixelstyle (since there are 1-2 pics in this style)\nBut we love details, so maybe randomly different Reload animations? I dream too much, sorry!\n\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n___________________________________________________\n\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you want to work on something, please tell us and let us support you with everything you want and what we can give you to help!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe not only searching for people making games, we also search for people who wants to help us make Art, Music, videos, etc etc! And we want to share thoughts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI would love to write down the whole story here but i guess its too much. So if youre interested in more info, please Contact me =)\n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Forgive any Spelling Errors... \n\n[(PROJECT MERC titel Pic)](http://i.imgur.com/ZlUMHUj.png)\n"

6cx80g,An Invoker-Style Puzzle Platformer,"    Game Design/Concept\n    The concept is based on Dota2's Invoker. The combination of Quas, Wex and Exort determines the spell\n    that will be used. However, instead of MOBA, the concept will be used for a platforming game with\n    puzzles. The invoker can store up to two spells.\n    \n    You will use spells to attack enemies, support yourself or reach other areas of the game\n\n    Controls (PlayStation)\n\n    Left/Right - Move left/right\n    Up - Jump\n    Down - Moved down on ledges\n\n    Square - Melee Attack\n    Triangle - Cast Invoked Spell\n    X - Invoke\n    Circle - Dash\n\n    L1 - Attune Button\n\n    L1 + Triangle - Attune Air\n    L1 + Circle - Attune Fire\n    L1 + X - Attune Earth\n    L1 + Square - Attune Water\n\n    Spells\n    - In order to cast a spell, the right elements must be attuned and assign to cast spell buttons.\n    - The elements that can be attuned are Fire, Water, Air and Earth. \n    - Each spells has mana cost, cooldown and may deal elemental damage.\n    - There is a small cooldown before you can invoke your next spell.\n    - Many possible spell combinations\n\n    Spell Types\n    - Basic Projectile : Low Cost Projectile Spells\n    - Advance Projectile : Projectile spells that deal increased damage. May cause debuffs.\n    - Trap : Invisible Elemental Traps\n    - Wall : Conjures a specific item/construct. e.g. Stone Block, Ice Block, Fire Wall\n    - AoE Spells : Spells that deal AoE damage. High cooldown spells\n    - Hex : Inflicts debuffs\n    - Polymorph : Changes the caster to a frog, mist, or bird\n    - Support : Regeneration, Magic Buff and Magic Defense, Invisibility, True Sight\n\n    Sample Invoke\n    Fire/Fire/Fire - Fireball. Deals Fire Damage. Has mini-AoE.\n    Water/Earth/Earth - Conjures a Stone Block. Blocks projectiles. Can be stepped on.\n    Water/Water/Water - Regeneration. Gradually heals the player.\n    Air/Earth/Earth - Rabbit Form. Allows movement in narrow spaces.\n\n    RPG Elements\n    - The invoker has 4 stats.\n    - STR : increases physical attack\n    - INT : increases the damage of spells and max mana\n    - VIT : increases defense and max health\n    - WIS : increases duration of buffs and decreases duration of debuffs\n    - Weapon : Determines the strength of physical attack and magic attack.\n    (Some have special properties like Fire Staff which increases damage of Fire Spells.)\n    - Armor : Determines physical and elemental defense\n    - Accessory : May improve defense or offense\n\n    Variations\n    - Can open a way for PVP combat\n    - May or may not involve leveling elements.\n    - The assigning of spells may not be necessary. The Triangle Button can cast the spell based on\n      attuned element. This can leave the Circle button for a mobility ability like Dash.\n    - The order of elements can be strict (Air/Air/Fire and Air/Fire/Air yields different spell)\n    which will have 256 combinations\n    - The order of elements can be flexible (Air/Air/Fire and Air/Fire/Air yields the same spell)\n    which will have 40 combination."
6cvsmg,Final Fantasy Tactics - MOBA,"I'v been trying to think of an interesting way to combine these two ideas, but its hard to visualize. I'm thinking 5v5 or 3v3 original characters controlled by one player only, rather then the traditional MOBA concept of individuals controlling one character. \n\nI'm thinking it would be interesting if instead of turn based movement it would be ABT or energy gauge based, and you would be able to switch between characters at anytime. I think this would add needed excitement to a normally slower type of game play. It also creates and interesting micromanagement system for optimizing your every move. I think it would be cool to have some kind of mechanic that rewards you for successfully staggering your characters, so that every character is always moving and accomplishing objectives.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any interesting ideas or thoughts. it's an interesting concept i think but hard for me to fully flesh out.\n\n-MermaidDad"
6cv704,A multiplayer management game where you have to decide which players are useless enough to risk their lives for everyone's benefit,"Multiplayer, 4-10 players, cooperative management game. \n\nEveryone has 2-4 skills out of 16-20, no two skills are interchangeable.\n\nEvery day there's a number of tasks that need to be done to avoid bad consequences. Some tasks can be inside the players' base, some require a group of players to go outside. Only players with appropriate skills can complete tasks, though other players may assist.\n\nThe main decision players make every day is deciding who stays at the base and who joins the group that will go outside.\n\n - some players are useful both inside and outside the base\n\n - it's dangerous outside, so players would prefer to stay inside out of self-preservation\n\n - some players have more valuable skills than others; if these specialists were disabled or killed, everyone else would be worse off\n\n - some skills provide safety for the whole group when outside the base\n\n - if a player was hurt, they'll be more vulnerable and slowly lose health until healed by another player inside the base"
6hf6ou,This Is *Not* The Jungle-The 'Shock' Games Meets Donkey Kong Country,"So, this is just an idea I had that came from alternating between playing System Shock 2 and Donkey Kong Country Returns, and watching Markiplier play Prey(2017) &gt;_&lt;\n\nBut, looking at the large areas of the space station in Prey(2017), and how odd and alien it can appear to humans made me think, what would a chimpanzee feel (also, how cool would it be to get around by swinging along the ceiling! &gt;_&lt;)? So, here's my idea-we're on yet another space station/super large space ship where everything has gone terribly wrong due to an alien organism being brought on board. Only, you're not a human trying to stop the menace. You're a chimpanzee brought aboard for scientific experiments. And once things go wrong, you manage to escape containment and must survive and find Kind Voice, your trainer and the one nice human. \n\nYou'd understand *some* human spoken language but not all, and be utterly unable to communicate with them (unless they know sign language). You can't read their writings at all. You can't use most of their equipment (I'm thinking maybe a 'monkey see, monkey do' system where eventually you can learn how to use keycards and the like, but only after witnessing a human do so a certain number of times) and while you can use certain very simple guns, reloading and maintaining is beyond you. Human medicine doesn't work for you either, so combat isn't the best policy.\n\nAnyway, what do y'all think?"
6hf203,Incomplete idea: A faceless humanoid that has the power to take the face of the person it kills,"I had this idea, and I'm looking to complete it.\n\n**Plot**  \nThe plot that I have in mind is that you're in a laboratory because a group of bad people found you and want to use you as an experiment. You wake up there, and want to escape and understand who you are and where you came from. It would probably be a stealth game.\n\n**Interrogations**  \nWhat a level could be like?  \nWould it be levels to find clues (maybe parts of the map of where they found you)?  \nA problem I found is that the gameplay could become repetitive if the setting is on the earth, so maybe if it's another planet, each face you steal could give you a particular talent like flying, breathing underwater, etc.\n\nAny help is welcome! Thanks!"

There are other players in your game, but it's risky to fight good players early in each round. \n  You get meat per kill, more meat for bigger kills, and you consume meat to improve your stats; improvable stats that you have (as a new player) are bite power and sprint speed. As you improve abilities in the round, your creature's appearance changes(i.e. Better bite means bigger teeth). \n  You earn xp to unlock new abilities such as pounce, flight, or camouflage. These are upgraded with meat every in the round though. For upgrades see bottom of description. \n  The goal of the game is to kill 50 players on the other team. You will respawn with your same stats if you are killed. You can survive and get many kills on the chickens and fish before you decide to ambush a hostile player.\n\nUpgrades include:\n\nAttack:\n  Bite\n  Scrape\n  Pounce\nMovement:\n  Sprint speed\n  Flight speed\n  Swim speed\n  Leap distance\nCamouflage:\n  plantlife color\n  Water color\n  Sky color\n  Whatever is behind you(activates when crawling)\nProtection:\n  Front side\n  Backside\n  Top of body\n  Underside"

6gz8j2,Social Anxiety Survival Horror,"Survival Horror games are all about not dying or going insane, but what if there was a more relatable survival horror about having social anxiety?  Rather than running from a monster, maybe you just want to avoid talking to someone. Increased stress levels lead you to fantasize about being embarrassed. \n\nCould even have a romance angle. You have to navigate social danger and build yourself up enough to talk to someone you like and succeed. Goal of the game would be a first date or just self respect."
6gyrpl,War survival mmo idea feel free to use,"I got this idea for a game so:\nWhen you join a server you are randomly sorted into sides based on countries. You can choose Air Force or army and for Air Force the game starts by dropping you in a random point in the air and for army you spawn in a helicopter mid air with parachutes and you jump off. Periodically supply drops or trucks come with food/water, guns, spades (which then allow you to dig trenches) bags of flour (stackable) and other stuff. There would be no crafting and you can fire at friendlies but you get deducted xp (and rank down) yes there would be ranks and from there you basically survive war. Also an added extra I think would be cool is in the menu instead of a boring video/ pic / slideshow / newsfeed you get to spectate 1 player every 10 seconds (automatically switches through) from 3rd person view. This idea probably sucks and I won't make it as I'm a gamer not a dev but feel free to use it devs! (But if you port it to console don't forget to make it limited cos pc master race all the way!!!!)"

6gwe1d,Alien Thoughts.,"So I had a strange dream last night, in which I realized something about alien invasions (or really anything where modern or near modern earth involves with aliens): unless we're the ones doing the invading, the invaders are always evil or want to grind us up or something, and the idea of their conquests ever being beneficial (i.e. bringing technology, order, equality, etc.) Is considered laughable. I'd be interested to see the opposite happening, where an interaction from another world was actually displayed positively and was genuinely mutually beneficial. For example, a brutal dystopia being ended with an alien conquest. I think this idea would be interesting to play around with."

6gv7i3,FPS with spell casting cards,"The game is based on this mechanic: every player has a small hand of cards that change on every reload of the main weapon.\n\nEach cards can be a spell ( for example fire cast, healing, bombs )  or a structure ( for example turrets, healing structures ). When a card is changed, it can't be drawn anymore ( before the end of the deck and its refill ).\n\nEvery card spend an amount of mana that can be restored by reloading or killing an enemy ( structures' kills doesn't count ). The mana cap is low at the beginning and raises slowly.\n\nAt the start of every match, each player choose one of its deck. The decks can contain an undefined number of card ( and each card can be contained various times, so it can be used more times before the end of the deck ). Every time a player ends its deck, he get a permanent debuff, so the player is discouraged from spamming reload to get the perfect hand.\n\nThe match are played by a small teams ( I think 3-4 player per team are good ) and on small but complex maps in which the players can quickly plan strategies and move in the appropriate areas depending on their hand."

Ends when it changes into ""enemy phase"".\n\nDuring the ""player phase"", players can queue special abilities that their character performs with various\neffects each...during the ""enemy phase"" successfully hitting an enemy or parrying their strikes grants a\ncharge up to a maximum of 4 that allows usage of the first ability in queue and the subsequent ones.\n\nCertain conditions grant the players access to the enemy platform becoming capable of attacking them without\nusing any special, parrying, ranged or ""player phase"" attacks but beware retaliatory counter attacks.\n\nThe assist characters occassionally activate an ability to aid the players depending on the priority given to them and are completely immortal but can still be hindered by status effects or being hit directly."

Still structured with a single player narrative. \n\n**Plot:**\n\nIn the year 2045 fighting climate change with surreptitious technology backfired and brought the end of the world. The only place left with with a somewhat breathable atmosphere is the [Suez Canal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Great_Bitter_Lake%2C_Egypt.jpg/1200px-Great_Bitter_Lake%2C_Egypt.jpg) \n\n\nWith the sudden radiation of the world through algae that was supposed to consume CO2 and release clean oxygen and water the algae instead created ""invisible"" radiation that catalyzes mitochondria's to hyper accelerate mitosis and thus accelerate evolution. \n\n\nThe few remaining humans alive are international oil drillers, fishermen and pirates all striving against eachother for survival. \n\n**Setting:**\n\nLarge settlements on the water like [these](http://i.imgur.com/fz14hS8.jpg). \n\nOne Island called [Socotra](http://imgur.com/gallery/QtGfT) managed to stay somewhat breathable where you can gather food stuffs. \n\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* First person story driven very similar to Stalker and Metro 2033. \n\n* Main gameplay is centered around exploring generated maps that are accessed via a campaign map. \n\n* Combat is a mix between [Guns of Icarus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209080/Guns_of_Icarus_Online/), [Black Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZacvOfWck0) and of course [Metro 2033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MCiJ8mr3QU).  \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Modular boat and Oil rig upgrades and generating loot such as guns and equipment. \n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Multiplayer with PVE and PVP. \n\n"

6gnj6z,FPS Game where one player is a squad leader and must stop other team members from defecting to the other team,"So, basically you would control a member of a squad of about 8-10 people. One person would play as the squad leader, able to use more advanced abilities than the rest of the group, like a minimap. The other players should follow the leader's instructions. But if they don't, they can be punished for insubordination.\n\nHere's the catch - they can go to the other side and fight for them instead, if they feel as though their side is losing. The squad leader can't switch, but he can see that this member is friendly-firing.\n\nThis means that the squad leader must be good at his job in order to keep the other squad members from defecting."
6gl4ln,Simple Mobile Game,"I just put my first game up on the play store a couple of weeks ago and I'm looking for another project. I'm interested in developing short, simple, mobile games. I have a few ideas floating around my head at the moment, but they're a little too big for me right now. \n\nI don't have any preferences for genre or gameplay, as long as it's doable for a novice. I have 3 years of experience in design generally and 1 year in Unity/C#\n\nWhatever game comes out of this experiment will be released free, open source, and ad-free on the Play Store and elsewhere."
6gl30b,"An FPS where every player on the server, no matter how big it is, has to build a settlement together..... But PVP is still allowed","The game would have a large map on most servers roughly the size of PEI from unturned. Not too big, but just big enough to have a sense of being a large expanse. Players would spawn in large groups, and the members of each group would be forced to work together to survive. They could build settlements, establish trade routes, and can either go to war with eachother or they could merge with eachother to form bigger settlements and bigger groups.The bigger a settlement, the more enemy NPCs spawn outside. Zombie hordes, invading soldiers, and so on. However, bigger settlements get perks, too. They get better defenses, temporary safezones, and supply drops of weapons, fuel, and such. The end game is for all of the settlements to join together, after which PVP is disabled and, as the final reward for such a unification, the players get infinite building supplies and the ability to call supply drops at will."
6gkoz0,A TV show inspired fighter..,"So I just finished rewatching my favorite show from my childhood, Avatar!  \nAnd now I really want to play it.  \nA fully 3D (but not quite xenoverse open) fighting game, with gameplay in between something like a dragon ball game and something a little more grounded like mortal kombat.  \nThe ability to switch between elements(earth, water, fire, air) or subsections (lightning, bloodbending, metal bending) on the fly (if your character allows)  \nArenas from and inspired by the show, set in each nation.  \nMultiple modes, from duels and tag teams, to a ladder culminating in a battle with the fire lord.  \nCharacter list drawing from the series, in addition to the ability to create your own avatar hailing from whichever nation you choose.  \nHeavy combat focus on special attacks, combos, breakers, and counters.  \nCharacter specific abilities and move sets (redirect lightning, sword combos)  \nAn ongoing faction war with real time bonuses based on faction (full moon power buff for water tribe)  \nA graphical style representative of the series, somewhere in between anime and western.  \nAnd lastly, cross platform between consoles to boost community size.  \nSo if you've gotten this far, I thank you for reading my rambling. The whole time I watched the series, I couldn't help but think about the wonderful game possibilities that were never really taken advantage of, and am glad I found some place to get it out! \n"
6give3,2.5D Snakes,"This is a modified multiplayer snake game that I would like to see made real.\n\nThe basic game elements consist of a complex layered gameboard with transition\nareas, snake evolution, obstacles, and food. The entire game could be coded with\nunder 32 glyphs.\n\nThe game ""rules"" are as followed: Players have a choice to spawn as one of multiple\ntypes of snake which interact in predictable manners with the game world.\n\nSnake type 1 is called ""Evolving snake"" and is shown on the snake selection screen as scaley green.\nIn the game, your snake will always appear to have red scales. However, as the game goes by, you\nwill ascend in tier and be able to interact with snakes below and above your rank.\nOther evolving_snake type snakes who are your tier cannot harm you, they will appear to be white.\nyou can pass over them with ease and will not collide with them. Snakes who are a lower rank than\nyou will appear to pass beneath you, and snakes in higher tiers will pass above you.\nEvolving_snake type who are one rank below your tier have green bodies and red heads.\nIf their head touches your body, they die. If their head touches your head, you die.\nEvolving_snake's who are one tier above you have red bodies and green heads.\nIf your head touches their body, you die. If their head touches yours, they die.\nThis pattern both repeats and is consistent: evolving_Snakes who are tier 1, for example, are immune(white)\nto evolving_snakes tiers 3,5,7,9, evolving_snakes who have risen to tier 2 are immune to evolving_snakes tier'd 4,6,8,10,etc,\nand so-forth.\n\nThe appearance of E-snakes to other types of snakes: alternating red and green bands.\n\nSnake type 2 is called ""Classic Snake"". C_Snake cannot pass over itself, over it's own kind,\nor over other snake types, and other snake types cannot pass over it. C_Snake has a unique ability:\nIt can eat rocks as food. . If C_Snake's head collides with snake type 3 in any way, Type 3 dies.\nClassical_Snake dies if it touches itself, however.\nClassic snake is Cyan with thin red lengthwise stripes.\n\nSnake type 3 is called FSnake or Fast Snake. FSnake's body and head can pass over the body of any other kind of snake\nand of other FSnakes. However, it loses in head-butts: it dies. If FSnake collides with FSnake, there is no damage,\nthe snakes are automatically directed in different directions. These are like gopher snakes.\nFSnake is black with thin gold lengthwise stripes.\n\nSnake type 4 is called Friendly_Snake. This is a semantic for server terms, you cannot spawn as this.\nBasically, all snake types get bigger as they rise in rank and eat more food and get longer. A snake who is\n3+ ranks below you will appear to be friendly_snake, you won't be able to hurt them. They will all appear white.\nIf they're halfway to being only two ranks below you, however, their head will begin to flash in their colors.\nOnce they're two ranks below you or higher, normal rules apply for any snake type but Evolving_Snake.\nSnakes who are 3 ranks or more above you will appear normal, but will have a black outline indicating their\nimmunity to you.\n\nSnake type 5 is called Buried Snake. Also a semantic, buried snake is used to display snakes on lower levels of the\ngameboard in increasingly transparent and dark renders on the underside of the tiles. All users see snakes in the level\nbelow and above them, adjusted for size, and in greytone as Buried_Snake.\n\nSnake type 6 is called AI Snake. AI snakes are randomly inserted into levels. They are non-aggressive and have collision\navoidance. AI snakes just try to eat food on their game_level. They die if their head touches a player's body, but\nplayers die if their heads touch the AI_Snake's body. Snake_3 however is immune to this as it does not bite ,and will\nalso not kill a AI_snake if the AI_Snake touches the player. AI Snakes do not die from hitting a wall, as they will\nAutomatically turn around. If The AI_snake touches itself it will shrink and lose segments of it's body, turning them\ninto meat on the tiles, until the snake can move.\n\nSemantically, there are 6 types of snake. Glyph wise, there are 8.\nESnake1,2,3, CSnake, FSnake, FrSnake, BSnake, AISnake.\nEach needs a glyph for head, body, and tail.\n\nThe board rules:\nThe game board consists of Hexagonal tiles, a grid 500x500. THe edge of the grid will be\ncovered in ROCK_WALL(inpenetrable). Higher game levels will also have some ROCK_WALL scattered in the game world.\nThe board will be covered in MEDIUM_SOIL. Medium darkness soil.\nSome tiles will have FOOD on them, some will have SMALL_ROCK. Small rock acts as ROCK_WALL to everyone BUT\nCSNAKE, which can eat it as food.\nThe game also contains MEAT, which is pieces of snakes which were killed and are left behind, and is edible.\nThe game also contains SNAKE_TRAIL, which is like slime, and appears as darker, muddier earth.\n\nWhen the user spawns, they will see the map, and move around on the soil. There will be areas of soil that will slowly\nbecome darker as they level up. These are portals. When a player glides into a portal, their head will stick out the other side.\nIf their level is 3+ tiers above the current map level, the portal will not be re-enterable(rock_WALL), ie they wont be\nable to come back- they have to go through into the next lower level.\nThe portals are fixed openings visible on the next lower level, to other players, as a ROCK_WALL area,\nunless they are still a low enough level to go back in, in which case it will appear as a mound of leaves.\nHowever, if they reach a higher tier, the rock wall will appear(IE they cannot go back).\nIf a player going through a portal is attacked(touched) by a player on the other side, they can only attack\nthe body parts on that side, if on the lower(higher) map level. If on the higher(lower tier) map level that \nthe user is descending from, they can attack the body parts outside the portal but the ones inside the portal\ntiles will appear grey(un-attackable).\n\nAll snakes leave behind a snake_TRAIL that is one tile longer for every tier they have grown, ie, it lasts\na little longer before evaporating. This slows down other snakes trying to cross their path.\nThis snake trail begins as just one tile.  if more than one snakes leave trails in a given tile, that tile\nwill only respect the last time it was crossed IE the game has a cooldown for each tile and when\na snake's tail crosses a tile, the game is told to ""reset"" the DRY_OUT for that tile according to the rank\nof the snake: the higher the snake, the longer(in game ticks) before it turns back to soil.\nThis is in multiples of three seconds. For example :  snakes tier 2 set tiles to 6 seconds.\nSnake trails slow snakes crossing them by 20% except FSNAKES which move only 10% slower and CSnakes which are halved.\nTrails are not left inside portals.\n\nWhen snakes die or are killed, the position of their body(not tail or head segments) is replaced by segments of meat,\nunless they are AI_Snakes. AI_snake bodies turn into food and their heads into SMALL_ROCKS(wherever they died).\n\nIf a player dies while within a portal, all meat objects formed within the portal are destroyed(meat and rocks are not left within portals).\n\nFood(apples etc) is worth 100 points, small_rocks(food for Csnakes) are worth 250, and meat is worth 250.\n\nGame world tiles, glyph wise, are:\n\nRWALL, SROCK, DSOIL,MSOIL,LEAFSOIL, FOOD,MEAT.\n\nEach game level contains two 8x8 portals.\nFood is spawned on the level in random places, 5 pieces of food every minute, until there are 50 pieces.\n10 small rocks are spawned on the level in random places. New food is not added until consumed.\nfood expires and is destroyed in 5 minutes.\nOld rocks don't expire, and more rocks are added, 1 per minute, until there are 50 on the map.\n\nSpeed of snakes:\nEsnakes and CSnakes move 2 tiles per second, and can accelerate to 4.\nFSnakes move at 3 and can boost to 5.\nAISnakes move at 2 tiles per second.\n\nPlayer snakes can slow down by holding Space to 1 tile per second.\nPlayers can accelerate their mass with a control key. While accelerated,\nthey move faster but consume their bodies. Every body segment of a snake\nis worth 100 points up to the first 10 segments, 200 points to 20, 300 to 30, etc,\ntill 500 points for the last 10 to 50. Beyond 50 tiles of body, they do not grow longer\nbut fatter. Their body grows 10% in size for every 1000 additional point they consume\nto 10,000 points. The maximum snake size is 25,000 points. Beyond that snakes do not\ngrow, only the player receives more points.\n\nSnakes use up their body mass proportionally with how big they are, using more\nwhen they are bigger and less when they are smaller. The biggest snakes, if they\nuse up their entire body, can move 24 tiles before no longer boosting.\nWhen a snake boosts, their body is left behind as FOOD.\n\nAISNAKES don't grow in length, only fatness, 10% for 10 food up to 100 food.\nIf it reaches 100% fatness the head and tail will turn to meat instead of rocks.\n\nPlayer heads and tails don't produce meat when the snake dies, only the body segments.\nPlayers who die on the first level only provide food, their body doesnt turn to meat.\n\nNotes:\nWhen I wrote that your snake will always appear to be red, I meant that only for\nthe ESnake type. Other snake types are to appear, even if the player, as that snake type.\n\n"
6gh6gy,RTS mixed with first person shooter auth a twist...,"So I know a lot of people probably have thought of the idea where it's like a real time strategy game, but you can take control on individual units and play as them. I have an idea similar to this. Instead of being able to swap between the two genres mid game, one team will be characters in a first person shooter type game, think Overwatch heros that are picked before the match starts and have set weapons and abilities. The other ""team"" is actually just one guy directing AI, and spending points to call in different ones. Since the AI would be weaker than the players, you'd have to scout which heros they are and think of a combo of mobs that counters their specialty. It would basically function kind of like a Horde/Firefight, but there is another player actually spawning and directing the mobs. The FPS players last as long as they can, and each round, the RTS player gets more points to select his wave each round."
6ggo7z,AAA not doable?,"I'm not a game dev vet or anything, I just have noticed a lot of people saying that ""you can't make that game because that's AAA studio type of games. And so I ask this, most of the time a good indie game takes about 2-3 years right? What would happen if someone spent like 10 years on a game? Would it be able to be AAA title quality? Could someone do that? "

6gcx5y,Island of Empires (Part 2 of 2),"(this was written in notes on my iphone, and i have auto-capitalization off, so sorry for the lack of such) illnesses and infections can be contracted, and wounds must be treated in order to keep them safe. sick players may wait for it to pass if it's a less serious sickness, or if it's a serious sickness, they can go to the kingdom's doctor. crossbows are the top tier ranged weapon, and steel swords are the top tier melee. horses can be armored, and players must find and domesticate them earlier in the game. the server wipes every month. in-game sunlight hours are 2 hours long, and night is an hour and a half. letters can be sent, and a role doesn't need to be filled to deliver them. once a letter is placed in a mailbox, the letter will be sent to the specified player's mailbox or to the specified mailbox. each player is assigned a mailbox number at the start of the game, and letters can be sent from the start of the game, as long as there are mailboxes. players can dig underground, but supports must be made in order for it to hold up. bridges can be created, and lakes and rivers are used for fishing and water sources. you may also fish in the ocean, but you may not use it as drinking water. mountains are usually hard to inhabit, but if the work is put in, it can be done. currency is gold, and players are automatically paid every two in-game nights, as long as they have a job, and any profits made from other players by selling goods and services are added on as bonus. automatic gold payment is assigned to players by the kingdom, as they must have an actual business. amount of gold payment is assigned by the kingdom as well, and depends on the job type and labor involved. not all towns become kingdoms, and many will stay small. they are located wherever, and are run by the people that inhabit them.\n"
6gcviy,Island of Empires (Part 1 of 2),"(this was written in notes on my iphone, and i have auto-capitalization off so sorry for the lack of such.)game starts out on a boat. you can be alone, or in a starter group of up to 10. the first stage of the game is to get to the mainland. won't take that long, hour and a half at the most. the island is twice the size of a rust island, and is randomly generated. next, you need to unload your supplies from your ship and send out scouts or go scout out as yourself, if so desired. once you have found a place to settle and expand at, transport your supplies over and start clearing the area as needed of trees, rocks, etc. wood from trees and rocks can be harvested and kept. start building, however desired, or however your supplies enable you to. players should be wary of wolves and bears, however they are not common. the won't attack unless provoked, or if a player gets too close. they are afraid of players. deers can be hunted and eaten, as well as fish. players can assign themselves roles, non-officially, but all roles must be filled in order for a town to function properly. roles will be like blacksmiths, hunters, builders, and shopkeepers. players that fill these roles, other than shopkeepers, can sell or trade their goods. solo players may join towns, and hire builders or whomever they require to make a home. there will eventually become rulers of a town, which is progressing toward a small kingdom. the ruler(s) is selected by popular vote or by force. players from the start of the game will be punished for killing without warrant, and will receive a stat damage by doing so, (stamina, hunger, mental health). mental health is affected the most, because as more people are killed, mental health of the killer will deteriorate, resulting in blurry/distorted vision, and weakness (less melee damage, worsened accuracy). however, this only happens if other players that are attacked and killed by you file a report at the death screen on how and why you were killed. the time of killing also is taken into account, and the admin reviews this. the admin takes into account when wars occur, and the location of the killing is also taken into account. the admin may also talk to the killer for more information if needed. along the lines of being killed, you may not respawn on the same island until it has been wiped, however new players may. in game voice chat is used, and is just like in real life, i.e. the farther away, the quieter. as kingdoms grow, more roles must be filled, like miners and knights/guards, farmers, etc. day/night cycles are as follows: the more people that go to bed in sleeping bags, beds, or the ground, will be like a vote towards skipping night. if more players choose to stay up, then night will commence. the vote occurs across the whole island. the game's technology may not progress beyond medieval times, so that means no guns, explosives, or electricity. animals are the only mode of transport. kingdoms can go to war with each other, and must fight each other by use of troops. types of troops may consist of knights, horsemen, archers, etc. roads are created by more players traveling on them. thieves are a possible role as a solo player, or a skyrim type thieves guild can be created. thieves can take whatever they please as long as they have access to it, and pick pocketing is a possibility. if caught by a player, they can be reported to the kingdom and will be punished if desired, or let free if they are ruled as such. building system will be as follows: rust type rules, however less limitations and takes longer than instantly to build. circular buildings can be built, and walls are thick. most player houses are made of wood, and castles are made of stone. metal is only used for small things, like tools, armor, and small accessories such as lanterns. this is more of a minimalist hardcore game, with not much of a HUD, and is meant to be roleplayed more. players can be punished and killed for toxicity. depending on kingdoms rules and laws, players can be enslaved and rulers can have full control if they are allowed to by other players. this can be stopped by the other players killing the ruler(s)."

Each team of spies/agents will have abilities like cloaks, smoke bombs, grapple hooks (if the level calls for them) and a bunch of other stuff. It'll be a shooter (not sure if 1st or 3rd person) "

6ju16s,Bloodborne II: Reawakening,"Bloodborne 2: Reawakening \n\nI must note than I am aware no plans are currently in motion for FromSoftware to make a sequel to Bloodborne. This is just an idea that’s been bouncing around my brain cage for a while because I’m a huge fan of the game. \n\nAfter the Nightmare released in Yharnam was defeated by the Nightmare Hunter, remaining Hunters gathered where the Nightmare Hunter originated from and began a new guild of Hunters trained in new techniques devised from improved weaponry, their own developing expertise with beasts, and advancements in technology brought about by the better understanding of electricity and its uses. Out of this new understanding of electricity came various experiments into its potential. Some experiments are simply aesthetic while others are of a darker, much more terrifying variant. \n\nOut of the new Hunters’ Guild came a gathering of scientists devoted to medical practices many believed too similar the usage of blood in Yharnam which brought about the horrific deformations of its citizens and the Nightmare itself. The scientists continued on with their experiments, in spite of protests from both the Hunters and locals citizens, believing that their work could improve the human condition by understanding the body and mind, reanimate the dead, and even create life. While they did become more aware of how electricity flows through the human body, affecting mind and muscle alike, their delving into the creation of life only brought about grotesque and horrible creatures the likes of which could not be found even in the Nightmare. So the experiments stopped—or so they thought. \n\nA cult of scientists abandoned the Hunters’ Guild and continued their work in secret, kidnapping, maiming, murdering, whatever they could to test their newfound knowledge. \n\nNot long after this cult began their work, Hunters began awakening in the Dream again. The Nightmare Hunter having defeated the evil lingering over Gehrman, the First Hunter, they thought the Dream lost forever. Upon reawakening in the Dream they discover the Workshop rebuilt and the Doll old and tattered, even seeming distant and inattentive.\n\nWhy are the Hunters suddenly finding themselves in the Hunters’ Dream again? Why is the Doll so different now than it was before despite everything else seeming as it was? Could this be linked to the Cult’s experiments? \n\nI had thought that maybe Bloodborne 2 could be more about vampires, delving deeper into the Cainhurst story but I think Vampires have been done to death at this point so I decided to keep in with the “horror” theme that Bloodborne had, the Lovecraftian and classic movie-monster feel of people turning into Werewolves and that sort but instead trying for a Frankenstein’s Monster/Dawn of the Dead theme.  Having hordes of plagued villagers coming at the player, exploring terrible laboratories where terrifying experiments have gone awry and that kind of thing. \n\nThe setting would be only slightly different from Bloodborne(and even Dark Souls has some of these same variants in all three games) where it wouldn’t keep to this safe-zone of closed-in abandoned cities, ruins, creepy forests, and cliff-side areas but making the game feel more open and natural by having farmland-themed areas and creepier areas like maybe a carnival that was attacked by one of the Cult’s experiments. Something like that. I just feel like FromSoftware kind of keeps to the same basic areas over and over again which never cease to be aesthetically pleasing or boring to explore but I just feel like there are other areas we could have in the games.\n\nNote about the “Nightmare Hunter”: (Spoiler about the third ending to Bloodborne)\n\nThis “Nightmare Hunter” is so-named by the Hunters after they stopped awakening in the Dream. Since Hunters only kept awakening in the dream after their deaths because of the Moon Presence they would assume that ONE of the hunters did in fact defeat whatever it was(they would have had no idea since only one of them could collect the umbilical cords) keeping the Dream going. So they named this unknown hunter the Nightmare Hunter and assume that he/she either died or is still alive somewhere. They have no idea that in defeating the Moon Presence the hunter that defeated the Moon Presence achieved transcendence and became a Celestial God, which is the reason why the Doll in the Dream now is closed-in and unfriendly, she’s been driven mad by the growing god she hid beneath the rebuilt workshop which would be the final boss.\nHunters would no longer be gathering Blood Echoes anymore but rather Notoriety Points going towards their “contract”(this being the contract you make when creating a character) which is dropped when the player dies and retrieved in the same way Blood Echoes were.\n\nHunters would be using Blood Healing still but a safer, more refined version. This new version of Blood Healing comes from individual hunters using their own blood placed into vials and infused with medication to achieve the same level of blood healing as before. Hunters would still have to buy more vials/find them when running low.\n\nWhat’s the different between the Hunters’ Guild and the Hunters’ Dream?\n\nThe Hunters’ Dream and the Hunters’ Guild are two separate areas, one focusing on the physical “wakening” working and the other the corporeal. The Hunters’ Dream acts differently in Bloodborne 2 in that the player must be killed by a boss in order to be taken to the dream, the player need not go there unless to memorize runes, spend insight, or PvP other players in the graveyard. After the first initial death to a boss the player may go to the dream freely from a lamp. The Hunters’ Guild is where the player levels up, upgrades weapons, purchases equipment and items, and stores equipment and items. When interacting with a lamp the player has the choice of going to the Dream or to a lamp found outside the guild.\nAnother interesting addition to I thought of is active co-op. Instead of having to set your summon sign down or set a password for a specific player(which would still be available options) the player may sign their name to another hunter’s contract. How this differs is that if a player chooses to do this they may only play co-op with that specific player without having to summon. Both would simply share a save file, equipment, and Notoriety Points. They may play without that player on that same save file but the difficulty scaling would be set as if there were two players(monsters have more health, do more damage). This would only be doable before defeating the first boss and not after. "
6jtbsd,A flowchart for enemies in a stealth game - use it however you like!,
6jrn4i,1920s Gangster game set in the southern US,"I was listening to Appalachian bluegrass and I had this great idea, set a GTA style free-roam game in the Great Depression era south. The love child of the movies ""Lawless"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". Moonshiners and bank robbers, white supremacists and sharecroppers, poor mountain people of Appalachia and the rich industrialist and bankers of Birmingham and Atlanta. Im the kind of person who sees images when I listen to music and thats what I got. A dusty game, very much like Fallout: New Vegas, but instead of a nuclear war it's the Dust Bowl, Prohibition, and the Great Depression all in one. On your way to Itta Bena, Mississippi, down a long dirt road, you encounter chain gangs smashing rocks and farmers in their fields. Racist politicians campaign for office while their constituents are living in segregation. It would be create quite a bit of controversy to portray the time period accurately but I think the protagonist should be African-American to add more difficulties and encounters in an effort to show the struggles of segregation and prejudice. Maybe a Chicago gangster decides to flee the law and takes up hiding in New Orleans. He gets arrested and his cell mate is the protagonist. Together they break out and the story goes on from there. Game mechanics are far outside my scope and if there is already a game like this then I would very much like to know about it."
6jqtcg,Ninja 1v1 Mission Game,"  Basically, the backstory is that two rival ninjas/organizations have the same goal if infiltrating and taking over the government, but they want themselves to win. Both of them want to be the next rulers, but they have different ideals. OR WHATEVER, the story is just a set up to have two ninjas fighting each other.\n\n  So each mission/round has an objective such as killing an important political figure, stealing government records, or something. Both ninjas are trying to either be faster than the other, kill the other ninja, or ruin the others mission in some way while also completing theirs.\n\n  The main skills of the ninjas are their stealth, speed, and weapon of choice. Really the highlight of the game is having an epic showdown between ninjas."
6jqo1u,Fun But edgy game idea.,"I have an idea for a game. The game would be online multiplayer. One player is a mass shooter, and the other players in the lobby are potential victims. The goal of the shooter is to kill all the players, but here's the catch:\n\nThere are several AI that the players can use as fodder and blend in with. There are also several ways the players can win. Either they find phones and contact the police and survive until a timer is up. Or one player is awarded a weapon to fight back, or they can escape. I guess you could say the game has similar threads as murder mystery, and Evolve. Please elaborate on this thread.\n\nEdit: I also think it would be fun to have different character designs based on different locations. (I.e. School, airport, movie theater.)"

6jk2tn,An MMO about hitchhiking,"Okay this might seem pretty stupid at first, but bear with me:\n\nThis game would take place in a very large map with plenty of small towns in the center and a few major cities along the edges. It would also have very extensive roads. Every session would have from 75 to 100 players and last up to 3 hours. All players will spawn around the center of the map, well away from each city, with one of the large cities being their destination. Most players will spawn with money and no car, but others will spawn with a car, but no money. The map would be so extensive that it would take too long for a single person to walk from the center of the map to a city, so they would have to depend on someone with a car to pick them up and drive them to their destination. The drivers would need the hitchhikers for their money, to pay for maintanence of the car, and also food for their passengers. Simutaniously, the hitchhikers would need the drivers, so that they can get to their destination. The goal of this game is to be social, without being intimidating, as a lot of mmos are. The car rides will be long, and you'll have nothing to do but to talk with the other passengers or your driver. Interaction would be essential as you would have to share the money, and the ride, and also communicate eachothers needs. The way I imagine it is sort of like a reverse PUBG, where instead of killing everyone on sight on a massive map, you're helping everyone on sight on an even bigger map than PUBG's. Also a tiny bit like Euro Truck simulator, where the majority of your time will be spent in the car, on a relaxing drive with friendly strangers."

6jfls4,JRPG - PVP,Not sure if its already out there. But here goes:\n\nI am heavily influenced by final fantasy games. But their games usually are very story driven and does not really have PVP elements to it. I know Dissidia is developed towards this concept but its not the classic turn-based. Newer final fantasy games battle system are more action based which is good and developed for the modern era. \n\n\nI was thinking maybe using Final Fantasy X Battle System as a start. It will be a 3 v 3 battle game. The game will be focusing on the PVP elements. Like choosing characters for their party or banning them. \nI know there are alot turn based RPG games out there but I think it should be more simple. Focusing on the battle only instead of move around boxes/squares like those tactical RPG.\n\n\nMaybe I just too drunk. 
6jf3bo,Party multiplayer game to play on Smart TV and mobile phones simultaneously,"Hi guys,\nThe title of this sub says ""for games you'll never make"", so... don't you mind if I ask you about a game which I actually can make?\n\nSo my idea is to make a simple yet fun game platform for ""drunk friend parties"". Does it make any sense? xD \n\nOk, let me describe the concept. Core idea is to use Smart TV (very many people has one nowaday) and mobile phones of people around. To start a game, you just open website on the TV, using its browser. Your TV is now the host. It shows URL and code (room number) for clients. Each of your friends who wanna join the game just take their phones and open that URL in mobile browsers. \n\nNow I'll try to say the same again but using example. Let's say, Poker. \n\nSo you and your friends are chilling in the room in your house. You are all sitting on the couch, next to Smart TV. And you want to play some Poker. \n\nYou open browser on TV and navigate to game.example.com. TV opens the site. It appears like a green table with a big number in middle. Now each player opens the same site on their phone, taps ""Join"" and enters number from the TV. When player is joined, he also appears next to the table on the TV screen. When players receive cards from dealer, they see their cards on their phones only. But public cards (flop) are displayed on TV screen. Players also use a phone to make game moves (""bet"", ""raise"", etc).\n\nI hope you get the idea. Technically, this is a regular multiplayer game, but the key feature is ""nothing to install"". No apps, no console. Just TV (or any other big screen to share with others) and your phone as a controller. Fast, cheap and simple.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'd like to get any feedback to know if this idea is worth to develop"

6jc41v,Card-Based City Management Game,"Hello everyone!\n\nI'm currently working on a mobile game with a friend of mine that involves building a small town and turning it into an empire. That is the basic idea for now. All this would be done using cards.\n\nOur goal is to stay away from Heartstone. The reason I say that is because one of the issues we ran through is the fact that there are only so many buildings a player could build. Lack of options of buildings wouldn't make sense in a card-based game, because it requires variety. What would be the purpose of those buildings anyway? Sure, some will produce resources, but the more we worked on it the more we started moving towards building units. In a card-based game having a lot of units makes sense (think of Magic: The Gathering). Opening card packs would offer the player a chance of getting new cards every time essentially. \n\nSo our goal for now is to move back and work in a robust system and stay away from battle units. To do so, we are currently working on improving other areas of the game sure as religion, happiness, and other features. \n\nDo you guys have any opinions on that? \n\nOur blog is kind of new, but we will be posting our ideas and progress over there in case anyone is interested.  https://epickast.wordpress.com/\nPS. I hope I'm not breaking any rule. My apologies if I did.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nJeff"
6jaqvl,A game inspired by Knights of Sidonia.,"It would be a third person action adventure game with light horror elements.\n\nThe Earth was destroyed by a shapeshifter alien species called Gauna. The remains of human beings dispersed in several ships that left the Solar System. One of them is the Sidonia, that has been able to withstand until now the attacks of the Gauna. The best weapon of Sidonia is Tsumugi Shiraui, a hybrid between Gauna and human being: she has a human psyche with a gauna body. We handled Tsumugi Shiraui, fighting the Gauna as we relate to the human beings of Sidonia. \n\nTsumugi can fly at supersonic speed, she is very resistant, has great regenerative habilities, could shoot particle beams, could dodge projectiles, has melee attacks, enhanced perception about Gaunas, and alter her own body to create new armor and weapons, but has limited energy reserves. The combat would be in flight and we would have to keep in mind that the enemy could attack us in any direction. The missions would be of exploration and combat in space, in atmospheres of planets and near stars. Tsumugi would fight alongside humans mounted on fliyng mechs but there would also be solo missions. \n\nThe Gauna are shapeshifters and possess enormous regenerative capacities, having two parts: placenta and core. Placenta covers the core and Gauna only disappear if its core touches a material called kabizashi of origin Gauna also or it is shot with the rare gravitic weapons; otherwise Gauna self regenerates. Kabizashi is scarce since Sidonia is unable to replicate it, so Kabizashi is used primarily for melee weapons while projectile weapons only serve to expose the Gauna core.  Tsumugi has kabizashi claws. A justification of the primacy of melee weapons in an era of space.\n\nSeveral types of Gauna would have, which raises various strategies. Gaunas with the appearance of giant humans, invisible by normal light, Gaunas that imitate human mechs or even ourselves, emulating experimental weapons like the gravitic beam emitter...\n\nAmong the missions we would handle Tsumugi without her combat mode, talking with her battle companions and with slight touches of humor to lighten the confrontations."
6j86hv,Toy Based Resource/Crafting Game.,"No I don't mean something like Skylanders when I say ""toy based"".\n\nSo imagine one of those games where you start off with nothing. You collect natural resources, you craft them, and you slowly build bigger and better things. The most obvious example would be Minecraft but without the destroying and placing blocks. It would probably also work better in an isometric style view.\n\nWhat makes it different is instead of resources like wood or berries you're collecting toy like resources. The example I thought of would be a tree that instead of being made of wood is made of plastic, and instead of growing fruit it grows nerf berries. The plastic could be built into a nerf gun and the berries could be cooked into nerf bullets.\n\nNot even limited to toys, the whole game could go for some kind of childlike aesthetic. Imagine growing lollipop farms and cooking lollipop pies in an easy bake oven.\n\nIts a silly idea sure, but it sounds fun too (at least to me). Anyone got more ideas for natural resources or craftable items?  "

6j08vn,Need some RPG class ideas?,"Here's a list of a few ideas for unique RPG classes I had in mind. They will have only brief descriptions to give you an idea what the actual class is for, so you can add your own ideas into them for your games:\n\nGuardian - A nice replacement for the generic warrior or knight. 'Guardian' sounds like there could be more involved than just chopping with swords and axes.\n\nSeeker - Sounds like an exploration type of class. Rarely ever seen in RPG's though.\n\nSurvivor - A more challenging class, mostly relying on primitive weaponry. Could have a potential luck-boost as well. \n\nDruid - This one is fairly known by now, and I don't think there's much to be said about this class.\n\nPuppeteer - Being able to control creatures and objects or simply having an entire army of fighting dolls. That's what makes a Puppeteer.\n\nMastermind/Operative - Mostly based around planning and organization. Good for the tactician.\n\nDiabolist - Sounds evil, doesn't it? Making fire and boom boom is the standard for the Diabolist. \n\nInventor - Why not just build things yourself to make fights more epic and enjoyable? Creating catapults, wooden contraptions and robots should be no problem for the Inventor.\n\nSupervillain - Pure evil. That's all you need to know. I'm sure you have your own ideas and interpretation of a 'Supervillain'.\n\nMorphling - Transforming into different creatures isn't that new in RPG's, but why no give this ability it's own class with a few extras?\n\nGiant - A large golem or monster would deserve that title. Fighting sure must be fun.\n\nVirus - Probably a 100% experimental class, with weird stats and abilities. \n\nExorcist - Sounds effective against ghosts, ghouls or anything in correlation with it. Enough said.\n\nArtillery - WEAPONS WEAPONS WEAPONS WEAPONS WEAPONS. The biggest loadout of them has the Artillery. \n\nBounty Hunter - It's hard to find the right words for it. Think about a rogue mixed with a gun based class and you get the Bounty Hunter. \n\nOracle - Cooler than a mage. Not relying on strength while being in fights. The Oracle has it's own methods of winning. \n\nPioneer - Hard to describe what a Pioneer should be doing in an RPG, since they differ greatly from game to game. You probably have to think a bit about that class. \n\nEngineer - Who doesn't know the Engineer? Not too often seen in games. Obviously fighting with machines to win. \n\nI hope this post helped you in some way or at least gave you some inspiration. Hava a nice day. "

6ivyaa,The gameplay of the recent X-Com games could translate very well into the Gears Of War universe. Or is that just me?,
6ivv21,A Modern City Skyrim-esque RPG,I noticed that a majority of open world games that are set in the modern day have very little rpg mechanics such as choices or a customizable character (completely customizable not just hair styles)\n\nI would be interested in a game that provided meaningful sidequests and factions allowing choices and creation of your own character set in a GTA style city with driving and shooting\n\nEdit: A word
6iv5aj,"A drone game, set in our world today",I would absolutely love to see a game from the perspective of a drone operator. Make it a flight sim but also combine it with possibly also playing on the ground as the enemy. Idek I just want a fun drone game
6iuy8e,A story-heavy game that changes itself a year after playing.,"This is an idea I came up with today that I feel could be a very unique mechanic, however might take quite a long time to make.  I could see myself making something like this one day, however for now I'd like to share it here and see what everyone thinks.\n\nSo, do you have a particular game that you enjoy so much that you maybe play it once a year or so?  I have a few of those, and one thing I always enjoy about those sorts of games is that if designed right, I find myself discovering new things about that particular game years after I originally play it.  I love that feeling, but what if we were to turn that into the gameplay mechanic itself?\n\nWhat type of game it is doesn't matter, although for the time being I'm thinking some sort of murder mystery game with a heavy emphasis on story would work best.  The game itself is alright.  You play through it, and then you put it down for a while.  However like a good book, you might pick it back up again to play it from the very beginning.  And here's where the magic happens.\n\nIn this game, if you have a completed save file, and have not played the game for a year, and start a new save game, the game itself will start to act strange.  Things will change.  The changes in the beginning would start small.  Maybe one of the supporting character's name would be a single letter off.  Or perhaps a character is wearing a blue necklace now, whereas last year they were wearing a red one.\n\nAs you get farther in however, bigger and bigger changes will start to take effect.  Clues to solve the mystery would be completely different from last time, and people who were persons of interest in the last playthrough are mere NPCs now.  After a while, the player will ideally start to wonder if they're just remember parts of the game wrong.  I mean, the last they played was a year ago, who knows?\n\nAnd that's the idea right there.  A game that changes itself without telling you in an attempt to confuse you when you replay it.  Perhaps later elements of metafiction could get involved somehow and completely change the story into something more surreal.\n\nThere are two major problems I can see with this idea off the top of my head.  The first is the fact that this assumes the player will want to replay the game again at some point.  That can be very difficult to predict.  The second is datamining.  I can easily see a couple people start to datamine the game and uncover this deep secret and ruin it for everyone.  That would be disastrous.\n\nBut imagine this sort of thing happening to you and your favorite games.  You decide to play something for old time's sake, only to discover that the game is starting to act sentient to the fact that this isn't your first time playing through.  And the best part is, this feature would not be advertised at all.  It would be a hidden feature specifically meant to surprise and maybe even scare people who want to replay it.\n\nDoes this sound interesting at all?"
6iunl3,Need some help with creating element combinations,"Hey guys, been a lurker here for a while, finally decided to post with a request. I'm having trouble coming up with interesting combination pairs from a list of 10 elements.

6ithli,2d fighting game that simulates a larger-scale battle than 1v1,"Just thought of this last night.\n\nYou know in nidhogg the idea is to get all the way to the end; not necessarily to kill your opponent, but to best them enough times in succession? Imagine a more traditional 2d fighting game with this mechanic. No, you wouldn't be able to run right past them, but it would retain the idea of just hitting the other person once to get by.\n\nI never played this, but I'm pretty sure [Deadliest Warrior: The Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_Warrior:_The_Game) was like what I'm describing. Characters have a bunch of animations and moves, and when they land an axe to someone's neck, the person feels it (they friggin die). So that body drops to the background and the person who got the kill can move forward. Player 2 (who died) now gets another character, walking from offscreen, who joins the fight.\n\nSo basically if you kill the other player, you get to move towards your goal. \n\nAh I'm not sure what else to explain, I feel like that's the gist of it. Could be pretty cool, right? I think it would definitely pay to have some brutal animations for killing characters; although it might suffer from having a slow pace.  "
6irusp,Sacrificing-game application,"I think especially in some games that implemented medieval or premedieval society, a form of sacrifice would be a nice feature, sacrifice a small rabbit to your preffered deity and you get a small buff or maybe a little heal, go to a temple and sacrifice an Ox and get a godly token of sorts that you can in time of need exchange/activate, for some buff, or maybe few seconds lasting god mode. "
6mabmn,SpeedGun,"The core of SpeedGun is a 90's style FPS that requires a speed run (hence the punny name). I see it as a FPS roguelite, with each run unlocking new weapons and new movement abilities. Movement abilities allow the player to go faster, or even skip entire sections, while weapons allow the player to more easily dispatch the monsters and bosses in their way.\n\nThere are two ways the player can die: health and time. Due to their permadeath mechanics, most roguelites encourage the player to be protective of their health. Not so in SpeedGun. Health pickups are scattered around the level, allowing them to stay alive as long as they keep moving and dodge attacks. Time is the far more major aspect. Each run has a brutally short ticking clock, to win the player must defeat the final boss before it runs out. The timer forces the player to keep moving. There's no time to hang back and pick off enemies, no time to cower behind cover.\n\nTime could also be a cornerstone of the story. A groundhog's day style framing device would work well, and help explain why the player can do subsequent runs. Something like: some evil alien is going to destroy the world in 6 minutes, and it's up to you to save it. Thankfully a brilliant scientist has developed a time machine, which will bring you back in time the moment before you die."
6ma31a,Stealth/Action/Monster/Rogue-Like/80s,"Ok so picture this, a game that goes through the life cycle of a Kaiju. And, it's a roguelike.\n\nYou start off as this small maybe cat sized alien creature that's crashed to earth in a meteor, outside of a small town. At this stage the gameplay is composed mostly of exploring the wooded area looking for small animals to eat, but you'll also have to utilize stealth to avoid hiking humans, and larger predatory animals. The stages last as long as it takes for you to gather enough nutrients to metamorphose into the next stage. \n\nIf you get eaten, or caught by the humans, and by caught I mean when a regular human sees you they run, call the authorities, and the woods get flooded with hazmat dudes actively looking for you, and they actually have to physically catch you and maybe even then you'll get quick time events ala Shadow Mordor that let you bite the shit out of them and escape or something, but if you don't escape, you can always start over as a completely different monster and see if their abilities are more your thing.\n\nIf you do escape and live on to cocoon you have to find a place that's appropriate for the species of Kaiju you've selected, maybe they need a cold dark sewer, or a dry run down empty house, you get the idea. It's at this stage you become lethal to humans and they now become your primary food source, you can still go to the woods but there not as big and when you make a kill you have to bring it back to your den, where you cocooned and that's never very close to the woods, so instead you now have access to the small town. Stealth takes on an even bigger role in this stage, but also more strategy as you'll have to plan your attacks if you want to go unnoticed for as long as possible, because again like the first stage when the citizens see you they freak the fuck out. Only now sometimes random people will grab nearby guns (it's a country town in the US) and try to kill you, and even if you escape them they call the hazmat guys who also bring soldiers who shoot on sight. After a few days (game time) if they haven't seen you they'll assume you've moved on and try to track you elsewhere. \n\nYou can kill humans anywhere, but eating them anywhere but your den will leave remains to be found by other citizens who will then be on high alert, they keep their kids inside and even send hunting parties out looking for the wild animal responsible and then again even if they don't kill you if they see you you've got to deal with the fuzz. If it's not clear yet stealth is really a key factor in this game. After you've eaten enough though you can cocoon again in a cave on the outskirts of town, things shake up a bit from here.\n\nStealth is still key, but due to the size increase you'll have to adapt utilize it differently. Also you have a choice at this point, you can A) go full on Tremors on the townspeople and their flimsy buildings, now earning money equal to cost in damages you cause to property and people. You also risk being overrun by the townspeople and dying while doing this so be careful. Then there's B) just continue on to the next destination sacrificing any extra points for safety. \n\nAt Stage 3 you move on to a remote area just outside of a national park, depending on your species somewhere in the area is a resource that once you get your claws/mandibles/tentacles/whatever on you immediately progress to the next stage. Almost always though what you need is either surrounded by humans or just difficult to get to. So what you need to do is figure out how to destroy their communications and isolate them. There's a logging operation, a lodge inside the park with people camping all around, and mine with a bunch of heavy machinery. At this point if you manage to destroy their contact with the outside world things get easier, but not by a lot. \n\nCause you see when I say this game takes place in the 80's what mean is it also takes place in kind like a universe that is an 80's monster movie. Yeah most people will run away in terror, but in the movies there's always those people that band together and do something absolutely ridiculous and kill the monster and save the day. If you're not careful some Kurt Russelian citizens might get the drop on and blow you up with mining explosives or rip your head off with logging equipment, oh or bulldoze you into a geyser or one of those acid pools, you get it, stay alert. If you do then their ridiculous attempts to stop you will feel all the more hilarious after you've eaten them and cleared a path to your resource. \n\nThis resource super charges you and sends you into your final form. A true Kaiju state, you range anywhere from 300-1000ft in height depending on species. You can stomp around the woods for a bit but you're encouraged to move on to the coastal city. The main goal of this is simply to destroy, cause as much damage as possible and earn yourself as much money in the process. Eventually you will be killed, if after two whole days none of the jets and tanks and helicopters have taken you down they the city gets nuked and you don't  survive that, but that's the point. After that you use the money you've earned to buy new abilities for different stages, different skins, entirely new species of Kaiju to play as, and maybe even new locations to progress through. \n\nThis game would be a single player game, and as dark as it all might seem I feel like it'd benefit from a humorous style.\n\n"
6m9quw,Is making an online deck building / tcg game a bad idea?,"I've historically really enjoyed real world TCGs - magic, Babylon 5, yu-gi-oh, etc - but have generally been underwhelmed with the online variety.\n\nI have, on many occasions, considered writing my own to try and correct this, but generally get put off by the idea of nobody else being interested.\n\nThe idea I would go for would be closer to the real world games, with more emphasis on the social aspects of trading cards, sharing decks, playing your friends regardless of comparative levels, and so on. I'd probably also go for much more traditional gameplay and avoid gimmicky rules that I've seen on quite a few apps.\n\nIs it a crazy idea to try this, or should I give it a go?"
6m77zl,Mad-Max FTL style,"I recently watched Mad Max: Fury Road and I was thinking it would be a cool game concept if someone made Mad Max game with the mechanics of FTL (roguelike RTS). \n\nInstead of spaceships, you could be commanding a War Party and upgrade/modify your vehicles as the game progresses. You would have to deploy fighters, charge weapons (flamethrowers, explosives, etc.) and make repairs on the go, with sparse stops for gas/bullets on the way. "
6m6y0u,"Fighting games that switches between mob fights and one-to-one (e.g. Tekken, King of Fighters, Street Fighters)","What was weird in latest Tekken game single player mode was how all the mooks were fighting the main character one by one.\n\nWhile it makes sense from a gameplay balance challenge perspective. It is a missed opportunity considering that each of the mooks are a pushover compared to the next actual fight.\n\nWhat if mooks are smarter and actually ganged up on the main player character? \n\nYou can still keep the 2D playing field. But incorporate mooks trying to rush the character from the side as well. What this allows for, is new moves involving smashing multiple mooks at the same time. Which will look pretty epic.\n\nCould also involve in the story, a trope savvy enemy boss, that in addition to fighting you, will also try to distract you with his mooks trying to sneak attack you on all sides.\n\nSo not only do you have to focus on fighting the main boss, you also have to avoid getting stunned by the weak mooks as well.\n\n--------------\n\nPros:\n\n* Additional mental challenge to player\n* Player have to multitask\n* Multi enemy attacks\n* Enemy appears smarter\n\nCons:\n\n* Gameplay balance challenge increases\n* Additional custom programming logic or scenes is required.\n* Scene either has to be two seperate modes of ""one to one"" or ""one vs many""\n* Or Scene has to incorporate logic to have a ""one vs many"" and ""one to one"" at the same time."
6m6x6g,Sci-fi GTA story idea,"Hi. I noticed that there is no good singleplayer open world scifi game. I love GTA and I think GTA love everybody, so I think that It would be cool to have scifi game in style of GTA or Scrapland if you know this game. I made a story idea for this game and I would like to hear you opinions and maybe more ideas. Game should be inspired by Star Wars and Valerian comic.\n\nThere will be two main protagonists. Woman and man. About woman, her name is Kes for now. Her parents die when somebody try to conquer galaxy, but federation stop them. Before that they destroy surface of one planet where she live. Some man found her stealing and gave her job on his ship, beacuse he know she has an adventurous character. They actually become pirates little bit (GTA style). But she was doing it to find her way and place in galaxy and she could see whole galaxy. But one day something will separate them. The second protagonist is a son of general or some other person in high status, his name is Raldy. His father wants for him to be a comander of the ship, but he is bad in it. One day they catch Kes and they will blackmail her to do some job for them. Raldy will join her, beacuse father wants it. They do some jobs and start travel galaxy on they own.\n\nEdit: I know it is little bit cliche, but I think it is good start. I have already some plot twist, but I do not want to spoil here everything."
6m5ys4,Daggerfall-esque Wild West Shooter,"I've got some Unity experience and was considering starting a project with this idea. Think Daggerfall, Doom, or Duke Nukem style graphics. It's a simple 3d world with 2d actors and animations. If you've played Daggerfall, it's not hard to imagine this idea.  \n\nIt's vague right now, but I'm trying to hammer out some concepts. I'm not willing to put a year into the development for this, so I'm staying away from much 3d modeling or 3d animating and large story/questline development. I'm thinking more of something like large open world of forests, deserts, and a few towns, light survival elements like navigation, eating/drinking/sleeping, and some kind of bounty-hunter story where you basically just hunt down NPCs through the world. Could also put together some kind of dungeon system somehow. Bandit cave hideouts or something that you can run into.  \n\nThe game would be less about story or character progression and more about exploration and surviving in the West. Maybe you're out of money and starving, so you have to break into a bar at night to get a drink before you dehydrate, maybe you have a contract to kill the sheriff of a town and all the deputies will be gunning for you once you shoot him, maybe your contract asks you to kill some famous politician that arrives by train once a week, so you have to coordinate your attack at that time and figure out the best time to kill him.  \n\nThink a gameworld around the size of half of Skyrim, which I think wouldn't be terribly difficult with the level of graphical detail I'm imagining.  \n\nI'm wondering if this sounds interesting to people and if anyone has some other ideas relating to this that they could bounce off me for inspiration.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5kIIfnqZ2I  \n\nHere's a short video of some landscapes from the Unity port of Daggerfall that a team has been working on. This is the look I'm going for."

In each platform you can have units you can move to invade other platforms and make progress on the map.\n\n* Platforms of a same staging post are not connected, so units can only move from a platform in a staging post to a platform in a *neighbor* staging post.\n\n* Staging posts can be rotated in angles of 90 degrees. You do so in order to be able to move the units in a platform to a platform in a neighbor staging post.\n\n* You and NPC take turns to play. In each turn you can make two movements: rotate a platform and move to or attack a neighbor platform. Then it's NPC's turn.\n\n* You have to choose the strategy of your movements carefully: when you rotate a platform during your turn, you may leave another platform in the staging post that has weaker units exposed for a stronger enemy in a neighbor platform to attack it.\n\n\n\nDo you like the idea? Yes? No? Why?\nAny feedback and ideas is much appreciated!\n\n\n\nImage:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/zDLTo\n\n\n"

6lxp94,Procedurally Generated Zombie Game,"I absolutely love splitscreen/multiplayer zombie games, especially the COD Nazi Zombies franchise. However, the one thing i think most of them lack is procedurally generated maps, meaning that everytime you play the game, the map is different! \nWhat inspired me to this idea was the game 'Necropolis', in which you run around a fantasy maze like map with friends, killing enemies with swords or magic powers. But every time you play Necropolis its a different experience because they randomize the rooms and certain map aspects. \nHow could this be done with a zombie game? Opening a door, not knowing whether it'll be a hallway, staircase, theater, etc. I feel like I'm onto something fun, but I just can't think of how a procedurally generated zombie map would work, with gameplay fast paced and similar to COD's nazi zombies. Does this game sound like it could take some feet? Or is it too complex? Because personally i can't get over the obstacle of WHAT to procedurally generate, and whether there would be enough randomization for the game to be fun. I love criticism! If anyone could help me move forward with this idea, or backwards if it's a dead one, I would appreciate it! I also had the idea of throwing in classes (mage, stealth/speed, warrior/heavy) to make it different than most zombie games. "
6lw2qp,Do you think anyone would want help me create a fully-fleshed out game concept?,"tl;dr: I have a cool story (that I don't really talk about here) and ideas for a game. Is that enough to get the ball rolling? \n\nSay someone came up with playstyles, mechanics, concept art, story that were really good. Would there be companies or freelance 3D modelers/coders out there willing to help? I've been assembling a lot of ideas for a fantasy MMO for years now and think I could really be on to something. My concept is heavily inspired by GoT, Dark Souls, Dark Siders and WoW. Gameplay wise, I wouldn't want it to be grind fest like a lot of MMOs, having repeatable content throughout the whole world. For PvP, I would want to encourage small groups of people to fight among each other in the world by incentivizing certain locations for wealth purposes (tuning numbers to where a giant clan won't just take over certain areas). Raids and dungeons would be WoW-esque would actually be difficult, only having 1 difficulty and always being rewarding. Random drops to me have always been grindy, so bosses could drop a currency where you can pick whatever* item you want from the boss after a certain amount of kills. I always loved the idea of reputations in RPGs too. I want to give players the chance to pick their own stories, starting with a few selections of vague backstories that they can build upon as they play. You could get yourself loved or hated by certain PvE factions who could offer you things valued by players. I think this would create a lot of interaction among players by having making trading partners (can't be loved by every faction). I also like the idea of having local auction houses for more world interaction. Certain items wouldn't be able to be put up at some or even any auction house (because of local laws and stuff). Maybe a black market auction house where everything is allowed would be difficult to get to? I'm also thinking a few races for 3 separate main ally factions that you can branch off from should you want to branch off from should you want to be a rebel, or something more verstatile where you could pick race, starting area/faction. \n\nI have plenty more ideas for this game, but I didn't sit down prepared to even write this. I was just going to ask a short question. Feel free to ask whatever because I have probably already thought about it's possible functionality in the game already in the past. "
6lvu9f,[Working prototype available] A game where you have a shield that reflects lasers shot by enemy turrets to progress through puzzles,"Hi,\n\nFor one of my classes I had to develop a working game and I thought that someone might like the idea and take it further than what I did.\n\nThe game has 2 levels, for the first one you have to reflect a laser to the button on top of where you spawn and for the second you have to reflect lasers 3 times to the ""EMP"" (the big box encased at the left of the level) to trigger the end.\n\nMove with arrow keys or WASD, move the mouth to change the direction of the shield and reflect the lasers, unzoom with the scroll wheel (important especially for the 2nd level).\n\nThe prototype was made in Unity 5 using C#.\n\nYou can **download the game** here (27Mb): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzL6uugDfALBMFBZeEF5S2RWX2c/view?usp=sharing\n\nAnd the source is available here: https://github.com/AntwaneB/cs485-reflection\n\nThe following will pretty much be our game design document simplified.\n\n**Name:** Reflection. Because it's a puzzle game so you have to think, and because the main feature is that you have a shield reflecting stuff...\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* The player evolves through different levels in an ancient unexplored temple filled with obstacles and puzzles to solve.\n* The player has a shield that is used to reflect shots (lasers) from the enemies.\n* He has to reflect on the proper angle to activate or destroy triggers and enemies.\n* The shield can absorb shots from the enemies to shoot back later in order to destroy them (acts as a gun that is loaded by the enemy’s shots).\n* There is EMP items that you can load by redirecting lasers at them, then pick them up, and then detonate them to deactivate enemies for a few seconds.\n* Enemies and triggers can have different colors and the player must reflect the right color to activate the corresponding triggers or destroy the corresponding enemies.\n* You can place alternative smaller shields that are either lasting a few seconds or indefinitely to reflect lasers a second time.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe player character is an explorer who was searching for this legendary temple. In the first\nroom of the temple he finds a conscious energy shield that talks to him and helps him through the temple. Through the temple between rooms he finds murals on the wall which the shield translates to him that reveal how the civilization that built the temple fell.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* The player character is a greedy explorer who is searching for wealth and power in the ancient ruins of the lost empire.\n* The shield acts as a comedic adviser to the player. The shield witnessed the death of his people and wants to prevent it from happening again.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nI don't really care but you can link to my GitHub I guess.\n\nFeel free to ask for any clarification.\n\nHope some of you are interested :)"
6lvfqa,F-Zero remake/overhaul,"A friend asked me last night what old game I'd like to see remade. Not just newer better graphics, but like complete rebuilt using today's available tools. After some thought, F-Zero could be a fucking awesome racer. Obviously it could look beautiful, but if a studio like Turn 10 (they make the Forza games) was able to do something with it, I can only imagine. Being able to hand pick all of your individual pieces to make your futuristic flying sports car and drive at insane speeds seems pretty cool. Essentially I just want a flashy but equally in-depth Forza game with F-Zero cars, locations, and physics. What do you guys think?"

6lp6st,Stuck between two ideas.,"Stuck between two ideas, forgive me if certain concepts are a little vague.\n\nThe first idea would be a ""Mech Dealer"". You would buy and sell Mech parts and entire mechs to the five fictional factions trying to get the upper hand on one another. You would also run a small ""restaurant"" and you would interact with different Npc's as they come in as patrons serving food and selling weapons to their respective faction if need be. When a faction goes up against another, the outcome would be decided by the level and attributes of the gear you've sold them. \n\nEach time a faction gains the upper hand you will be awarded a bonus for a period of time and you would also see a change in the types of patrons that visit your restaurant. \n\nHowever each time a faction loses it may trigger an ""event"" i.e someone from another faction stealing from your stockpile or selling the weapons to terrorists which would result in losses for you. \n\nAs game play goes on you would start to acquire more rarer parts that would in turn have their own benefits as well as disadvantages for the faction that have purchased it and in turn would have a positive/detrimental effect on you. \n\nOR\n\nA 3rd person ninja/stealth game that emphasizes on ""Shadow and light"" where the player would have to traverse stages while hidden in the shadows and avoiding enemies. The entire stage would be a puzzle getting from one side to the other using the environment to create more shadows or distractions for nearby enemies. Each stage having multiple approaches from staying in the shadows to using disguises. There may some limited engagement. \n\nThe plot and the main character I've come up with..I don't think has ever been done before hence I'm withholding that info for now which hopefully sets it apart from other games. \n\nHowever I don't want this to be completely linear which would result in a short game. I would want it as such that people would come back and play it multiple times. \n\nI'm aware the second idea isn't as fleshed out but any feedback would be appreciated."

6lo07w,"L.A. Noire, but Blade Runner","Cyberpunk, IMO, is due for a comeback. The gritty, fantastical, dramatic visuals of cyberpunk mixed with a genre already known for including Noire elements is a good fit. The movie Blade Runner showed that nicely, and the dramatic visuals would simply be nice to walk around in (while having plenty of examples to take inspiration from). The Asian influence in both L.A. Noire and Blade Runner would make for a good mash-up.\n\nTechnologically, the point-cloud approach is actually still good-looking and computers can handle the data better now than when L.A. Noire was made.\n\nBut from a gameplay perspective, you get something completely new: you're not just trying to discover if the suspect is lying, you're trying to discover if they're even human.\n\nThe cases in L.A. Noire did take you to a few cool places in 1940s Los Angeles, and the Hollywood angle is always a good fit with Noire. But in a cyberpunk setting, the missions would allow for a level of world and lore discovery that is much more interesting, unique, and new since you don't already understand the world you're investigating. So many elements of dystopian sci-fi could have really interesting applications for crime that you'd not considered before. For example:\n\n* To cover up a murder, a man frames a clone or replicant of himself.\n\n* To fake his own death, a man might make a clone of himself and kill the clone (which doesn't have his memories). Does the man get charged with murder? Is it a lesser crime?\n\n* Everyone is ID'd using iris scanning. You find and break up an illegal eye-replacement ring.\n\n* The sheer amount of stuff that the government is recording of a person could be huge, and there would be creative ways of deceiving the 24/7 surveillance of the populous.\n\n* A spaceship gets back to earth and you must solve a crime that happened when everyone was in cryostasis and was committed 700 years ago.\n\n* Take anything from Futurama, really: advertising in your dreams, suicide booths, whatever. These could all add really bizarre twists to an investigation."

What if there was a game with realistic mechanics, such as bullet damage affecting you based on where you were shot and the bullet caliber and stuff. What I really think will make the game unique, however, will be if when you die, you lose everything and you get sent to a new server, where you have never been and everything is different, with new civilizations and stuff based on the players who have been there before. It would make every time you die a new experience, and you can't just run with a friend who will grab your stuff when you die and you have no consequences. I think it would be really cool, because players will really not want to die, and lose their friends, their base, and the history they have made. I don't know, just an idea I had."

6lgpk9,"RPG, no story, survival","I was thinking about another game and I like RPG, but you always have some story you need to follow. So I was wondering about game where you have no story. Only NPC and you can ask them if you can help and you will do what they need. Like build mill or help with bandits, with training, kill traitor, find ""witch"". Or you can save a women on the road from bandits and take her to some village. You can find orphan and teach him/her. So there would be lots of stories, but it is only up to you what way you will choose. You can live in village or build or repair some. Help in that village or kill everybody, steal.\nStory: There is three kingdoms fighting each other for years. So there are no big armies only small groups fighting and destroying villages. World is destroyed, but still there are lots of villages where player can live and work. Kingdoms are in war, but nobody fighting after that much years."
6lgpd7,An Idea for a Mid-20th Century Tactical Shooter - Fire &amp; Steel (Needs Work),"Below I have detailed my latest idea for a game, a tactical shooter called Fire &amp; Steel.\n \nFire &amp; Steel would be a tactical shooter, but would differ significantly in its goals when compared to most other tactical shooters. If I had to compare it to another shooter, perhaps it could be compared to Project Reality, but it differs in many ways so that comparison is not exactly accurate.\n \n*Setting*\n \nFirst of all, Fire &amp; Steel is set in the mid-20th century, and so would be almost or completely devoid of recognizably modern weapons or cartridges. Assault Rifles would be very rare or not in the game at all. The most common weapon would be a bolt-action rifle, followed up by machine guns of different descriptions. Self-loading rifles would be present as well, but would be more rare than bolt-action ones.\n \nThe game itself is set in an alternate history scenario. Fire &amp; Steel would take place in the period around 1945-1951, but, in this reality, the Second World War never occurred. This was due to a variety of geopolitical factors, but most importantly that many of the major players in that war - Nazi Germany, England, and Soviet Russia - are all changed drastically. Nazi Germany has been replaced by a Centrist German government with Puppet States in Poland and other territories, England has been taken over by a Scottish Alliance and Russia is controlled by the Mensheviks. Many other things are different as well - France is Fascist, the African continent has seen much conflict between new colonial powers, and China has splintered into warring states yet again. Japan and the United States have both splintered into warring factions as well.\n\nI can explain the setting some more if you'd like, but the basic idea is that many, many states, alliances, and empires which never existed have come into being in the period after the First World War, primarily due to the turmoil of that war and other conflicts.\n\n*Organization*\n \nAnother way that Fire &amp; Steel differs from other Tactical Shooters is in team size. Each team can have a varying number of players up to 48 a side, or even greater, if development space allows. Naturally, maps differ based on how many players are on each side. Furthermore, due to hardware limitations, some people may not be able to play on the highest occupancy servers. However, if the technology has improved, then perhaps even more people would be accommodated.\n \nRather than trying to organize such a large unit under only one commander, however, each team would be split up into smaller sub-groups that are more reminiscent of other Tactical Shooters. There would be a few different kinds of sub-groups, or ‘sections’.\n\nThere are a few different types of sections.\n \nThe Rifle Section would be composed of about 8-10 players, and would be further split into two sub-sub-groups. The Rifle Section would have a commander, as well as a group of five or so players who are armed with rifles. There would also be a group of the remaining two or three players who man a light machine gun - one person fires the gun, while another (a bot) loads, and a possible third protects the other two. \n \nThese smaller groups would be able to queue together to find games, though they may have to be added up from separately queued groups of players due to the size of each group. It may also be possible to queue as a group manning the light machine gun, and a group armed with rifles, and so on. Alternatively, ad-hoc connections to the server would be possible, but the players would *have* to join a section rather than being able to play by themselves.\n \nOther types of sections include:\n \n*Heavy Machine Gun Section* - Composed of about 5 or 6 men, including two to carry and man the gun (again, one of whom is a bot), one to command the gun, and the remaining to carry ammunition and protect it.\n \n*Light Mortar Section* - Composed of 5 or 6 men, including one to carry the weapon, one to help load (bot), one to command the weapon and the remaining to carry ammunition and protect it.\n \nVarious other types of support weapons, such as Antitank Rifles, Infantry Guns, Heavier Mortars, etc. may be included, depending on development restrictions.\n \n*Gameplay*\n \nNow comes the all-important part of any multiplayer FPS: the gameplay. Fire &amp; Steel, like many tactical shooters, would be very focus on teamwork and working together to achieve your goal. This usually means working within your section, though it does extend to working with the other sections on your team.\n \nObjectives for each section are set automatically based on where they spawn. For example, a section spawned on the northwest side of a village would have the objective of capturing the northwest end of the village. However, it would be important to work together with other sections to capture larger objectives. \n \nEach section has a commander who coordinates his section. Due to the nature of online FPSes, this may not work out exceedingly well, but players will naturally be incentivized for following orders (or punished for failing to do so).\n \n*Entering a Game*\n \nThe best way for me to explain how this game would work is probably to explain how a game is entered and played.\n \nThe player selects a faction they would like to play for, as well as a role they would like in that faction. Of course, there would be strict limits on roles (to avoid everyone picking sniper or NCO) but you would be incentivized to play roles which are necessary.\n \nAfter doing the above, the player may queue with their friends, though they all have to be playing for the same faction. It would be possible to queue up for a Rifle section, for instance, if you have a group of people, rather than having each individual person queue for rifleman and one person queue for NCO.\n \nOnce in a game, the player or group of players is able to spawn in and is given their orders. The players would spawn at certain reinforcement points, which move up as objectives are captured.\n \nEvery game mode is focused around objectives, and objectives usually include territory of some kind, but may include special, unusual objectives, like capturing a vehicle or a certain person.\n\nOther game modes could include asymmetrical warfare, and the possible inclusion of vehicles at a later date.\n \nThe players in each section then work together to achieve their objective.\n \n*Teamplay in a Mid-20th Century Setting*\n \nHow would teamwork work out in this environment? What would the role of, say, the Light Machine Gunner be? How would bolt-action rifles be used in a tactical FPS?\n \nThese are all important questions to answer, so I will address them here. \n \nFire &amp; Steel would be a game centered around recreating real military tactics used during the time period of the mid-20th century. One of the most important tactics used in that time, and still used today, is fire and movement. This means one group of people shoots at the enemy, preventing them from moving, while others in the group move up to close range in order to eliminate them.\n \nThis is the role of the Light Machine Gun, and also of heavier machine guns - to fire upon the suspected position of the enemy in order to suppress them so that other members of their section can move up to destroy them. \n \nBolt-action rifles would work out as weapons that require carefully aimed shots, but have a lot of power in every shot. Because of the emphasis on realism, a shot from a rifle in Fire &amp; Steel would have a very good chance of killing someone if they are caught out in the open. However, that is relatively unlikely because of cover, hence why penetration is such an important factor - see below. \n \nIn essence, the main goal of teamplay in Fire &amp; Steel is to position yourself well in order to destroy the enemy in a cohesive manner. This is why the commands of an officer are so important, and why having a good officer is important as well - one has to know where to put themselves in order to affect the battle in the greatest way possible. Of course, an experienced player will be able to accomplish this much better than a new one, but the commands of the officers will help to make up the gap - at least, theoretically.\n \n*Important Mechanics*\n \nSuppression - Since suppression is so important in Fire &amp; Steel, it would be a major mechanic, and would relate directly to the morale of the player. \n \nPenetration - Since enemies will be hiding behind cover a lot in this game, being able to penetrate that cover is very important. Hence, all, or practically all surfaces in the game will be penetrable if shot by the appropriate round. This extends to explosive weapons being able to blow up walls, though destroying entire buildings would not be possible.\n \n*Customization*\n \nFire &amp; Steel would differ again from many modern shooters in its restriction of customization. The player gets weapons based on what team he is playing on, and he may or may not be able to choose which weapon specifically he gets. Rather, the role that is selected, and the map that is played on will affect which weapons are issued to the players. \n \nNow, this may be a contentious design choice, so I’d like to hear feedback on it. I’d love to explain it some more if anyone has any questions about it, or anything else.\n \nBelow are some sample loadouts for players. Included are several items which may not see use when the game first ships (such as a gas mask) but would be important features later on. These should offer some more insight into what can be done by each player and the types of weapon which would be used.\n \nPolish Rifleman\n \n* [M1891 Long Rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser_Model_1889) chambered in [6.5x54mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6.5%C3%9754mm_Mannlicher%E2%80%93Sch%C3%B6nauer) with sling and bayonet\n \n* 110 rounds (22 clips) of ammunition, including 10 rounds (2 clips) of tracer ammunition and 10 rounds (2 clips) of armor-pierincg ammunition\n \n* Gas Mask\n \n* Two fragmentation grenades\n \n* Two magazines of ammunition for the light machine gun\n \n* 50 rounds of loose ammunition\n \nBelgian NCO\n \n* [M1949 Rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Model_1949) chambered in [7.65x53mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.65%C3%9753mm_Mauser) with sling and bayonet\n \n* 100 rounds (20 clips) of ammunition, including 20 rounds (4 clips) of tracer ammunition \n \n* [Astra 400 Pistol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_400) chambered in [9x23mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9%C3%9723mm_Largo) \n \n* 24 rounds (3 magazines) of pistol ammunition\n \n* Gas Mask\n \n* Binoculars\n \n* One smoke grenade\n \n* Two fragmentation grenades\n \n* 30 rounds of loose ammunition\n \nFrench Light Machine Gunner\n \n* [M1922 Machine Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotchkiss_M1922_machine_gun) chambered in [7x57mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7%C3%9757mm_Mauser) with sling and bipod\n \n* 120 rounds (6 magazines) of ammunition, including 20 rounds (1 magazine) of armor-piercing ammunition\n \n* One spare barrel\n \n* [HP-35 Pistol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Hi-Power) chambered in [7.65x21mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.65%C3%9721mm_Parabellum) \n \n* 39 rounds (3 magazines) of pistol ammunition\n \n* Gas Mask\n \n* 50 rounds of loose ammunition\n\n\n*General Realism*\n \nSince this game is intended to be realistic, the HUD would be very limited or almost completely nonexistent. Some features would be lifted from other realistic games, like being able to approximate ammunition capacity by weight, but there would be no killfeed, and no mini-map. \n \nAs said above, damage would be to a realistic degree. Rifle shots would almost always incapacitate the player, unless the bullet does not hit a vital part of the body, ricochets, or has lost energy because it already penetrated a wall. Similarly, explosive weaponry would have a lot of power.\n \nCommunication would be limited. Voice chat would not be universal, but would have a limited range, unless the players are both using radios. Text chat would work in the same manner, but, like CS:GO, it would be very prudent of the player to use a microphone.\n \nRespawning would be limited. The players would be able to receive reinforcements via the NCO requesting them at reinforcement points but, due to limited reinforcements, it may not always be possible or prudent to immediately resupply a section if most of its members die at the same time. \n \n*Conclusion*\n \nAnyway, that’s my idea for a realistic, tactical FPS set in the mid-20th century. I feel it could be a realistic, but still competitively viable game, due to its extreme focus on teamwork. It would try not to focus on realism to the point of being frustrating to average gamers, but would still replicate the experience of a soldier around this time to a great degree.\n \nI think this game could succeed, and could possibly be an easier game to make than something like my other recent FPS idea, [Onslaught](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPSDesign/comments/6ju3u6/fps_game_idea_no_1_onslaught/). This is because it does not require any extraordinarily fancy design choices, besides the somewhat large server size, and commensurately larger maps.\n \nI would love to discuss this idea with you guys, and expand or refine it based on your feedback. In particular, I'd like to know how teamplay in the way I'd like to accomplish it could be encouraged and facilitated. \n \nIf you have any questions, please ask away! I love answering questions about my ideas.\n \nThank you for reading.\n \nZehroflcopter"

Or maybe these two countries are about to start a war and you need to get as much information as you can (like the date of invasion, troops location etc)/get other countries to be your ally. The gameplay would almost entirely consist of dialogues.\n\nSimilar games: Papers, Please; Beholder.\n\nWell, what do you think?"
6lbm8p,"Mercenaries: X-COM, Pokémon and NHL series in a blender","(Intermediate/Experienced, don't know how to add flair from mobile app)\n\n**Elevator Pitch**\n\nTake the tactical missions of X-COM, through in the roster/finance management of a sports game, and sprinkle in online trading from Pokemon.\n\n**Platform**\n\nPC, or console (Main Game &amp; Passive Play)\n\nAndroid, iOS, browser (Passive Only)\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe player takes on the role of a mercenary company founder and must assemble teams of soldiers to tackle missions.\n\nSoldiers must be hired to complete these missions, you need boots on the ground! Soldiers have inherent base stats (like Pokémons IVs, or XCOMS will and aim stats) but their field abilities can be improved through experience and training (accuracy, damage, speed, endurance, health, etc). Additionally soldiers gain reputation which help your organizations rep.\n\nSoldiers are hired outright (slavery/life contract) or on a per mission contract. Treating your soldiers poorly (too many failed missions, inability to pay, too many squad deaths/injuries, etc) may cause them to quit or mutiny. Soldiers who die in battle are permanently dead.\n\nYou must also build up a base which contains your intel/recon team, medical, science and training facilities.\n\n**Active Play**\n\nSimilar to traditional Tactics/RPG games, level up your squad and take on increasingly difficult missions. Missions are randomly generated or hand crafted which can be tackled at any time provided you have the intel. Game is over when you no longer have the reputation to get new contacts, or manpower to raid your enemies.\n\nGame is open ended with players setting their own goals. (similar to grand strategy games like Crusader Kings). A more directed story driven experience could be part of the game (eg take down a wanted drug cartel leader in a series of hand crafted missions) but completing it does not end the game.\n\n**Passive Play**\n\nAside from commanding soldiers directly on missions, you can also just play manager. Hire your soldiers out to other online players, but be careful they might come back injured or dead! You can manually approve contracts (viewing the other players mission success rate and other stats) or auto approve based on criteria. For instance, you can assign payment penalties that must be paid if the soldier dies or comes back injured.\n\nSoldiers can also be assigned to auto missions which have a success rate and are completed in real time (ie soldiers become unavailable for the next 16 real hours). The accuracy of the perceived success rate is dependent on your intel/recon rating. \n\nPassive play complements the main game but can be played in small bursts hence why a mobile client would be possible. Log onto your account and gain money/level up your soldiers while you wait for the bus so you can have a stronger team to take on that base assault that caused you so much trouble two nights ago.\n\n**Skill Level**\n\nDefinitely high end Intermediate or low end experienced. If I had the time I'm 87% sure I could throw this together with my current skill level. The skills required to build it aren't difficult by themselves in isolation, it's just a lot of work over two distinct tech stacks. \n\nActive Missions could be super detailed and fleshed out to a AAA level, which would require animators, 3D graphics knowledge etc but also could be implemented simply, isometric 2D or top down.\n\nPassive play is just basic menu navigation and boils down to a simple database application with a few concurrency checks thrown in for the real time component. Not trivial stuff but it's a common tech problem/project that would be easy to build from tutorials and others experience/mistakes online.\n\n"
6l6qpd,Sky survival: build an island in the sky and try to make it through various hazards,"Just started working on it as a side project, looking for criticisms/suggestions. \n\nYou start an a very small strip of land, and you can place blocks to expand(like Terraria). Hazards will occur frequently and randomly. Tornados, lightning, enemies, etc. will appear and try to destroy your land and/or you.\n\nOne of the core mechanics is that there's no costs to building things, but there are pro and cons to everything. For example, placing blocks will decrease the speed of your island, making it take longer to reach the end of the game. You can place generators to power turrets and gates and other useful objects, but generators destroy all nature around them, and without fruit trees, you will starve to death.\n\nNo story, about ten minutes to beat the game, crushingly difficult.\n\n[Rough prototype](https://gyazo.com/438e3800d8811afdde6cb76a3a6eb213)\n\n[Example hazard, a crowstorm](https://gyazo.com/178b53b5df477197b15c3639881049d8)"

You are a human on a planet that has thousands of intelligent inhabitants who are rich in culture but lack technology. Think Oddworld meets Master Chief as the dragon born. Every inhabitant is different and some downright hate you and others are willing to work you. Deep down below the surface of the planet is a domain that holds a vast world full of monsters called Dwellers. They are demonic creatures that only care about killing. The larger the dweller the less intelligent, the more humanoid they are, the more intelligent. Then after whatever story happens on the planet, the sister planet orbiting this one invades and now it's a planet vs planet conflict."

6ie6fg,Want help developing this game idea further,"Going to make a text based RPG game, a bit similar to Sanctuary RPG.

My story has a character learning about a new alien race, discovering and ""borrowing"" their technology to advance his own experiments, while making sure he protects his older sister with supernatural powers he developed from exposure of the alien technology.

6iaiip,Optional antagonist ending,"I've been giving thought to a game idea. You start the game as the protagonist, and fight to overthrow the oppressive antagonists. But along the way you character starts to discover that the antagonists are really the side to be on. (For example, if Luke Skywalker discovered that joining the Empire was the right move, and the only reason he opposed them in the first place was that he was indoctrinated into a rebellion culture from birth). You would spend game getting stronger, and the items and powers you collect would make your teammates and allies stronger too. But at the critical turning point, you have the option to switch sides. If you don't, you finish the game like normal and beat the bad guys. If you turn, you join the ""bad guys"" and have to fight against all of your old allies, and depending on what items you collected or quests you completed, the old allies would be stronger or weaker. \n\nThe kicker is that you have no idea this option exists until the end of the game, so you would go around helping the allies like mad for the first half of the game, then run the f*cking gauntlet through all of the stronger allied forces in the end. \n\nMarketing the game to the public would require keeping this a secret, so people don't have the twist ruined and play the first part of the game with minimal leveling, etc. This makes followup playthroughs more interesting and desirable.\n\nThoughts?"

6i2hay,"A full out medieval war/ siege game, which combines the mechanics of Chivalry, Guns of Icarus, and Besiege.","So this game would have 2 teams. One of attackers and one of defenders. The defenders would have a castle with custom traps/ obstacles they could build.  The attackers would build simplified besiege-like weapons to breach the castle. A first person combat system would be implemented with both teams, and there would be a guns of icarus-style sky battle above. There would be different divisions for each side. Both teams have a building/ prep period at first\n\n**Divisions**:\n\nAttack: Engineering division (like besieged, but simpler): These people would build/ repair the siege weapons. \n\nDefense: Would make/ repair things like traps, moats, and place turrets for infantry to man\n\nInfantry (like Chivalry, Medieval warfare): These would be the grunts who fight on the ground and use the Engineering Division's custom siege weapons/ turrets. It would have a combat system like Chivalry.

Let me explain.\n\nYou start out with it just being a normal day in [insert name of town] and then something happens, say, you find something you're not supposed to (give me suggestions) and then you tell somebody (something else you shouldn't have done) and it sets out a ""curse"" on humanity. Everything starts going weird. Physics start to go awry and people start to deteriorate into things like zombies or ""monsters"". (Suggest names below) I am thinking the infected humans have a face that is made of polygons, and they are ruthless killing machines. Basically everything turns to hell and you have to make it out if this fucked up nightmare you call a life. The plot twist is that the way of getting out is killing yourself. Once you die, the game shows you what really happened. What really happened is that you went insane, killed a bunch of people, including your family, and everyone around. You got caught, locked up in jail, and finally..... killed yourself. All because of something supernatural that you SHOULDN'T have stumbled upon. It was nobody's fault but yours.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you buy this game? Would you kick start it if I decided to learn basic and intricate game development and made it? Please. Don't steal my idea. I at least want to get credit for the idea if you beat me to making it.\n\n----EDIT----\n\n\n*(   ) = pronunciations\n\n\nYou play as a white male named Sean (Shawn). He works for the Black Crystal Bay Police Department. He's American, about 5'9, 154 lbs, Muscular-ish with Blue eyes, Brown hair, an average sized nose, is 27 years old, and a Wife named Signe (Sig-Nee).

You, a detective and 3 other cops search the murderers house, and you find a shrine to Satan. You decide it's not important enough to tell anyone, considering the detectives found a note to the police stating why he committed the murders and suicide.\n\nYou wake up the next day and everything starts going weird. Physics start to go awry and people start to deteriorate into things like zombies. The infected ""humans"" have a face that is made of polygons, and they are ruthless killing machines.

Each cities from different players then would have a really different look since people would choose to focus on different aspects (war/education/exportation/technologies/etc) so they would end up having really different types of buildings in the long run. \n\n&gt;Like a sort of 'Empire Earth'/'Civilization' (with the 'battle systems' included as a sub-mechanic of 'natural disasters') where the 'City building' mechanics and aspects would be more focused on single unit buildings instead of 'zones'. \n\n\n\n**Gameplay** \n\n\nSelecting and placing buildings upon a gridded map.

Remember that as you grow your city through the ages, each single buildings have to be hand-picked and placed or upgraded, giving them a really unique feel.   \n\n----"

Can y'all help?"
6ncu0g,Is this any worth?,"Guys, i has this idea that might be semidecent. (It's in early stages tho, but perhaps someone can rescue some of its concepts for their own games).\n\nSo, layout: you are a christian soldier of the crusades that gets shot by an arrow, the wound infects or whatever so you are having this hallucinations caused by the fevers. Everything nightmarelike.\n\nThe game then is kind of a 2d in which you fight enemies that are based on Muslim soldiers but mixed with demons and that stuff (remember that you are having hallucinations) the world is again based on what you have seen as a crusader but also twisted by your mind, fears etc. \n\nAlso the graphics are based in medieval romanic art (in the fashion of this other game, apotheon, that is based on Greek art). (It would be also nice if music included some Gregorian chant etc etc)\n\nWhat do you think?"

6n7sx5,Controller layout and magic system for a Harry Potter game,"This is less of a game idea and more of a magic system/mechanic for a Harry Potter game (or any other mage game really). We had a fun discussion a few days ago on /r/truegaming about the lack of good Harry Potter games and I whipped this up. It'd be fun to talk about it more.\n\nLet's say this is a triple AAA big budget game on console. I'd want to see a third person, over the shoulder camera view around the distance of say, Uncharted. This way, aim would still be somewhat of a factor. Have large list of spells usable. You can map certain spells to buttons/triggers/bumpers. These would be your more common, utility spells. You can cast the rest of your spells at will by holding down a button (say LTrigger) and performing a series of button presses and stick movements. Imagine street fighter movements, varying in speed. Maybe more powerful spells would require a longer, more complicated sequence. This would require you to study and practice the movements and sequences and your accuracy and speed, similar to how you'd actually study if you were actually going to Hogwarts. Your proficiency in wizard duels would rely on how many spells you know and how well and how fast you can perform them. Channeling spells (mind control, levitating objects, etc) would require holding down the spell trigger after performing the required sequence. You should still be able to move, albeit at a slower, more limited pace.\n\nI like to start brainstorming stuff like this by figuring out how I would like to play this game and what buttons do what. This way, mechanics are tied to stuff you can actually do on a controller.\n\nLet's use the PS4 controller. All my favorite games have been on PS: Uncharted, Last of Us, God of War, etc. PS4 also has the touchpad which I think could be useful in a Harry Potter game. [Layout here.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AcE2c.png) I'll be referring to this image for the rest of the post.\n\n**Button Layout**\n\n* I would keep the standard 3rd-person, over the shoulder movement and aiming system with the analog sticks.\n* R-Trigger (R2) - Quick-cast equipped spell.\n* L-Trigger (L2) - Enter spellcasting mode.\n*  X (or cross) - Jump, or movement in general. Double-tap and hold stick direction for rolls. Possibly hold for flight/levitation.\n* Square - Interact with environment. Opening doors, talking to people, picking up objects, etc.\n* Triangle - Counter/parry/deflect. In the HP universe, you can block spells. I imagine a system where you can time the button press to block a spell, like your average counter system. I'd expand on that and fit the lore by adding a direction in addition to timing the button press, you can deflect the spell in that direction. Maybe some spells are too powerful to simply tank by blocking, and you *have* to parry to avoid damage.\n* Circle - Not too sure here. What other actions are iconic to a HP universe? Use potion perhaps? Inventory? A cover mechanic? I'm not sure HP should really be based on a cover and shoot gameplay style, but it would be logical in the universe. You see characters use cover to avoid getting hit in the movies. But maybe you can use level design to dictate the kind of playstyle you want to push for. Say a final battle with Volde- I mean, He Who Shall Not Be Named - would be in a large open area with very little cover and would depend almost entirely on your knowledge and skill in casting spells. Whereas if you get caught in a shootout with Death Eaters in Diagon Alley, it would make sense that there would be places to take cover. Maybe this cover mechanic would allow you to use the bumper buttons (R1 and L1) to peek aim (L1) or blind fire (R1).\n* D-Pad - Quick-cast spell slots. Equip a spell to each direction. Four total quick-cast spells. The player can customize which spells he wants to use most often.\n\n**Casting Spells**\n\n* Cast spells by holding L2 and performing a sequence of button presses (the four face buttons) and R-Analog stick movements.  There should be a short window after the sequence is complete where you can aim the spell (using R-Analog). Once the sequence has been completed, press R-Trigger to cast the spell. You should still be able to move around with L-Analog, but at a slower, walking pace, during this whole sequence. For example, to cast *Expelliarmus*, hold L2, do the required spell sequence, aim at your target,  and press R2 to cast.\n* Channeled spells would require you to hold L2 after casting with R2 to keep channeling the spell. For example, to cast *Wingardium Leviosa*, you'd hold L2, do the required spell sequence (it's more of a flick), aim at your target, press R2 to cast, and hold L2 to channel and R-analog to move the target around. Release L2 to drop the club on the troll's head.\n* All spells have a casting animation and take a certain amount of time to complete that animation. You can be interrupted during this casting time. Simple spells like *Stupefy* for example, have a relatively short casting time and animation. A Transfiguration spell would be considerably more complex and would take longer to cast as well as having a more difficult spell sequence. Also, this would encourage players to recognize what spell an enemy is casting based on the animation and any other cues (color, sounds, effects, etc) and make a decision on how to deal with it.\n* If a spell is equipped in a quick-cast slot, it will still require your player character (PC from this point on) to perform the casting animation, you just don't have to hold L-Trigger and do the spell sequence. I would limit the types of spells you can quick-cast. You don't want stupidly powerful spells available at the touch of a button, although this would be balanced by the casting time. The player should want common spells slotted into quick-cast for ease of use.\n* Maybe there will be an ""accuracy meter"" for more complicated spells. How closely you follow the correct spell sequence will increase its effect and/or power. For example, you input a ""perfect"" Fireball spell, you shoot out a huge fireball that engulfs the room. If you miss the timing slightly, you'd cast an average sized fireball. However, if you just flub the sequence entirely, you shoot out a little spit of flame that sputters pathetically and dies.\n* To counter or parry a spell, you'd have to time your Triangle button press to block right before the spell hits you. There will obviously be a window of time to do this, and you should be able to cancel out of spellcasting mode in order to counter for most basic spells. For more powerful spells, you'd have to know the counterspell. \n* At high levels of play, I imagine the system would look something quite like a fighting game. Players will be inputting various spell combos while trying not to mess up the sequence or ""drop the combo"". This system should encourage players to be creative with their spells and link different effects together, effectively creating their own ""style"" of spellcasting. This system would also encourage players to perfect their mechanics. For example, you could start off with a few shots of *Stupefy* to try to stun the other player and give you a few seconds to cast a more powerful spell, like *Petrificus Totalus*, to really open up the enemy to a powerful spell combo. Or a more defensive-minded player would try to cast a ""perfect"" shield enchantment that lasts a few seconds in order to give them time to cast a really powerful, channeled Fire Blast spell, all while being protected by the shield. Or maybe a player will like using simple, basic spells but use them in creative ways, like levitating boulders and throwing them at the enemy.\n\n**Learning Spells**\n\nShould be a fairly straightforward process. You have access to a list of spells. At low level, you'd have just basic spells anyone can learn. These are your *Accio*, your *Lumos*, etc. You learn new spells by reading tomes or by learning them from a teacher. Maybe you discovered a book in the restricted section of the library that gives you access to spells few others have. Maybe you're the only player to have found and learned *Sectumsempra*. This would incentivize players to explore the world in the hopes of finding some obscure text with a powerful spell no one else knows. In the world of Harry Potter, knowledge is power, and a system like this would reflect that. A players' skill and power would be based on 1. What spells they know. 2. How well they perform the spell. 3. How creative they are with their spells.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I got a little carried away thinking about this."
6n7oo6,Looking for split-screen 3D first/third-person game ideas,"I just completed a very early version of a split-screen 3D game engine, after seeing ""What the Box"" and thinking it was a great and simple idea (especially for someone who can't create 3D models).

When you start the game, you will make a curriculum selecting the programming languages you're most familiar with, and all the jobs will be based on the languages you select. (*Ex: I'm good on C and i select only C, so all the jobs will be C-related.*). You can select one or more languages and the tasks will be random.\n\nThe pay will be based on how efficient your algoritm is and if accomplish the goal. The way to tell how it's efficient is by evaluating two things:\n\n- Execution Time\n\n- Memory Usage\n\nThe less memory and time, the more efficient the algoritm is, therefore, higher pay.

I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this (very sorry if it isn't), but if anyone has any ideas for me that would be amazing.\n\nAbout the game:\nBefore each level, you get to choose a loadout to get into the game with. The allows you to customize your tap/swipe up/ swipe down/ and swipe right attacks. Swipe right attacks are usually supportive attacks that don't do any damage on their own.\n\nWhile in the game, monsters will spawn from the top section and slowly walk down to the bottom section of the screen. The player will have to use their selected attacks to try to kill every monster spawned. Once a monster reaches the bottom, it will ""attack"" you, and then teleport back to the top to make its way back down again.\n\nHere is a demo video on google drive:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6LNoG_OfK0ANW1sXzRBRU1rcUk\n\nRight now the attacks are clearly not balanced at all, but my main concern is adding more stuff to the game.

6n13wa,Suburban Survival/Exploration Game,"Introduction:\nI'm thinking of an open-world survival game set in an explorable  suburban environment. In this game, you wake up one day and quickly find out that everyone in the world has disappeared, leaving you as the only human alive in the world. Enemies (I haven't decided what they actually are yet) would spawn during certain times each week in various difficulties and sizes. The game would have little to no storyline and would involve mechanics such as an inventory/equipping system, hitscan bullet physics and a day/night cycle. The main focus of the game is exploration and survival.\n\n\n\nWhat Is New About It?:\nI personally haven't heard of or found a successful suburban survival game that heavily involves exploration. Other than that, nothing is really new.\n\n\n\nWhat Does It Look Like?:\nI imagine the game to look somewhat similar in graphical style to the game SUPERHOT ( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6101215/pu202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70-1453913711-2012170-screenshot-original.0.jpg ). The only difference between the two graphical styles would be the addition of many more colours to the game instead of the strictly white/red/black color scheme that SUPERHOT has going on. The game would be first person and be set in areas like this ( https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/uploads/businessinsider/2015/05/Malvern.jpg ). \n\n\n\nWho Is The Target Audience?:\nThe game would be mainly targeted to rather mature older (teen - adult) audiences, but would be somewhat accessible to a younger age range.\n\n\n\nAre There Similar Games?:\nNot that I know of.\n\n\n\nCan I Play It With My Friends?:\nWhile the prospect of a co-op adventure with a friend through this type of a game sounds very fun, it might add too much on to the work load. On top of that, I believe that the multiplayer functionality of the game (if it were to get it) would come second to the core experience of the game.\n\n\n\nWhat Would It Be Played On?:\nPC.\nPotentially a port to consoles such as PS4 or XBOX One if the game became popular enough.\n\n\n\nAdditional Specific Details:\nThe majority of houses/buildings would be enterable and have different items inside depending on what type of building it is.\nA weather system that includes rain and fog. A Day-Of-The-Week system that lets you see what day of the week it is. A day-night cycle. A very large Pre-Made world to explore. Various weaponry such as guns, swords, bats, ect. Various items like medication, food, water, tools, ect. Various clothing options like hoodies, jeans, jackets, bullet-proof vests, hats, ect. A health, hunger, thirst and energy meter. \n\n\n\n"

6mygxb,One life per day,"My dream game would be a large scale military shooter on a scale that would put battlefield to shame. Using a large open world map similar to ESO in which a live battle goes on 24/7 with two opposing sides in a ww2 setting with long lines and objectives that must be held/assaulted. Players would have a strict chain of command allowing for higher ranked experienced players to give orders or lead a squad/platoon and at a certain level you can take on more commander-like roles. Disobeying orders could hurt a soldiers rank quickly thus ensuring a strict chain of command policy. I guess the main goal would be for a game that requires an extreme amount of tactical thinking and somewhat realistic because of the one life per 24 hours rule... each player would have their own class i.e. Paratrooper/infantry companies/tanker/fighter pilot /bomber pilot/artillery/commander that they could level up to unlock new skills but when one of these classes is picked the player cannot change for atleast a week. With all this being said, I have no knowledge whatsoever on game developing so I don't know if this would be possible... just wanted to hear some thoughts from the community. "
6mwto8,Like SimCity but spooky,"Imagine the leafy autumnal New England town from Halloween.

Building a Smoke and Steam factory will attract a Freddie Kruger. Building a Bates Motel will attract more trouble. Ideally building civic buildings on lay lines will promote better paranormal activity. Ideally you want as many hearses and GhostBuster cars on the roads as possible. \nBigger cities will host a richer paranormal and murderous population. \nDon't forget to build an ol' mill or abandoned mine to encourage accidents and if you can, build the hospital on the grounds of an Indian grave yard.\nToxic waste in the water can be an issue for your mutating swimmers, but careful you don't rob the visiting great white shark from your shores.\n\nAnd a Dracula."

The amount of mana/power required for each spell is based on how much you change variables, number of lines of code, how many times you use loops, etc, thus rewarding concise and clever coding with cheaper and more powerful spells. As the game progresses you can find new variables to edit. You could maybe use something like scrolls to create scripts to be called in your other spells to save mana, but these would be limited.

6mogvw,(X-Post from CrazyGameIdeas) Dreamed up a good idea,"A few days ago I dreamt up a pretty good RPG game idea and wanted to know if there is anything similar out there. Please read all the way through before commenting, because when I say I'm looking for similar things, I mean nearly EXACTLY. I know the basic idea will probably be similar to something else, but what I'm looking for is a deeper coincidence than ""bluh plot is same.""\n\nTitle: Voidlands\n\nPlot: For some reason, a growing void is destroying this plane of existence. To find out why and stop it, you must travel from plane to plane classic dungeon-floor style. However, planes will be large and filled with dungeons, towns, and unique things of their own.\n\nCool thing: Each plane, over time, will be consumed more and more by Void. Getting caught in the void usually is an instantkill, but you get plenty of time to escape. It's more like a constricting barrier than anything. You have to get to the next plane before the Void kills you, but you have limited time to level up, complete things, buy items, etc. After arriving at the next plane, you start the process over again.\n\nSo, put yourself in a player""s shoes. You're at, say, Plane Four. But something is weird. It feels like you aren't getting the full experience. First you just notice things like blank entries in the Bestiary. Then, NPCs mention fearsome beasts you don't remember fighting. Then, you find a recipe for a powerful weapon that, despite grinding for hours, you can't find the right materials for. Eventually, an NPC mentions a VOIDPLANE. By now, interest is piqued.\n\nThe NPC is recurring, and offers a teleportation service. You decide to check Plane Three. He says that that area has been devoured, and you aren't strong enough to resist the Void there yet. You ask to go back to Plane One. He obliges.\n\nWelcome to VOID-1. You see, in time, some areas of Planes will partially recover from being destroyed. Strong players will be able to resist the dark force constantly Pac-Manning the area, and will be able to revisit harder and distorted versions of earlier levels. Void 1, for instance, is about as hard as Plane 5. In this way, players that have grown stronger and more experienced are encouraged to check things they missed and see changes, adding an actually fun spin on backtracking. New enemies, new weapons, the players find that they were missing an entire HALF of the game. Now, rather than fearing the Void, they look to it prepared. As any hero should.\n\nBecause...\n\nWhy fear the void when you can make it fear you?"

6mj5sk,A mix of Capture the Flag and Bed Wars(in Minecraft),"Whenever I talk about anything that is exclusive to Minecraft, that's because this idea is oriented towards Minecraft, but can be in any game. I will automatically assume everyone reading this knows what bed wars is. If not, go on YouTube. \n\nThere are two stages- the retrieval and defending stage. In the retrieval stage, teams are in an enclosed space where they have to fight three bosses to get their loot. The team that deals the most damage to the boss when it dies gets the loot. A team can have more than one loot. You can also kill other teams in this stage. If you kill a team with loot, your team automatically steals it.\n\nThen the defending stage. Each team must defend their bed (or any other significant figure), and their claimed loot, if any, in their base. Teams can steal other teams' loot. If at any time a team has all three loot in their base, they win. Ways of winning are killing all three bosses, or eliminating everyone and stealing them. There is no time limit.\n\nBasic bed wars rules apply. Maps are basically islands in the sky, which is the original game. Currency values apply. Currency generators are at the same places: iron and gold at the base, diamonds on side islands, and emeralds in the middle or in the base if you upgrade the base.\n\nTo sum it all up, first, everyone is in an enclosed area fighting bosses and each other. The bosses drop loot, in which a team collects it. Then you play bed wars and capture the flag simultaneously. There is no time limit, and when a team has all the loot, they win.\n\nAny of these features can be customized.\n\nAlso, I can't find the flair button, but I would say this is an intermediate project. This is definitely a team effort."
6mis7q,Survival Game Centered Around The Sun,"The whole idea of this game is it's roughly 1 billion years in the future and all of humanity has left/died. The sun's luminosity has increased by 10% and the surface of Earth is around 47 degrees Celsius. You were frozen in an underground bunker and never woken until a mechanical failure releases you (not the plot of Fallout I swear). Your only equipment is a hazmat suit, an oxygen tank, and some other supplies to start you out.\n\nThe difficulty of the game comes in when you can't stay outside for long because of the extreme temperature. In the day it can get up to 47 C and at night down to -35. There are also still some creatures that have evolved to live in these temperatures which can be a source of food but can also kill you. You require food and water (which are scarce) so you can't sit inside all day. There are still some buildings and ruins which you can explore for equipment to survive longer and keys to past that tell you what happened.\n\nI don't have an end goal but essentially you go out for food and water, try to find equipment and artifacts to improve how long you can stay outside and help you survive longer and better. I understand this sounds quite similar to a lot of survival games but let me know what you think. Feel free to critique and share your ideas! :D"

It would be text based or would have very simple graphics for different settings/items and a text-heavy interface. \n\nThe goal: solve a randomly generated murder in a randomly generated town.\n\nMechanics: go to locations in the town, bring in people for questioning (simple dialog tree system), search for evidence (and send it to ""the lab"" for testing), and when you're ready fill out an ""indictment"" saying who did the crime, where, when and with what weapon. Then, a ""trial"" happens automatically based on how well you did at collecting evidence. At the end you'd be told who the real killer was.\n\nSome interesting tidbits: all the people in the town would be randomly generated with random professions, relationships, and a few random personalities some with red herring ""motives"" for killing the victim.\n\n**Fleshing out some specific mechanics**\n\nMoving around the town -- basically a text adventure interface. Description of the scene, and  a list of actions you can take. Some of the actions involve travelling to another part of town from the current part. There would be a limited number of places to go (&lt; 20), but finding some evidence might open up other parts of town (like knowing of the existence of a character will give you the ability to go to their house for example, getting a warrant will allow you to search a property).\n\nCollecting evidence -- at each location you'd have the ability to ""search"" different parts of the location, and there's a random chance you'd find an object there, some of which might be evidence of the murder but most of it not. You can choose to bag evidence and send it off to the lab for prints/fibers/DNA evidence. \n\nInterviewing people -- you can talk to people, and ask them simple questions like ""when was the last time you saw X?"" ""where were you at X time?"" ""what do you know about person Y?"" A person's statements can trigger certain events like opening up a new location or character. For example, ""what do you know about person Y?"" might trigger, ""Oh, Y is a messed up person! I hear he tortures animals on his property!"". This would open up Y's property as a place to go.\n\nIndictments -- at the end you prepare an indictment. This is an accusation against a known character that goes something like ""Bob Jones killed Mary Jane at 8:30 AM on Tuesday with a knife. His motive was jealousy"". Each part of the indictment has to be linked to evidence. "

6odix1,Game where you switch characters every minute.,"I only have a rough idea about this game, but essentially what's happening is that there's a villain that is really f'ed up, gruesome murders and twisted beliefs, and main character is the only one that can stop him. Main character is almighty protagonist, and has the ability to switch to different characters. I'll give an example: You're in a courtyard surrounded by enemies. Before the fight starts, you get the option of 3 characters from a game/anime/show/etc. For this scenario, let's say you get Zarya from Overwatch, Spiderman, or Eren from Attack on Titan. You pick a character (let's pick Eren) and each character has a specific moveset, slowly charging his/her ultimate which is their signature move (turning into a titan). After a minute passes, the game stops and you must choose between characters again. Iron Man, Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul or the Scout from TF2. This would be an ongoing cycle throughout the game, and the thing that would make it so much fun would be the endless combinations of characters one could achieve, and the amount of characters in the game. Each character would have a unique and different moveset. I honestly don't know if it should be a beat em up, a first person shooter, etc. I've always dreamed of being that character in a fight scene that really messes stuff up, and this is my only way of achieving it."
6obzrg,Psychology Test,1. A scenario where you have two different paths and on each block you have to chose who lives and who dies (like saw)\n2. Only thing is the people you choose to live will help try to solve the boss puzzle and if you don't you all die and you lose.\n3.That means have to think about the disadvantages and advantages they might have.\n4.But you always tell the truth so that's means will the people be able to handle that you let someone die.\n\nThanks for reading all ideas and comments are appreciated. \n
6obx0b,"This isn't really an idea, but does anyone else think that Stardew Valley should have been simpler?","What I mean is that there are certain features and ideas I feel that were not needed. When I first started playing, I thought it it would be a purely farming based game. However, things such as needing to craft things yourself or go mining make the game too complex for my taste.\n\nIn the case of crafting, I feel like it might actually be better if everything you need was purchasable, making money management a bigger part of the game and getting rid of the unnecessary hording of Items. I hate when I have a bunch of items in my chest that I don't even know if i'll need. I could agree that gathering the more basic materials like wood and plants make sense for trading to skilled workers, or just plain selling off. But a crafting system in general just seems out of place since its not a survival game.\n\nAlso, mining and combat is just not fun to me. It just doesn't make sense to me that the person who wants a specific tool or weapon would have to get the materials themselves. The character we play as is a farmer, not a miner. Now I understand having basic mining elements like getting stone out from the farm, as that is a skill that a lot of farmers would need to maintain their farm. But going mining underground for ores is just a step too far for me. \n\nOn a different part of the game, however is the ""story"", which I don't understand much at all. This might just be because I have no idea what to do to interact with this side in the game, nor do I have the interest in finding the mayors pants for him. Yes, there should be a nice interactive town to explore, and lots of people to talk to and get to know, but that's as far as I would go. \n\nThis is just my opinion, and I don't think that anyone has to take me seriously. But I would like to know how other people feel.                                              \n"

6o893j,"Save your Escaped-Slave Village in Colonial Brazil and Use Hallucinogenic Drugs to fight Spirits with Complex Martial Arts Combat, Rainforests, and Historical Accuracy!","A open world role playing video game about Palmares:\nInspired by the historical truth but taking fictional plot lines. Palmares was a city in the Brazil in the  that was first established by a group of 40 West African slaves that burned down their plantation and fled. They were helped in their journey to a safe place by many Indians. This was in 1602. By 1680, there were 20,000 people living in the main city Palmares, with other scattered slave settlements. There were also many whites and Indians living in this city. Here the martial art form Copeira was developed. \n\nThe video game would be about two things, one mystical and global, also with an underlying mundane political storyline. \nYou play as one of 5 races: Maroon (escaped slave), Mulatto (part black), Portuguese, Caboclos (part Indian), or Indian. Your race determines your starting stats and abilities. \n\nThe map of the game is roughly modern Pernambuco and Alagoas in Brazil, although shrunken for gameplay purposes. It includes hills, rainforests, valleys, canyons, and beaches, plus ancient ruins. There are the major Palmeras cities, one large (Cerca do Macaco and one smaller, both well fortified cities in the hills, and several small scattered slave villages in the surrounding hills and valleys. The biggest city is very multicultural, as is Recife, but many others are not diverse. The game also has several villages of Indians scattered around the game, representing two different cultures, one very open and another more hostile. There is also a major Portuguese city Maceio and other smaller Portuguese towns Penedo, Pao de Acucar, Agua Branca, and San Mae dos Milagres in the South. The Dutch have invaded the North and control the city Recife since 1644. \n\nIt is 1677. The plot of the game at the beginning seems like it'll be about Portuguese forces trying to destroy the slave communities, who you are a citizen of. Tension and violence has been escalating lately, also with the Dutch. At the time, the semi-mythical leader of the main Palmeras government, Ganga Zumba, has become a king with his family members running some other communities. He is also trying to consolidate the settlements into a kingdom called Angola Janga to have more military defense against the Portuguese. Also a military leader Zumbi is planning a coup on Ganga Zumba because Ganga Zumba seems closer and closer to signing a deal with the Portuguese. You rise from humble origins and get embroiled in this bloody conflict and become a trusted advisor of Ganga Zumba but remain mostly a freelance adventurer. Your race will play a big role in all your interactions. However as the game progresses, a new and arguably more important plot line emerges (though the player can choose to prioritize either one, and these choices of which quests to do when will have butterfly effects). Weird magic shit starts happening and you hear from some Indians that an ancient Amazonian god has been awoken and will do bad shit. You learn from some Shamans how to harness magic and spirits using herbs and potions. You then try to appease or defeat this ancient evil god. \n\nInteresting Stuff:\n\nThe history itself is so unknown to many people, it presents a rare multicultural experience in the 1600s and many sides of a Great War. It also includes so many diverse settlements with people to interact with and factions to join. For instance some new slave groups come from tribes that are enemies in Africa, while others are third generation slaves and are all commingled. Also the economic success of Portuguese settlements varies greatly, and acceptance of the Quilombos also varies greatly. Indians relations from village to village are also different. Culturally diverse. Plus it includes rainforests which are new ground for open world games and it has many other types of dope geography.\n\nWomen's role in the Quilombos were very interesting. There were far more men in the communities, so women would often be rescued in raids. In many villages polygamous families would develop, with one wife being the matriarch and giving tasks to her various husbands. This contrasts to women's diminished role in the colonial cities.\n\nCapoeira is a guerilla martial arts form developed by escaped slaves, which they disguised as dance to hide their training on plantations. This fighting style is a big style of gameplay in the game, with a complex and hard to master combat system similar to UFC 2, but of course other combat styles are available like guns and swords, each with realistic and intuitive yet complex combat systems. This gives the game a large learning curve and gives more role playing customization. There should be huge differences in combat between a guerilla copeira warrior, and a conquistador with armor and a sword and horse. No hack and slash like skyrim\n\nAncient Amazonian religion plays a key role in this game, as well as western African folklore, and the Dutch are Anabaptists, while the dominant religion is Iberian Catholicism. The way the player interacts with ""magic"" in this game is kind of dope because I don't want it to be super unrealistic but it definitely exists. Pretty much there are both good and evil and neutral spirits of the land, plus maybe a spirit or two of the non-Christian slave minority. The player gets his spiritual perception heightened by taking drugs. Alchemy plays a huge role in this play style of the game. Herbs are collected with varying effects and there are complex minigames and processes to brewing the herbs into types of Ayahuasca, the traditional brew used by South American shamans for vision quests and stuff. These vary in strength, and some will cause the game world to become slightly or highly distorted, with hallucinations. But they will also help the player divinate different clues  or insights to solve quests. They can also buff different stats like endurance, charisma, or pain tolerance. Poorly made potions may also harm other stats. Some brews may send the player into different realms of existence where they must physically confront the different spirits. Leveling up your Shaman skills can help you be slightly magic sensitive when sober, but it is slight. There's no potions that make you shoots fireballs and shit like that (at least in reality) but they have different subtle effects to help solve quests through puzzles and or through combat. Also taking Ayahuasca induces a random element to gameplay, where hundreds of reactions or hallucinations can happen.\n\nThe game doesn't have much ""dungeon-delving"" but it has many cool locations to explore. The way the map works is definitely more like Witcher 3 than Skyrim. There's also real world environment damage like Battlefield, at least for some things. For instance historically when Portuguese armies would approach a small Quilombo the citizens would just burn it and run into the woods. This kind of stuff happens in game in real time.\n\nThe NPC AI has to be high. For instance historically, many Portuguese peasants would flee cities and go to Quilombos if they were conscripted into military service against the Dutch. This should happen in game. Or Maybe some of the normal townspeople do go into the military and end up dying in game forever. Also you should always be able to talk to people about stuff. In skyrim bandits attack you on sight, that's dumb. Even in combat, you should be able to yell a variety of phrases that might stop combat and open a dialogue. Also there must be intricacy to each NPCs reaction to other NPCs and the player. If you're a different race they trust you less, some hate you. Refugee slaves would often trade with outskirt colonial villages, each villager should have a different reaction to this mingling. And of course there are still plantations with slaves all around. These slaves should be able to escape in game in real time, or be killed in the course of work. Many quests can deal with freeing slaves or perhaps being one, because historically if you came to a Quilombo on your own you were considered free, but if you were brought by force from a plantation you were still considered a slave or at least lower class. \n\nAnd like any good RPG, there's quests all around. Everyone has a dumb trivial quest they can give you, and some have dope quests. Each settlement also has a unique, longer, interesting quest relating to it. And there are also many factions to join, some are either/or but some can be joined by anyone. There can be abolitionists, slave catchers, militaries for each nation, shamans that worship different spirits, merchants, a Dutch historical society searching Indian ruins, Bandeirantes, Catholic monasteries, a gang of escaped slaves that now raid white settlements, maybe even pirates on the coast.

6o80uj,Planet of the apes,"So I saw war for the planet of the apes the other day, and all I could think about was how cool a game it could be if done right. It would be awful if it was one of those generic screen to game quick money grabs, but if some time was put into it, it could be neat. You could design your own ape and have a sort of skill tree where you evolve the virus that makes apes smarter. it could be open world with human/ape outposts and old ruins. Could even have different bioms and add some survival elements/skills"
6o7g7v,"New Multiplayer Game To Rival COD, BF and Overwatch Idea","So the basic gist is a game which is set in both LA and NYC (2 campaigns!!!) The campaigns would be about beef between two gangs (LA campaign) and two mafias (NYC) which would eventually involve the police. \nMultiplayer would be involve areas from both the campaign and unique maps. LA maps would be in the hills, the hood, the big city, and a huge mansion. The NYC maps would be set in an industrial site, abandoned areas, times square among other places. The teams would be randomly selected from 3 teams which would be the two gangs/two mafias and the police. Classic game modes would include TDM CTF among other modes. You can play as males and females from all sorts of ethnicities. There would be a huge customization selection.\nA zombies mode would appear and would involve characters from both campaign and multiplayer. The outbreak would have an unknown cause.\nI think that this game is a good idea but most people might think it sucks. I'm open to ideas and I hope to get enough attention to the point that just maybe a gaming company will see this and will give it a go. Probably wont happen but nothing is impossible lol. Thanks for reading please reply to this with your thoughts and ideas for this game! "
6o70dv,Extreme Fishing Simulator,"Before someone downvotes this to oblivion hear me out. Maybe I should have named it *Extreme Monster Fishing Simulator*. Basically you live in a world where you can fish for monsters. There will be a main storyline on the lines of catching a super rare monster fish. You start out with the lowest form of fishing which might be just a roll of fishing line and a hook and some cheap bait and catch some weird but believable fish. \n\nOver time you will have the ability to fish in different areas and the better areas are more dangerous, plus you fish with better equipment. The dangerous element can be manifested in different ways I'm thinking bad weather, fishing on an unstable boat etc. Also the monsters you catch are increasingly large and more ridiculous. \n\nThere will be mini-games where you will can enter competitions to catch certain types of monster fish. You can earn good money here, but it will be tricky. There will be side quests where you help others catch fish. They will reward you with money and/or tips to catching fish. The tips will be invaluable to catching the big one. The people you help will tell you the possible location of the big one, what kinds of bait might work and how to catch it. \n\nI'm also thinking this game might have RPG elements. You can upgrade the player's stats. Plus you can hold inventory items. Some items that come to mind are fishing guides. The basic fishing guides will be cheap to buy and will be available at all fishing shops. Then there will be specialist guides that may only be available in certain places and will cost you more. Then there will be rare 'fishman's manuals' that were made by experts fishermen and will be hard to find, but worth it. One (or more) of those manuals will be very useful for finding and catching the big one. \n\nWhile this is definitely a fantasy based fishing sim, I still think it will be possible to add real world forms of fishing to add authenticity, IE you catch fantasy creatures but you do so in real world terms. There will also be whaling, but whaling for monsters. Speaking of whaling we can add a moral dilemma in the game where you will have to make the decision to capture and kill an endangered monster fish, if you don't, something bad happens. \n\n\n\n"
6o615t,Rip my combat platformer to pieces,"Bear with me, english isn't my first language. I might have a good grasp of the language itself, but punctuation might be a bit weird.\n\nI love games like Castlevania and Souls games and have been working on my game that borrows a bit from both, but still does its own thing. The game is a sidescroller platformer, but with emphasis on also killing enemies instead of just avoiding them or considering them as obstacles. Player has a simple but slow-ish one-two punch with great weight and strength behind them, a dodgeroll that lets you move through enemies and projectiles, and basically anything that hurts you,  and a heavier attack that's slow and fires a projectile that goes through enemies.\n\nPlayer's unique ability is the ""grab"" or ""chain"" mechanic which I haven't named properly yet. When player kills an enemy with the heavy attack they get stunned before disintergrating. During that time player can grab the enemy, or part of them, and use that as a subweapon. For example, you can grab a regular mook enemy and throw them at other enemies, or rip off a fire breathing monster's head and shoot fireballs from it a few times. My mantra is that I don't want gimmicks into my game. So player isn't forced to use any of those subweapons if they don't feel like, and none of them are required for puzzles etc. if there's even going to be those. There is also an option to jump on a wall and run upwards for a short time before falling/jumping off.\n\nThe game is going to be very arcade-like with clear progression with some forked roads that lead to different levels. Think Castlevania 3. I don't know if there's going to be a progression system. One think I've thought about, but not sure if it would work, would be what I call Hype Meter. Each time player does damage their attacks become faster for a while. This would put more emphasis on combat and make players feel really brutal and vicious, more powerful with each hit.\n\nSetting:\n\nThe game would be based in an alternate modern day universe where all sorts of monster races live together in a gigantic Honk Kong-like city by the sea with many monster cultures living together. Player controls a newly hired ""super hero"" of that city after the last one retired. In this world super heroes are basically the city's strongest people who will uphold peace with strength first and law second. The player character is a boneheaded and somewhat troubled young orc with giant steel arms that give her amazing strength, and she's only in the job to beat up punks and to get paid.\n\nThe game's story begins with the deep sea people suddenly attacking the city and pulling it underwater inside a giant bubble. The deeper they go, the weirder and more dangerous things start leaking into the city through the bubble. And who knows what awaits them when they finally hit the bottom?\n\nTL;DR\n\n- Castlevania-esque high difficulty arcade platformer with emphasis on brutal combat.\n- Ability to use enemies as weapons in various ways.\n- Player can run up walls for a short duration, as opposed to the usual simple walljump mechanic.\n- Well timed dodges and attacks that speed up after each succesful hit are key\n- Modern day alt-universe cityscape setting with grimy tall buildings, neon lights, dark alleys and silly looking monsters.\n- Classic arcadey feel with a toggleable story for those who are interested in exposition and those who just want to play a game.\n\nRip me apart. I know it's a huge wall of text. Before you doubt me, I can assure you that most of the mechanics are actually already in beta phase, and tons of in-game art assets are made. This has been under work for over two years. I'm working on this completely on my own and I'm a slooooow developer.\n\n\nHere's some screenshots:\n\n[Our yet unnamed player character.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3gu93bgx45p6nw8/ork.jpg?dl=0)\n\n[Slugmen.

6o5o8g,Really great game idea,So my idea is having a craft survival game.You join a clan u build up a base as a group kinda similar to clash of clans though but everyone works on this base and every 24hours or so u get raided by a random and ur way in defending is by using the defenses in ur base and while raiding u need to make weapons that also take time to make so u have everyone as a group working on different things as a team and at this time theirs really no good craft games out in mobile so id like to see this but the key is to get a really good survival online game on mobile.
6o2iew,[Game Element] Offering up your own bounties in RPGs,"This is less an idea for an entire game and more an element I wish many RPGs had.\n\nSimply put, it would be a very useful feature in many RPGs to be able to offer up your *own* bounties to NPCs. These could be for items, enemies, finding another NPC, raiding a dungeon, etc. It would be especially useful in mid-game settings for assisting in ""being in two places at once,"" or even end-game settings where you are sitting on piles of gold but still have to grind to get that one rare drop. In the latter, it offers an excellent system of trading resources for time spent finding items/enemies/whatever.\n\nThe actual means in which NPCs could (attempt to) complete your bounties can vary. This could be affected by any number of factors such as:\n\n* The difficulty it would take a player to find the item, raid the dungeon, etc.\n* The reward you offer\n* You character's ""fame,"" ""reputation,"" how many quests you have completed, etc.\n* How many NPCs are actually able to take on the bounty, and the skill of each\n\nThe actual manner in which setting bounties can be carried out can vary too (from least to most intricate):\n\n* A ""bounty menu"" on the UI\n* Some ""bounty guild"" in the world you need to speak to who manages these\n* Offering up bounties personally to guild members or others through dialogue or a ""bounty board"" system\n\nSome interesting/fringe aspects of such a system:\n\n* Games that possess a ""crime"" system (Elder Scrolls, etc.) could consider not paying for a bounty a crime, which acts as a check on setting high-level bounties\n* If playing an evil character, there could be the potential for you to set bounties on items/creatures you *currently possess*, so as to trap adventurers\n* The potential for NPCs to accept your bounty to find an item, but take the item for themselves, requiring you to follow up with them\n* Depending on how advanced the game is (leaning towards AAA here), you could actually see NPCs who accept the bounty go out into the world in search of the item/enemy/dungeon"

6nzz0w,Skyrim to Enderal as Skyrim to Harry Potter,"If you haven't seen my last I really like the fact that a group of people turned Skyrim into a game they liked (Enderal). In my last post explained I would like that for Percy Jackson. I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA FOR Harry Potter. If you guys have not seen my last post, Enderal is a HUGE mod for Skyrim. Enderal is a total conversion mod for Skyrim. It changes the whole game into a whole new story. I think it would be cool that they do that for Harry Potter. So basically it would explain what happened to Harry when he was a baby. Then you would start as Harry Potter learning spells gradually. Getting quests that correspond to the story etc... I think this would be awesome so if you are a HarryPotter fan and you like games hit that up arrow to your left. "
6nzqzo,Skyrim to Enderal as Skyrim to Percy Jackson,"If you guys don't already know Enderal is one of the biggest mods of Skyrim. Its a mod that is free but is a completely different game. It uses the same controls and (base) that Skyrim does but it changes Skyrim into a whole new story.No more imperials or stormcloaks. I was thinking the same way the people changed Enderal into Skyrim, it would be awesome to have a Percy Jackson game. With the same controls. and it follows the actual story of Percy Jackson. I think this make take AAA but I'm not positive. The people that made Enderal are a nonprofit team I'm pretty sure. So this show it would work. In the beginning you guys would be able to choose a character. Ranging from Percy, Annabeth, Piper, Jason, Leo etc. The reason why it would take AAA is because if you chose someone like Jason you would have to start in Rome. And in the book it does describe Rome all the way into the second series. Anyway after you choose a character like Percy it would gradually show you the controls. Like once you get to the point where Percy learns how to control water. It will show the controls to control water. I think this would be awesome because I'm a huge Percy Jackson fan I don't know about y'all. Anyway I think this would be good for other book too like Harry Potter. Feel free to criticize my idea in the comments below. "
6nxniv,Roleplaying Survival Horror Game,"I have had this idea in my head for such a long time. Essentially, it would be Far Cry meets Fallout meets Silent Hill meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R. \n\n The player would start out by customizing their character, choosing their background (Soldier, Hitman, Psycho, etc.) and then their class (which woulf determine their abilities and their starting skills). \n\n Following this, they would wake up in a dimly lit and barricaded mansion bedroom, sitting in a pool of their own blood (implying that they were badly injured and barricaded the room to keep something out). The mansion would be HUGE, but it would be only one of the many ""zones"" the player could explore in the open-world environment.\n\n There would be similarly large areas like a carnival, an old farmhouse and cornfield, a few towns, a swamp, a large underground cavern, an abandoned military base, stuff like that. \n\n Each area could be traversed and explored at will, and would be drastically different than the others, featuring different enemies, loot, bosses, backstories, etc.\n\n For example, the carnival would feature cannibalistic clowns with several variants, one town would be connected with the forest and serve as a hub for witchcraft and cult activity (the player would have to fight a witch boss here), the caverns would feature creatures similar to those in the Descent and the Cave, the swamp might have cannibalistic hillbillies like in Wrong Turn.\n\n The story would be both in the narrative and in the environments (much like in Fallout, you would be able to find records, journals, and recordings of the events at each location.\n\n The main story would involve the conflict between military forces who are currently trying to contain and exterminate the supernatural horrors that dwell in this place, a cult who wishes to unleash these horrors on the world and start the coming of the antichrist, the survivors of the supernatural takeover, and you. \n\n You would be able to do some missions for the cult for rare loot and valuables, but you would not be able to side with them endgame.  \n\n  The military and the survivors would be at odds, mainly because the military won't let them leave due to possibly exposing the outside world to some sort of contamination. \n\n You would be able to side with one or the other, or get the two to work together against the cult. All the while, the devil himself would be taunting you and attempting to stop your mission, at one point even crucifying you.\n\n Your skills would also play a pivotal role in the game, and you would be able to perform some actions depending on them.\n\n You would be able to find tons of weapons and gear to assist you in surviving all the horrors, as well.\n Anyway, thats just my idea for a game. Just thought I would share."
6nwjlu,Trippy Liquid Dropper,"I'm not sure if this is a flyer, or a dropper... The intro is a starship floating through space, and hitting a wormhole, violently throwing it/you into another dimension. You need to travel from wormhole, to wormhole (level to level) to get back to normal space.\n\nThe actual levels are psychedelic flowing funnels you have to fly forward through, avoiding floating incorporeal entities with differing powers, and speeds. You should also be traveling through a gas/fluid, so there should be a wake wherever you move. You should also move a bit slower.\n\nYou have no guns, or they're useless against non-corporeals, but a few of the entities are friendly, or at least curious of you, so they hover around your ship for a little while, once you get close enough to catch their attention. They would work as buffers against the other entities."

6nvohq,Space exploration with old world sea voyager feel,"The idea is simple enough. Basically, it's Uncharted Waters (NES, or SNES for the sequel) in space. You start off on your home world, gathering together money for your first spaceship through task, or trade. Once in the sky, the path to glory is pretty much up to you.\n\nYou can be a wayfarer, seeking out new horizons, and piecing together a map of the stars, little by little, and selling your progress to the highest bidder. If you frequent a port, or just like the merchant, you can become his personal map maker, aligning yourself to the port, and fetching a better wage there. The further you 'sail', the better your wage, but space gets sparser, and deadlier the further you go.\n\nYou can be a trader (like Ambrosia's Galactic Trader for Mac), collecting goods from one planet, or system, and selling them for a profit. The further away you go, or the less hospitable the terrain, the better your price.\n\nYou can align yourself with raiders, pirating the skies, or world leaders, keeping them safe.\n\nBe nice, trade with, and do tasks for a planet, and it might align with you, or your homeworld. Anger them, and you could turn a whole system against you. \n\nYou can also search for artifacts to sell for a very good price, but they are the stuff of legend, and you'll have to befriend people to get their stories. (Vikings for Mac)\n\nThe big thing is to get a better vessel, and increase your fleet. (Tradewinds) You can even find an upgrade from time to time, if you're lucky enough to come across a derelict ship. Hopefully, before long you'll be captain of a huge fleet, and no one will want to mess with you."
6nr8qh,BoomBall! A dodgeball arena shooter,"Hey there! So I came up with this concept a couple years ago and it got some traction, but I just wanted to get this idea out to a fresh pair of eyes.\n\nBasically, it's a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, whatever v whatever arena shooter on small maps, with the idea being that bullets are balls that you can pick up and shoot at other players that will bounce around until they are grabbed. The ball would also act as a hot potato type of deal where it would explode in your hand if held for longer than three seconds. Players are very mobile with dashes in all directions available to use.\n\nMatches consist of multiple rounds, and it felt pretty good with a prototype I made where it was first to 15, win by 2. Rounds should go pretty quick with a time limit of maybe 15-20 seconds for each round. These rounds take place in small arenas with obstacles such as pillars or boxes to hide behind and bank balls off of, and players can move freely around the arena (they are not restricted to one side as in normal dodgeball).\n\nI started out the prototype with 1v1 having both players fight over one ball, but it was much more fun when there was one ball for each player in the field. This applies to 2v2 and 3v3 as well, where there are 4 and 6 balls respectively. I never got to test 2v2 or 3v3, but I can imagine it would be pretty hectic but very fun with strategies like passing and positions becoming available.\n\nThe aesthetic for this game would be sort of Quake meets Rocket League. Big arenas with cheering crowds, and armored soldiers duking it out.\n\nUnfortunately I lost the prototype sometime ago due to a computer crash, and I'm honestly not very interested in creating a full game out of this, but I figured it would be something you guys might be interested in tackling! Let me know what you think!"

6njb72,A first person procedurally generated open world fantasy game.,"So in the game, you can start either in the wild or in a village, either way, you are a peasant with only the ragged clothes on your back and a few coins there is no main objective that is up to the player the NPCs can sell you items give you randomized quests or simply wander the village going about their daily lives the main focus of the game is freedom you can be whatever you want to be but you have to earn it yourself want to be a cleric? then join the church and train to be one.want to be a druid? venture into the forest and prove yourself worthy to become one of them you can craft a multitude of items yourself but you must learn how to make it first by leveling up your skill level in the respective aspect these skills or simply reading a guide book, however, this not as fast as paying someone to teach you the recipe.now outside of the more developed civilizations, there are many hazards such as bandits that will try to rob you of whatever you have, dire bears and wolves seeking out their next meal, and necromancers collecting new minions, if you find yourself in combat with them there would be an intimidation mechanic so if a bandit leader sees that you are completely decimating his forces he will order them to retreat, if the dire wolves and bears are severely injured or you threaten them with fire they could decide you are not worth it and run away .something that you can't do in most games is recruit enemies so if you find an Orc camp you can challenge the chieftain to a duel for his title as chief (note not every chief would risk their title and simply order your death) first you would have to fight a few orcish warriors to earn the honor of challenging the chief if you do win then the remaining orc are yours to command however if you are not an orc then some might not accept you as their leader.another thing is you can become a necromancer by breaking into one of their towers and taking their spellbook.one last thing is you can start your own kingdom."
6kvvxs,As a fan of roguelites I always have little ideas in my head. Decided to flesh it out into an idea!,"---------------STORY----------------\n\nFar into the future space travel for all becomes a possibility. Colonies on other planets, new organisations, corporations rise and fall. Humanity does what it does best: Adapt and thrive. \n\nAs the explorable area of space grows a new area known as the 'expanse' is formed. Close enough to warrant traffic and trade, while far enough to be almost lawless. The expanse constantly shifts as it is absorbed into the embrace of the law.\n\nOn the brink of the expanse lives are forged for those seeking adventure, acts of piracy, heroics and daring merchants risking all for an extra profit. One such person is you. \n\nFor whatever reason, you have found yourself on the outer edge of the expanse and while stopping on a planet you discover technology of great significance. Not only does it prove that something intelligent is out there, but it provides a great power. Dubbed the 'jack' due to the nature of stealing bodies it allows for the transferral of conciousness and with it comes (essentially) immortality. \n\nHowever the crooks, pirates and other adventurers will likely want this technology for themselves and this is confirmed when an infamous pirate attacks you and helps you learn to survive after being defeated. You must make it back to civilized space, to safety, and to do so you must fight your way through all the other pirate lords on the way.\n\n----------------Mechanics------------\n\nFast paced top down shooter, upgrades that change gameplay vastly on a run-to-run basis. \n\nBoth the enemies and player die relatively quickly, but upgrades and abilites should prevent death occuring too quickly to reliably react.\n\nPlayer boards enemy ships via a small pod on each level, levels are partially generated from carefully designed room sets that are unique to sections of the game. Multiple levels per section until a boss or 'pirate lord' must be fought. After a pirate lord is defeated their ship upgrade is gained and a jack upgrade is picked by the player.\n\nNew items, enemies etc that can be found on a run-by-run basis are unlocked through gameplay such as doing damage, collecting x amount of upgrades etc. \n\nSome unlocks apply to the characters ship or the jack, resulting in permanent upgrades. 'Jack' unlocks allow permanent application of some buffs found in runs whereas 'ship' upgrades are unique and allow the player to use abilities used by bosses such as missile barrages, emps etc.\n\nAfter a pirate lord is defeated, the player can optionally skip that section and not have to play the levels up to the boss, or just the boss itself, however in doing so collects less upgrades due to not having the opportunity to pick them up.\n\n------------------Equipment--------------\n\nOne static 'stun pistol', does not run out of ammo but requires a charge time between each shot. No upgrades apply to this weapon.\n\nMelee weapon (baton? sword?), certain upgrades apply such as damage buffs and attack speed. Combos can be learned and selected resulting in different swings/damages. Etc, long slow sweeping attacks or quick short slices or mixtures.\n\nOmnicannon (Ranged Weapon), most upgrades apply to the omnicannon. Highly adaptible projectile weapon that allows for modification to any form via modules or manual adjustments.\n\nArmor (Sythread), an armor made of synthetic threads that are highly adaptable. Can take in materials and use their properties like metals and their alloys. certain upgrades apply such as new movment abilities, sheilds, etc.\n\n------------------Enemies---------------\n\nCreating fun and unique enemies could be difficult due to the style of the game, but some ideas are listed:\n\nFast glass cannon melee enemies\nTanky control ability melee enemies \nImmobile sniper-like ranged enemies\nRun and gun enemies\nEnemies that try to body block/protect others\n\n\n\n------------------Bosses----------------\n\nBosses are 'pirate lords', leaders of the pirates, gangs and the like. Each boss has special actions allowed by their ships such as barrages from the cannons, localised emps.\n\nEach boss also has a unique fighting style.\n\n1: The first boss is the easiest but still challenging, due to not having any ranged attacks but disabling upgrades. Uses a large sword and fights by dashing to the player and slashing after a short delay. 'Ship' ability is a localised emp that disables the upgrades the player has collected for a short duration. \n\nHow to beat:\nAt first the boss has a sheild rendering them invulnerable, when the emp goes of this sheild is dropped as it disables everyones upgrades (and ranged weapons). The sheild can be destroyed with the player's melee weapon and then they are succeptible to regular fire between emp bursts.\n\n------------------Upgrades---------------\n\nMany different upgrades would suit the gameplay style suggested, however some ideas are:\n\nVariations of gunfire,  for example bullets split into two individual shots, rate of fire increased, bullets pass through enemies, splash/aoe damage\n\nSome abilities could be double edged swords, eg bullets penetrate enemies \n\nSome abilities could create unique gameplay such as the addition of a dash/movement types \n\nArmour abilities increase survivability through interactions, not numbers increase. Eg, sheild that deflects bullets to the side if they strike a set  degree arc from behind the player, dashes/blinks\n\n\n------------------End Game/Post Story Content-----\n\n'Pirate Lord Mode'\nFuck having a peaceful life, become a pirate yourself! \nUnlimited levels, limited lives. Get as far as possible raiding ships. Bosses occur after a set amount of levels and defeating them gives a life.\n\n'NG+'\nRestart the game from the beginning. Ship upgrades reset, jack upgrades are kept. Bosses are more difficult and have additional movesets. Standard enemies are given 1 random upgrade from the set resulting in sillier gameplay. "
6kv0bz,"""Kingpin"" - Economic Drug Trading RTS","I would like to see a game that is all about the drug trade.  I envision it as an isometric view of a city with an atmosphere similar to the old school game, Postal.  \n     You start out as a low level street dealer just trying to hustle up enough money to buy bigger quantities of product, guns, bail money, etc.  You have to move your player around the city blocks to avoid cops and jack boys while finding the most lucrative corners to sell dope on.  Once you stack enough loot to buy a stash house and big enough quantities of drugs, you'll naturally become a higher level dealer.  The great part about this is you'll now be selling to other low-level street dealers, which could actually be other real people playing the game online.  \n     Now you run your street corner/block/housing project/etc.  You get to adjust the price of your goods based on supply and demand, don't get too greedy though or else your dealers might start buying from other wholesalers around town.  Oh, you just found out one of your boys is buying cheaper product from homie down the street?  Call a hit on him to cut into his profits.  Your neighbor just snitched on you?  Lay low while you switch stash houses.\n     You've put in work, hit licks, and grinded until the sun came up.  Now what?  You need to think bigger.  You need to get a plug.  Now you start moving in product from other cities where you get it for way cheaper.  Pretty soon, you might be pushing out other dealers simply because they cannot compete with the quality and price of your product.  You run the city now.  All the dope being sold here goes through you.  \n     You want more though, it's not enough.  You have expensive habits.  Those flashy cars you bought don't pay for themselves, but they did attract more customers, along with more police.  You've stacked up enough money to buy all the tools you need to start a small cartel.  You buy a plane and get to the source of the product.  Now you are bringing in hundreds of kilos at a time.  You are officially a heavy-hitter who's dope is going into every major city.  You only got to this point because you made the right moves at the right times.  If you ever slipped, you would've been locked up or even worse, killed (permadeath).  You're a Kingpin.  Don't rest on your laurels though, you are a huge target.  Everybody wants a chance to be the big guy so naturally, there's a high price on your head.\n     I know this is an ambitious title, it needs to be made though.  It would be wildly popular, guaranteed."
6kulyz,Would any of you be interested in this game if I made it?,"Hi,\nSo I currently have an idea for a game which I would like to create however I just wanted to get other people's opinions on it to see if they think it would be fun or if there would be any flaws etc.\n\nOkay so basically, the idea of the game is where it is a 1 v 1 with another player (might have 2v2 available later) and you both have a wizard. You can customise this wizard before the game to give him things such as boosts etc, as well as being able to change cosmetics.\nEach player takes in turn to lay a card down on the table (you have a deck of cards which you can customise beforehand) however this card must be above or below the other player's card that they just played. You can also change the suit if you play the same number but of a different suit (similar to UNO). Here's the difference though: if the other player cannot play a card, your last card played will use it's ability. Each card will have it's own ability (such as cast a fireball at the other player's wizard and deal damage etc).\n\nI was thinking about adding in something like pets so when a player cannot play a card both player's pets attack each other and they could all do different things or something.\n\nPlease could anyone willing answer me these questions:\n1) Do you like the idea of the game?\n\n2) What do you think could be improved?\n\n3) Do you like any of the features that I described?\n\nThanks!"
6ks429,Volcanic island fantasy,"Last time I was starting a game, I came here for advice and you guys had some good ideas, so I figured I'd try again :)\nI've been thinking of making a small third person open world game that takes place on an island with a volcano in the middle. The player character would use some kind of water bending type magic. The end goal of the game would be to get to the top of the volcano, so difficulty would progress in rings up the mountain. Down by the shore there is the most water and the least lava. At the top, the opposite. So far that's about all I have. Any thoughts?"
6krm10,Would This Make A Good Game?," So I've learned that I usually come up with good game ideas, but they would be too expensive, or too complicated controls (which I still don't think it was complicated but whatever) so I wanna know if you'd play this. \n\nA game where you have to eat, drink, buy gas, etc. But you're an assassin. You would start off as a hood rat, and paid poorly. You wound meet people and would be offered drugs and things, if you take them your character MIGHT become addicted, same with other things. There would be no main goal or story. You choose your path. You can become a political assassin, mafia hitman, or just a random assassin. You can travel to different parts of the world. (like America could have Detroit, New York City, LA, and Las Vegas. Then there could be Dubai, Cape Town, London, rural Japan, etc) The closest thing to a main goal is to become better, and richer. You could learn martial arts which would let you counter like in the Arkham games when they get close, but usually you'll be at a distance. \n\nTime actually goes by also. Not real time but there wound be Summer, Spring, Winter, and Fall. If you die you have to respawn at the start of the day, unless you quick save. If you go to jail or prison you can choose to actually live day by day, which can make you allies, but can also make you enemies, or you can choose to skip it, which means you won't make any allies there, but you can skip any time, so if you find an armsdealer who has a gun you want, you friend him, but still have 5 years left, you can skip it, and keep him as a friend. Depending on people you meet, and side with, plus how long you we're in prison, will set how easy it is for you to get more work outside of prison.\n\n The game starts you at 21 and you stop aging at 28, but the game continues. There are some default people you meet, or kill, but for the most part it's all randomly generated people. There are default traits that are randomly given to every person, so if you decided to talk to them you can learn about them. Maybe they work from 7am to 3pm, goes to church every Sunday, drug problems, and lives with wife And kids. OR they accept disability, they never leave home, alcoholic, has no family. \n\nYou can be silent or loud. You could have to kill the town drunk, or the don of a mafia family. It could be an easy in and out, or it could turn into a shoot out. The game never ends and you could just assassinate forever and keep getting richer.\n\nIt would start you in a shit apartment with little to no food, some of which is expired, a handgun, bad clothes, and no car. You could eventually be living in Dubai, penthouse, Lamborghini, and 100 million dollars in a back account in Mexico. \n\nThere would also be bars and clubs to go to. There are underground ones that are actually online, where you can meet other players, ask for tips, or hire them to come into your world and help. Or you can go into a normal club and hook up with a person from the club. \n\nThe game would be third person. It would be like Payday meets GTA meets Sims. \n\nCops will also remember you so you have to wear a mask and gloves. \n\nEdit: showed to friends and they asked these questions \n\nQ: Would it be open world\n\nA: yes but there wound be multiple maps. Like if you've played Destroy All Humans, you know you have multiple areas you can fly to.\n\n\n\nQ: What's the story on the character? Do you get to edit him or is he pre set?\n\nA: You can customize your character, pick traits, good and bad ones, like athletic but easily addicted. There might be like an opening cut scene of your home life but that's the only story. You can also be a girl if you want.\n\n\n\nQ: When you do that stuff like drugs, when you get addicted, what happens when you don't get anything in a while? And when you meet other players, can you straight kill them?\n\nA: You get sick, which would make your aim off and would lower your maximum health for like 30 days, so instead of having 100 as max, it might be 80 if you are getting clean from pills but like 20 from meth. Pot wouldn't effect you negatively unless you are on parole. And no you can't kill others unless you two agree to do a job together, they come into your world, then you can, or if you go to there's. This way you could do a job, collect some money, get to the drop off, and kill them so they don't get a share. But if you die while that happens, you wake up the next day and your character says, ""What a crazy dream""\n\n\n\nQ: Would there be an online assassination gamemode where people could go head to head and others bet ion it? Would there be racing? \n\nA: To keep with realism, no to the assassination gamemode, but there might be like paintball which you could play online or against NPCs. Same with racing. \n\n\n\nQ: Would there be loan sharks? \n\nA: Yes. Also, if your character is a drug addict, some dealers will sell you stuff even if your broke but there longer you wait to pay, the more it goes up, so you might want to just kill them instead of paying, but once they are dead, they are dead.\n\nQ: If you don't pay back a loan shark, would they like come and destroy your stuff?\n\nA: Yes, and you can also so stuff like set up a credit card, and if you owe them money, they will take your car, and house. \n\n\n\nQ: So about the jobs, can you give me an example?\n\nA: Starting out it would be like, abusive father beats daughter, daughter wants him dead for 300 and she doesn't care how. You could accept, deny, or bargain, bargaining works better as you become more infamous. But later in the game it could be you have to assassinate a mayor for 50k and you HAVE to shoot him while cameras are live. Or like take out a mob don but you have to sabotoge a plane to make it look like an accident. If you mess up you can take him out normally but only get 25k. If he escapes he can go into hiding and you can give up on the contract, or find him. If you give up you lose respect, if you accept, you could get more depending on the person who gave you the contract plus how dangerous it was. Not all future ones will force you to do specific things. A lot is just kill this guy by this date for this much. Here's his info. Then you follow him to work and stuff, watch them, the decided how to do the job.\n\n\n\nQ: What's the characters name? Or does he/she have one?\n\nA: It would either be like saints row where they have a nickname, or you can pick out names out of a name bank, we would have it where  NPCs will say those names. But after becoming more infamous you'd have the option to choose a nickname or alias to go by. You don't have to but it's recommended.\n\n\n\nQ: Could Satan be a nickname? And will there be different nicknames for different personalities or actions? Or is it all the same?\n\nA: Maybe like Diablo, or the devil. And yes. Depending on the way you play, and depending on if your given a nickname or if you get to choose. If you get to choose, you'd have a word bank. If your given one it's how you play. So if you are a silent killer, you might be shadow. If you completely destroy everyone you encounter, you could be like El Diablo if your Mexican or the Reaper if your white. If everyone fears you and you are really good at dangerous jobs, it might be like Baba Yaga. If your personality is like bipolar, easily angered, etc. You could get like loose canon\n\n\n\nQ: Are you just an assassin, or would there be more? How would online work? \n\nA: Not all missions would be assassinations either, just most. There might be a contract you get to protect a mob boss. Someone you owe might hire you to help them smuggle stuff out of the country which you could do instead of paying them back. And neither of those missions are guaranteed to go well, so you would be able to hear the plan then decided to do it or not. Also, there's not always a guarantee that anything will happen. You could watch the boss all day and not a single thing happens. But some people could also be informants or undercover cops, so you never want to trust new guys. You could pay someone to set you up a back heist, you could hire other real people to help, go in alone, or hire computer characters. You wouldn't need online to play. For the most part it would be single player with co-op options and online game modes. Like once you hit a certain level of infamouscy you can go to the underground clubs to befriend or hire real players. But they won't all be in the same world, you have to accept them in. Then after that you could play forever with a partner, team, gang, or solo.\n\n\n\nQ: On lower levels, could you accept others offers online AND ask for help? Or would you have to reach a certain level to get the trust/popularity to get others to help?\n\nA: You'd have to be well enough known to be able to get to underground places which is the only online part to meet people to co-op with. Now, when your poor there might be bars and stuff to get help but it would be NPCs not actual players, and all the NPCs at these bars would be sloppy, and could backstab you. The underground clubs would be like a secret hotspot for assassins in the game story, but in game logic it would be a place for people to meet. Also, you could dance and drink at the clubs. The dancing would be a quick time event.\n\n\n\nQ: Why would you dance? Like does it have a purpose or just for the hell of it? \n\nA: Cause your character would have a fun stat which if is too low the character gets moody and becomes an asshole. Same with pleasure stat. There would be traits to help. Like the trait greed could make you have fun when you get money, psychopath is fun from killing, adrenaline junkie would be you have fun from exciting and dangerous things. \n\nPleasure isn't a big one, sex would be easy in the game cause of prositues and clubs. But if you want it slowed you could have the gentlemen trait which is like you like to take things slow, the scared lover which means you don't have good experience so you don't crave love as much, or the loner who isn't affected by pleasure. \n\nAlthough you can also fall in love, then if your loved one dies, your character, depending on the traits, may no longer seek fun and pleasure."
6kq2qq,"Arms in 2D - ""Gloves""","Hello!\n\nI had an Idea for a game and already got some basics of it finished.

The objective is simply a flag on the other side of the screen, nothing keeping you from going to it. You go to press the ""D"" key, as that usually makes you go right, and BAM! Game Over. Solution: Right arrow key ;).\n\nI just think it's sort of a neat idea to mess with the typical gamer. Let me know what you think and feel free to use the idea."

6kjbh9,Multiplayer Survival + Cooking Simulator,"The title doesn't really say much about what I'm thinking, so allow me to elaborate.  I'll try to only talk about the basics of the mechanics that I think would go well with it so that I can give the developer as much freedom as he/she wishes.  If someone does take this up: you have complete freedom to reject any of the ideas as you see fit, as I do realize the suggestions I've written below may be constraining.\n\nThe core of the game I'm thinking of is based around cooking.  However, to do that, one must first gather ingredients from the surrounding environment (I'm thinking like Rust or No Man's Sky style).  The player can proceed to do two things with the food that he collects.  He can cook it (more on that in a second) or plant it in a garden (also more on that later).\n\nI'm thinking that the cooking mechanisms work like this.  At the house that you made (house-constructing mechanics are the developer's choice), you can go to the kitchen and cook food.  Of course, food gives you health, but when you find a recipe, the food made by that recipe gives you small stat buffs.  There are a set amount (perhaps like 100) procedurally-generated recipes that no one knows, only the computer (I'm thinking that, every time someone finds a recipe, the computer generates another, so that there are always 100 available unknown recipes to find, in this case).  One must experiment with the food he has to try to find these recipes.  Each time he does an experiment, he gets food as a result and an indicator of how close that food was to an undiscovered recipe.\n\nHe can cook it like so, or he can plant it in a garden.  If the player constructs a garden and he plants some food that he gets instead of cooking it, he can receive a steady and (relatively) safe supply of food to experiment with.  However, other players can break into your garden and steal your food and seeds (ways on how to avoid that are up to the developer).\n\nLast idea is that, if you are killed, the person who killed you can acquire a small portion of the amount of recipes you know.  The combat system behind this doesn't have to be too complex, just basic shooter mechanics.\n\nIn essence, think cooking simulator meets Minecraft meets Rust."
6kj9zy,[AAA] RPG-style NFL coaching game,"Basically what I'm envisioning is a version of Madden that's played as a Bioware or Telltale-like RPG. Instead of controlling players directly during the games, it would be heavily story-driven with the player as the head coach of a failing NFL team; interacting with players, fellow coaches, fans, and other characters mainly through dialogue. During the course of a season you must manage your team through tough losses, player scandals, injuries, and criticism from media and fans while you try to lead your team to victory.\n\nEssentially, the game would consist of three areas\n\n\n**Regular Season Games:** \n\n* These are the big ""story missions"" that make up your core game-play. You set your lineup of main players in the beginning and the game itself proceeds according to a script, based off of your lineup and decisions you make at key moments. These could be crunch points in the game where you must select which play to run, whether to pull an injured player or have him play on, challenge a questionable call, direct a player to play dirty, etc. \n* Most games would be winnable, but losing would not make you fail that mission, the consequences of your loss would play out later.\n \n**Off the Gridiron:** \n\n* These would be player-NPC interactions or missions that either help or hurt your season as a whole and your performance in future games. \n* You may be faced with a mission where a player has been accused of cheating or arrested and you as a coach have to face the press and owners. Poor dialogue choices or interactions will hurt your team's popularity, and your own reputation score. \n* You may be given the option to cheat or use performance enhancers on your players, which could either payoff or trigger a crisis later on if you are caught. \n* Finally, there is also team management, where you direct how your players train to adjust their stats in order improve your chances of winning. \n\n**Post Season**\n\n* This portion of the game plays out the same as the regular season games, but failure here means the game is over.\n* To advance to this stage of the game, you must have won enough of your regular season games to qualify, otherwise you will face an Xcom-like season failure cut-scene after your final defeat. And, you must have kept your reputation and team popularity score high enough to not get fired. If you were caught cheating, had too many public outbursts at players, officials, and the media during your dialogue choices, or otherwise sullied your own reputation you can end up fired and it's game over. \n* This is where your decisions made earlier on the field and off the field can come back to bite you in the ass. Injured players might miss critical plays, or get season-ending major injuries, and force you to take bigger risks to win. If you have history of playing dirty or getting irate at officials, you might receive more penalties. Poor team popularity and reputation will also negatively affect your team's performance. \n\n\n\nUltimately, there would be multiple ways to win. Effective coaching and NPC interactions can leave you winning with a healthy, popular team, and as a respected coach. Or, you can run your players into the ground by playing through injuries, mar your team with scandals, and let your reputation take nosedive in the name of winning.\n\n"

6kgae7,Simplistic Persistent World Multiplayer thing,"My idea:\nYou are in a ship with 4 engines, floating about in space (2D). In order to keep this ship moving, you must go from planet to planet, collecting 2 resources:\nWick and Fuel.\n\nFuel is what lets you move, and Wick:\n1. Lets you burn the fuel faster\n2. Allows you to communicate with other ships over long range.\n\nWithout Wick, you can only communicate over short distances, and fuel only burns quite slowly, so it is important to have both resources so you can both communicate outside of your current gridspace and travel fast.\n\nOne thing that would be nice to have is a ""Wick-Fuel Mixer"" slider, where you can regulate how many Fuel units are burned per Wick unit and the like.\n\nIdeally, each of these resource ""nuggets"" would be focused in certain areas on a huge space grid map, be limited in amount, and once drained of resources, stay drained.\n\nUsing long-distance communications should use up Wick, the longer the message and communication distance, the more Wick is used.\n\nAlso, players should be allowed to trade with each other, exchanging Wick for Fuel and Fuel for Wick, so as to make player-to-player interactions not completley worthless.\n\nAs well as this, there should be penalties, where if you run completley out of both Fuel and Wick, you will be forced to stay adrift until someone stumbles upon you. There will be a countdown until ""death"", whereupon you are restarted in a random location.\n\nMore complicated stuff:\nClans. People can form them (for a tiny fee, maybe something like £0.25) and they, along with everyone who joins, can communicate amongst themselves instantly. (to make up for a deliberate lack of a friend's list)\n\nPlayer-to-player collisions. In order to give a somewhat passive and boring game a slight competitive edge, how about allowing player craft to collide? This could result in tactics such as ""boxing-in"" rival clan members and forcing them out of sectors, along with some other stuff."

6k9rwm,Simple Task Management Pet Collector Game,"Hello. I am unsure if anyone here can relate, but it can be very hard for some people to remember or even feel motivated enough to do even simple tasks.\n\nThis is a game geared towards individuals who struggle with mental limitations.\n\nHabitica has a good idea, but they fail to include individuals who do not work well under stress.\n\nThis game will be fully positive reinforcement with a toggle for negative reinforcement if desired. Life is stressful enough, the last thing some people need is more stress from a game that is supposed to help motivate them in real life.\n\nThe game will have ways to create and customize tasks and set up a reminders system for them. Completing a task before the reminder will result in a larger reward, while the longer you wait the less the reward will be. Not doing a task will not punish you in game unless you want it to.\n\nRewards will be in game currency and unlocking of certain pets and items.\n\nWhat I am not sure about is if I want to include a customization avatar that can be dressed up and or a isometric house that can be expanded and furnished. Or if it would be better to have the pets as list items like on browser pet sites vs seen walking around the house like in games like NekoAtsume. However I do feel it would help to include ways of interacting with your pets to increase a affection bar. It may just be for aesthetic value vs anything in game.\n\nThis game is meant to be cutsie in style overall. And simple enough for ease of use and understanding, but also complex enough to engage interest and motivation outside of the game.\n\nAs far as platforms go I feel this game would be most useful as a download, where it can access and create notifications. It might be easier to make it just for phones (ios and android) vs for computers as well (mac and pc).\n\nI am am comfortable with vector art so could create imagery and designs. However, it would be highly helpful to have others who would be willing to help with feature ideas and perhaps coding. I can code anything but Java with time and research. I just can't seem to wrap my head around the Java language.\n\nRight now I am just looking for interest and ideas on designs and lay out so I have a general idea on how the game should look and  layout so I can start creating vector visuals.\n\nThank you for your time.

6k9l4h,Pictionary Battles!,"I've had this idea for a while realizing there is not a single pictionary game i could find on PC from any game distributor or even website, besides a spanish one called ""Pinturillo 2""\n\nSo it's basically just pictionary, you have a multiplayer lobby with a chat function and color pickers etc. BUT my catch for pictionary battles is that there are cards with themed packs (no micro transactions, just unlock the card packs by playing the game and earning coins) But lets say you start a game with the movies pack, every player will be distributed 5 or 7 cards at the beginning all with names of movies, then each person rolls dice to see who will go first, if 2 people roll the same dice they have a mini rock paper scissors battle. 1st round begins, the player drawing chooses the card they want, and have the option of replacing a card they don't like, which they cannot use the new one until their next turn. There is a _ _ _ kinda thing at the top, and people in the loby guessing must type the name into the chat, whoever gets it first gains the most points, 2nd fewer, and so on. You also have a health bar, guessing wrong will damage you, when you ""die"" you can no longer gain points, but you can guess the correct word to sabotage other players, smoking out the screen, covering up the word _ _ _ part, damage them, replace their cards, etc. Doing these sabotages successfully will give you the chance of being revived back into the game. Settings will allow for timed matches, limitless, team battles where people can draw together, score caps etc. You will also have a little avatar that reacts to the game occuring, which you can customize with outfits and such with the coins you earn from the games, also coins used for card packs, card backs, ui themes, new sabotages, different brushes, colors, and more.\n\nI have a pixel ui in the works, but i have no idea how to code...\n\nLet me know what you think!"

6k2w5y,RTS Mixed With FPS,"Concept: Online RTS style commanding and map combined with FPS. Whitelisted (or not) ‘Commanders’ can make allies or enemies for their country, move troops and resources, send out reconnaissance, and provide buffs during battles. ‘Soldiers’ (any player with the game) can partake in a battle on the ground, either selecting a battle on the map that requires troops or being placed in a random battle where they are required.\n\nI have a more detailed description here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M6E126WMzHkjh0etQ8viIksAik9TQpBdpmCUZpsXc98/htmlpresent\n\nOne thing I liked about this idea is the player's ability to play as their own country, which is a nice change from constantly playing as USA vs. (insert here). It would also be neat to see what countries ally with who. I would expect the smaller countries to unite against the larger powers: that would be cool to see.\n\nMajor cons I can see with this game is the massive amount of assets needed. For example in order to have every country's soldiers be accurately equipped, many MANY models and such for weapons, vehicles, etc will be needed. \n\nAnother thing would be how overpowered some countries would be at the beginning, namely the US as I expect the majority of the people playing would want to join them.\n\nMaps would also be an issue; there are lots of environments in the world, so there would have to be a few dozen generic maps at least, and my idea of having a map specifically for every capital city is very unlikely.\n\nHowever I think this game does have a very slight chance, but only for an extremely dedicated development team, hence why it's tagged as Dream. It may also be translated into a WW2 or sci-fi game of some sort. Anyways, thanks for reading and let me know what you think!"

62831k,Alternative take on a Sci-fi Horror game,"In this game the player character is a hyper realistic android aboard the crew of a space ship. At some point during each of the game's missions the crew will encounter alien life. Unbeknownst to the poor humans, the player's primary objective is to ensure the organism returns safely to an off-world research facility at any cost. Yes, it's basically the horror movie classic Alien distilled into game form. Here are some ways I believe we can improve and iterate upon the model.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI see each level starting out on a different ship (these could be procedurely generated if need be) To kick off the action quickly, we open up in medias res, after whatever malicious entity we'll be containing has already gotten on board the ship. We are treated with a small vignette of the crew going about their business, and then the first victim is killed off in a flurry of violence. You can have this take place in full view of the other crew, or perhaps they only hear a distressing radio signal, or someone finds the grisly scene and alerts the others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is where we hand control off to the player. We see a quick digital overlay informing the player of their updated mission objective, and a reminder that the humans are completely expendable. The player gets a top down perspective of the room they are currently in as well as a ""fog of war"" style view of the rest of the ship that they can pan and zoom with the mouse. The first thing the player should be doing here is trying to gather information about the monster. Size, number, appearance, feeding habits, ability to reproduce, and even special abilities will all affect the overall strategy leading to the eventual containment of whatever is terrorizing the ship.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can imagine slotting in some standard monster tropes here, a play on the xenomorph being all to obvious, but other attributes could include damage resistances or healing factors, active camouflage, enhanced strength to break through doors that haven't been reinforced, or multiple creatures with pack tactics. Maybe robotic or psychic enemies that would compromise either the player or the crew's ability to out-strategize the creatures, forcing them to rely on the other for the bulk of the heavy lifting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, I'd like to see things progress more or less in real time, while different levels will see the player assume different roles in the roster, each with it's own permissions and clearances. Acting outside of these boundaries will raise suspicion in any crew that witnesses these acts, so there is a stealth aspect as the player moves around the ship and makes their preparations. As an android, the player will have the benefit of superhuman speed and strength, but again, it's important that the player try to keep these activities away from prying eyes. Once the crew's suspicion has been raised against the player, they will no longer be able to make requests of the crew, limiting the number of containment options. Alerted NPC crew will also try to access the ship's data logs, which can reveal to them their less-than-mission critical status, which will turn them fully hostile against the player, forcing the player to contend with them as well as the monster, who they will invariably be trying to kill as quickly as possible.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIdeally however, you will be able to uphold the masquerade and work with the crew to seal the monster in a confined space that still leaves the crew with access to the key parts of the ship (the bridge, the engine room, cryosleep) whatever they may be. These can change from mission to mission, keeping strategies varied and fresh as the game advances. I'd also consider having an armory or other means of arming the player, with specifically nonlethal weaponry. Depending on the creature there may be other ways of disabling it such as freezing it or overloading it's electrical components. Some monsters may not be containable in the traditional ways, capable of destroying doors or moving through small vents, or even short range teleportation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the end, player performance can be broken down in a number of ways, including completion time, crew alerts, crew members killed, and damage done to/by the monster. I'm sure there are others that aren't coming to mind now, but these figures can be combined into an overall level score that gives the player an indication of how well they did in general, as well as a goalpoast for future playthroughs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm happy to hear any comments or criticisms at this point as well as thoughts on ways to expand the existing systems and ideas for creatures abilities and weaknesses."

625ahk,For fuck's sake stop with the simple ideas!,"**Do not fear** making big unrealistic ideas or **whatever else you want** to post.\n\nThere is no such thing as a game idea's viability here. Thinking that someone is going to pick up your idea is equally unrealistic. People care about their own stuff, the only thing you can do is help them with your own thoughts on things.\n\nWhether its **a few random thoughts** or a 40 page game design **Thesis**, as long as **its interesting** it can be useful.\n\nI love well done MMO ideas. MMO's are complex things with lots of things getting into them, they have economies, player interactions, progression systems, world exploration. Lots of interesting mechanics and systems interacting together so when someone come with a MMO idea they have their own perspective on how things work. They are much more valuable to analyze. There is a reason I am always lurking /r/MMORPG way more then here.\n\nYou know how I use this subreddit?

6256y9,"Stealth / Escape game. No saves, no respawns. Third and First person. Please read details - let me know what you think.","Hi r/GameIdeas ,\nLately I've been thinking about this idea for a game I'd pay $100+ just to play, however I cannot find any game like it. I'm bored at work, drinking coffee so I figured I'd lay out a rough draft for all of you to see. Let me know what you think - Good ideas / bad ideas, or just general thoughts of this idea.\n\nIf any of you know a game like this, please for the love of God tell me, because I've been dying to get into a stealth game lately.\n____________________________________________________\nThird Person/First Person Stealth Escape Game\n\n	**General Overview:**\n\nThis game is not a “click randomly and try to escape” game like on mobile devices or pc. This is a game where the *player controls a character*, and through trial and error, finds a way to escape the situation. Stealth and critical thinking are a key role here, with emphasis placed on both aspects, rather than one or the other. \n\n \nNo saves, no respawn points. Pauses are allowed. \n\n\nThe 4 difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard, Extreme) do not vary with AI difficulty, but rather length in time. To beat the game on easy, I would like to think it would be about 1.5-2 hours long of gameplay. Average would be about 3 hours long, Hard and Extreme could take to an upwards of 5-6 hours. So in theory, the game is short, however to complete each mode would take some great time. (More details on this in “story”.)\n\n\nWalk, tip toe, run, jump, crouching, crawling, climbing, jumping and grabbing onto ledges with fluidity and realism. No obscene or unrealistic jumping heights, running speeds, things like that. Strictly boiled down to what the average person can do. Control breathing for situations where you need to be absolutely quiet.\n\n\nNo control tutorial – Every action you can do will be displayed within the first room. From then on, only button hints will show (press x to do this, press c to do that, etc.)\n\n\n**Story:** \n\n\nThe playable character (teenage / early 20’s, boy or girl.) is abducted in an act of sex trafficking. How it happened I haven’t thought about. However, you (the playable character) wakes up in a room or a cell. This is inside a giant complex (with an outside portion). Through stealth and critical thinking skills, with AI that are doing their jobs within a normal “shift” (guarding the complex, watching video cameras, taking a break, etc.) you must simply escape. The objective is to leave the grounds completely – that is survive and escape the complex and outside portion.\nHow to escape is up to the player themselves: manipulate the environment by moving objects to climb higher, find keys or tools to break open or expose new rooms and different areas. Distract the guards by throwing objects / making noises. Hide in objects such as barrels or crates. Operate machinery to open up new path ways to go. It’s essentially a free “open world” game within the confines of a single complex and outside grounds.\n\n\n( I do not want killing guards to be an option, however this is just a draft so I may take this option back but place penalties instead.)\n\n\nThis is where the **difficulty levels** come into play: \n\n\nEasy Mode: 1 ½ - 2 hours long. You make it to a certain point within the compound, and can escape.\n\n\nNormal Mode: ~3 – 3 ½ hours long. You make it past the point of the 2 hour game mode, then there are more areas to explore / puzzles to solve which unlocks a route to freedom (which, it isn’t just a free pass… the route is clear but you need to be stealthy and sneaky enough to do it.)\n\n\nHard / Extreme Mode: upwards about 6 hours long. These game modes require you to be put in great risk constantly, which some of the areas you have already explored during easy and normal mode, while introducing even more areas or puzzles, and really putting the player to the test. \n\n\n**Options/Gameplay:**\n\n\n-	No mini map, or map at all for that matter (unless you find one). This reinforces the critical thinking part, the player must recognize and be able to trace back steps, know the directions they are going. What rooms they are in, what they’re called, etc. The idea is to really make the player feel lost within the environment.\n\n\n-	First person and Third person mode: I know third person mode can give the advantage of looking around corners, where as first person mode can give the advantage of inspecting things up closely.\n\n\n-	No saves, no respawns: this is supposed to give the player the feeling of every choice counts. The player should constantly be thinking “If I do this, I could die / the guards could be alerted / this pathway will be blocked” etc.\n\n\n-	Subtitles : This can be useful for picking up information that guards say – anything from schedule to key placement, where the most guards are, where the least ones are. However, there will also be clues scattered to where you can find this information. How to obtain it is all up to the player.\n\n\n**Characters:**\n\n\n-	Main Character: Boy or Girl, customizable in the aspects of Clothing and looks. There are no special skill sets, level ups, anything like that.\n\n\n-	Guards: AI guards. Equipped with weapons, and possibly even dogs.\n\n\n-	Other captured people – these are people you can maybe catch information from, but generally they would keep to themselves (as in, no AI companions or anything like that.)\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\nThe player is put to the test in this stealth / puzzle hybrid game. The ending is good because of the escape, however how long will the player endure each restart to finally reach the end goal? Imagine playing for 1 hour and 20 minutes on easy mode, almost nearing the end when suddenly a plan or escape route doesn’t work out, you’re caught and or killed. The game would almost force the players to think ahead of time, unless they just mindlessly make it through by sheer luck.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n**EDIT: I've been considering what you guys have been saying, and I'm happy some of you have been engaged in talking about this. Again, if you know any game remotely like this, please tell me. If not, anyone know any game devs? haha\n\n"
62493a,Hack.Basic (multiplayer hacking game),"Welcome to the XXI century, where everything and anyone are connected and hacking is as simple as typing nonsense on a keyboard, just like movies!\n\nThe main focus of the game is Multiplayer, so here's the idea: Every player will have his own terminal with his own set of apps, and the main objective (*depending on the mode selected*) is to **hack into the other player's terminals and destroy them**. They will also try to destroy your terminal, so you should update your software if you want to be safe.\n\nThe modes would be these (i have more in mind, but these are the must):\n\n1.- **Log.AR** (*Find the terminal that has the Log file and steal it. The winner will be the terminal that has the Log when the time reaches zero*).\n\n2.- **Fully XXI** (*Find and destroy other player's terminals. The last functional terminal will be the winner*).\n\n\n\nFirst of all, all the hacking here is ficticional, obviously. i write this because i had some misunderstandings when explaining all. So, here's the mechanics:\n\n*****\n\n**UPDATES**: \n\nEvery terminal will have an app (*tentative name:* **Heli-Miner**) that will serve as their main resource to get funds to update their software. The app is a idle-miner that will always work at any moment. Updating your software will consume both money and bandwith, so you can't update everything at any time. Choose wisely depending on your strategy. You can update the Packatch (*read next point*), Antivirus, Firewall, Heli-Miner and possibly, download PDF so you can improve your knowledge and typing to make more powerfull viruses (*read last point*).\n\n*****\n\n\n**HACKING**: \n\nEvery terminal will have an app (*tentative name:* **Packatch**) that will serve as their ""contact"" with the exterior world. What the app does is to catch every sended package on the LAN (*terminals will send packages even if players don't want to*). The player must select and decrypt a package in order to get data from other player's terminals so he can hack them. But be aware, player's can fake packages by sending viruses (*negative powerups*) that if you decrypt them, you will have trouble. (*read next point*). In case your antivirus is up-to-date, it will pop-up an advice saying that it blocked the virus.\n\n\nOnce you have the data, you can begin the attack. **But how?** You can:\n\n\n1.- Connect directly to the terminal without IP bounces, but risking yourself to be detected so easily. When trying to log into the target terminal, a minigame will appear (*i could explain it too, but too much text*).\n\n\n2.- Same as above, but with IP bounce. This will give you a lot of time until the antivirus or firewall can detect you.\n\n\n3.- Send a virus directly to that terminal that will open a port for you. Once the port is open, you can connect without much trouble, but you can still be detected.\n\n\n4.- Send a virus directly to that terminal that will try to run a command on the Command Prompt (*usually destruction of the terminal. You can't copy data with it*).\n\n\nOnce connected, you can either copy their files, steal some money or run destructive commands on the Command Prompt, only if you're not using 4th. And BTW, being on a 1 vs 1 match won't be a problem, since the ""minimum"" count of players will be filled with bots, so the gameplay won't feel as a *""who can hack more faster?"".*\n\n\n*****\n\n\n**VIRUSES**: \n\nI have mixed reaction towards this point, but whatever. Every terminal will have a **Notepad** and a **Virtual Box** that will serve as their ""laboratory"" where they can create and test viruses. Once the virus is finished, you can send it to the LAN as a package that other players will be unaware of. If someone decrypts it, you will receive bonuses depending of the virus you created (for example: bunch of pop-up Ads = Money for you). You can make more powerfull viruses if you download PDFs that will teach you how to make them. My reaction towards this is mixed, because it will get the feel that you're controlling an Avatar, not a Terminal.\n\n*****\n\nThe game would be totally 2D and platform target is PC. So on summary, the list of the terminal apps would be these:\n\n\nList of Apps |\n---------|\nCommand Prompt|\nHeli-miner|\nAntivirus|\nFirewall|\nPackatch|\nSoftware Updater|\nNotepad|\nVirtual Box|\n\n\n\nI'm open to suggestions to improve it."
623m2c,Need help making my idea less cliché.,"Hi guys!\n\nI'm a uni student and for my coursework I have been set to design an action adventure game.\n\nThe restrictions are this:\n- Can only contain 10 levels.\n- No hubs or open world.\n- Single Player only.\n\nNow the idea I've been toying with is setting it in a cyberpunk world where the protagonist must fight the 5 pillars of society; The Media, The Law, The Politics, The Science &amp; The Bank. \n\nAt the end of every second level the player will fight a boss belonging to one of these pillars. Then the player will make a choice affecting the game world for good or ill in future levels and also changing the story's ending.\n\nNow reflecting on this, this feels too cliché. Though I have already designed concept art and screen layouts for the design document I have to produce. So I feel it is a bit late to backtrack.\n\nAn idea I thought to make it less cliché is to make it more satirical. In a world of Trumps &amp; Brexits, I feel that might be a relevant niche topic to hit. So I would exaggerate the pillars to reflect this.\n\nDo you guys have any ideas to bounce off this to make it stand out?\n"

61zseo,2-4 Player survival/horror where you rely on your team mates or you lose,"So you have the players, currently I'm thinking between 2-4, but here's the thing, in this setting (I got this idea from Alien, so let's say a claustrophobic spaceship) each player has a unique set of skills and equipment.\n\n* Player 1: Ranged Weapon\n* Player 2: Melee weapon/shield ability\n* Player 3: Radar/motion sensor\n* Player 4: Systems interactions (Camera/doors/etc)\n\nIn this example I will use the Xenomorphs from alien and have only two players, P1 with the weapons/shields, P2 with the utility. P1 would have to keep a lookout while P2 gains access to the next area/sets up traps or routes for the Xenos or players to go. But then when they are moving P2 has to warn P1 of upcoming Xenos or possible dangers.\n\nThe players have to work together to identify where Xenos are coming from and defend against them, all while trying to survive/get to a checkpoint/safe area. I think this would be great for co-op play and making a team work together and have good communication skills.\n\nI don't know, mainly writing this so I won't forget later on, and I thought it would be a neat idea."
61yncg,The Shadow Knows,"How doesn't anyone make a game devoted to this great character ""The Shadow""? Originated from 1930 pulp novels, throgh radio-drama, up until Baldwin in 1994. Damn, Batman was copied from him!\n\nAnd still, no games. "
61wz65,An idea for a music themed JRPG,"A Music themed JRPG. In the setting music is magic, the winds carry a tune and the animals sing. Magic is performed by playing instruments, with different instruments altering the spells (more on this later).\n\nThe main plot follows around something called ""Silence"". It creeps in slowly, stealing the sound from the land. Keep in mind that even in real life something being perfectly silent is unerving, but in this world music is literally everywhere; sung by animals, carried by a breeze, the world itself has a natural rhythm. Finding a place where that music is gone and all sounds seem muddled and quiet? It would be down right unnatural in universe.\n\nThis is where the game's two area types would come into play. In music filled areas you have tons of magic. MP naturally regenerates between battles, plants grow huge enough that roots and branches can easilly be crossed, traversing a city on magical sidewalks or elevators are the normal way. Enemies are typically strong, but you have constant natural MP regen so you always have spells to blow. Think about an area filled with mini-bosses, but you fully heal your MP after each battle. These areas are more about combat and learning the area.\n\nNext come the silenced areas. The easy MP regen is gone, but the enemies are more typical RPG fair to balance it out. The big problem comes from the areas themselves. Once vibrant forests are wilted, cities of magic are drained of color and power. What where simple to traverse areas are now labyrinths as the roots and branches that made bridges have rotted away and elevators are inoperable. You're forced to take different paths, solve puzzles, or possibly sacrifice MP supplying enough magic to restore a path.\n\nCombat is rather typical JRPG fair, but instead of classes and weapons, you have specialties and Instruments. Character's would specialize in certain kinds of instruments; Percussion, Strings, Brass, Woodwinds, and Miss (smaller instruments for singers like Maraccas and Tambourines). Each character would have a set of abilities as well, the Singer as a White Mage for example. However, note that they are good with sets of instruments, not just a single one (strings instead of just Violins or Cellos).\n\nThe skills a character has are modified by what kind of instrument they're using. The Singer, for example, has a simple Healing Spell. When equiped with a Microphone, said healing spell becomes stronger. When equiped with a Tambourine though the healing spell would only give the base heal, but also provide a small Defence buff. When equiped with Maracas, the spell becomes AOE. Each different type of instrument will alter all of the character's skills in a similar manner; Violin makes skills quicker (would either be ATB or CTB), Cello makes skills AOE, Guitar makes skills more powerful, and Bass gives skills secondary effects as additional examples. This would give each character multiple different flavors to allow large customization with a smaller character pool to give each character plenty of time for development.\n\nNow for the problem that complicates things: I would want the soundtrack to be dynamic with the battles. The instruments your characters have equiped would be featured within the battle music, their instrument drops out when a character falls, no accompanent in Silenced areas so only the instruments of your characters are used by the battle theme."
61w38t,megman legends/zelda styled game without mega-story/ip baggage in a different setting -- good/bad idea?,"I like the idea of maintaining close combat, action based gameplay, as well as ranged types of stuff (maybe different characters?) I like the RPG like features seen in both the new Zelda and the Megaman legends series.\n\nI like the idea of really deep subdungeons, seeking out powerful items -- a lot of modern games don't have that suspense -- that challenge and REWARD of searching deep subdungeons and fighting off minibosses for hours seeking out the parts to an epic weapon or armor. I HATE mmos, because all the objects are just backgrounds. cant pick up a sword or lightsaber or gun in an ancient tomb -- no treasure in korriban, just endless respawning enemies. it feels so fake, no immersion, no excitement. endless punishment for literally zero reward. It focuses on the bad points of gameplay without any of the satisfying parts. the large worlds are empty.\n\nthe world should be either open, or semi-open (Somewhere between the standards of now and yesteryear). I think attention to the little things in areas, enough so to keep things varied and not feeling like a cut n' paste of a million emotionless characters with the same faces/things to say, makes it feel bigger than it actually is. and is more tasteful than just packing in endless fetch quests and predictable tropes, that at first were novel and new/fun, overcoming limitations, but now has become a 'requirement' without much innovation.\n\n*[GETS KINDA CRAZY BELOW]*\n\ninstead of using the story at all (It would be funny to have parody names, like Helga and SalmonDork or something stupid -- It would also be funny to break the 4th wall at times, and parody things like robot chicken [which might even be legal as parody of cultural known works]  and have like, a parody of OoT scene where 'link' bitch slaps Zelda, steals the ocarina, says he aint got time for that shit and slaps her ass then a 'thug life meme' gets overlayed on the screen with the music) -- or maybe if it was a different game and I could get away with it, a giant gorilla with a huge **** named Schlong, and when the fat hero fails to save the 'princess' she gets banged in a cutscene reminiscent of an Atari porn game, except she likes it and fast forward to the present they get married and fat plumber becomes the butler - it even makes fun of the fucked up cultural shit going on now irl.\n\nbut aside from parody, it wouldn't even need a great story -- just some ridiculous, hilarious B-grade parody plot with endearingly funny characters -- like 8-bit dot heroes but more lewd and troll-friendly.\n\n*[END CRAZY]*\n\nas long as the worlds 'feel' big they don't need to be with attention to detail. I think itd be cool with varied environments, planets that weren't even close to todays standard of size -- smaller, with less stuff but more intentional stuff with a lot of subdungeons that intersect\n\nfun boss battles would be important, and having lots of different equipment to find or build and power-ups and stuff. \n\nI'm sorry if I never end up able to make something like this and am just rambling. I probably am, but I just sit imagining this stuff and try to make little tetris games and stuff. I'm failing math, so its never gonna be more than a hobby. but one day if I succeed itd be cool. I'm kind of insane though."

You have to tell the body what types of cells to produce Helper T Cell, Cyto Cell, Daedritic Cells and use their specialized properties to help defend against invaders.\n\nThe counterpart is creating a Invader and attacking other players Immune Systems.\n\nArt Style would be Kurzgesagt's Flat Design Style."
61v80l,Crazy idea nuclear test simulator,"There is no game or simulator for testing nukes? My idea is build game where you just test nuclear weapons like u.s and soviet did in cold war era! You could pick side and take part them nuclear weapon testing program test real nukes real test site like nevada, bikini atoll, novaja zemlja etc and just for testing not killing millions of people!!! It included history campaing both side real tests like trinity, crossroads, castle bravo and so on and editor where you build you own test area, type of test and nuke! It included lots of science stuff of course and physics but not too hard to normal player to get inside and understand things. So that is my idea and who not love big explosions what u think?"

What I would desperately love as a game is one that, like Settlers, is a town building, resource management game... but then you are able to make weapons, armor, books, etc... to be used as resources for ""Heroes"" that live in town that can be assigned to go into dungeons and fight.  Based on their stats and the stats of the items and food and potions and stuff they have available to them in the town, they return (or don't return) with items and more % of a clear of that dungeon.  You create parties and move into new areas.  This is my dream game.  It's like creating Storm Wind from WoW and everything your town can offer to Heroes makes them better for The King's quests and his town.\n\nTell me something exists already!"
61sal7,Dark Souls pvp type...but altered into a pve style state... (Dream...Or possibly Experienced/AAA),"Basically, a person plays the game dark souls style, summons and all that, maybe without invaders, maybe with for added challenge...but instead of all the enemies controlled by AI, they're controlled by players, but with many restrictions in place. The first is you are given a random mob in the zone to control, once in control, if your mob is stationary you cannot move, if it patrols you can move along or within the pathing freely as you see fit but cannot move beyond just yet. Once the player comes within the proper ranges or sightings you will gain full control within an aggro zone, a circle of sorts you can move within, and to prevent hit and run tactics, grows smaller as you get closer to the target to force you into combat with the player instead of hitting and running off like a coward into other mobs. Your attacks and spells will run on cooldowns (a lot like moba and mmorpg games) to prevent ability or attack spams when not allowed or too overbearing in balance. In the end of the zone where a boss or a particularly strong mob resides, the best performing mob that did the most damage to a player, or a random player if no damage was dealt, will gain control of said boss mob. For those that don't like waiting, a spectating picture in picture could be used to see things from the player's perspective as they move through the zone.\n\nIt's not the most amazing idea, but I think a community could make this a really fun type of game, and I think the limits would be necessary to prevent players from just outright ganging up on a player by running off and all congregating into one small chokepoint and assaulting all at once."

61mldo,Platform Fighter Idea (like Smash Bros),"I've had plenty of ideas for video games but this one has been stuck in my mind in a semi-consistent way for a while so I think it's worth fleshing out. Here are some basic mechanics:\n\nWIN CONDITION:\n	Smash Bros like fighter (knock the opponent into the stage boundaries to score a point). Unlike Smash Bros you don't respawn when being knocked into the blast zone, you just bounce off them back onto the stage.\n\nOFFENSE:\n	Instead of giving your opponent damage which increases launch distance, hitting your opponent increases YOUR launch power (possibly shown by a meter on screen). This meter fills faster the more recent your last successful attack was to encourage aggressiveness and to reward combos rather than campy cherry-tapping. The meter increases launch power exponentially rather than linearly, meaning the next hit will give you more power than the last hit, providing a very satisfying feedback loop. Once the meter is full, your character becomes a more powerful version of theirself (think Goku going Super Saiyan or a Pokemon evolving) but only temporarily. \n	This system would create an unbalanced equilibrium in that better players would be rewarded more power as the match goes on, causing the worse player to eventually feel helpless. To slightly mitigate this, attacking a player with a higher meter increases your meter by more than it would normally to allow the losing player to make a comeback once they finally start landing hits.\n	Attacks can also be angled with the control stick and are not wildly different depending on direction so as to avoid doing unintentional moves as a result of incorrect inputs (like using Mario's up tilt when you mean to use Mario's high side tilt). Special moves would probably exist but I haven't thought about how those might function yet. Grabs will exist but I haven't fleshed those out either.\n\nDEFENSE: \n	Shields are bubbles like in Smash but do not break or shrink. Instead the shields have a ""sweetspot"" on the perimeter of the bubble. It's position relative to the center of the shield bubble can be moved by tilting the control stick while holding shield. If an opponent's attack hits the shield sweetspot directly, the shielding player incurs no knockback and can punish a laggy move. However, the shielding opponent will take knockback if their shield is hit further from the sweetspot, receiving higher knockback the farther from the sweetspot the shield is hit from. However, the knockback received is always lower than the knockback from a successful hit, and without suffering hitstun.\n	Hitting the shield button right when impacting a surface (except for blast zones) causes a ""ukemi"" (also commonly referred to as a ""tech"") where in hitstun will be instantly cancelled but the remaining knockback from impacting the surface is reduced. In Smash Bros. the knockback would also be cancelled, but this creates a ""cave of life"" scenario where stages with gratuitous ceilings and walls would make it near impossible to KO a player who can ukemi consistently.\n	There is no ""dodge"" mechanic as it would make shields redundant. Since shields can be grabbed out of, the way to dodge a grab would be to move out of the way normally rather than simply giving a player a period of invincibility (Street Fighter is still balanced without dodges, for example). \n\nMOVEMENT:\n	Players can run, walk, and jump. Unlike Smash, characters cannot double jump under normal circumstances (maybe some characters can have that as a special mechanic). Instead, everytime your character touches the ground they are allowed one jump. They cannot jump again until they have touched the ground. However, if you are knocked into the air by an opponent and haven't used your jump yet, you can use it in mid-air like a standard double jump. You can also instead opt to use your jump for a fast-fall (done by jumping while holding down). Fast-falling can't be done by quickly inputting down like in Smash Bros. Inputting in a downward direction (including diagonally down) while already on the ground causes your character to do a quick wavedash-like slide and consuming your jump. Although you are technically still on the ground you do not refresh your jump until the slide is over.\n"

61jvdy,Story Ideas for Platformer,"So I am currently looking for story ideas for my platformer game. The game I am hopping will achieve a Transylvania and Dark Souls feel. The game aesthetic is revolving around a black and white pallet and certain objects, for example a flame, to be in color. Ultimately I want the game to enhance a great platforming experience but I lack the creative ability to craft a story. If you guys could help that would be exceptionally great. Thank You!"

61915n,"Game-Portal Game (no, not Portal)","This is a web portal that hosts games, however you access everything from within a gamified site, perhaps similar to Second Life? The purpose is to take game portals to the next level because going through lists and lists of games is completely banal. There would be a core game that is the cornerstone the site, maybe an expanded [Sherwood Dungeon-like](http://www.sherwooddungeon.com/play.html) - and I would not take the design lightly since a rooted personality really needs to be developed for this to work well.\n\nI would suggest a team to be recruited from Game Jams to build first party portal-worthy games on a regular schedule (perhaps weekly), and (perhaps another team) to extend the host site game.\n\n*Lingering Questions*\n\n* Should an adult area be built to cater to a large portion of the audience?\n* Could advertising be built into the world like AAA games get branded, instead of videos and banner ads? Also, any way to do some affiliation and something like Groupon or free currency promotion systems?\n* Could a community communication system be developed to supersede chat and bulletin boards? Should a second site be developed to host legacy communication needs, and would that detract from the core site? At any rate, existing communication protocols should be made available, such as Reddit, voice servers, Discord, Twitch and so on.\n* There's going to be a core balance issue between the core game and submitted games in the eternal battle for the player's time.\n* Can older well-known games be up-converted or remastered?\n* How should current big name devs be approached?\n* Should Google Play, the App Store, or any other store system be integrated in some way?"
617ztt,"""Survivors vs Undead"" game that is just a mash-up of different games and modifications ideas.","I'm not pretty good at tl;dr-ing the idea of my whole 52-page design sheet with pretty bad knowledge of english, but lets start it from saying that it is my first try, so feel free to bash my head as hard as you want, the sooner - the better. If only this idea was good for 2017 year. \n\nBut seeing as Zombie-themed games make popularity with their own features that I might not like, this list worth a little try.\n\n###*The game is based on pretty simple Lore idea:*\n\n*In some town there's virus outbreak and good amount of people get sentenced to life after death.*\n\n*The Survivors of the first undead wave start to make it for themselves via any means that are decided by each map (so, no open world).*\n\n###The gameplay idea: \n\n*to make a game fueled by simply managed, fun&amp;easy-to-learn advanced system, which propagates the knowledge of your skills, abilities, situation around player and inventiveness.*\n\n*With that we could create any zombie-themed situation to be proud of. Be it Panic, Death, Win and Lose, Lurking in the Shadows, Hunting down Prey or even Barricading your ""soon-to-be-ransacked"" place to live a minute more.*\n_____________________________\nEach map type has it's own set of rules.\n\nEach map can have different ways to do the job for both teams so maps objectives can range anything from:\n\n* - ""cleaning"" space (prefix Survival);\n* - doing some work (prefix Objective);\n* - fleeing from the horde (prefix Hardcore);\n* - surviving the incoming horde (prefix Timed Objective);\n* - making a try to incapacitate undead force (prefix - Arena)\n* - and other sub-types\n\nLets take as example Objective (multiplayer) maps:\n\n0.  We have Survivor and Undead team, by joining the Survivor team you have chance to become starting zombie if no one chooses to be the Tier Zombie.\n1.  Players who die as Survivors become Normal Zeds. \n2.  The ones who **choose (were chosen) to be Undead at round start get fun classes to make it easier to \n""score a point faster"", not to ""win a round in a mere second because I killed the best players and the rest of Survivor team will die to them.""**\n\n##What's the ticket?\n\n1.  Advanced Ranged and Melee Combat systems that adore the whole ""Survivor's guns versus Undead Claws"" idea.\n2.  Core ideas utilise the strength and flaws of each and every of them takes their place in the game. \nAt the same time you will have ""even more advanced"" modular game systems - if you don't like them, you turn'em off.\n3.  Decent features for both PvP and PvBots.\n4.  Team-work features that encourage cooperation (Horde lines) and anti-camping ""features"" to prevent stalling the round.\n5.  Features being intuitive and easy to learn, needing medium skill to use them right and giving the hardest pay-off when mastered. At the same time all of features should be manage-able for ""first try"" players. I don't want Space Station 13 finger breaking way to play the game.\n\n##What's the reference group (where I've got the ideas)?\n\n1) ""Survivors versus Undead"" type of ideas :\n\n* Zombie Panic! (HL1 modification, Source: v1.0-v3.0)\n* No More Room in Hell (1-2)\n* Urban Dead\n* Resident Evil: Outbreak (Both files)\n* Left 4 Dead (1/2)\n* The Last of Us\n* Killing Floor\n\n2) ""Combat system"" ideas :\n\n*  The Culling\n*  Fistful of Frags\n*  Nosgoth (dead nowadays)\n*  Left 4 Dead (1-2)\n*  CS:GO (plainly to point something out)\n\n\n**What makes the game unique?**\n\n1.  Mashed ideas from different games into one system. It means you can diverse your playstyle in a type of games that does not always support the exact meaning of ""diversity"". (What I did seems pretty ironic for me - the most cliched game idea gets Advanced with features to the point of ""No-return"". But what I did - I just added a whole load of ideas on-top of a simple casual type of games.)\n\n2.  This game idea driven by gameplay and the ability to tweak things as you wish, for more go back into ""What's the ticket""\n(however, most of core ideas were made with emphasis on how they would work with their role in real game).\n\nThose features that add on a great layer of replay ability make it unique, not the plot or something. You can always slap a bad/good plot or two on these types of games.\n\nJust because good zombie themed plot-driven games or multiplayer niche zombie games were made long ago doesn't mean that we can't take a bunch of the best from those to make a new and unique in it's copy-paste way game.\n____________________________________\n\n\nP.S. If someone want to get the point of ""mixing those games"" into a one clear, I can post a (Mega) link of my ""design sheet"" into comments (if this makes things clear), but be prepared to see actual numbers and a bucket of ideas about ""making the game fun"" - it's my rant about the experience I've got in similar games and what I would want to avoid.\n\nI won't cry if someone steal one/two/every idea of any type, be it melee, ranged/whatever from the list. As I said, I'm not the first one to invent them. Are they even innovative by themself? I think nope, thats why I merged whole stuff, because why not?

6167jp,Untitled MMORPG Band-Build game.,"Ok, before I start, yes, I know this will never make it in today's world of gaming but it's an idea nonetheless. I was thinking of the good ol' days of sitting with my friends and family in the living room playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band and that got me thinking, what if someone made a MMORPG that relates to both games? \n\nHere is how it'd work: \n\nYou walk around a Destiny-like Tower planet thingy to find players to start your virtual band with. The members who found the team need to agree on three things, 1. Who else joins the band, 2. What the name of the band is, and 3. What genre of music to make. Once that is done and dusted you start by signing to a label and either making an original song or covering one of the games many on-disc songs. It basically carries on after that with some tragedies and blessings thrown in. Maybe around 7 different stories to randomly get when you start the game. \n\nAlso, a point I forgot to note that is crucial to the game, the game come with different bundles and all of them cost almost the same as each other. Here is a list of the bundles and prices (I can't invert US$ into Euros and etc...): \n1. Guitar Bundle-$70\n2. Bass Bundle-$70\n3. Drums Bundle-$85\n4. Lead Singer Bundle (option to come with Guitar or Bass w/ Mic and Mic stand)-$95\n\n"
615z0l,Crash Test Billy,"So I had this idea for a game where the goal is to design different vehicles/contraptions and use a crash test dummy to test them out. The game features a similar building mechanic as Besiege. The objective is to get the crash test dummy, named Billy, to the finish point, which would usually be hidden by some obstacles, You have to design a vehicle/contraption to help you achieve this. There will be many different parts in the game, and I plan to add new content as the game progresses. Aside from the mission mode, there will also be a sandbox mode, where you are free to create any contraption you want, and even place some ramps/walls in the test arena.\n\nI already started developing this game, and recently, I found out that a game like this already exists, well sort of. There is a game called Crashtastic, which has a very similar idea, but it seems like it was abandoned. I thought my idea was pretty good and unique, but now I'm not sure. What are your opinions?\n\nI posted my game on Steam Concepts, where you can see some gameplay footage.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889213242"

But instead of crushing it into a new ability, you are chunck loading new playable levels in the mobs.\n\nAnd additionally a way to return from interior to exterior levels.\nThis could also be a mechanic trying to get them to swallow things to further the interior levels.\n\nDepending on what they consume adds to the new interior world.\n\nThis would add a new mechanic that you would have to get the AI to swallow items and even you at a point to continue to further levels.\n\nPlay with the idea and see where it goes.\nI just haven't seen an layered level system that is contained in the game play mechanic.\n\n"

63dcai,Open ended sandbox. GTA minus the violence and x1000 the fun and activitiies,"Very recently I've come to the realisation that there simply isn't enough non-violent, fun games that everyone can play. This realisation came about when I discovered Tower Unite a while ago; a game where you run around a small hub hotel world, play games with friends, and visit each other's houses.\n\nI want to see a large, open world game that has a similar layout to GTA 5; a big city, small towns elsewhere, wilderness, desert, mountains, ocean, rivers, lakes and so on. This game, however, would be heavily limited in terms of violence, with punching and kicking probably being the most one could do, and the slapstick ragdoll physics of NPCs and players would nullify any violent undertones. \n\nMuch of the development effort would be directed towards making the city come to life, with NPCs walking around, chatting, even taking part in activities with each other and/or the player. There would be many enterable buildings including snack shops, clothing stores, car dealerships, hotels/houses if the player purchases a place, and so on. These places will offer the services they would logically have.\n\nOn top of this a lot of effort will then go to filling this world with games and activities that players can enjoy. They can be anything from racing to bowling to soccer to the inbuilt cinema and so forth. To cater to the largest possible audience this game would be both singleplayer and co-op.\n\nWith GTA minus the intense violence, this game could attract an enormous fan base from countless demographics. Hopefully someone taps into the currently untouched potential of non-violent, large scale video games."

633kvu,Above the clouds: The Floating Empire,"Basically the idea is... A creature has been hiding beneath the surface of the earth, unnoticed. This creature will eat and eat and eat, and grow and grow and grow. There is not limit to the size of this creature. One day it submerges from the ground to find more food. People spot him and try to kill him, only to be eaten alive. The creature will then grow. People realize that this enormous creature that is capable of swallowing cities whole is becoming a huge threat to the human economy and civilization. So scientists, mechanics, and researchers quickly develop a machinery that can lift cities from the earth and put them high up above the clouds. You take food, resources and money up with you. And bring as many people you can. You leave for the skies on Christmas day of 2089. You only bring basic resources with you such as: apples,oranges,grapes,oak wood, coal, oil, gas, and other fuels, you bring tons of water, salmon, chicken, beef, pork, broccoli, and trees which you plant on your floating islands. In the process of this with the discovery of these technologies you build hovering cars and create your own atmosphere and gravity on the islands. You stay on the islands for 900 years. During this time, occasionally you go down to earth to get more resources and you rediscover objects,resources and foods etc. You have to survive on the islands. Also dont forget the creature is still alive!!! It will jump up and swallow your islands whole. Beware, if you send people to get resources they might not come back...This is the basic story line.\n\nCreate islands...Trade with your islands and your friends... Discover and Rediscover...Create new machinery and weapons...Keep your economy going...Design your own islands...Create a vast empire of floating worlds...Colonize new islands...Explore earth, after 900 years!!!! (what changes await)...Create a travel system between your islands...farm...plant...grow...  THE ONLY LIMIT IS YOUR IMAGINATION!!!\n\n"

You manage your development teams, money, influence, production facilities, relations with other companies and your consumer base. You build consoles, software, games, and services, make acquisitions or get acquired yourself. You buy stocks and make hostile takeovers, deal with the law and government regulations, make decisions and react to event through a similar system to Victoria 2.

62ysnd,[MMORPG]Player Run Dungeons,"This was inspired by the anime Overlord, I like the concept of player made dungeons with all the customization. Dungeon Keeper, roguelikes and dungeon crawlers are some other inspirations.\n\n##Of Dungeons, Towers and Crystals\n\nThe basic setup is there are dungeons or towers with multiple floor levels(down or up) and are of a particular elemental type: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Dark, Light and they generate a crystal of that element. They are controlled by a group like a guild and their organization structure is based on its type where for example in a fire dungeon the leader and ranking is decided by regular fighting tournaments while the water dungeon is done democratically by election and the Wind might not have any organization at all with all being free to do whatever.\n\nA dungeon generates crystals of its type on each floor based on amount of players on it(popularity) and based on dungeon type, where for example a fire or dark dungeons will increase based on the number of players killed. Or in a earth dungeon on the amount of resources not collected by the players(so all about secrets and puzzles).\n\nA dungeon to increase its power and add new floors and buildings uses crystals as currency. The higher the floor numbers the more demanding and varied the requirements of crystal types.\n\nEvery certain amount of floors(5-20 based on total dungeon depth) there are relays that collect the total amount of crystals from the previous floors every day and send up to the next relay in a set number of days. 1 day for the first relay, 3 days and subsequent relays adds +3 days.\n\nTo get crystals you do so by raiding this relays with the deeper you go the better the payoff. Raiding the final dungeon heart gives you a percentage of total stock of all crystals collected including what you stocked from raids, if that stock is lower then the requirements to get a new floor you dungeon heart gets massive damage that is very costly to fix. If you get repeatedly damaged your dungeon will get destroyed.\n\nOn every floor there is also has a certain amount of pool of points that the dungeon master/guild can use to customize the dungeon that can be used for monster spawners, traps or one life special monsters. The pool increases the deeper you go and on ever 5th floor there is a boss room where the pool is increased greatly. You don't necessarily need to make this a room with a boss as you can use the pool to make puzzles and trap rooms that might necessitate specialized party members.\n\nThere is a restriction on the number of players that can be on the same floor. There are multiple gates around the floor that let only let one party in(max 10 players) and after that it closes, to be available again the party needs to continue to the next floor. They open to a random place on the next floor. The exit gates can be random from each other like the enter gates or it could be in one place like in the case of boss fights. There is also a timer a dungeon master can set up on that floor but the minimum is 30min. Boss fights don't have a time limit but puzzle rooms can.\n\nAs you can see the basic design principle behind this is a basic back and forth between players and the various dungeon factions all kept in a equilibrium. The reason for this mechanisms is to reward dungeons that can keep the balance and make them advance farther while bad ones naturally disappear.\n\n##Procedural Generation and User Customization\n\nThe dungeon master/guild can control all the aspects of floor generation. They have at their disposal tools that can generate dungeons procedurally even regenerating the dungeon periodically and adding monster spawns and traps automatically. They can build rooms and corridors manually that they can feed into the procedural generator that will make them fit like legos as well as build structures that gets populated in those rooms. They can also make completely custom maps and save and swap between them as long as the point cost is upheld.\n\nThe floors can generate harvestable resources and treasure chests based on a global dungeon inventory that you can set to distribute on ane specific range of floors. You can setup so that some items and harvesting resources appear only in certain chests on a particular floor that are hidden secret places. \n\nAll types of monsters drop their own parts for crafting on death.\n\nEvery dungeon is awarded a few unique monsters or rare resources based on the depth of the dungeon which no other dungeon is awarded.\n\nOutside of the floor points, things can also cost crystals with unique types of monster spawns and unique bosses costing a variety of types. It's good to use a variety of types so that monsters can synergize with each other and thus raise your bang for the point cost.\n\nYou can also script the behavior of the creatures based on the more advanced monsters with intellect. And some you can equip with armor and weapons that you craft.\n\nThe Dungeon types also have their own specialties:\n\nEarth Dungeons have more in depth artifact crafting and treasures. They also have dragons with their own treasure horde.\n\nWater Dungeons can create special monsters and mutants with unique traits through breeding. They can also tame monsters and put them into artifacts Pokemon style.\n\nWind dungeons can facilitate travel to different server nodes, they have their own special resources,gear and monsters. more on this later.\n\nFire dungeons can create tournaments with their own rules for all parties(players, dungeons, own guild) and can gamble on victory, winner takes all. They can fully utilize their dungeons as the tournament ground with special areas and tools to facilitate it.\n\nDarkness dungeons can demand tribute payed every day and have powerful classes and boss monsters available.\n\nLight towers(can never be dungeons) are a fully admin controlled special dungeon. They pay light crystals daily equally to all other dungeons except darkness dungeons to the amounts it can based on if they are raided and based on the level of development of the dungeons. They are also very hard to raid. There is one per server node, more on this later.\n\n##Hubworld, player progression and raiding economy\n\nPermadeath! Lets get things out the way. There are 20 levels for every class and a limited number of lives for that class that unlock as you progress. Basic classes have high number of lives(10-20) but limited power potential, while more advanced high power and special abilities but limited life(&lt;10). You are expendable. \n\nIf that wasn't enough every item has permanent durability loss, there is a standard of 1000 max durability for all equipment. Top tier equipment is at &lt;350 durability on creation, with insane power at around ~100 durability. You can have perfect equipment(1000 durabilty) but at the mid-high tier max.\n\nOf course that wouldn't matter to you if you died, except it does since progression is done through guilds and that equipment could be reused. Your guild matters, you are expendable.\n\nHow it all works is there is a hub world. Dungeon guilds own this shit and you are just doing their bidding. The dungeons make request with rewards(including class unlocks) to incentivize players to raid other dungeon's crystals on their behalf with a percentage of crystals given to them(10% max). They can also request to defend a floor from player attacks(there is only one defense party per floor, but other parties don't necessarily know which is which). They can also do some recruitment for members.\n\nThere is also ""normal"" guilds that are not part of the dungeon guilds. Their purpose is to collect enough crystals to make their own dungeon. They have their own guild headquarters built in the hub world and their own treasury.\n\nThere is also a free market, shops, crafting where everything can be traded. Equipment, resources, monsters, class unlocks and the most important dungeon floor portal saves. The only thing that cannot be traded in any form is crystals. Of course the best stuff you can only get from more developed dungeons so those things are rare on the free market.\n\nOutside of guilds there is also another form of progression. For players who want to play solo there is also monster spirits. They can contract with a dungeon to posses monsters on the floor including bosses. They cannot raid and they only get rewarded with crystals. Every player has a monster spirit on their account they can play at any time and join floors that are attacked. They can steadily build crystals but they cannot use them for anything else then creating a dungeon. They also have no guild as support when they do create it.\n\n##Endgame and server nodes\n\nEvery hub world is linked to a limited number of dungeons (10-20) and one light tower. There are many cluster nodes like this and wind dungeon guild can travel freely between them. The cluster nodes also collectively have their own special resources, monsters and classes available. The cluster nodes also have a rank. To progress your dungeon to the next cluster node you need to completely raid the top 5 deepest dungeons in the current cluster and to completely raid the light tower of the current rank.\n\nIn higher tier clusters the crystal generation is increased and more special resources are available,monsters and classes.\n\nAs you continue moving up the rank you finally reach the endgame cluster. Here any raid that reaches and destroys the dungeon heart gets instantly destroyed and they have to raid the final dungeon of the previous game's winner.\n\nIf you finally win all the links and hubworlds are randomized between each other but based on similar cluster ranks while the final cluster node gets completely destroyed including the whole hubworld and remaining dungeons while the winning dungeon gets to become the next final dungeon and the cycle repeats.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The hightable functions as a meeting where the leaders discuss alliances and trades, territory, etc. The hightable consists of 7-12 leaders, and each seat is typically given to a continent. This is so that one organization cannot take complete control, and so that each continent can have a representative to negotiate terms on a worldwide scale. So it would look like the Yakuza, Triads, Irish Mob, Italian Mafia, Russian Mafia, Jewish Mafia, Indian Mafia, etc. \n\n\n**GAME CONCEPT**\nYou play a subordinate of one leader of your choosing. Each 'faction' has various pros and cons. You are a highly trained hitman, who also has extensive knowledge of the crime world and how to run an organization. Your goal is to oust your leader and become the leader yourself. However, its not as simple as murdering your boss and taking his place. Because there is a highly entwined, complicated network of relationships among the leaders. So you first must either kill and replace each of the 11 other leaders, or gain their trust and their support.\n\nIn other words, out of the 12 leaders, there are various alliances and rivalries, and you must decide how to approach taking out your own leader. The idea is to either kill and replace each leader with your own trusted man, or to ally with a leader and gain his support.  So if you kill one leader, it might piss off another couple of leaders, which in turn makes your job harder. Or, by allying with one leader, you might become more trustworthy in the eyes of their allies. It works both ways. Once you have replaced/allied with all 11 leaders, you can take a shot at usurping your boss.\n\n\n**GAMEPLAY**\nThe gameplay is hitman style. You choose globalized missions that consist of you entering a confined area, and your goal is typically to either assassinate or gain intel. Once inside in mission, you have free reign to choose how you want to approach it. Each mission rewards currency, connections, or skills. Currency is used to buy and upgrade weapons, and for each mission you must choose weapons and buy ammo and supplies in order to fit your playstyle. If you have no currency, you start the mission with your fists and must go from there. Skills are fairly straightforward. You gain skillpoints from mission and use them to upgrade your character in your own personal way. Connections are basically influence among the leaders. You can exhaust your connections in order to gain intel on the leaders or to contact them and negotiate. \n\nMissions will typically net positive influence for some leaders, and negative for others at the same time. So you must choose wisely which mission to accept. However, some missions will net no connections at all. The mission will always grant a high % of one commodity, and lowers %s of others, sometimes none. So there might be a high profile, independent assassination mission that will grant a lot of money, but no connections or skills. Or a mission that might grant a lot of connections, and only a few skills and low currency.\n\nYou have free reign to choose which missions you want to accept, but they are all based on a timescale. So one mission might be in the US and one might be in Russia, and by the time you finish the Russian mission, the US one has expired. \n\n\n**LEADER GAMEPLAY**\nYou have two options when it comes to leaders. You can choose to kill them and replace them with your own person, or you can ally with them. After gaining a certain amount of connections, you can contact a leader and ask to start working for them. Once you have completed a certain number of missions for them, they will have gained your trust and you can either do a series of 'finale' missions where you show true loyalty and help them, which will gain their support; OR, you can backstab them at the last second when they're about to trust you. The second option is to use your connections to gain intel on them, to find out where they are, the weaknesses in their organization, etc, to make it easier for you to take them out. Trying to assassinate a leader headon is quicker, but much harder, and will likely be noticed by other leaders. By gaining their trust you can get closer to them and will catch them while they're vulnerable, and do the deed quietly so other leaders will not know who killed them. \n\nOnce you have allied a leader, he will then provide support for you on missions, through a number of various ways, and will even give you special intel if you pay him enough or help him after allying him. Throughout your missions, you will also come across subordinates of leaders who do not like that leader. You can get these subordinates to help you sabotage their leader. If you use a subordinate more during missions and outfit them with good gear, they will become more trustworthy of you. If you kill a leader and promote the trusted subordinate, he will be fiercely loyal and help you tremendously. If you promote a less trustworthy subordinate, then he is more prone to betraying you or ignoring your wishes. A promoted subordinate will have a clean slate on relationships, and develop new ones only after he is promoted. If he is a truly loyal subordinate, you can command him who to form relationships with. \n\nIdeally you can either kill every leader or ally every leader, but this is extremely hard. If you start murdering them all, the leaders will beef up their security to the max, making it very hard to get to them. It's also hard to ally with them, because each leader has certain friends and enemies, and those friends and enemies have their own friends and enemies. So you might ally one leader but make two others hate you by doing so, and have to work twice as hard to get them to like you, which also causes missions to get much harder.\n\n\n\nOnce you have all 11 leaders dealt with, you make a try at your own boss. Depending on how you handled the other leaders, it will change the circumstances and difficulty of your own bosses missions."

62ttf9,Game Ideas,Submit your game ideas below and I'll pick the best ones to create a game concept of it 
62sq6f,A 3D chat room with media and games as its main function,"Players would be able to host chat rooms  on their home computers or on dedicated servers, with customization options for their own character and their chat room. And by customization options, I mean it. You'd be able to add couches and chairs for your characters to sit in, functioning TVs, board game tables, video game consoles, etc. TVs would allow you to program your own channels with time slots,blocks, etc, using videos from your own hard drive. Video game consoles would allow you to access MAME, Openemu, and other emulators, and so forth. You could even change the physical design of the chat room, turning it into a basement, apartment, or even a large complex building, pretty much anything."
62rhhh,Need some ideas for new aspects for game I'm making.,"I've started to make a top down rougelike rpg of sorts. There's a hubword with shops and storage, and then levels. Each level is completely randomly generated. The weapons are made from random pieces and have random stats. I want to expand on this but I'm not sure how. Any ideas on how I could add something more interesting?  \n  \nI should also note that the equip system is non-combat friendly. To get an item out of your bag you must drop everything out. You can then drop all your current equipps. Then you can drag the weapons close to you that you want to equip as well as put items in your bag. This is so you can't quickly change up in combat without shenanigans occurring. \n"
62orti,A sandbox MMO in an Earth sized world that I literally saw in a dream.,"This may be ridiculous but I literally saw this in a dream, I dreamed I am browsing Reddit, and I stumbled on a /r/gaming post about this game.\n\nThe graphics appear to look like the old Runescape, and the world appear to be Earth 1:1 and in the screenshot there appears to be someone typing in chat ""Don't shoot him! Shoot me! i am the Falfa!"" Then a screenshot later a giant white monster appears and everyone like ""OMG!"" ""LOL!""\n\nSo this game could have different fauna roaming in the world depending and even some extremely rare monster including the Falfa I mentioned. The Falfa is special that it spawned when a player character dies, but only very very rarely. There is a data tracking map that updates whether a player sees one of these rare monsters that is visible to the public.\n\nThe game features permadeath, and even more unforgiving is that you only limited to 2 (Or maybe more) characters per account, once you died your second time, poof! That account is useless, you can't create any more characters. But if you turned into the Falfa and survived as the Falfa (which you can't control as because you are now a monster), you may return to being human again, but that doesn't mean you are guranteed to be the Falfa the second time.\n"
62o7zv,Simple adventurer game.,"\n----- Concept -----\n\n-An adventurer who is out to explore the open fantasy world with some city building mechanics.\n\n\n----- Ideas -----\n\n-You start by creating a character and choosing a specific class, race and a backstory.\n\n-There will be few starter classes you can choose from in the beginning.\n\n-Race and backstory will affect the stats of your character.\n\n-As you progress through the game, you will meet other adventurers whom you can recruite to join you.\n\n-You are able to build a small camp where adventurers can pass by and you are able to interact with and maybe sell loot/items that you have looted throughout your adventures.\n\n-The camp that you build can be improved and upgraded to town or city, depending on the popularity of the camp and your character.\n\n-Main stats such as strength/agility/intellect/stamina defines your characters type.\n\n-Secondary stats such as charisma/leadership/tracking/crafting gives depth to the character and can affect the adventurers around you.\n\n-As your upgrade your city, you can get involved in deplomacy with other cities.\n\n-Subclass is something you can choose on the side of you main class. If you start as a knight and choose a subclass that uses dark magic, you class will become a deathknight, of you choose a subclass with divine magic you will become a paladin. This type of depth in my opinion keeps a player interested and want to try all kinds of combinations.\n\n-Dungeons and Raids are something that are very important in a fantasy world.\n\n-You will be able to create contracts and treaties with other cities for trade, peace, war, etc.\n\n-Guilds can be created by NPCs or adventurers where each guild has its own purpose, such as merchants guild/adventurers guild/crafters guild etc.\n\n"

To defuse the bomb the players have to cut the correct wires, but no one can do it on their own because wires frequently go over the edges of the cube.\n\nThe players have to not only communicate, but dynamically split into groups, because it takes only two players at any given time to track a wire.\n\nFor extra confusion you can rotate your view of your side of the bomb, and it's rotated randomly on start.\n\nIt could be thieves and a super secure safe instead of a bomb.\n\n[Illustration](http://i.imgur.com/1DG3xB3.png)"

62csec,9 Lives Horror Game.,"You go into an obscure torrent site. Not even the pirate bay but something really obscure and shitty.\n\nYou find a game called 9 Lives.\n\nWhen you start the game you are welcomed to the title ""You have 9 Lives remaining"" and has a glitching theme.\n\nIt plays like the standard horror game Amnesia, Slender, whatever, monster caches you, jump scare, game over. Heck lets say the monster even has Alien Isolation level AI cause why the fuck not. Also the monster is cute as fuck instead of scary(but you still get screaming sounds) and the background is like in shojo manga with hearts and shit.\n\nIf you get game over you have to start again.\n\nAt ""5 lives remaining"" the game deletes itself when you lose.\n\nAt ""3 lives remaining"" the game deletes the up folder from the game if it has any data or recursively goes up until it finds data. Hope it wasn't your game library Ha Ha Ha.\n\nAt ""2 lives remaining"" it BSOD your operating system but doesn't change anything.\n\nThe next time you start the game it glitches and say ""-9999999 lives remaining"" if you die your whole hard drive gets wiped.\n\nCongratulations! The game was actually a virus. Also while its at it, with all that data it mined it also saves your profile on a database somewhere.\n\nNow the next time you start the game and matches your profile that it saved a ""0 lives remaining"" will appear.\n\nIf you lose again it hires a hitman from the **Darkz Webz** with your profile and paying them exclusively in Dodgecoin(not filthy bitcoin). If You Die In The Game You Die In Real Life.\n\n**Oh!!** And the moral of the story was Don't Pirate Kids! I almost forgot!\n\nAlso a hackzor will probably make this game but I take no responsibility! I'm just spreading fun ideas to share with people!\n\n"
