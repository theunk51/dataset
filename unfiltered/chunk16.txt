etqkov,"Hi! I'm new here, I'm very young, and have no development or coding experience, but I have a good game idea, here it is!","So, the game will be basicly a boss fight / sandbox game where every character has a way of playing ranging from offense to defense, but they're designs will be simplified, and that would be the price fo pay if i want a larger cast of character, so, players will work together to defeat the boss, faster they do it, the better they're rating, better the rating, more the prize! And the prize will be in-game currency, which can be used to purchase character skins (only cosmetic) and to also upgrade characters, when upgrading characters, you can only upgrade one spec at a time, strength, health, and also upgrading the uniqe abilities of that character, if one character can jump really high, you can upgrade that, if another character has a special BITE attack, you can upgrade it, too! And now to the mechanics:\n\nYou chose your character depending on which ones you have (you'll be able to unlock characters, I still dont have an idea how) and then get matched up with other players... if the game even affords multiplayer, or just play with friends on yall coach, or just team up with bot players! (That ain't as cool as playing with other players and strategizing with them) and fight the boss in a 3d environment, these environments will be medium in size, but running from the boss wont be possible, if the boss defeats a player, it will imprison them in a cage either on its knees or back, also, some boses with higher health and better metal (they're robots) its gonna have its heart or other sensitive body part popping out as a weak point.\n\nOmg I finally got this out of my chest, it feels good, but I still wanna try making this game in the future or just pay have a team of programmers to help me make it, I still have decades ahead of me, so this idea might not be just an idea sometime in the future.\n\nThanks for reading this, goodbye!"
etpl04,"Age of Wildcraft - a strategic, creative, fantasy game","So imagine Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in online multiplayer. The art style, the combat system, the crafting - it's all there. Weapons and armor wear out over time. But there's also a Minecraft element to it. You can dig and mine anywhere. You can construct buildings and craft new tools and weapons. It's not as blocky or physics-bending as the actual Minecraft - no floating islands etc - but the world is even more expansive and flexible than Breath of the Wild.\n\nWhen you spawn you get to select what you want to specialize in. A miner gets a pickaxe from the start and mines and forges metal faster than everyone else. A woodcutter gets an axe and can chop wood and build houses, catapults, etc. faster than everyone else. Similarly, farmers specialize in growing food and digging while rangers move and climb a bit faster and can more easily tame wild animals. Miners naturally can use swords in battle, woodcutters axes, farmers spears and rangers bows. It's not impossible to learn how to use other weapons however, nor is it impossible for a miner to farm or for a farmer to cut wood: it just takes a longer time. \n\nApart from these crafting-and-combat professions, I imagine there to be monks, spies, and wizards with unique abilities and strengths.\n\nAs you gather more food and build more houses, more people are able to spawn. Those who aren't controlled by humans are NPC:s following the commands of players with the same profession as them.\n\nSo you start a civilization with your friends. You collect wood and minerals, plant food, befriend horses and other animals, build houses, monasteries, and workshops surrounded by walls. You might even build a mighty castle and send out scouts to find mythical beasts like unicorns and dragons. But then you notice a rival civilization, gathering their army to wipe you out.\n\nHere's where the strategy element plays in. One of you spawned as the king or queen. These royalties have unique access to a birds-eye view of the map and can order their loyal citizens to do many different tasks: building this, farming that, attacking them, etc. This will give huge bonuses to those following the royal commands. The king or queen thus play something more like Age of Empires, while still being able to train in combat and fight for themselves on the battlefield.\n\nOne can easily imagine many different play modes: a small band of adventurers trying to survive orcs and monsters in the woods, epic battles on an enormous battlefield, or a Sims-like peaceful creative mode where one simply seeks to build a beautiful kingdom together.\n\nWouldn't this be the most epic fantasy game of all time?"
etm63p,Card Universe (Draft 3.0),"Note From Author: I am an absolute beginner/nobody that knows nothing about making/designing games and knows the bare minimum about the fundamentals of coding. This is mostly a proof of concept. If you have some feedback or suggestions, That would be appreciated. If you would like to steal this idea for your own, that would also be appreciated.\n\n#Overview\nCard Universe is a video game that features a mix of 3d Platforming, roguelike, and Open-World Action RPG elements. The story is that the player is a human from the real world that discovered a magical artifact called a Binder that enables them to send their consciousness into a place called The Universe of Imagination, where humanity's thoughts and feelings create cards which can materialize into tangible objects and forces, with humanity's evil thoughts and feelings becoming dangerous things like monsters and hazards. As an Avatar, the player can gather cards and use them or store them in their Binder for later use. The main goal of the game is to gather cards, level up, survive, and do whatever they want.\n\n#Controls\nStart: Binder\n\nSelect: Menu\n\nA: Jump/Arial Action\n\nL Stick: Movement\n\nR Stick: Camera\n\nB: Interact\n\nX: Card Trigger\n\nY: Card Select\n\nL: Sneak\n\nR: Run\n\nControl Pad: Shortcut Hand\n\nL Trigger: Lock On\n\nR Trigger: Alt. Shortcut Hand\n\nL Stick Press: Card Shortcut 1\n\nR Stick Press: Card Shortcut 2\n\n#Progression\nThe primary additive factor that determines the effectiveness of most of the player's actions is their Level. All damage dealing and damage reducing/stopping cards scale off of the level in some way. Everyone starts at level 1 and more levels are gained through the accumulation of Points.\n\n##Points\nThe Avatar has two counts of points, the Lifetime Point Count (LPC) and the Fluid Point Count (FPC). The LPC is the total amount of points the player has gathered throughout their current campaign and passing thresholds in amounts cause the player to Level-Up. The FPC is the current number of points the Avatar has accumulated and can be spent by interacting with NPCs for cards and other services. Points can be accumulated by killing monsters, selling cards, or finding treasures.\n\n##Meters\nLeveling up not only increases the overall effectiveness of an Avatar's actions, but it also increases the Avatar's meters and grants Stat Points (STs). The Avatar has three meters, the Hit Meter (HM) which regulates how much damage the Avatar can take and is regenerated by healing cards, the Action Meter (AM) which regulates how long the Avatar can exert itself and is regenerated over time or instantly with certain cards but not usable until completely filled once completely drained, and the Special Meter (SM) which regulates how many cards can be set on the Hand at one time with more powerful cards having a greater SM cost.\n\n##Stats\nEvery Level-Up grants the Avatar 10 STs which can be spent in one of five stats which add 1% to their corresponding statistics. \n\nPower increases the HM and the damage done by cards. \n\nEnergy increases the AM and ads to the effectiveness of cards that block damage.\n\nWisdom ads to the SM and ads to the effectiveness of cards that reduce damage.\n\nInstinct ads to the effectiveness of cards that bestow harmful effects on foes and increases effects that strengthen the Avatar.\n\nSpirit ads to the effectiveness of cards that bestow beneficial effects on the user and decrease effects that weaken or hinder the Avatar.\n\n#Cards\nLike the name of the game suggests, the main purpose of the game is the accumulation and use of cards.\n\n##Hand\nAll cards are stored in the Hand for immediate use or in the Binder for later use. Using the Y Button brings up the hand, which is a radial menu that allows for the selection of a card with the R stick that, if it is an active use card, can be triggered by X. Alternatively, specific cards can be assigned to two shortcut selections, the primary being the control pad which can be switched to an alternate selection by the R Trigger. Shortcuts for individual cards can also be assigned to the R Stick Press and the L Stick Press.\n\n##Binder\nThe Binder has pages that store cards in a 3x3 section on both sides of the page and a limit of ten pages. Each card has a limited number of uses and once used up must be found again in the game world.\n\n##Card Types\nPower Cards: Allows the player different actions and abilities. Come in various subcategories.\n\nAbility Power Cards: Can be used instantaneously, lose uses for each successful active use. (Ex. swinging a sword, walking on a wall temporarily, launching a fireball, blocking a hit after raising a shield)\n\nTactical Power Cards: Creates an independent object that can assist the player or harm them if used improperly. Used when damaged. (Ex. bait to attract monsters, a springboard-like area, a bubble that entraps anything inside it and can be used as a platform, a bomb that first attaches to the Avatar then moves to an opponent after a successful melee attack)\n\nConditional Power Cards: Used automatically once certain conditions are met. (Example, neutralizing a killing blow, doing a burst of damage if a foe is at low health, exploding if hit by a fire attack)\n\nBoon Power Cards: Grant passive effects or bonuses to the player and can change their primary abilities/capabilities but may make the player more or less resistant to certain things. Effects can stack. Used when Avatar is damaged. (Reducing damage [Armor], hovering at a fixed height while in midair, allowing free movement while underwater)\n\nResource Cards: Cards that can be stacked. Used for a wide variety of purposes.\n\nMaterial Resource Cards: Used to craft other cards or to cause events in the game world without using Power Cards. (Wood, ore, herbs, and stone of various types.)\n\nConsumable Resource Cards: Used to restore Meters and/or grant temporary boosts to Avatar. (Food, potions, medicine)\n\nLocation Cards: Cards that are gained upon the discovery of a new location. Can be used to fast travel to said location from a different location. Possess information about the corresponding location such as available cards, monsters/NPCs in inhabitation, and miscellaneous information about the nature of the location. Can be used while in the binder and are not placed in the hand.\n\nGuardian Cards: NPCs that seek to assist the player with their own sets of stats and meters. Always deployed while in hand and using card may activate special abilities. (A horse that can be ridden, a satellite that fires a laser to locked on targets, monsters that have been captured and pacified)\n\nArtifact Cards: Cards that grant beneficial effects in or outside the binder. (Picking up two cards at once, an extra life, unlimited stamina.)\n\nCurse Cards: Cards that cannot be removed from the hand once acquired but can be destroyed at certain points of interest or by certain cards. (Halving all meters, doubling incoming damage, making cards damaging the user upon use)\n\nRitual Cards: Cards that cause widespread effects once certain conditions are fulfilled. (Summoning a special boss monster, altering the properties of a location, creating an area where NPCs gather)\n\n##Attributes\nMost cards, characters, and forces that can be interacted with have at least one attribute. If struck by a harmful force that they are resistant to, the damage will be multiplied by .5. Alternatively, if they are vulnerable to the attribute, the damage is multiplied by 1.5. They are as follows: Red&gt;Purple&gt;Blue&gt;Green&gt;Yellow&gt;Orange&gt;Red\n\nAll avatars start with neutral resistance but certain cards can endow a specific attribute. Resistance does not stack, but attributes do.\n\n##Monsters\nNot all monsters fight or can be engaged the same way. \n\nSome perch upon a high point and are able to snipe at the Avatar from a great distance, but have a narrow range of awareness and can be snuck up on when they lose sight. Some monsters can relentlessly stalk the Avatar and can only be damaged under specific circumstances. Some cannot be harmed unless attacked in a certain way, but may not specifically target the Avatar when approached.\n\nLikewise, there are a number of creative ways an Avatar can engage the opposition, such as provoking a monster into attacking its allies, using environmental gimmicks and hazards to the Avatar's advantage, or employing a creative use and combination of certain cards.\n\n##Traits\nEvery card, NPC, monster, or location possesses traits that act as specialized modifiers for interactions between each other. A few examples include:\n\nFire Elemental: Fire attacks and hazards heal instead of damage but take double damage from water attacks and hazards.\n\nLightweight: Get flung extra far by forces that can move it.\n\nEtherial: Only take damage from cards with a supernatural-type trait.\n\nDanger: Direct contact damages.\n\nRegen: Heal over time.\n\nIntense heat: Unless characters possess certain traits they take damage over time. Increases the damage of fire and heat attacks.\n\nFickle: With certain stimuli, may ally with foes or attack allies.\n\nIron: Conducts and attracts electricity, does extra damage to characters with Fairy, Undead, and Demonic traits.\n\n#Player experience\nAt the start of the campaign, the player is dropped in the middle of a random Location. If they die, they lose all their cards and points and have to start over.\n\n##Locations\nLocations are sandbox environments that can be freely traversed in any manner of way depending on the skill of the player and their current selection of cards. Every location has a list of monsters and NPCs that inhabit it, cards available to be collected, and treasures to be obtained through different methods. There are also portals hidden within each location that take the player to a different one. Locations can also contain a number of gimmicks or hazards that can make traversing it easier or harder depending on the player's skill.\n\n###POIs\nEvery location plays host to a number of Points of interest that can be interacted with for a number of purposes in a number of ways. Some POIs play host to a challenge of skill, puzzles, mini games, entrances linear dungeons/courses/challenges, or simple events/tasks that once completed rewards the player with a specific card, healing, ailment removal, long-term buff, or some other convenient service.\n\n##Crafting\nOn the flavor text of certain cards is a list of materials that an Avatar can take to a particular Point Of Interest in order to craft a copy of that card. However, all but a few materials are non-specified and any material that falls into the category of the non-specified material such as ore, wood, or leather, can be used in its creation. When used to create a card, the traits of the material are added to that card, like increased damage to certain foes, more uses, or an extra attribute.\n\n##NPCs\nNPCs can be found throughout each location individually or as groups within locations that serve as population centers. Each NPC type has various likes and dislikes. If the avatar is in good favor, they may offer access to events that assist the player, information on that location, buying or selling cards at lower/higher prices, healing, or buffs. If the Avatar is in bad favor, they may trigger events that harm or make things more difficult, give misinformation, sell or buy cards at higher/lower prices, or debuffs.\n\n##Bosses\nEach Location has at least one powerful Boss Monster that drops many rare cards and plentiful Points upon defeat. Some Boss Monsters stay at a fixed point, others may migrate throughout the Location, and others appear under certain conditions or times.\n\n##Rank\nAll cards possess a ten-star rarity system which is a representation of their spawn rate within each location and the number of points they sell for at vendors. Monsters also have a similar star system which is a representation of how difficult they are to dispatch or how much they can threaten the Avatar.\n\n##Level Calculations and Combat\nAs was stated before, the overall effectiveness of cards scales off from the Avatar's level, usually rounded up.\n\nExample 1: An attack Action card that does 125% damage being wielded by a level 20 Avatar would, before taking in the defense and resistances of the target into account, 25 damage.\n\nExample 2: A level 10 character wielding a card that does 100% damage + 80% Base Damage would do 10 damage, in addition to 8 damage that would ignore the target's defense.\n\nExample 3: A level 10 character wielding a card that does 20% + 5 damage would do 2 damage hitting 5 times for a total of 20\n\nExample 4: A level 10 avatar that deploys a blocking Action card with 120% could block an attack of up to 12 damage, but every instance of contact would count as a use and drain the AM. And if it tried to block anything more the AM would be completely drained.\n\nExample 5: An Avatar using a boon card with an armor value of 10 would be able to reduce up to 10 damage on top of all other boon cards' armor value of non-base damage. However, if it had a damage reduction trait of 20% wielded by a level 20 character could reduce base damage of up to 4.\n\nMost active-use and Action cards have a speed value that determines how many times it can be used in a second, which also indicates the delay until another active-use card is used. Plus, cards that have more beneficial effects or what could be described as overpowered also have a smaller number of uses and take up a greater portion of the SM when equipped and a greater portion of the AM when used.\n\nGranted, these are only factors that matter mostly if the Avatar directly engages the opposition. There are a number of possible strategies and tactics an avatar could employ to greatly shift the odds in their own favor, like attacking from an advantageous position or using a clever combination of cards to meet the situation.\n\nThe Binder cannot be opened while a foe is aware of the Avatar's presence.\n\n#Multiplayer\nThe game features a Player to Player room system where Avatars can utilize their own Location cards to create an interconnected game world. The room creator can select from a number of rules that can alter the primary rules of the game and govern the interactions between Avatars. Players have the option to keep a Card Box which they can transfer cards without the risk of loss. One's Point count and Level do not change upon death while in multiplayer mode and the room creator can choose to scale the levels either equally or based on certain circumstances within each mode.\n\n##Hardcore\nAvatars can attack each other to claim random cards dropped on death.\n\n##Territories\nAvatars can form teams to capture Location Cards which can serve as respawn points that allow the controllers to keep cards. Monsters can be tamed and used by teams.\n\n##Deathmatch\nLast one standing wins a random card dropped from each Avatar.\n\n##Desert Island\nAll Avatars start with nothing.\n\n##Spectator\nPlayers can watch Avatars and trade Cards or wager them on certain outcomes.\n\n#Cosmetics\nPlayers also have access to a number of cosmetic options to Express their own style, such as skins to change the appearance of a card's action, stances that change how the Avatar moves when traversing their enviornment, and of course costumes for the Avatar itself. These cosmetic cards only need to be collected once, have no limits to how many can be obtained, and always remain with the player's profile no matter what happens to the Avatar.\n\nLike my ideas, have some constructive criticism, or want to add some of your own? Please, leave a reply!\n\nSpecific examples/ideas for cards will be given upon request."
ethwzs,Open World Survival Western Game,"Similar to Ark: Survival Evolved and Rust but you move to the west and have to defend yourself from bandits and other players. You are also able to build a homestead and farm livestock and crops although players can steal the crops and livestock. You can make a clan and build a small town and NPCs can come along and make more buildings(like saloons, banks and telegraphs to contact other settlements). There could be larger towns like blackwater in red dead redemption where you can buy and sell the crops and livestock you've farmed/stolen. You can buy gun parts to craft guns or craft the parts themselves."

You, also a penguin, wake up inside your little igloo.

eth4mf,The Card Castle,"Imagine Iggy's Castle from Super Mario World, but make everything Deltarune related. The theme music would be ""The World Revolving"" played at 80% speed. Once you get to Iggy (Jevil, in this case.), the platform spins around. The music goes to its regular speed. The platform is multiple brick blocks that sometimes separate. Jevil throws multiple (for example) clubs. If you get hit once, you go from Scarf Feather to Super Mushroom. You can try to run and jump on Jevil's head to deal damage, but you cannot do that again for the next minute. If you decide to jump on Jevil's head, the music's speed increases by 10% and it gets harder. This keeps going on until the 5th jump, where Jevil finally either turns into the Devilsknife and lets you have him (25% chance), you get Jevil's tail (25% chance), or he disappears (50% chance). If you want to try again, it turns your life into hell. And this is only one level...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey! Thank you for reading.

et8oyo,probably great lovecraftian esque survival game,"&gt;!So this is my idea and ill never make it because of my shit programming skills and overall low income, but here is how it goes. Earth pretty much has been fked by walls of mist appearing in lots of places , them circling small zones, your goal when starting out is not to die by a squid monster as they appear out of the mist walls, the other side of the mist walls is safe however there's no people inside the safe zones due to the low chance they can actually go trough as u need to be a match for the mist to accept you , u can start building inside whatever u want. however the outside of the mist circles which monsters spawn out of but dont go inside, is practically hell but is also the only way u can get resources such as water, food, materials. The closer u are to an mist wall the more hellish monsters there are, there are as monsters small ones which u can kill somewhat quickly but they also deal a lot of damage, and there are bigger ones, most of the game u will be running from them and scavenging, u can make the mist disperse and make the walls appear somewhere farther from ur home so u can scavenge safer outside, u can make the inside mist wall expand but doing so the outside world next to ur wall will get harder due to even more stuff appearing, also building outside will attract lots of monsters to ur actual location, and the more the buildings outside stay alive the more will appear , u cant kill larger monsters, u need to lure them out of the place u want to scavenge. u can probably add more to the idea but i got the base one going on, maybe one of the large walls has an small village of matches inside where u can do quests and stuff like that. It can have bosses which u have to beat trough different gimics and maybe even rituals and stuff. Also to clarify the entire outside is covvered of a bit less dense mist than the actual mist walls so monsters do spawn somewhat outside but most big ones come from teh walls!&lt;"

et7t84,Card/Fighting Game?,"The idea is kind of a weird one so hear me out, it's a fighting game where instead of button combos, the players use cards. You pick say 10 cards at the beginning of a match and arrange them in a certain order. The cards each have types like this is a punch, this is a kick, this is a grapple, etc. Both players are going in blind, you have no clue what your opponent is gonna play naturally so you have to try and guess the best combo and use some strategy. The actual fighting plays out kind of like rock paper scissors where it's like a kick beats a punch, punch beats a grapple, grapple beats a kick, or something of that nature. Maybe add in a few special move cards or even a rare few block cards, just to spice things up. When you win a match, you gain your opponent's card like in a game of war, and it's a best of 3 rounds. I know it sounds rough but I think there's something there."
esy4rz,A Far Cry type game where the Antagonist faction is a Neo-Nazi/White Supremacist group,"Originally, i wanted bad guy faction for this game idea to be a ISIS-esque Terrorist group, but, Far Cry 5 already more or less went that direction. However, there's a guy in a Discord server I frequent who claims to be a Nazi, and that kinda gave me this idea (i think this guy is just being an edgy fuckwit, but you never know). Forgive me if this is vague btw, I pretty much just came up with this this morning.\n\nThe main Villain, the leader of this Nazi-type group, is blatantly racist, and believes that Blonde Hair, Blue eyed white folks (what the Nazis would call Aryans) are the true superior race. Interestingly enough, the protagonist is also an ""Aryan""-being a blonde hair, blue eyed female- which makes the villain himself hesitant to kill her, and he will frequently attempt to get her to join him, as he thinks it'd be a waste to kill such a ""perfect specimen"". Like Far Cry 5, he will occasionally capture you (although probably not quite as much as in Far Cry 5, as that got a little annoying) as the story progress, and that's when he will often do this. Even at the end when you finally fight him, he will be finally fighting to kill you, but expresses regret, and basically says that you left him with no choice. \n\nLike other FC games this game would involve Outposts that you have to take down, and im thinking some of these could basically be like Concentration camps, where you have to kill the defenders and free the people who were enslaved at this camps. As far as setting, I kind of want this to take place in America like FC5- but it doesnt necessarily have to. Gameplay would of course, be in a FPS style similar to other FC's, and im thinking I'd want to overhaul the customization a little bit. You may have had a custom Protag in 5, but not gonna lie the actual customization was terrible. Even though this idea has a set Protagonist, it can be made to where you could ""customize"" her alot better than your character in FC5 lel. Making most of the guns highly modifiable is something I'd want as well, as well as good vehicle customization. I could probably explain more gameplay elements in the comments if you guys would like.\n\nNow, I'm well aware that the whole Neo Nazi thing can easily be very controversial. Having a blatantly racist villain is one thing, while some other people might think that this game is demonizing white people (much like how some thought FC5 was demonizing Christians). But, on the other hand, I think it'd be a good way to both address racism and take a look at the psychology behind it. Also, this could also make the Resistance faction that you fight with very diverse, and because the Villain would also hate LGBT people, having both ethnic diversity and a little LGBT involvement in this Good Guy group would probably be appreciated by some people. However, i think this would make it VERY hard to make the villain likable- I almost don't want to try to make him likable. I mean, making your audience absolutely hate your villain and really want to put a bullet in him does work when done right, but, the FC series is known for likable villains, and most people think villains are better when you can like them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think of this? Would it be too controversial to actually put in a video game, or could it be really good if done right? Sorry if i don't have quite enough details on this yet, as it's a very new idea of mine- Ill keep thinking and see what i can add."
esvh1l,Minecraft-style game ideas?,"Does anybody have any ideas for a game that is creative with building and stuff, kind of like Minecraft, without the voxel world. Sorry for the vagueness."
esul43,Autocrat,"In the game Autocrat, the player enters the world of a fragile Democracy.  The time period is the early 20th century in the aftermath of the great war during a time of tremendous uncertainty.\n\nTheir objective is to be a part of the successful political party which takes over and replaces the Democracy with an Autocratic regime by passing the ""Disabling Act"" to eliminate parliament and declare their party the single state party.\n\nPlayers do not assume classes or level up with experience to distinguish themselves, they rather come into the world as a normal, essentially unknown person, whose livelihood and character growth relies on the influence they develop in the world.\n\nPlayers start with beneficial background traits called ""boons"" like ""War hero,"" ""Industrialist"", ""Famous Thespian"", ""Gentry"", and so forth, that impacts the opinion of certain demographics of the population upon them.  \n\nPlayers also start with negative background traits, like ""Occultist"", ""Drug Addict"", ""Sexual Deviant"" which are kept unknown but can be revealed through spying efforts.  If these negative traits are revealed, they can be used to damage a person's reputation with certain demographics.\n\nThe population is split up into many demographics -- keeping public appeal high is important, because when the public opinion of you is low, if you happened to get assassinated and thrown in a ditch, it doesn't have that negative of an impact on the assassin.  An aggressor who wanted you dead would first destroy your character before destroying you physically.\n\nThe game is played from a top down, political map oriented view, where they can see polls in areas of the country and a marker indicating where they are, along with travel times when the player chooses where to go on the map, with a zoomed in top down view for when a player enters a building or go to an event space, . (where players and characters are approximately the size of a pea on screen, for scale)\n\nMaking yourself more popular involves developing social organisations to organize speeches and rallies.  Social organisations are established in the name of the party to draw members of demographics towards supporting your cause.  But rallies and meetings can be attacked or sabotaged by paramilitaries or spies.\n\nPlayers do not fight directly,  but instead the most direct form of fighting is by deploying a party's paramilitaries.  Paramilitaries can be established by any player in the name of their party, and they can also come into conflict with other paramilitaries of the same party, if players in the same party have a falling out.  After all, aspiring Autocrats don't always want to share.\n\nAnd, players engage in a more stealthy form of combat by engaging spying activities by establish intelligence operations.  Intelligence operations are less direct but can be just as deadly as a paramilitary operation.  Spies can destroy reputations, attempt assassinations, etc.  for a player with a more subterfuge oriented play style.  A player that focuses heavily on intelligence operations might wilt easily when confronted head to head by a large paramilitary, but if a intelligence operation heavy player catches a paramilitary focused opponent unaware...\n\nEstablishing social organisations, paramilitaries, or intelligence operations takes time and resources, such that you cannot effectively do all of them at once and must manage your resources accordingly, and a good party communicates well to ensure they are using these three tools to meet their objectives.  At it's heart, the game revolves around managing aggressive resources (paramilitaries, spy ops) and beneficial resources (social organisations).  \n\nAnd, after elections, parties can come together to form coalitions, which shifts alliances/allegiances frequently.  Democratic parties will enter into coalition with Authoritarian (player) parties, but only if they strongly align demographically -- and once one party becomes too strong, all the NPC (Democratic) parties will begin to band against it for fear of a government takeover, increasing difficulty substantially for that party to ensure the game doesn't end too quickly as one party takes the lead.\n\nWith allowing players to develop interesting demographic appeal and enact various laws, players will have  a lot of freedom to express exactly what kind of dictatorship they want to establish.  Is it a corrupt kleptocracy solely for lining your own pockets, an ecofascist state, for the betterment of the planet, or a worker's revolution towards Communism?\n\nAnd intra-party fighting, inter-party fighting, and coalition building should keep all players on their toes as everything can change around quite fast.\n\nEach game would last a couple hours, and randomly match individual players or small groups of friends and an equal smattering of AI controlled Democratic parties.\n\nThanks for reading!  Would love your input."
estr84,Trying a new variant of Sudoku in JS,"Hi,\n\nI have tried to create a simple variant of Sudoku. Here you play with bot. The UI need a lot of polishing but still thought to share it.\n\nYou need to maximise the score to beat the bot. For maximising the score you need to find the cell with maximum numeric value while solving sudoku. \n\nYou could also try this on play store [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamesmint.sumine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamesmint.sumine) or web version - [http://geekthrust.com/sumine.html](http://geekthrust.com/sumine.html)\n\nDo you guys think that this idea can work?"
ess3cw,"""Parking lot fighter""","Here's a game I'd absolutely love to play:\n\nA bunch of players (as many as possible without worsening the quality) are put into some stage (say, a mall, a parking lot, a school, a bar  a park, whatever... Different stages could offer different gameplay). The objective is to be the last one standing in a realistic fight (that players view from a first-person perspective). \n\nIt should feel like an actual fight, so no healthbar like most fighting games. Instead, you go for a KO or a submission. In order to prevent some players from just avoiding conflict until only a few opponents are left, a bonus could be awarded per every elimination (or perhaps, if a player reaches X eliminations he is automatically declared the winner, regardless of how many remain).\n\nThis idea is of course online-oriented, but may be interesting to adapt into a single-player. It'd be great to have a wide variety of (customizable? characters), maybe even put your own picture (that's hard stuff, I know) into their faces. Some may see this idea as a ""shooter with no weapons"", but I think the game mechanics will be completely different (1-vs-1 conforntations will not be solved instantly and other players could join in)"
esovks,The Last of Us DLC: the first night,"After watching the opening sequence of *The Last of Us* again (gets me every time), I started wondering: What happened between when Joel put Sara to bed and when he returned to his house? When he returns to Sara, he seems to have some idea of whats happening. \n\nI say there should be a DLC of those missing hours. \n\nAfter Sara goes to sleep, Joel gets a call related to business. A client will give him a check, but it has to be now. Joel is reluctant to leave Sara alone, but he knows the client is just a few blocks away and it won't take long, and he needs that money.\n\nJoel drives through his neighborhood late at night. It's mostly peaceful, but he notices certain odd things as he travels: A police car drives by, lights and siren on. A family loads up their car and drives off in a panic in the middle of the night. A barking dog suddenly stops with a yelp. \n\nWhen Joel gets to the client's house, he sees that the man has a sick child, apparently because of an animal bite earlier that day. Before Joel gets the check, the child goes berserk and attacks his parents. They both become infected. \n\nJoel has to fight his way out of the house. Outside, he can't get to his car, and has to walk through the back alleys of his neighborhood, to get back to Sara. He has to fight or avoid the newly infected, and trigger happy scared people. Crashed vehicles block his path and force him to take detours. \n\nAlong the way, Joel tries to help other people, but they turn out to be infected and he barely escapes with his life. This is why he refuses to help the family he sees later when he's in Tommy's car. \n\nFinally, Joel returns home, finds Sara, and they try to escape to safety...."

esdvr5,Lumberjack Loses dog sidescroller,My idea for a game is a 2d pixel art side-scroller where a lumberjack loses his dog and has to make his way across many different terrains and through many different weather conditions to find him again. In certain parts of the game are ghosts that you encounter that guide you towards where you should find your dog and they provide a much greater level of light to certain darker areas which otherwise would have to be lit up by a match which would provide a much lower level of light to the area. If enough of a certain item/currency is collected across levels then they can be exchanged to make snowier areas easier to traverse through. I'm also thinking that some campfires/tents with lamps can be found occasionally throughout levels that can be used as save points.

es3b8g,An arcade shoot'em up in which the goal is to upgrade your ship so much that it plays itself.,"This is like a hybrid between an arcade shmup (think R-Type) and clicker games. You gain XP by destroying enemies, and then you can spend those points on upgrading your ship to gain XP faster.\n\nAs your ship gets larger with every add-on upgrade, it becomes harder to evade, so the gameplay slowly shifts from actively evading enemy fire to passively *tanking* enemy fire with your growing ship. Eventually your ship becomes as large as the screen-filling bosses you fight against.\n\nAnd when you thought you're near the end and your ship can't get any larger, the camera zooms out for *Stage Two*, and your ship is once again small relative to the screen."
es1w8o,An open world space fantasy survival game: Planet Hopper.,"It would be a Minecraft style game, but it's set in space. The premise is, you wake up in your spacecraft as you're crash landed on a strange planet and you need to find materials to fix it. There could be hydraulic drills that you can use to mine meteors and parts of planets. Once you gather enough materials on the planet, you can fix up your spaceship and then the galaxy is yours to explore!\n\nEach planet would be like a biome within itself, and would also be randomly generated. If the planet is abandoned, you can name it, but if it has inhabitants, then you can't. The aliens of each planet would be randomly generated from a variety of parts in a variety of places those parts could go. You can also trade the aliens materials that you find on other planets. \n\nThere's also a *very* slim chance that you could find Earth in the game. It wouldn't be the Earth we know, as it would be destroyed from climate change. You also can't tell what your character looks like as they're wearing a space suit. There could also be a crafting type of mechanic in your spaceship where you gather materials and the ship just builds them for you. \n\nThe game would have no end except for maybe getting home. There doesn't really seem like the game could have an end as there's always a new planet you can find. Thanks for reading!"

Similarly, in the Klonoa franchise, using only the Square button Klonoa can activate switches grab certain things, and pick up enemies, which then enhance this button by becoming weapons to throw, tools to unlock items, provide special effects, and even be used as a double jump.\n\nI want to make a game with a versatile, one-button mechanic like this, but I'm drawing blanks on what to actually *do*.

ere6ga,"Shooter, destruction infinitely upgradable weapons","I have far below basic understanding of programming myself but is looking into a program, whatever comes after or during college/university i guess. Been a gamer most of my childhood and like to play different kinds of games and easily get bored, but i play mostly top tier games either by rating or popularity, you could say i have a high standard.\n\nI like 2 concepts, destructive enviroment, visual impactful damage to humans and human like robots. I also like stats, one thing that i don't see enough of is shooters a way to scale up the effectiveness and i'm not just talking about damage, range and attack rate here, i mean more than that. Anyway...\n\nYou are put into an arena that's large enough that a 20x zoom sniper may not be enough to properly see the targets. In the arena enemies in the form of humans and robots or a combination will spawn with their own arsenal of low tech or high tech equipments.\n\nYou will start the game with a basic low tier pistol and over the corse of the game you will gain access to say, 30 other base types fitting into it's own category such as pistol and revolver. Each weapon has access to a massive variety of stats, ranging from base stats such as damage, range, zoom, etc. Each weapon can get special stats such as velocity, projectile size and such which affect more stats at a greater level. Each weapon will also have access to powerful stats such as projectiles fired per shot, magnetized projectiles, splitting projectiles etc. Finally each weapon has access to base bullet and gun modifications such as adding sights, upgrading magazines, barrels, handles etc, more than usual where as the name and numbers of attachments available are higher than usual and many of them are fantasy with their own design. They all have an impact on the general performance of the guns. The idea is to potentially end up with a gun that could theoretically shoot machinegun fast shotgunning explosive rounds, if that's the path you went. Or machinegun fast shooting with absolutely no recoil or spread, hits dead center on the target.\n\nWhile on the topic of devastation, whether you can use a side app connected to the game or ingame displays, you would be able to see exactly where the bullet went, what it hit, how it affects the target and what kind of debuffs that give. I'm no medical professional, but say i were to shoot a lung one time, the target will have trouble breathing and will gain points towards internal and external bleeding, or i shoot the kneecap, slowing their movement down and doing the above effects. Or i could aim at the head and brain and get one out of a couple outcomes, disorientation, confusion, gunoperating impairment, perception of ally or enemy loss, etc. You will get an xray camera or internal organ side and front view with a description window of the impairment. You could pause the game and check the targets damage status and see what kind of functionality impairments the target has and try to exploit them. If the target should take it easy and stay still, try to cause it to move as much as possible, the target lost a great sense of hearing or sight, sneak around them easily. The target can't run due to leg impairment, you know the drill. As for robots, same implies... only less bleeding and a different damage effect(and weapon effectiveness) shooting of an arm could cause the robot to need a second or 2 to readjust and figure out what went wrong, shooting of an a leg will cause it to try to find the optimal way of transportation. Due to robots not feeling pain, trying to put a lot of holes into it isn't necessarly going to stop it.\n\nNeedless to say, this would be a very complicated high end game. \n\nTLDR. Put into a large army with obstacles and enemies, kill them with insanely customizable guns and see the damage they cause and readjust your combat style accordingly."

eqqj0j,Battle Royale Game Based on movie &amp; Novel by Koushun Takami,"I'm a big fan of the movie""Battle Royale"" and always wanted a game based upon it. Fortnite and the others of the ""Battle Royale"" genre suck and don't have the same feel as this great film(On top of having greedy business practices). So I have come up with an idea of a way to make this game work and maybe how to keep it going for years to come. So here we go(***Spoiler Warning for the Film for those that haven't watched it***):\n\n{Game-Start} \n\n1. Firstly, have the player create their own ""Student"". This will basically be confined to facial features and some slight changes to their school uniform(Like a girl not wearing her jacket or a guy have his jacket buttoned or unbuttoned). Since this game is set in Japan, race will be confined to Japanese, but you will be able to chose your sex. \n2. The game will start with an introductory cut-scene explaining why students are being taken and being forced to compete in the Battle Royale. And then have a cut-scene of the attack and kidnapping of the students  straight from the film. \n3. After the cut-scene, you will load into the school from the film, with a timer counting down until the game starts. As you wait around here, an NPC(Probably either  Kitano from the film or  Kinpatsu Sakamochi form the Novel, or a random pick of the two) will explain the rules of the game as they do in the film/book(And you will find out about the bomb on your neck, that will go off if you go to the wrong area or try to escape the island). Then, as the clock reaches its final seconds, each of the students(I'm thinking the same number as the film, so about 40 players) will be given a bag with a random weapon and other supplies and sent out into the game world. \n4. After they enter the world, they will have a few choices of how to play:\n\nA-) They can run off and kill everyone they see(More on combat later).\n\nB-) They can team up and kill everyone and then turn on each other later.\n\nC-) They can team up and complete a series of ""Quests"" that will allow them to escape from   \nthe island. Probably following a similar series of events to what the people in the movie   \ndid. \n\n{Game-Play}\n\n1.   This was the part that confused me the most. As the players will have a large range of weapons to chose from that are both firearms as well as melee weapons. So I thought about it and I believe that a Dark Souls-like combat system would work best for this kind of game. Have a dedicated dodge button, that will allow you to be able to get away from bullets, on top of arrows and melee attacks(This should make it fair for everyone around, as long as you know how to dodge correctly. Which will come with practice). Then you will lock-on to your opponent and fight it out like a duel from Dark Souls. \n2. When you kill someone, you will loot their body and get to keep whatever stuff they have(As long as you have room in your inventory, which will be shaped like the duffel bag from the movie).\n3. On top of getting loot from opponents, you will also find ""Legendary Outfits"" on the island, that will look like the clothing that some of the students from the film wore(Like the shorts and shirt that Mitsuko Souma wore) and maybe some custom outfits made especially for the game.\n4. On top of fighting, you will also have to keep an eye on the map you'll get and announcements that will be made, so that you can tell which areas become danger zones. In these zones, anyone that enters them will immediately have the bomb on their neck blow up and they will die instantly.\n5. Finally, for game-play, some players will be trying to complete the quest-line(Either alone or with a group) to escape the island). Not sure how this will be done yet, but a big part would be getting the bomb off your neck. This is probably the hardest way to do it, but will allow for their to be multiple winners.\n\n{Content on Disk}\n\n1. The game will be $60 dollars. With no MTXs of any kind.\n2. The game will have the iconic island from the movie/book, as well as a few others that reference other Battle Royale or similar films. \n3. All weapons, outfit, and other content will be available on day-one to everyone. \n4. An off-line, Single-player version of the game would be nice, and may come as a DLC later(Maybe packaged with the game later as a ""Complete Edition"" of the game. This would include cut-scenes of iconic moments, iconic boss fights, and meeting and teaming up(Or fighting)  with characters from the movie/Book). This would be far more tricky, and would defiantly have to come later. \n\nWell, thank everyone for reading. I really hope a developer will read this and get inspired to make a game like this."
eqodia,The Bike Thief. (A concept pitch.),"Bicycle theft is a [major problem](https://nypost.com/2020/01/18/brazen-portland-theft-steals-police-patrol-bike/amp/) in Portland. For this most heinous of all crimes, a special task force, the BIT (Bicycle Information and Recovery Taskforce) a has been created to prevent all acts nefarious and bicycular. (“Why isn’t it BIRT?” Because BIT sounds cooler, you idiot.)\n\nTo BE the number one criminal, now under constant you must max out your skills and perform bicycle heists to become... the Bike Thief. No name necessary, you are THE GUY (gender neutral) to go to for stolen bikes. \n\nGuts and Glory meets GTA meets Watch Dogs?, with the pointlessness of Untitled Goose Game, in an intentionally difficult experience with real-time lock-picking and U-lock breaking—don’t be seen breaking them by any of the busy Portlandians walking around, or a warrant will be issued for your arrest! Unless they’re like, not a snitch. Your call, bruh.\n\nIf you’re not ready to tackle something as complex and important as bike thievery just yet, start small: shoplifting to build your confidence skill, sneaking around in public to build your sneak skills, talking to strangers and meeting other thieves to pull off multi-mission bicycle heists, all the while building your charm skill and adding people to the polycule you’re probably a part of because it’s Portland.\n\nPerform side missions for your thieving pals who want particular bikes stolen under certain conditions. Frame others for bike theft! Dress the part! Customize your character! This is single-player, but a multiplayer experience could come later, with more options to play with your friends.\n\nSteal bikes, become a criminal overlord among the people in your polycule, be probably gay because it’s Portland* and help the game win some gay-themed awards for LGBT representation, eat donuts to learn the tricks of your enemies in... the Bike Thief!\n\n* Warning: a lesbian trans woman made this joke, it is unadvisable for non-gay people to proceed repeating it."
eqn9dn,Elemelons (Elemental Watermelon Game),"Yes, this is stupid.\nHas this been done before? Probably.\nIs it still funny? Fuck yeah.\nSo this game concept is one that will probably just be a funny concept and not be an actual game. This w would take the format of a mobile game, where you have to collect melons from your melon farm and do experiments on them to get different melons. Here's an example: \nYou take your melon, and you decide to electrify the fuck out it. You have an electric melon. \nYou can do this like a million times and shit, and your goal is the Æther Melon, the mightiest elemelon. How the fuck do you make it? I don't fucking know.\nI think a few features should be a melon shop for convenience, some melon quests where it's just not making the aether melon and repeatedly failing. If you got any ideas I'll gladly take them, this was just a stupid mobile game concept."

Basically you write a couple sentences (max 500 char) with a GIF, post it, and then people can slowly build on your story (or you can just build on your own story). The hypothesis was people might like the fun adventure of telling stories with other people or even on their own and then sharing them. \n\nLink to the game: [http://gifstories.mike.gg/](http://gifstories.mike.gg/)\n\nScreenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/lYuqv0m](https://imgur.com/a/lYuqv0m)\n\nAt this point it's early so it's more like a widget than a fully fledged out game. The top questions we have for you:\n\n1. Do you ""get it""? What do you think could be the appeal?\n2. Which type of customer / use case do you think could be the best initial fit? (e.g., is it more for memers to make short stupid stories together, or is it more for storywriters to write long stories over many blocks by themselves)\n3. How would you ""gamify"" it? e.g., is there points? are the points just about getting the most likes as in traditional social media?\n\nThanks for any thoughts!"
eqkzmv,Grand Theft Auto: Gotham City,"This game would be literally too awesome to exist, but if Rockstar creates this game in my lifetime, I would be seriously impressed. This would be a GTA style game set in the fictional city of Gotham, as well as its fictional characters. Rockstar could easily make Gotham City by drawing inspiration from Batman: The Animated Series. They would also have a lot freedom considering Gotham is a fictional city. \n\nThere are various iconic locations such as Wayne Manor, The Iceberg Lounge, ACE Chemicals, Arkham Asylum, etc. There will also be a ton of fun DC references within the game including Superman, Green Arrow, Metropolis, Court of Owls, etc.\n\nAside from the regular GTA weapons, there would be a ton of badass weapons in the game you could use such as Penguin's Umbrella Gun, Scarecrow Fear Gas Grenades, Joker Venom Grenades, etc. \n\nThe game is open world, obviously. If you reach 1-4 stars of notoriety, the cops will come after you. If you kill enough cops, you will get 5 stars, where the Batman will come after you. The way he comes after you depends on where you are. If you in a car, he will chase you in a Batmobile and shoot you with non lethal missiles. If you are within a building, he will be in stealth mode, turning it into a horror game. If you are just outside on foot he will use brute combat. You cannot kill Batman, but if you inflict enough damage, you can escape when he grapples away to recover.  He would be like a very, very hard boss battle, like Dark Souls hard. When fighting him, he can use various gadgets such as Batarangs to stun you, smoke pellets and grappling gun to retreat, and a batclaw to pull you in. \n\nThe main story is about is Ash, a 22 year old who moved to Gotham City due to its cheap rent after graduating college with a lot of debt. He watches the news, and wonders about the legend of the Batman, but lives a shitty life due to having a low amount of money and barely paying rent. A couple of his friends in the shady part of town invite him to pull off a bank heist. During the robbery, it gets messy when cops arrive and it turns into a shootout where you kill a ton of cops. The Batman arrives at the scene, and it turns to a horror game as you buddies get picked off one by one. You narrowly get into your car, and barely escape from the Batman. Because of this, you become somewhat of a celeb in the criminal underworld. You get offered a job by Black Mask, a high tier villain who is a rich Mafia boss. Because of this your pay increases substantially and you get to live the good life with a ton of money, all under a crime lord who is practically immune to Batman, but you have to go on dangerous missions.\n\n The main story consists of a gang war over control of Gotham between Black Mask's Mafia, Two-Face's Gang, Joker and Harley's Gang, and Penguin's Gang. There will be various characters in the main story with their own agenda which would be mercenaries/terrorists (Deadshot, Deathstroke, League Of Assassins, Bane), characters with their own cause (Catwoman, Riddler, Poison Ivy), as well as vigilantes (Batman and Red Hood)"
eqk57b,A revolutionary type game,"I'm envisioning a game that I've been considering for a year or 2 to start working on but have never really gone forward to start it. If anyone out there finds it interesting by all means you can have it. The game centers around a hero. But not a typical hero that you see in everyday superhero movies, but more of a hero made strictly for the gaming world. The hero has the power to switch in between dimensions at will to transverse levels and fight bosses. \n\nFor example, the game will have 2 different modes you can toggle between. 2D and 3D. You can toggle between these modes at any time with the press of a button. And when in 3D mode your hero, and the environment will have a 3D model, but when you switch into 2D mode your hero and the world around him transitions into 2D pixel-art sprites. With the transition between dimensions the player mechanics and environmental mechanics all change with it. The foundation of the game is that when you make a level, you have to develop 2 versions of the level, one in 2D and the other in 3D that the player can switch between at will. And within the level there will be parts or areas that you can only beat in 2D mode and parts that can only be beaten in 3D mode. As well as bosses that will be easier to fight in 2D mode at some points and 3D mode at other points. And it is up to the player to strategize based on the different components.\n\nI would love to know your guys thoughts on this and how it could be improved, any advice is welcome. I also want to know if any of you know of a game that is like this, because I have not been able to find one. And if I do decide to start creating it one day, any criticism or comments you guys have for me? And in any case this is just an idea for anyone."

eqi41j,Make your own FPS," \n\nHi, I’m J.A. Vázquez, the CEO of Reef Software.\n\nThe GameJam is in the corner. You want to participe and don't know what to do? Would you like to make a classic fps from the mid 90’s like Wolfenstein, Doom or Duke Nukem? You know, full of action, bullets, never boring… But it’s very tough to create a game like that from scratch, doesn’t it?\n\nWell, that’s why I’m here, because in Reef Software we want to help you make your own classic First Person Shooter. Let me introduce the new packages made by the team, that going to help you make this come true.\n\nWe use sprites from Free Doom just to show how the templates works. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-gF0PFei-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-gF0PFei-4) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first Package as you can see, you can have the perspective of the character and change to the respective animation depending on the direction you are looking at him. \n\n[https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-1-8-directional-view](https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-1-8-directional-view)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second package, you get the shooting system for your game, so you can shoot a pistol, a shotgun, a projectile shooter and even a particle shooter, also you can change how much ammo uses each weapon per shot, and using multiple types for ammo, and assigning it to each weapon you add, in case you want that some weapons share the ammo. It also includes some animations for the player, pickups like ammo, health and armor.\n\n[https://reef-software.itch.io/classis-fps-package-2-shooting](https://reef-software.itch.io/classis-fps-package-2-shooting)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Third package is the combination of the previous package, you can see the enemy in 8 different angles, but now you can shoot him and even killing him with the shooting system, previously explained.\n\n[https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-3-bundle](https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-3-bundle)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fourth package is the biggest one, because in this one, the enemy can see you, chase you and attack you. He can shoot you like a pistol, a shotgun or projectiles, and you don’t need to dive into the code to doing it. Even changing things like the how often he will attack you, the range of his attacks and the speed of aim system.\n\n[https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-4-full-gameplay](https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-4-full-gameplay)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut wait, there's more, there's a fifth package, This one has the same system as the fourth, but in this one we include a single normal map, because in this one you can have a level progression for your game.\n\n[https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-5-level-progression](https://reef-software.itch.io/classic-fps-package-5-level-progression)\n\n  \nThis package's is recommended for developers who wants to have a working prototype for their games, or developers that don’t want to spend time coding and want to focus in the animations and art.\n\nWell these are the first 5, Classic FPS templates made by Reef Software, that going to help you make your own game.\n\nThanks for watching, see you later."

eq6rij,"""Religion Hopper"" - An endless game","A strategy game where you have three random religions and in each phase one of those three religions will be fulfilled. Random events will alter the possibility of fulfillment for each religion. \n\nAt the end of every phase, only the followers of the one true religion will receive a blessing which increases their happiness. Monuments built for false religions will be destroyed, the monuments of the true religion remain. Consequently the next phase establishes two new religions and resets the probabilities for each one to be fulfilled.\n\nThe followers in this game tend to lose happiness by nature. The loss of happiness will increase once you assign a follower to an undesired religion. Throughout the phases, units will naturally be attracted by a certain religion and start building monuments for it. You have to cleverly reassign units in order to build out the monuments with the highest probability of being fullfilled. When the depression rate is too high, they will kill themselves. The goal is to keep your units alive as long as possible.\n\nTl;dr: A strategy game about cleverly assigning units to different religions in order to avoid suicide."
eq5n7g,An open world game where you can base anywhere,"Backstory: you play as an ex-soldier or hitman or something with decent survival skills convicted of a crime they didn't commit, you hatch a plan to escape to the wilderness and hide out till you can escape to another country and start a new life. You manage to escape into the wilderness but the government is relentless in trying to find you, and so they send police patrols, army patrols, bounty hunters and the like out to try and find you. \n\nGameplay: it's set in a large open world map (American midwest/Rockies mountain setting) where your player can setup a tent or little hut made out of branches and leaves and whatever else he can scavenge wherever they want in the map. There are lots of cool little hidden away, off the beaten track spots in the map (think gta5 map and RDR2 map) but if you stay camped in one spot for too long a government helicopter might spot your camp and send out patrols, forcing you to keep moving around the map. There are small towns dotted around the map and roads all over the map as well. If your character dons a disguise he can rob a gas station or other store but it will mean patrols will be sent out to track him in that area and increased patrols in and around that location. \n\n\nSo yeah that's the base idea of the game. I just had this idea while reading another post on this subreddit and thought well someone might be able to do something with this and it's a game idea I would love. I love huge open world maps with lots of little things to explore and i would love a game where you can setup a tent or whatever anywhere and have that as your base.\n\nThanks"

epvtml,“Chosin”; my idea for a realistic FPS set in the Korean War,"We’ve seen a lot of historical FPS games set in Vietnam, WW2, and so on. But what about the Korean War? Well, here is where I introduce my idea. What if there was a realistic, tactical multiplayer FPS like the Rising Storm or Insurgency games set during the Korean War? There would be large-scale maps based around Seoul, the Chosin Reservoir (hence the name), Pyongyang, etc. where you can either fight for the UN or North Korean/Chinese forces. Soldier loadouts would also be authentic, with UN using M1 Garands, SMLEs, and NK/China using Russian rifles such as the SKS and Mosin Nagant. Vehicle combat would also play a big role in the game, with tanks such as the Sherman and T-34s. The realism part of the game would play the same as it does in Rising Storm, Arma, etc, with limited HUD, realistic bullet mechanics, great emphasis on communication, and whatnot. Since the game would be in multiplayer only, it would only be PvP servers of 64 players or Co-Op against bots. \n\nI hope you guys liked my idea. It’s sad that the Korean War is known as the “Forgotten War” and barely receives attention from most people today.  Maybe if this was a real game it would have the same effect Battlefield 1 had on players about WW1 and teach them about this war?\n\nTl;dr: My idea is essentially a Rising Storm/Squad-type FPS game set in the Korean War with authentic weapons, battles, etc."

eptqcq,"Large Scale War Game [Revised because last one had like, no content in the body lol]","So basically, this game would be a very large scale modern war simulation game. There would be a very small number of servers, but a large amount of players in each server. The battles would last a long time, but players can leave or join during it. It would be similar to WW2 Online, but far more modern. I would prefer it to span over multiple biomes, such as a desert, forest, and destroyed cities. It would have a squad (not the game lol) type gameplay where higher ranks lead their squads and can control the squad by guiding movements and other things. It'll also have a realistic ranking system, and maybe even some kind of training system where you do some kind of training to rank up. The wars would be huge maps, with multiples POIs that you fight for control over. Unlike most domination games, control doesn't mean standing there at a point. Domination in this game would mean having the point secured with nobody in it. You would want people in positions to guard the points though, because with that large amount of players, it'd take a lot to guard a point. There could also be different divisions that you unlock as you play more, such as special operations which means you get more tactical items. At this point you're probably asking ""How do you win?"" And the answer to that is you must take all points including the enemy team's base. Each base gives you an advantage of some sort, whether it be increased ammo or new weapons. This is so games don't drone on for days. This game will be designed to be very realistic with very high damage and low health. This is to force players to be tactical and not just run and gun. It will have a proximity-based VOIP unless you press a button that activates a radio, with switchable channels (squad, team, party, and music.) Finally, there'd be customizable uniforms and different body armour types. For example, you could buy helmet covers (basically skins), attachments, and other things that give you an advantage. Perhaps items would be unlocked with rank. There would also be NO pay-to-win, as this is supposed to be as realism based as possible. Any suggestions or other discussion would be great!"

He stays stationary in the middle but has blaze like fireball attacks and the occasional ""minion spawn attack"" even with all the other mobs spawning. He could also maybe have a ground slam attack (I dont know if that's possible). But the fight is kill the 3 (three) Miniboss Pigmen and after they die they drop a specific item (like in the first room). After you collect all 3 drops, you go over to a chest (1 per wall, left, right, and across from the boss) and deposited 1 (one) item per chest. Once all 3 are deposited, his immune buff disappears and players are now allowed to hurt him. And if they do not kill him in *x* seconds, they have to redo the whole fight again but boss health kept where they got it down too. Once killed a key (like a loot crate key) is given to each player and that is their ""key"" to their loot. The final area after the boss holds 6 chests and 1 player can open 1. Each player basically gets their own chest. Each chest has the same loot pool and the same chance per item/reward.\n\nWith the possibility of loot after each room cleared!\n\n\nExtra Info: I love Destiny 1/2 and have always wanted my own strike in the game where I get to create it. Or raid because those are amazingly fun. But this is my vagueish take on a dungeon and would love to see this happen, especially on minecraft!!! Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this! I hope this is all possible and if so I can easily go into more detail on what it would look like and more in depths where ever I need to. Cya!"
epssdr,"Pod racing with weapons, so simple yet never done successfully in the recent years","I don't know if anyone here watched the old series Oban star racers but basically i am talking about the race system there but as a video game, every player gets a pod/ space ship preferably with custom made capabilities like the nfs car making options, also you should be able to upgrade your engine etc. and the weapons ofc could be anything from aim and shoot auto aim to melee weapons i don't wanna go into detail since this is just a concept but i really want a game like this but dont have the capability to do it so i was hoping that maybe someone will see this and make it a reality"
eprvfm,Battlefield like Pixel Game wit destructible environment,"\nI'm thinking of making (as the title sugest) a pixel game that would have similar elements as the battlefield franchise. Although with some twists. Most of the map would be totally destructible although you would get a tool that would allow you to place new blocks to build bases and the like to make bunkers, foxholes, castles anything you want while facing an enemy team that doing the same thing all in an attempt to kill you. \n\nFeaturing procedural maps that keep each new game totally unique while at the same time using some prebuilt maps for consistency. \n\nThe time period would probably be either ww2 or ww1 depending on both your comments and which one I like more. The game would also have fully realtisc weapons for whichever time period is picked. \n\nI'm not sure on whether or not I vehicles would be added but if they are added they would be able to be disabled by destroying the track or a wheel for the respective vehicle, this would make players choose to be more patient when shooting at vehicles for one well placed shoot in a wheel could leave a vehicle disabled and a liability for the enemie team.\n\nWeather. I'm thinking about making random weather from fog to snow to the worst storm imaginable that would vary match to match and might even copy the weather IRL(would  be pretty cool lol). \n\nMap size. I would probably make the maps very large scale on the size of squad or some of the larger battlefield maps to allow players to utilize their building abilities and the destructive environment to build fortress around hard points and traps on roads.\n\nMatch size. I'm thinking of making the match 64 vs 64 or potentially 128 vs 128 although that could lead to a number of server issues and sever lag if people with poor ping joined in. The standard would probably be 64 vs 64\n\nPrice. Idk I'm not totally sure on what a good price would be or any price for that matter.\n\nPlease tell me in the comments what you think of this idea plus what you would add if this was your game along with how much you would pay for this kind of game! Thanks have a good day yall!!\n\nJust letting those of you who are getting ready to fry me in the comments for my grammar, I typed this all on mobile in 10 minutes trying to cram my 2month long thought into this word diahera above you. Please have mercy."

epkurj,A wish for a ghost sandbox simulator,"The general idea:\n\nA ghost sandbox simulator with good/neutral/evil/ mechanics.  \n\n\nA game where you play as the only ghost in town and roam around different locations trying to find a way to pass to the other side. You can play as a good ghost, bad or basically anything in between. Do you want to be like the Patrick Swayze ghost from the movie Ghost? Sure, you can do that. Maybe you want to be the Dude ghost and just do absolutely nothing valuable? Sure, no problem at all.  \n\n\nYou could be doing everything from getting the neighbor dog to stop barking at 2 AM, take control over a person's body (think Beetlejuice) to swapping nametags at the local wedding party or just do absolutely nothing while you float over a family eating dinner in perfect harmony. You have to find out how you want to live your ghostly life and reap the consequences of your actions. Oh, and I forgot to mention, if people get too drunk, they might be able to engage in a spiritual conversation with you, making you able to plant ideas in their head, which could potentially have devastating effects."

epfnqj,Cinematic war experience FPS,"Hello,\n\nThis is an idea that is too large in scope for me now. I am still working on it in because I believe it's a great idea and I would like your feedback.\n\nIt is the first FPS game that makes use of artillery and MLRS in scenarios.\n\nThe game is set in the Cold War era and focuses on the battlefield immersion, the game should be singleplayer and maybe co-op.\n\nSound is extremely important, the use of artillery and MLRS is always present and the sounds are nearly deafening (needs work here to make it playable).  The player must realize from NPCs when to seek cover and when to advance under friendly artillery fire.\n\nEach mission is made from set pieces and plays out from an observer point of view. The main character of the game is the narrator which tells the story of war and sets the order of playable missions. Chronological order is not necessarily required.\n\nAn example of a mission will be: Start: Narrator/player views the field and is given a description by other NPCs. The enemy attack begins and everyone is in cover from artillery fire.\n\nOnce the artillery fire stops the enemy is already close with tanks and mechanized infantry.\n\nThe narrator observes a friendly antitank position and the player is immediately transferred to it and begins playing.\n\nAfter this sequence the player is again transferred to the narrator POV and goes on retreat observing the antitank position being overrun. \n\nEnd: After other tasks the player receives a conclusion of the battle, what it meant, how it changed the war.\n\nNote: all battles have predetermined outcomes, the player plays soldier storylines and is not key in the winning of battles.\n\nKey mechanics: Statistical death: the player is only hit if rules of war are not respected, the tasks are not fulfilled in time, or if the player runs in the open.\n\nAdvance even through death. The entire storyline is playable even if the player dies during the mission. The narrator automatically jumps to the next story. If the player wants to find out the rest of the story then a restart is required. The player can finish the game without playing.\n\nDifficulty settings from story mode to hardcore mode where the game must be finished without any saves from end to end.  \n\n\nThank you for reading."
epf4cy,s p e e d . | An extremely fast paced FPS.,"# Introduction\n\ns p e e d . is a fast paced first person shooter where 2 teams fight with guns on a random map. It is a game designed to be difficult to master.\n\n# Main Ideas | Gameplay\n\n* The game is slightly similar to the round-based gameplay of **Counter-Strike 1.6,** though, with a few **twists.**\n* If you headshot an enemy with any gun, it is an **instant** kill.\n* Weapons are able to be bought at the start of every round. Every weapon has it's own **firerate, damage** and **range.**\n* Movement speed is **high,** though it is not high enough to make the game broken / not fun to play.\n* There are spray patterns, though, moving while shooting will **not penalize** you (in terms of accuracy). If you are moving while shooting, however, you will do less damage. This is to prevent **running and gunning** from being the meta.\n* It has **round-based** gameplay, with the player purchasing weapons at the start of every round, to kill the other team. Unlike Counter-Strike, however, there are **no** Hostage or Defusal modes. It is just a **Team Deathmatch.** In other words, there are no bombsites, no hostages; just two teams battling it out.\n* There is **no minimap or map.** You will have to rely on your memory to know where you are in a map.\n* The only **HUD elements** in the game, is the **kill cam** (where you can see if a player has killed another player), your **health,** and your **money** (to buy guns at the start of rounds).\n\n# Main Ideas | Graphical\n\n* The graphics are very reminiscent of **SUPERHOT's** graphics.\n* The **artstyle** of the game is in the style of **polygraphic** art.\n* **Your player** is a crystal black, though, only **you** can see this.\n* **Enemies** are a crystal red.\n* The **environment** in which you play in is completely white, with **shaders** being added in to give the game a sense of **depth** (even when everything is the same colour).\n\n# End\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. Please, let me know what you think about this idea. And, as always, have a good day."
epavhw,"A political game like House of Cards, where you gain power through corruption.",Imagine a game where you play the puppet master.

epafk5,A mobile magic tower defense game,You are a wizard trying to defend your tower. You chuck potions at oncoming enemies and their loot automatically drops into your inventory. On the go and or between waves you make really simple potions to supply you for the next wave. These potions would be like different types of magical bombs. Thoughts?
ep7enf,A roster management turn-based strategy game that also has arena RPG elements,"One type of game I would die for is a game that combines roster management, turn based tactics, and arena 3rd player RPG games into one game.\n\n**Core Idea:** You play as the warlord of a kingdom, sending troops to battle against the troops of other warlords. The battles look like a Fire Emblem game, but rather than boring animations, the game goes into a small arena for 15 seconds where your damage, health, speed, etc. are based on your character's stats in the tactical overlay and how you play the game tactically.\n\nTo illustrate what this game would look like, I'll offer three games that I feel fit each component the best.\n\n**Roster Management:** Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI - ROTK has always had one of the most extensive rosters, making it interesting from a gaming perspective as you seek to recruit and retain the most effective officers. I want a world with a large but flexible roster. Winning battles could mean you capture officers from the enemy and force some to defect. Making use of defectors to fight their home country, however, could lead to disaster. The one thing I would change from the ROTK XI roster system is that soldiers should have an easier way to grow and improve, deepening your investment in the roster (and the sense of loss you get when an officer dies or defects). Furthermore, the size of the world roster expands as soldiers from individual units survive combat and gain distinction and becomes named officers.\n\n**Turn Based Tactics:** Fire Emblem, pick your favorite - Fire Emblem's turn based tactics model is incredibly effective for making the battlefield feel personal. It's characters in a skilled warband fighting in a skirmish against other skilled characters. It works well for a personalized roster, and the weapon triangle contributes to interesting tactical decisions on how to position your characters.\n\n**3rd Player Arena:** Kingdoms of Amalur - This one is the one that I don't have a good fit for. I'm envisioning a small fighting arena where you would control a character to fight 1v1 against the other character you attack (or attacked you) on the tactical overlay. Kingdoms of Amalur has fun fluid combat, and it'd be a good fit for a fight in a small arena where faster lighter characters would have to rely on roll dodging to avoid damage."

ep06l6,Looking for an idea to make a game that will help me make another eventually,"Hello everyone, i am currently struggling in finding an idea of a game. The thing is that i already have an idea for a great game but i only have one person with me in design (i am a developer familiar with the hole pipeline of design) and achieving this game requires animations and i should raise fund to pay for an animator and another designer and another developer. So, I thought why not create another simpler game which i can manage it using existing animations from Unreal Engine's marketplace and mixamo and with its money i hire people for the first game and get it done.Now, my problem is that i could not think of something that can be done in 2-3 months and make it really work to make enough money. I said why not try the community and see what kind of game and gameplay they want to play and get inspiration.\n\nSomethings about me to help you help me better: I use Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprint and C++), familiar with the hole pipeline of design and my friend is a designer and he is with me on this. I prefer the game to be a more like some sort of either endless/repetitive gameplay so it don't have to have a storytelling or at least not a storytelling that should have cinematic (this is the problem with the first game).\n\nThanks."
eozz6w,I'm making a survival/dungeon crawler game and I want your input and suggestions!,"Hello! A friend and I are making a survival/dungeon crawler game and we would love to hear what you guys would like to see in the game!\n\nThe game will be set in a little run-down town. Somehow you end up here and find out about some form of magical mine/dungeon/underground realm where every time you enter it's different and death causes a a time-warp-like thing that rewinds time to the moment before you entered the mine but some things stay the same (Like item unlocks, rescued NPCs, etc)\n\nIn the town there will be wrecked buildings and structures and things that were once run by NPCs that mysteriously got lost in the mines/caves/dungeon/underground realm and the reason isn't revealed until later in the game and we haven't decided on what it should be yet (Like an evil that brought them down there or whatever.)\n\nThe word **realm** will be referring to the mysterious underground world that the game takes place in (Under the town) from now on.\n\nThe realm will consist of many floors (Probably around 70) that will be procedural generated, getting harder as you descend. Each floor will have enemies that all need to be killed before advancing and they will also have items available to be collected (like ores and wood and stones and things) and those will get more challenging and rewarding as you go deeper. There will me **areas** or **""chunks""** that will be sections of floors (like ten or 20) that are unique from other chunks. For example ""The Mines"" could be the top 10 levels with very simple enemies and very basic ores and materials for crafting. Like Bronze and Wood could be collected from harvesting and Slime could be collected from certain enemies and then combined to make Slime Sword which could be a slightly more powerful weapons than the basic Stone Sword that you start out with but this can only be done if you have unlocked that recipe by killing 15 slimes and just things like that. Where you can only craft it with the right materials and after you've unlocked it by completing unique tasks and stuff.\n\nBosses are stronger than normal enemies who are encountered in the Realm at the end of every area/chunk and need to be defeated in order to move on to the next chunk. After a boss is defeated it could unlock certain items to find in future runs, give currency that carries over (When you die you lose everything except for unlocks, NPCs, certain currencies, recipes, etc), or even triggers certain events in the surface area. When a boss dies it will drop items in varying qualities and quantities  depending on how well you combated the boss.\n\nNPCs or non-playable characters will be prominent throughout the game and they must be ""obtained"" by doing various tasks like rescuing them, encountering them, housing them, or just them showing up from out of town or passing by. Each NPC will help you in different ways ranging from selling you items, giving you recipes in exchange for materials or coins, rewarding you for completing tasks, giving you temporary or permanent buffs, or aiding you when you need it most. (Like randomly appearing in the Realm below level 30 and offering weapons or medical items for example)\n\nSo, here's where you come in. We need to know what YOU would want to see in this game. What should the story be like? How fast should you progress? What should the overruling theme of the game be? Should we go for a happy, upbeat vibe or a menacing and intense vibe? What kind of NPCs and enemies and bosses would you like to see? Do you want it to have simple stats like 1 hit = 1 health loss, or complex where each monster comes in different levels with different attack values and health values? Would the game to be more combat-intensive or story driven? Should there be many items or few to keep things simple? Basically tell us anything you can and we'll take it **all** into consideration when making the game!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, and we look forward to your responses! \^-\^\n\n\-OOPS! Studio!"

You have to manage the recruits directly below you and whatever they are doing to recruits below them.\n\nYou have to manage the income, convince people to join below you or someone else (recruiting directly below you is easier but costs you more money, so you wanna put them below your recruits and possibly their recruits - it could be a whole tree!)\n\nYou also have to figure out ways to spend your money on advertisements and lobbyists to make sure that your company lasts.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

eoz8hr,A survival game set in a laboratory,"So my idea is a first person/possibly third person game set in a laboratory during a zombie apocalypse. This idea will be split into two parts, the mechanics of the game before getting into the story.\n\nThe Mechanics:\n\nThe game works like most zombie apocalypse games in the sense that getting hit by a zombie will deal damage. However there will also be some puzzle elements to it, such as looking for specific key cards to finding alternative paths to an objective, etc. The player character can walk, run, jump and crouch.\n\nCrouching behind an object hides the player from certain enemies, but if the enemy sees the player, they can stab them with a knife or shoot them with a pistol if they have the ammo.\n\nThe Story:\n\nHere I will only talk about the story of the game and not the expanded universe.\n\nThe player is a Urgent Response Unit (URU) operative who has been dispatched with a unit into the Henderson facility of the Scientific Research Institute (SRI) to evacuate any surviving personnel. At some point, the player may learn that the URU has abandoned them there in a quarantined facility with no known way out. The player will then have to work with the survivors to find a way out and survive.\n\nI know this is an ambitious project, but I just wanted to share this to get it off my chest. I do have expanded lore on the universe this game is set in if anyone is interested. This is also my first ever post, so it might not be perfect.\n\nThe lore of the world I've presented to you is expansive, as I like to come up with stories in my spare time, so i might make a post on the lore if requested.\n\nThank you for reading till the end."

So can you help me by replying which idea you guys think is better?\n\nIdea #1; The gods thought they needed more power over the universe, therefore the gods started siphoning the life force and power from planet to plant, until they found planet Earth. The gods saw that the Earth has traces of highly intelligent life. The Earth is inhabited by 4 elemental mages that rule a kingdom each. One day, the air mages scout say the gods siphoning off energy from the planet in secret and quickly reported this incident to the great air mage... so, the air mage rallied up the mage of fire, mage of water, and mage earth... then together they took their armies and used their power to travel to the place of the gods and strike them down, before they can destroy any other planets.\n\nIdea #2; The Earth was once a happy place, where everyone lived in peace and harmony... then the gods took over and started their rain of terror. The trio are known as, Ianna Goddess of Emotion, Durmamo God of Space, and Tera Goddess of Time... together they create a devastating force. The gods destroyed entire cities, states, countries, regions, continents... only because they were looking for a human who has an incredible power that they are highly afraid of. At last the gods found the human with this immerse power that they have sought for so long. It was a human boy named Daniel and he lived a happy life with his mother, father, and sister. The gods found his home and immobilized his family in a fixed point of time and threatened to kill his family unless he gives up his powers... but, Daniel didn't know what the gods were talking about because he had never experienced using this sudden power the gods say he has within him. Because Daniel did not give the presentation of power that the gods asked for... the gods killed his mother, father, and little sister and took their souls... then, Daniel suddenly fell to the floor and a shock wave of power surged from within his body... powerful enough to push even the gods back... while Daniel cries he is teleport-ed to some weird unfamiliar place where he met some powerful mages which help him control his powers and find inner peace, but secretly Daniel was getting stronger only to plot his revenge on the gods for killing his family."
eox7r6,A game where 100 people are in a little world and they have to work together to survive.,"I dont really want this to become a game, so much as it is a simple thought that might be cool to share. That really is what i feel about the subreddit.\n\nSo the core premise would be that you would be teamed up with 100 more people, and be placed in a randomly generated world of medium size, nothing crazy like Minecraft’s world but nothing too crowded, and the idea is that everyone has to cooperate to not die for 30 to 50 minutes. If you get killed, you cannot respawn and have to be sent back to the lobby. Kind of like a mixture between Fortnite and DayZ."

Being not a selfish bastards he and the ground crew listen to the radio for any calls for help, then send the C130 out with the supplies the enclave needs. Also while in the air the C130 can spot potential dangers and warn the near by enclaves about it.\n\nI envision the game play going something like this:\n\nEnclave 1 radios a request for medical supplies\n\nEnclave 2 radios a request for water purifiers\n\nPlayer loads medical supplies, water purifiers, and some spare emergency radios on the plane then takes off for Enclave 1\n\nEnroute to enclave 1 the player spots a band of mutant bandits and warns enclave 1 to recall their farmers and close their gates\n\nThe player flies over Enclave 1 and airdrops drops the medical supplies then turns for Enclave 2.\n\nOn the way the player spots a band of survivors heading to Enclave 1 and drops the spare radios on them. Once the survivor band makes contact the player tells them to go to Enclave 2 because the  Enclave 1 has mutant bandits in the area.\n\nThe player reaches Enclave 2 and drops off the water purifiers. Then turns for home.\n\nOn the way home the player gets a notification that Enclave 2 has requested medical supplies for the new refugees.\n\nUpon reaching hope the player loads up food, ammunition and a double load of medical supplies.\n\nThe player takes off towards Enclave 1 when they radio in that they are under siege and are low on food and ammunition.\n\nHaving preemptively stocked up the player arrives at the besieged enclave and drops the food, ammunition, and medical supplies before turning to enclave 2. \n\nThe player sees a storm gathering in the mountains north of enclave 2 and warns them about flash flooding.\n\nAs the player passes over enclave 2 to  drop off the rest of the medicine he sees the people of the enclave sand bagging their living area and moving their animals to safety."

A 3rd could play as a hero unit and micro an elite force.,"\n\nLord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth Is an example of a game that has hero units but they are all controlled by one player.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrZ0VEKXCUM\n\nThis Idea came from watching competitive games of Age of Empires, and seeing people micro the military units. There's only so much time to react and make micromovements, and most of their time has to be spent managing the larger economy and moving large masses of military units.\n\nThe LotR:BfME game has hero units like Gandalf etc and you can level them up and if they die you can get them again after a short timer countdown.\n  \n\nBasically I would like to see one player play as the hero unit, more like a MOBA almost, but they can  defend the other team member as they play the classic rts and also do raids  on the other player.  The hero unit could either earn a small force of units to control, or maybe be given some by the other players.\n\nThe last player is the Military General which would control many normal military units, usually several hundred.  It could be cool to have these people not share line of sight, or not in real time. I think especially for the hero unit. They could communicate, and see what areas have been explored."
eohqvu,What would you like to see in an Isometric/2.5D Samurai game?,"Hey guys,\n\nFor my first game I want to make a game about a lone Samurai fighting against several knights. For duels against bosses it'll be 2.5D like a fighting game, but for minor grunts it'll be isometric. It'll be borrowing a lot of ideas from Sekiro such as the posture system and several parries. What other mechanics would you like to see? And since he's going from Japan to england, what environments should I design, apart from a road with cherry blossoms, a  castle, a mountain, a ship, grasslands, and a forest?"
eofwa6,Looking for Ideas to Make my Survival Game Idea Fun,"I want to make a survival game that has some elements of horror to it. It will be First Person and, basically, you start out in a large manor with multiple buildings and such and the point of the game is to escape to freedom. In order to escape, you have to enter different rooms to grab a key or item that helps you progress. Each room however is a different world based on a monster or mythological creature. For instance, one might lead to a forest that has a Wendigo or a labyrinth containing a Minotaur. When a person opens the door to the world, that door stays open for the rest of the game which allows the creature to enter the manor and stalk/chase you. There will be multiple rooms but not every room will need to be opened. My thought was to make the first couple rooms the player opens have the items needed to escape and anything opened after that is just for the players enjoyment. This way the game can be different each time the player starts a new game.  \n\n  \n\nMy question is, does this sound fun to play or will it get boring after a while? I'm wondering if I should add a weapon(s) that can stun/kill creatures because there could be a few of them stalking you at once but I don't know if that will detract from the survival experience. What would you add/remove to make the game more plausible/fun? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time."

f60wq6,I just joined this group because I just had a simple idea and this is the perfect place.,"The idea isn’t something I have much detail on. But it’s a 2d fighter with flashy fast paced combat like the many fighting games made by Arcsys. The game is a Godzilla game, and since it’s from the point of view of the kaiju they wouldn’t be hulking and slow. The game would be flashy as hell obviously. \n\nBut the real questions are who would you main? And how would you want your favorite kaiju to play?"

f5thkl,an idea for a somewhat meta metroidvania platformer.," the setting for this game is a city with a class system based around  platforming, the slum dwelling lower class can't jump or have little  jump height, the middle class have average jump height but have nothing  special to them, and the elite upper class have things like wall jumps  and double jumps. you play as a lower class boy who cant jump, when  exploring the slums you find a pair of boots, you put them on and find  yourself able to jump, you just collected an upgrade, an ability that  only a legendary lord was able to do, the games story has you rise to  power collecting upgrades and eventually become the king of this  platforming based city, as you have collected enough upgrades to become  the most powerful platformer in the city."
f5qchy,A third person shooter where the player can manipulate the four elements,"Yes, this is Avatar with Guns. Before you go hysterical, here's the idea.\n\nHumanity is at war in sort-of fantasy setting. At war with titan-like beings called elementals.\nElementals are forces of nature given life. So there's the typical fire, water, earth and air, but also unique ones like lava, swamp and ice.\nSome humans also have elemental powers, because.....science. \n\nGameplay\nLike I said, third person shooter. Think Mass Effect meets Uncharted. Players have a much higher degree of freedom than just run, enter cover and shoot.\n\nHere's the cool part: Guns and elements interact in unique ways. Fire can cause guns to overheat and explode. Water can cool down a burned ally. Earth can make you bulletproof.\nOn and on.\n\nEach element has its weakness, similar to the natures in the Naruto series.\nPlayers can also use elements in more creative ways, like using earth to make barriers or platforms,using water to create slides, using air to glide or using fire to create cover.\n\nElements react with each other of course. Water on fire makes steam. Fire on swamp explodes. Air on water makes mist. Think Divinity Original Sin 2 and its brilliant system. \n\nGuns are divided into 3: Ballistic, Energy and Experimental. Each one has a different reaction to each element. The players can discover them on their own.\n\nPlayers can unlock new skills to be used with each element. They may or may not be classes (personally I prefer classless) but players can have an affinity for an element and unlock unique abilities and even VARIATIONS (eg a fire user can unlock Thermal ability, Earth users can use sand). \n\nWhat do you think? This can be used for a single player \n\nP. S: I had to keep myself from using the word ""bend""."

f5ojoe,Body damage and dismemberment (Living and fighting past it),"I had an idea playing The Surge, where you can target certain limbs and armored parts of enemies to get loot. The whole industrial/SciFi themes made me think of doing a merging of limb damage and dismemberment with trans-humanism.\n\nSo, the idea basically would entail that your character's major body-parts (chest, legs, arms, head) would have individual health values. When the health value gets too low, the body part would cause issues (a damaged arm can't lift heavy items, a bruised chest would cause coughing fits, etc.) and eventually, be completely dysfunctional. Obviously, your head and chest would be essential. However, losing an arm may not be so fatal, and may let you pull out a pistol with the other in a pinch, or even take a handy mechanized prosthetic, which is where the trans-humanism comes in\n\nThis would be a failsafe idea in combat. Failsafes could include several items and equipment used by the player. Here is a list of some examples of failsafes I thought up.\n\n- A cauterizing instrument, to stop bleeding (should you add bleeding from dismemberment or damage)\n- One handed weaponry, should you only have one hand\n- Lightweight Prosthetics, granted if you can carry them\n\nYou could also include preventative measures like armor to reduce limb damage, or even have remote control units with destructible parts that wouldn't put the player character at risk. Add other mechanics alongside it as you see fit and flesh it out further. You're the dev at the end of the day."

The more battles you win the more spawns you get but always rank up to an eventual top rank with the most skills but hardest missions going against  better players that are lower rank.

f5ewy1,HEAVEN OR HELL: An FPS where everyone is in a different dimension.,"This game is a 3D polygraphic game.\nYou win a match by being the last one alive, and there are 3 matches in a game.\nNo one respawns until the next round.\n\nEveryone chooses their own weapons pregame, similar to CS:GO’s Shop but with no money.\n\n\nThe twist?\n\n\nNot everyone is on the same plane of existence.\n\nYou can spawn in Heaven (White terrain, black backdrop)\nPurgatory (Gray terrain, gray backdrop)\nHell (Black terrain, white backdrop.)\n\nYou can only see people on your plane of existence.\nYou can still walk and bump into people on the other planes of existence, as they’re all on the exact same map.\n\nAs in, Heaven players are on the same spatial map as Hell and Purgatory players, but they can’t see or hear Hell or Purgatory players even though they can’t occupy the same space.\n\nYou can hop planes by getting a kill. You switch to any plane you’re not currently on.\n\nPlayers can cast spells, but spells only affect players on other dimensions (ie: shoot a vortex which can only hit Hell players which you need to find by visual or audio cues)\n\n\nWhen hit, players drop Spectral Matter which gives off their location to other dimensions.\n\n\nHow does this change the trope of FPS?\n\nOnly Players are dimension bound. Objects aren’t.\nCorpses are visible to all players, along with bulletholes and spells.\nAt around 10 players left (out of 20), players start the event known as “DISPELL”.\n\nAll players drip Spectal Matter and the dimension with the most players will start vaporizing. Players need to hop immediately or perish with the dimension.\nAfter the dimensions with the most players are gone, the next one starts and this time it is the one with the most bodies on it.\n\nYou are locked in the dimensions until you get a kill. The last dimension starts vaporizing at the final 2 players with a 3 minute timer. The winning player ascends and wins."

f5dcys,Strategical survival game,"First let me say that this is a game i will potentially make myself or with another poster potentially. I am posting it here so see if its an interesting idea people could like playing, and potentially gather more ideas.\n\n\n\nThe game is mostly text based and is purely strategical. The objective of the game is to last as many days as possible. You would have a leaderboard with the most days survived. The game would hopefully have enough depth and content so that the ""maximum days possible"" is never really discovered and new records keep being broken.\n\n\nThe game has the following stats:\n\n\n* Gold\n\n\n* Income\n\n\n* % chance of survival\n\n\n\nWhen every days begin, your income is added to your gold amount. You cannot end a day if your % chance of survival is below 50%. It doesn't matter if its 60% or 70%, as long as its over 50%. There is no actual RNG involved, you just need a chance above 50%.\n\n\nYour chance of survival is determined by 3 factors.\n\n\nFamine % + Defense % + Revolt %\n\n\nEssentially the 3 % are multiplied together and need to be above 50%. For example, a very high defense % can compensate for lower % in other areas.\n\n\nDuring a day, here a few things you can change:\n\n\n\n**Tax rate % (1-100):** This will affect your income in a very immediate way, but will have a slower effect on your revolt %. It will take a long time before your taxes causes your revolt % to be problematic, but will also take a long time to fix.\n\n\n**Roles**: You can assign roles to your villagers. Its up to you to change the roles every days as much as you want to. Here is a few possible roles:\n\n\n* Guard: This help increase your defense %\n\n\n* Farmer: This help increase your income\n\n\n* Nurse: This help increase birthrate. \n\n\n* Clown: This help lower revolt %.\n\n\n* Scientist: Reduce research time.\n\n\nThere would also be a lot of different research to do, that takes different amount of days to complete. New roles to discover and so on.\n\n\nHowever, every days, the difficulty of defending the town would increase, and would require better defense and technologies to survive. Something like x^1.3 difficulty where x is number of days.\n\n\n\nThe game would be designed in such a way where a total beginner would probably survive around 30-40 days without much trouble.\n\n\nA more experienced player could do 100+\n\n\nAnd the best players would compete for scores around 500-600\n\n\nThere would be around 100 different possible research, with various research times (1 to 10 days). Most of them can be researched further to improve the research."

f58qgt,A medieval/fantasy 2D side scroller where the aim is to get back your head and get revenge,"Ok, so the title is the basics of it, but the part where you have to get your head back is actually a core game mechanic. For example, along your journey you will encounter different objects to use as heads. These might be enemy’s, parts of enemy’s, projectiles, or just items, you can pick off the floor. All of these count as a single point of health (similar to mushrooms in Mario), which gets removed when you get hit by an enemy, as the ‘head’ falls off. Extra health can be added by using hats. These ‘heads‘ can also come with special abilities, for example: Candle which lights up dark areas, a fish which allows you to breathe underwater, a bomb, which after Thrown off (all heads can be thrown off at will) explodes, or-a classic-a pumpkin where you can change its face-a bit like a cosmetic (or shoot fire if it’s lit, although there‘s probably a better ability I haven’t thought of). Some heads however have no abilities, and are just methods to get health, for example acorns in one of the first areas. You can either to attack, jump on enemy’s heads, or use your sword hilt to, well, do whatever the object you have attached to the sword hilt does (like a sword fish, fishing rod, or simply, a baguette).   \nThat‘s about the core elements of the game, so now I’ll get started on the story.\n\nyou start off in a city like area as a cloaked figure working your way through crowds of people, all rushing to get somewhere desperately. Amongst these are tall knights, which cause Your character to hunch (or something to blend in more) whenever he/she walks past them. Eventually you come to a cathedral like area where everyone is crowding once you reach its’ end, you see an armoured king like figure, perched on a golden throne. He is wearing a golden mask. Upon his thrones are spikes, and upon the spikes, are the heads of his defeated enemies (hopefully there’s a way to not scar a child by making this child friendly). You jump over a banister and approach the king, who seems to be knighting his followers. Once he sees you his followers slink into the background and they whisper amongst themselves. “Do you wish to seek my blessing, beggar?” the text on the screen shows. A bottom prompt appears and when you press it your character whispers growls “no” and brings out a knife and stabs the king. The music stops as the king falls upon his knees. But then he gets up and removes the knife        from his chest and stands tall and imposing beside you. “You insult me.“ He says grabbing a sword taller than your character and slicing off your head. He grabs the head in midair and kicks your remaining body through the stained glass behind him. As your flying through the air the beginning credits kick in and the intro music plays as the landscape in the distant shifts and changes, giving insight into what is yet to come. Soon you fall through a thick layer of tree branches and lie on the floor, unmoving. Once you press any buttons, he/she stirs and gets up, feeling blindly through the air. You feel an acorn, place it upon your head, and your journey begins.\n\nAnother part is when you find a sword in an area similar to a Legend of Zelda game. What soon plays out is also similar to LoZ; the music builds as you slowly but surely remove your sword and... the sword snaps, and what was left attaching to the hilt slides out and crumbles, leaving you only the hilt, and a new mechanic.\n\nAnyway that’s the boneworks of it, and I’ve a few more ideas about where the story goes, but I have no idea how to make a game so I’ll leave this to anyone willing to make it. If you read this through thanks, and hopefully this won’t just disappear and go to nothing. Cheers! : )"
f517xh,Wii War : War Mini Games,"So Here's my Idea: And It wouldn't need to be on the Wii because that is a very old Console or the Wii U but perhaps a very cartoony style where you can Customize your character.

I think a nice fun soundtrack would be Nice."
f4zjsa,Dancing game for PC with xbox one kinect.,"I recently got a kinect to get full body tracking to play with VR. It works fine but then I got an idea when looking at the kinect tracking. I thought about a possible dancing game with the kinect. \n\nMy idea is to have a video of the choreography, not sure if this possible with the kinect, or even necessary as some other software like kinovea could do it, but to extract the skeleton movement from the video of the source choreography. Then have it so you can calibrate your body, height room to that source skeleton's, and when you dance, the game will compare how close or similar the geometry and movement of the skeleton is from the kinect is to the source skeleton. So, how well you do in the game will be determined by how well your body skeleton's movements matches up to the source video's skeleton. The closer you are, you get more point or more percentage similar like in singing karaoke games.\n\nI have no idea if this is possible but I've seen no dancing type for pc or vr really. Also there is a limitation with the kinect as it only have 180 degree capture of your body so you can't turn around."
f4wwrp,A clusterf*** racing game piled with so many racecars that they have to shove and climb over each other just to get by.,"Imagine *Clustertruck* but with even more vehicles cluttering the track, all of which are cars that can climb on top of each other. Each car has ludicrous ungodly traction to climb anything in its way, leading to *World War Z* levels of cars stacking on cars stacking on cars.\n\nYou have basically the same abilities as the AI racers: Your car will climb anything in front of it, ram into anything beside it and do a little hop. The only difference is you have a ""boost"" button you can occasionally use to power-up your climbing/ramming/hopping abilities. For example, you could use hold ""boost"" while you hop to do a mid-air jump in case you need to save yourself from falling off the world.\n\n####Oh, yes, you can fall off the racetrack.\n\nThe game features abstract, floating racetracks. There are usually walls/obstacles of varying height at either side to prevent cars from falling off, but they're too short to save any careless cars at the top of the stacks.\n\nThere is no way to get ""in front of the pack"" in a sense; there will always be racecars ahead of you... like they are just a part of the track. These are all bland ""filler"" cars, whereas your actual race competition are the brightly colored racecars that started the race beside you. They too have the special ""boost"" abilities."
f4wt5d,Physics based crafting system,"So I've had this idea in mind for a while, but as i don't know much about programming, I've never made it myself.\nAs the title says, a physics based crafting system. For example, you have a rock, a stick, some glue and rope, which you can assemble however you want (sortoff like the building mechanics in gamed like scrap mechanic), you'll be able to make a hammer by placing the things in the right spot.\nThe idea makes sense for a VR game, which will also make handling items easier.\n\nThe physics part comes in with certain items, such as a hammer or axe, where you hit something, it does some maths and stuff happens. Another example is if someone made a gun; you fire the gunpowder and it does some maths, making a small bullet go flying through the barrel, unless the barrel is too weak and explodes.\n\nShaping objects will also be possible with certail tools, and can thus be used to make new items.\n\nThis also makes it possible to create vehicles or other structures that aren't limited to the usual Lego style construction."

f4vq64,A rogue-like RTS where play as an evil attempting to conquer and consume all of existence,"Just a little game idea I had an was thinking of making. Not sure if it would work or not and just wanted some feedback.\n\nThe game is called Malice (work in progress). You play as a dark and consuming evil intent on conquering or consuming all of time and space. You know those ancient evils you see in movies and stuff? You’re that. An ancient, undying evil. With an army of occult monsters, twisted humans, and more to help on your mission. \n\nThe game is an RTS where you need to guide units to complete objectives around increasingly difficult stages split into different areas. There will be random generation. Some resources may farther, closer, different enemy types, etc. All of the maps have different themes and challenges. There’s Ancient Greece/Rome, Fedual Japan, Medieval Era, World War 1, World War 2, and more that I’m still thinking about. \n\nI’m thinking the rogue-like aspect will be based around what units and items are available when you’re reborn. You may be summoned by a group of cultists, come back with a horde of demons, or more. There will also be a variety of enemy types depending on what era you start in. Along with some cross-run progression. \n\nOf course, just an idea that I want to flesh out."
f4v2z5,A 2D game in the style of a cave painting.,"I don't really have much else besides that. Like, enemies, players and objects are painted on, and the terrain that you traverse is dictated by the texture of the walls. Could make for an interesting metroidvania or maybe a platformer. I don't think the art style would work in the top down perspective like Zelda. You could go around fighting prehistoric fauna with a spear (there aren't many games with spears as a main weapon), which could be used for pole vaulting and holding open doors or something. The whole game could have a torchlit aesthetic. Maybe you could get a bow and arrow as well, or maybe there could be a crafting system with tiers. For variety, different areas could have different stone types, with maybe backgrounds carved into the stone, or like dead trilobytes and stuff embedded. When you die your body could become a faded version of itself, to mark points of death, and with each successive death each one fades one more level, allowing maybe three at a time.or, it could fade over time and you only have a limited time to get back to it to get your xp and stuff. Maybe you could tame a wolf in the game as well."
f4sqww,Randomly Generated 3D Fantasy RPG,"I’ve imagined a game with Mount &amp; Blade: Warband-type graphics that’s set in a fantasy world with a randomly generated story. Plus randomly named characters with random appearances and backstories.\nYou can explore outside of the towns and villages in a procedurally generated world. The computer decides whether the world is mountainous or flat, forests or plains, deserts or snow, etc.\nThere would be dungeons o’plenty to find while you’re exploring. \nThe story and quests are different every time. You can save your game and start a new story, but also go back to the old one any time. Save files and whatnot.\nThe game would start with some text explaining the randomly generated plot. Maybe something like: \nThe kingdom of Gathea is under threat of attack by the evil Wizard Farkor Talstreaux, and his dragon minions.\nYou are a noble knight, hellbent on stopping Farkor at any cost. Your travels have brought you to an inn at the village of Melka, where a mysterious stranger has asked to meet...\nThen you’d see a button that says Start Game, and now you’re in the game. Each experience would be pretty unique. I can picture a subreddit where people share their stories and and experiences in the game. Or just meme the hell out of the wonky randomly generated stuff.\nWhat do you think?"
f4sgqg,[Request] PVP turn based 15 min long matches game (browser or android),"Hey, I am a new game dev and I am trying to test making an online game. Ideally it should run on browsers and be a pvp turn based game ( can have coop) with matches that take no longer than 15 mins. I don't like card games that much too.   \nit's going to be open source (github) and a learning project \n\nbonus points if it's easy to make."
f4rm4y,SoulLike Battle Royal!,"16 Player in one map, start almost naked on random spots, There are other NPC monsters and even Giant Demons and more summonsed in random spot in the map. \n\nKilled by a player or NPC doesn't matter, You can level up (Max 10) using souls from player you beat or lost souls from players who get killed by other NPC monsters."
f4q6o3,Shooting game with a twist,"A death match with dash, wall climb, jump mechanics. A person need to hit the other person hit box to kill them. Hit boxes can be customized: the location, color and the shape of them. Also more customization will be available in shops or after completing a set of quests. There will be randomly generated walls and jump pads or can be modified so that every time a player die, the environment changes slightly.\n\nOther modes can be similar to battle royale but a smaller map with no shrinking circle. Instead, a player health bar is decreasing gradually and to gain health u need to kill other players. The rate of health decrease will increase as there is less player in the map.  (To make it more interesting, a player can choose an weapon ability that will alter one of the chosen weapon ability and each time a player die other alive players gains the same ability: reload speed, movement speed, jump height, jump distance, magazine size, gunshot sound) \nBasically, I want it to be funny and unique experience for each gameplay."
f4op9e,Seeking ideas to improve top-down Stealth RPG game...,"So my game is about guiding hapless NPCs through procedurally generated desert landscapes, sneaking them past patrolling guards, hiding them in the bushes, and eventually helping them cross into a utopian city of the future. \n\nIf a guard catches one of your NPCs he arrests them and leads them off screen. If a guard catches you, you get in a fight an incapacitate the guard which lowers your HP and sets up a 2 minute timer until the guard wakes up. You then have to stash the body and exit the level before the body is found or guard wakes up. If you do this too many times your HP runs out and you fail. \n\nThe game is top down and has 2 action buttons. One button sets a marker waypoint for your NPCs to travel to. The other button uses your selected item. Items can be picked up and include the following:\n\n1. Rock - throw this to distract a guard, he will hear it and go investigate, allowing you to sneak by. \n\n2. Wire Cutters - Used to cut open fences\n\nSo the game is fun but feels a little flat. I'd like to add mechanics to liven it up a bit. More items could definitely do the trick, or maybe another ability like a dash? \n\nThis community was very helpful with my [first game] (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrier-commander-war-at-sea/id1447673490) so I thought I'd ask for some input for this. \n\nThanks in advance!"
f4np4d,Ghost Rider,"Hello all new to the sub so don’t bite my head off is something similar has been suggested. Now hear me out I’m sure a ton ideas start off as make it like this game make it like that game, but I honestly think ghost rider would go fantastic with a souls like combat. I know indie devs don’t  have the budget for a ghost rider license. But this is just me being a nerdy fan of both ghost and souls. Now I’m not a huge comic book reader I’m move of a movie and fan of comics as well as tv shows and such so I’m not gonna act like I know the character like the back of my hand. But I did enjoy both movies and all the time she’s shown up in video games. The god of war ghost rider clone was alright for what it was. But I do think souls combat could suit ghost rider well."
f4nnxj,A nerf blaster fps,"It's as simple as it sounds , an online or single player fps possibly using real world blasters from the nerf community, like captain slug's caliburn, outofdarts' Jupiter, Mr.heathpants' dessert pigeon, or FDL series, I eel like the original creators would be fine with this if you asked.\n\nGameplay/mechanics\nI feel like there would be 2 game types, a more realistic gameplay type, kinda like call of duty or battlefield, but made to look like real nerf battle footage, and a ""classic"" mode that plays more like nerf arena blast, more 90'sy if that makes since, faster paced and more platforming, not realistic at all. The game would also focus around modifying blasters to make them more powerful, accurate, etc. For example, you play matches, get some form of currency, and can either buy springs, motors, scar barrels, etc to upgrade the blasters and have them done quicker, but lack in quality, commission someone to modify or build a blaster for you that takes longer but has less chance of breaking on the battlefield, or buy filament to 3d print a new blaster to use and wait some time for it to 3d print. Joining class/squads/teams/whatever could also be there too for perks like cheaper commissions or faster print times with youtubers leading them, like captain Xavier leading the auxiliary and walcoms7 leading fuzzy walrus industries, and having them voice some lines for the game world not be too hard I would assume. Some different gamemodes would be available to play, also. Some examples would be TDM, DM, CTF, CP, ETC. And both game types(regular and classic) would be able to play all of these. Also a small thing to note would be dart drop due to no being guns.\n\nSorry if I got too wordy, I just love nerf and want a successor to nerf arena blast, but anyhow all I request I you make this is a spoon the credits and a free copy if it's paid"
f4n3ak,A gardening sim,"Story\nI feel like the story would start off with you needing a summer job to pay for something you really want but you end up making a lot of money so you keep going,nothing too complex.\n\nGameplay/mechanics\nA first person game where you do various types of yard work, from raking the leaves, to planting a garden, to laying grass for a construction company or something. Ideally this would be done more hands on than hold this button and wait, but anything works. Having status bars would also be interesting, like a stamina so you can't now the entire front lawn of a mansion in 5 minutes, a hydration bar for the same reason, a fatigue bar, etc. This could go on, and refilling these bars would requite things like water and food that you could find in an in-game store and buy with money you earn in the game, you could buy upgrades like bigger water bottles or healthier energy bars, or even things like better tools, clothes, etc to increase the time it takes to lower this bar. \n\nOne last gameplay thing think would be fun but not required at all would be a gta-like free roam world to explore if you leave the lawn where you could steal cars and ""kill"" people in the vein of Simpson's hit and run, e map wouldn't be super large, no bigger than like a medium sized gmod map.\n\nAnother mechanic not required but would be even cooler is this game in vr, that's all\n\nIf you do make is all I request is a spot in the credits and a free copy if it's paid"
f4mxat,A Survival Game. But not another DayZ/Rust clone,"For a long time now, I've been really wanting a specific type of survival game. I'm bored, and tired of all the silly ""DayZ"" type of games that offer nothing but ""Loot/Die/Repeat"" gameplay while filled with ""Cliche Unskilled Badguys"" or ""Ranger Seal EOD SpecOp cliche goodguy"" players who are essentially useless.   \n\n\nIf I was a developer, with a team, and a LOT of money like EA style. I'd make....  \n\n\nSetting: A Game that takes place on a colony ship in deep space with failing systems. An emergency crew is waking up in order to start getting repairs underway, however, there is a short with the Stasis pods and many people begin to wake up. Resources are low, many sections have faulty life support, Agricultural Wing is all lights out, which means oxygen is also in the red. The player must work together to keep the ship and crew going until they reach their destination planets. If, somehow they survive, they can then begin colonizing a harsh new world with the surviving crew. But once the game starts, there are only 20 minutes to get the air flowing again.  \n\n\nGameplay: Everything is complex. You can't just ""Click"" something to fix it. You need the parts, tools, and skills to fix it. Everything from crafting and repairing to medical diagnosis and surgical application requires skillsets. Every person (Player and NPC) has a role to fill.  Sure, it borderlines into the Simulator Game territory of course, but that's the point.  Complexity, learning your role, and getting good at it.   \n\n\nPlayer Characters: COOP/Online made characters are permanent in your personal ""Character Pool"", allowing you to wake up on other ships ahead of the game. Be warned, however, cause if your character dies it's permanent on THAT server. If you wanna use that same one, you'll need to find another server with a more competent crew who aren't fuckups.  \n\n\nClasses: Engineer, Medic, Security, Scientist,  and Captain.  \n\n\n Each class has a branch of various skills in them acting as disciplines. You cannot max out everything, just like IRL.  Example below  \n\n\nEngineer &gt; Mainline Skills you HAVE to unlock and do so automatically.  \n1: Basic Maintenence and Repair. You start here as an engineer. Allows you to access various things and you're given an Engineering Crew ID card/Security DEC.  \n2: Mechanical Engineering- Allows crafting of parts and tools needed for complex mechanical systems.   \n3: Electrical Engineering- Allows crafting of parts and tools needed for complex electrical systems.  \n\---&gt; 4: Rank Up The following skills are ""Sub-Paths"".  \n4a:  SP- Agricultural Technologies: Allows you to craft parts needed for Farmers/Botanists/BioMedics  \n4b: SP- Vehicular Mechanic: Allows you to strip vehicles and craft/repair parts to get them working again.  \n4c: SP- Weapons Designer: Allows you to craft and repair weapons both personal and turret systems.  \n4d: SP- Civil Engineer: Allow you to craft plumbing parts, building parts, recyclers, and operate Fabricators/Workshop devices.  \n4e: SP- Aviation Engineer: Like Vehicular but for hovercraft and flight transports.  \n4f: SP- Weaponsmith: Allows you to research, craft, and scrap weapons. Low = A stick. High = Rail Cannon.  \n4g: Systems Engineer: AKA a Universal engineer. These are the ""Jack of All Trades"" who specialize in the  craftmanship and repairs for all other branches. However, they are limited in the way that what they craft is never 100% Condition, and is more prone to breaking. (Best for Singleplayer with an NPC crew)  \n\---&gt; 5: Profit. You can MAX out only 1 Path + Half of all the others. It doesn't sound bad but it would lock you out of the high-tech stuff in all other branches. This will be needed in the long term on more advanced systems unless you're a Universal Engineer, in which you ""Can"" do everything, but with a massive debuff in item and repair quality.\n\nAll the other classes of course would have their own skillsets to suit their needs.    \n\n\nIn essense the game is mean't to be played with a competent group of people for long term survival. Not some silly Looter Shooter where you die and respawn. In this, you die, that character is wiped for that game.    \n\n\nOffline/SinglePlayer Play: You start with your own custom character of any class you want. If you die in SP you will be given a choice to either begin from the start OR choose a colonist to control.  \n\n\nNPCs: NPCs have a moral and needs status. The better it is the better they will do at their jobs and the more skills they will learn. The worse it is the worse they will work and some may even become hostile and freak out. Many will speak to you, others will have side jobs for you based on your class. You can develop teams as a Security Operator, or as the Captain.   If an NPC if the Captain it'll be a good idea to do as you're told. If you play as the Captain you will delegate orders, crafting submits, and so on.   \n\n\nIn short. A meaningful survival experience. Not some cliche loneliness simulator. No... No romance options. Unless it was done right with the right writing staff and decent actors.   \n\n\nI could keep going. But if anyone was actually reading this, thank you. If you're a game developer and wanna give this a shot I don't want money, I just wanna play a game like this. If this is Electronic Arts reading this. No, I don't want monetization and I don't care if BioWare is put on the list, not allowed..."
f4mwx1,Metal gear but its 3am and your trying to get eat cheese from the fridge,"The cheese at 3am was just an example, but t gist of the game is that it's a stealth/action game, perspective does not matter, where the stages are tour house where you try to do something, some examples that come to mids are the cheese, trying to avoid you little cousins when your family comes over, trying to retrieve something from your parents bedroom, stuff like that, stuff you would do IRL sometimes.\n\nSome gameplay elements I image would be present is a breath of the wild like sound meter, pets, people, and items u an interact with to distract something with, some items you can use like nerf gun or something you use to distract or attack, a rubber ball to distract with, that kind of stuff. A bartering system for pick entities to help distract  would also be cool, like give a cat some catnip to knock something over, or e aforementioned nerf gun to a hunger sibling to make distractions better.\n\nHopefully I wasn't too wordy, I tend to do that and if you end up making this a reality all I request is a spot in the credits and a free copy if its paid"

You play as a dark and consuming evil intent on conquering or consuming all of time and space. You know those ancient evils you see in movies and stuff? You’re that. An ancient, undying evil.

There’s Ancient Greece/Rome, Fedual Japan, Medieval Era, World War 1, World War 2, and more that I’m still thinking about. \n\nI’m thinking the rogue-like aspect will be based around what units and items are available when you’re reborn.

f4m2sf,"A puzzle platformer that's always split into two screens, and combines 3d elements with 2d elements","Similarly to my last idea, the game here is also a bit more on the dark side. \n\nThe game would be called ""As Close As Apart"" and follows our two main protagonists, Brother and Sister. The screen is always split in 2, either scene containing Brother or Sister. \n\nThe game will have puzzle elements that will require you to utilize the 2 screens, and will require interaction with certain characters to ask for directions. \n\nThe character interaction parts will be the most anxiety inducing, because saying the wrong thing will lead to an instant game over, and in this game, dying once means you gotta play the entire chapter all over again. \n\nThere will be platforming action similar to that of Super Meat Boy, however this game will have a grab feature as well. \n\nIt'll be stressful, because I want the game to make the player think ""should I take this item with me? It'll slow me down when I need to make long jumps, but I'll need it incase something jumps out at me."" There is no wrong choice, no matter what you choose, you'll still need to be on your toes. \n\nThere'll be a good ending, a bad ending, and a reunion ending. Getting the good or bad ending is simple, just make a certain choice near the end of a game, but to unlock the reunion ending, you'll need to beat the game without any checkpoints, and don't get spotted by the police AT ALL. \n\nPlease let me know what you think!"

f4iffk,An RPG Game Where Every Choice Matters.,"An RPG game where the world is manifested from the thoughts of the protagonist in which every choice, no matter how significant has noticeable consequence. This not only effects the progression of the story, but also how well you and your party members work together in battle. For example, choosing not to complete an area in the game may cause some of your companions to desert you, while others may support your decision, giving you more options and combat as well as unique side quest opportunities."
f4hl9c,a idea for a somewhat meta metroidvania platformer.," the setting for this game is a city with a class system based around  platforming, the slum dwelling lower class can't jump or have little  jump height, the middle class have average jump height but have nothing  special to them, and the elite upper class have things like wall jumps  and double jumps. you play as a lower class boy who cant jump, when  exploring the slums you find a pair of boots, you put them on and find  yourself able to jump, you just collected an upgrade, an ability that  only a legendary lord was able to do, the games story has you rise to  power collecting upgrades and eventually become the king of this  platforming based city, as you have collected enough upgrades to become  the most powerful platformer in the city."
f4flrz,Tooth and Claw: A post apocalyptic fighting RPG,"This is inspired by a George Orwell classic: Animal Farm. Loved the book.\n\nAnyways the game is set in a post apocalyptic world where humans have disappeared and left civilization behind, while animals evolved and began to inhabit the cities left behind.\n\nAnimals are mostly divided into two groups: Dwellers and Outliers.\nDwellers choose to inhabit the lost civilization and also take up farming and crafting. They believe in evolving with technology \nOutliers believe in sticking to the old ways, hunting free and wild. Outliers mostly avoid ""human"" acts like walking on two legs.\n\nGameplay\nThe player can choose which animal to play as (like species in RPGS), each having unique evolutionary traits.\nThey are part of a group of outcasts from the Dweller community and must survive by beading together and fighting off predators from both sides.\nExploration is done in LAYERS. Meaning that each level is made up of two layers of maps: Open areas and Labyrinthine paths. For example a city has open paths but underground is a maze of tunnels and corridors.\n\nCombat is a melee focused mix of souls-like third person action mixed with the punchy and methodical combat of Absolver.\n\nThe main aim of the game is building your own  family of outcasts and trying to survive in a (literal) dog-eat-dog world"

There be timer, and u lose a health u go overtime. If u have made a wrong choice after u have gone through the door to another stage, u will be in the same room again with a health point subtracted. Like all rogue game, there could be upgrades: to slowdown time, to stop a character from running, increase movement, spot a mistake and etc. I planned it to be 10 stages that increased in difficulty as u go. In the final stage, python tile puzzle will be a pic of number 5 character and it will need will u finding another number 5, happily making number 10."

If you seek, it just acts like a normal hide and seek game but when you find like, 7-8 people it starts turning night and small spooks pop out like rustling leaves and creaking boards but slowly turns into some paranormal activity. If you chose to hide, you have to hide or avoid the seeker until 7-8 people are found and it turns night and with seeker, small spooks and paranormal stuff. You can also chose the ai difficulty to make it seem more like a normal hide and seek game in the beginning."
f42yld,Tile-based Racing Card Game,"Gameplay:\n\n**Cards**:\n\nThere would be 2 different decks. One exclusive for each player and another designated for events.\n\nThe event deck would be composed of cards that can either be advantageous and disadvantegous for the player that draws them. Part of this deck would be supplied and hand picked by participating players and another part would be cards linked to the chosen race track.\n\nThe player's deck would be composed of cards based in their chosen vehicle and its customization.\n\n**Vehicle**:\n\nPlayers can choose and customize their vehicle. Every vehicle will have a default set of cards to be included in the player's deck. \n\nCustomization is usually paired with card(s) that shall be added in the deck as well.\n\nA vehicle shall also have a set of attributes namely:\n*Speed Rate - determines the normal tile movement of the vehicle\n*Fuel Capacity - determines the number of fuel point at the start of the match\n*Durability - determines the amount of damage the vehicle can withstand\n\n**Racetrack**:\n\nThe racetrack will be composed of tiles which may also be separated by lanes.\n\nThe tiles doesn't necessarily need to be rectangular especially for curves.\n\nThe racetrack may also have pits, obstacles and shortcuts.\n\n**Race Starts**\n\nAt the start of the game, players will have to draw four cards from their respective decks.\n\nTurn order will then be determined. The vehicle with the highest *speed rate* will be be the first and the lowest will be the last.\n\nThe first player cannot use a card in their initial turn. This rule can only be applied for matches with 2 to 3 players. In case of 4 players, the 1st and 2nd players cannot use cards in their initial turn.\n\nIn this phase, players can also use up to two cards from their hand to control their turn order as well as temporarily increase their speed rate.\n\n**Movement**\nEach turn, all vehicles would be moving through tiles depending in their vehicle's *speed rate*. example: *car A has a speed rate of 3 tiles per turn therefore in its turn it shall move 3 tiles from its previous location.*\n\nVehicles cannot move to tiles occupied by another vehicle.\n\nIt is possible to swerve to the left or right lanes/tiles and shall count the same as moving forward, however, if the player does this more than once in a single turn (without the effect of a card), he/she will be prompted to draw a card from the event deck.\n\n**Card Usage**\n\nAfter moving to a new tile, the player would have to draw a card from their respective deck.\n\nSome tiles in the race track may prompt the player to draw a card from the event deck if their vehicle moves on that designated tile. If the player is prompted to draw a card from the event deck before being able to draw from their respective deck, the player will not be able to draw on their respective deck on that turn.\n\nWhatever card drawn from the event deck shall automatically take effect.\n\nA player can only have up to 6 cards in their hand (unless altered by card effect). The next card drawn from their deck upon exceeding this number shall be automatically discarded, however, doing so shall enable their vehicle to move 1 more tile in that turn.\n\nA player can also use a card from their hand on their turn before or after moving to a new tile at the expense of tile movement count determined by the vehicle's *speed rate*. example: *car A has a speed rate of 3 tiles per turn, the player moves 2 tiles forward and spends the remaining 1 tile movement to use a card.*\n\nIf a player runs out of cards from their hand and their deck, they can still continue the race. If the event deck runs out of cards, reshuffle it back.\n\n**Fuel and Durability**\n\nPlayers will spend 1 fuel point on the end of their turn if he/she moves to a new tile on that turn.\n\nIf the vehicle moves above its *normal speed rate* by means of card effect, the player will spend 2 fuel points.\n\nExtra tile movement caused by discarding a card because of exceeding the maximum cards at hand will not consume a fuel point.\n\nObviously, vehicles with no fuel left to spend cannot execute movement and automatically looses the race.\n\nVehicles may also gain damage throughout a race. This can be caused by obstacles present in some of the tiles, cards drawn from the event deck and inflicted by other players.\n\nThe vehicle's ability to withstand damage is determined by *durability*, a vehicle with no more durability left cannot continue the race and automatically looses.\n\n**Pit Stops**\n\nThe racetrack may have designated pits. When a vehicle passes over a tile aligned to the pit, the player can chose to spend some of their tile movement count to reshuffle the cards in their hand, to replenish fuel, or to repair lost durability.\n\nStopping in the pit also enables the player to remove, replace and/or use equipment cards from their hand without the expense of tile movement.\n\n**Conditions**\n\nThe first vehicle to cross the finish line wins the game.\n\n\n(the above rules is not final as I have not tried simulating it)\n\nLong post.

f42amm,Text based game similar to Sorcery,"Not sure if this would be the place to post this, but I want to make a text based game that has pictures to go along and basically make an interactive book with a roll of the dice attack system, a set of skills that can increase based on user choice and can effect gameplay, upgrades that can be made that can effect where you can go, tech that can be used in certain areas similar to Sorcery.\n\nMy idea is based in space and follows a lonely space traveler traversing an unknown (to the character) solar system due to a work hole. The point is to travel throughout the solar system stoping at different planets and outposts trying to find a way back home. Throughout this journey there are several side storylines that all play into the big picture, but some parts and stories are at will to the play. Example being side quests that can add to the lore and possibly add advantages to gameplay, but don’t stop you from completing the game. \n\nI know it sounds like I’m asking for a lot. I actually have a lot of the story written out, but I’m completely new to game making. With everything I’ve stated what would be my best option to getting this actually made? This is a passion project so there is no timeline. I honestly just love video games and storytelling and want to make a game I would want to play. \n\nI guess to sum it up and simplify, since I’m a beginner, what is the best way to get started on making a game like this?"
f41kl3,A multiplayer game based on trying to herd sheep.,"One person is selected as a shepard, with dogs to help herd together the other players, who are sheep. You need to prevent the sheep from killing themselves as the shepherd, there are about 19 other sheep. Dangers such as cliffs, rusty pipes, and a wolf are present."
f3zphf,Rhythm Fighting Game,"I just randomly thought of this a few minutes ago so it isn't the most fleshed out, but a rhythm fighting game would be awesome! I'm thinking like a typical 2D fighter, two fighters, one on each side. Each of the 2 players would be playing the same song, (I'll use dance dance revolution style mechanics to explain this further) and each player will have their respective time to either attack or defend. I think turns would work by notes almost? Player 1 would have 20 notes to attack with, attacking with more damage with higher accuracy of notes, or flat out missing if a note is missed. Player 2 would still be playing the rhythm game, but blocking instead of notes are hit perfectly, taking a bit of chip damage if accuracy is off, and taking full damage if the note is missed. There is obviously a lot to add on but this rough idea was super cool to me."
f3zjiz,a idea for a somewhat meta metroidvania platformer,"the setting for this game is a city with a class system based around platforming, the slum dwelling lower class can't jump or have little jump height, the middle class have average jump height but have nothing special to them, and the elite upper class have things like wall jumps and double jumps. you play as a lower class boy who cant jump, when exploring the slums you find a pair of boots, you put them on and find yourself able to jump, you just collected an upgrade, an ability that only a legendary lord was able to do, the games story has you rise to power collecting upgrades and eventually become the king of this platforming based city, as you have collected enough upgrades to become the most powerful platformer in the city."

f3wuqd,Asymmetrical Multiplayer Horror VR Game,"I proposed this idea a while back to a few vr subreddits, but after playing TWD saints and sinners I think you could actually make a really decent game out of this.\n\nSo there's killers armed with unique weapons and powers. I think maybe a passive ability, toggle ability, and their unique weapon would be enough to have decent and diverse kits. Maybe 3 or so at launch.\n\nSurvivors would spawn in weaponless and with very limited options for survival. I think giving them a passive and toggle ability would also lead to some interesting mechanics and plays. They would need to collect items to protect themselves and escape. The killers can be harmed and stunned but they are incapable of being killed, while survivors go down pretty easily. Survivors would have backpacks where they can store bandages, small weapons, and key items.\n\nSo I had a decent idea that would make survivors have multiple lives without it being too obnoxious. Each time a player dies they leave a little ghost which can see the area around them. they can move around a little radius from the body. If the killer is within the radius or in sight of the player ghost their location is revealed to all other survivors. A friendly player would have to go to the body and revive the dead player. The player would come back but would be more decomposed and deadlike. This can only be done twice before the player dies permanently.\n\nI'm thinking that the each map would have multiple ways to escape and leave. There would be basic stuff like powering and driving a car. Getting electricity back to a region to power a gate. Collecting artifacts to power an escape portal. Stuff like that.\n\nThe biggest draw is that Killers will need to be pretty decent at finding the survivors and landing a killing blow. While survivors need to be stealthy or skilled enough to incapacitate the killer without dying. The best killers would go from survivor to survivor slaughtering them and catching them off guard. The worst killers will kill a survivor and camp the body while the others do everything to escape and win for all of them. The best survivors will combine stealth and aggression to bamboozle the killer and make their escape.\n\nHonestly, after typing this all out this kinda sounds like a smash hit VR title for horror fans if I had the technically skills to make it I would.\n\nAnyone else have any good ideas for a game like this? If any devs wanna take this idea and run with it go ahead. If you do that though bring me along I would love to help out."

f3pov8,The Anti-Civilization Game,"So I was inspired by a post about no player avatar in the world which led me to think abotu traditional civ-style games. \n\nSo here's a ""twist"" on that. \n\nYou are a young planet, you are enjoying all the peace and the life that you are teaming with. But there is one set of beasts in particular who concern you. They are very creative creatures and you sometimes watch them for centuries just to see what they will create next. But they are starting to spread out of their territory you had designed for them to have and threaten to cover your entire surface. \n\nWhat's worse, they are beginning to kill off your fauna and flora faster than you can replace it and it is beocoming infuriating. \n\nSo, in this game, you are Mother Nature, Nature's Wrath, what have you, and you are trying to keep the ""humans"" on the world from expanding too far but because you aren't evil you are also not trying to kill them off just ""keep them in check"". \n\nAs you advance in the game you can develop things like ""Apex Predators"" ""Plagues"" and similar ""advancements"" that allow you to wipe out settlements of the humans and keep their numbers down. But they are sneaky and will have ""secret settlements"" that are hard to find, etc until they begin to develop bows and arrows and other technology that start to defeat your own advancements. \n\nBasically you race against the ""Civilization"" in order to keep it from getting out of control. \n\nIn a two player mode, one of you might be the traditional civ style player and the other be the Nature's Wrath player. \n\nThat's about as far as I've gotten with this. Thanks for reading :)"

f3molh,"Mount and Blade but with Mechas, set in space.","# Setting:\n\nCenturies from now, humanity united under the United Nations Of Mankind have colonized hundreds of star systems.However, due to rising anti UN sentiments and violent secessionist  movements across the human space, UNOM broke up.Now, humanity is ruled by 3  waring powerful factions:\n\n***Federation***: A democratic,capitalist faction, originally a remnant of the former UNOM. Their mechs and ships are more defense oriented and their ships can handle more cargo than other faction's ships.They are known to make the best armor and force fields.Their capital world is Earth, Sol system.\n\n***Imperium****:* A fascist, xenophobic faction, supposedly founded by the infamous 13th UN Fleet during the rebellion after they found out how the people of the outer colonies were mistreated by the UNOM. Their mechs and ships are more attack oriented (which means more weapon slots) and cheaper to buy  and repair but with less quality hull and more chances of breaking down.They also make extremely cheap and easy to make but low quality weapons and ammo. Due to these factors, most pirates and outlaws prefer to use Imperial technology. Their capital world is Zeus, Olympus system.\n\n***Order****:* A very religious faction that originated from a cult that used to operate in the outer colonies.Their mechs and ships are very speed oriented, which means they have to sacrifice their storage capacity and hull quality for speed.Their mechs also has the unique ability to self destruct in a fiery explosion, powerful enough to take out most of the unfortunate  nearby mechs in the battlefield.Their capital world is New Gilead, Canaan system.\n\nThe player can choose which faction did the player character(PC) originated from and this would not only affect their standing with the PC but also the PC's skills and perks.As you progress through the game, the PC can join any one of the factions and later PC may even become the leader of a faction.\n\n***Minor Factions***: Most of the minor factions are randomly generated and while some of them may give the PC missions, the PC cannot join them. However, the PC can make their own minor faction (which may even become a real major faction if the PC have enough resources).Minor Factions example: Random Trading Company/Pirate Clan/Mercenary Warband,etc.\n\n# Gameplay:\n\nThe player character (PC) initially start with a mothership (which serves as your means of mech storage and interstellar transportaion) a single mech and some cash (what type of mothership/mech and the amount of cash depends on the player's choices during character creation).Then the player can make money through interplanetary trading, mercenary work (bounty hunting and escorting service) , fighting in the local planetary arena or gambling.As you gain more money, you affort to updgrade your assets, buy more mechs,hire more people to pilot those mechs,  buy interplanetary real estate, etc.As the player character is doing these things, factions are constantly fighting and making alliances, randomly events like natural disaster ,economic crisis, brutal pirate raids  or even space monster attacks are happening."
f3i8y0,What makes a RTS game like age of empires stand up?,"I'm making se research about RTS games like age of empires, close combat: the bloody first etc..\nObviously the strategy side is important since you have to gather for resources and evolve your city/community/base efficiently to be able to defeat your opponents.\nBut I'm more interested in what makes the games stand up in front of the others. Here are some points that I think are worth to mention :\n\n- A few (or a lot?) ressources that you need to collect to grow your community and build new things/units.\n- a great enemy AI that is challenging the player\n- a good control over the units to give the player the control over it and the ability to apply his strategy at will\n- a large variety of buildings and units (though I can only think of around 10 type)\n- a captivating campaign story and missions.

f3ea51,A melee based platformer with level selection &amp; choice based consequences,"The game idea is similar to old school Castlevania in mechanics, with MegaMan like power-ups after bosses. The twists are multiple choice powerups after defeating a boss, which alters gameplay and ending. \n\nYou would be a random villager in a town that was besieged by an evil wizard. This wizard raised some of the worst monsters in history to destroy the town because of a holy relic in the church. Everyone in the town votes, and you have been chosen as the hero.\n\nBosses are your typical monster fare; werewolf, swamp thing, vampire, gargoyle, and etc.\n\nThe twist is that when you defeat a boss you have a three-prong choice to make; Power, Nothing, or trinket. For example, Werewolf boss. If you select power, you force werewolf to bite you after defeating it becoming a werewolf yourself giving you more strength/health at night &amp; control of wolves by day. Select trinket, you cut off the werewolf ear and wear it as a pendant, wolves are now scared of you and don’t spawn on additional levels. Do nothing, well you just burn the wolf and end the threat.\n\nThese choices change how the town sees you. Power - Maybe the blacksmith doesn’t upgrade your sword anymore as the werewolf killed his daughter. Trinket - blacksmith gives you a discount, but church doesn’t let you meditate at night as the ear represents the evil of the moon. Nothing - people love you more.\n\nIn the end when you free the town, if you’ve chosen Power too often, they shun and expel you, or you become the next evil wizard. If you choose too many trinkets you become power hungry and rule with an iron fist.\n\nBonus - The town voting could be a class choice. Choose black smith - more health and a hammer, the tailor - fast and nimble daggers!\n\n\nThis has always been a dream of mine to create, but I know my art/programming skills are not up to par."
f3dqdj,Idea: Ball Roll Game - Control the Stage Map by Tilting Phone,"Roll a ball through maze-like stages by tilting the phone to tilt the stage map. Can feature traps like pitfalls or sharp walls that destroy the ball if it collides with them. Obstacles (e.g. wooden fence) can be destroyed if the ball picks up a certain ""power"" (e.g. rolls through flames to catch fire which burns wooden obstacles). Points are scored based on time taken to complete a stage by getting the ball from point A (stage entrance) to B (stage exit). Each stage takes up the full screen, so that it's visible in its entirety from above. The graphics can be simple (I thought of Quell aesthetics)."

f38gaz,Refining Game Idea,"The basic idea about the game is, that you have a secret double life. During the day you are working in an italian restaurant. However during the night you are a vampire and need to seek out a victim.\n\nBasics:\nEach game state(day/night) lasts for 10 minutes. Your goal is to survive as long as you can. If you don’t get to your victim for more than 3 nights you will die, and the game will be over. If you can’t manage your restaurant and go bankrupt, the game is also over.\n\nThe catch:\nAs you start to kill victims in the night you also start to raise suspicion. During the day you can also work to lower your suspicion or work on your restaurant. You need to decide how to split up your time.\n\nMore Suspicion means more guards walking around town during the night and day. Also maybe some contractors may decline your services causing maybe a shortage of money, or a shortage of ingredients etc.\n\n\nIdeas that I might change:\n\n1. I thought about your “night time job” beeing a werewolf instead of vampire. However I don’t know how it would work out because you need a fullmoon.\n\n2. I thought to change your day time job, but again I am not sure what could fit, and what you should be able to do there.\n\n\nNow I know this game idea sounds like a 3 - man  5 year project, however I am just one man.\nTherfore I need your advice on how I should simplify this game without conpletly destroying the premise of it.\n\nThe game will be in 2d, and I am planning to use either Godot or Unity, as I have experience in both of them. I have very good programming and shader knowledge and also have experience in working on projects. I have created things like Pong and Tetris and simple top down shooters in the past. I also worked on chess engines and connect four bots. This is just so you know that I am experienced enough to complete such a project.\n\nOne last thing:\nWhat do you think should be in the minimum viable product, or a prototype so to say, for this game? I need to actually test out the mechanics.\n\nPlease tell me what you think, and thank you for all your help and suggestions!\n\nCheers!"
f36xvy,Just an idea i had,"I been seeing a lot of space exploration games and destroying the environment kinda games lately. what if we had a game that did the opposite. I was thinking you start on a empty planet or space as a first person adventurer. you have the ability to to create your own ecosystem, plants and animals, kinda the same way you do in Spore, and there is no limit on how much you can create. but first you have to mine craft and create a livable place.

f31ktm,Spirits: A Platformer Story,"(Insert Cute Character Name Here) has always been a strange kid. His therapist tells him that the meds he takes will help him to stop seeing the ""spirit world"" but his grandmother shares a secret with him that she also saw the spirit world and that it is a gift that just happens to their family every now and then. She tells him too that there is a reason he is seeing the spirit and their world, because there is a great evil threatening the spirit world and if the spirit world is destroyed then people in the physical world will become lifeless and soulless creatures. \n\nNaturally, grandmother shows our hero the door into the spirit world and the story/adventure begins. \n\nThe mechanics for this game would be that the kid in the spirit world can collect ""spirit companions"" which can look like basically anything from a fox to a dragon. Each spirit creature has its own, unique ability that is not only helpful in getting about the spirit world but is necessary to figure out how to traverse different areas. \n\nAs an example, there may be a tunnel system that the kid can't fit into but can let out the fox spirit (which you control) who can fit through the narrow areas and activate whatever is needed to further progress. \n\nSome spirits may simply make good weapons like a basilisk spirit whose eye beams turn enemies to stone for a bit or a frost spirit who freezes fire enemies that can otherwise not be harmed or defeated. But others might actually be required to traverse the areas such as a large turtle spirit who floats on the spirit waters allowing the character to jump on its back to get through an area of water, etc. \n\nThis was just an idea that came to me today and I wanted to write it out to see what folks thought. My head seems to be a revolving door of ideas lately..."
f30tgr,A rhythm RPG about a group of kids trying to stop a hidden cult within their Neighborhood,"I'm currently working on a game that I call ""Savage Youth"" or ""Fever Youth"" (still deciding on a title) and I don't know whether my idea is good or not. \n\nIn the game, you take control of a girl named Claire, who finds her teacher bludgeoned to death by a large group of people wearing strange masks.  \n\nI'll elaborate more on the Daytime Mechanic. During the day, you can choose to either skip school, or go to school. Skipping school allows you to go places in order to upgrade attacks. However, you don't get free time the next day because you're given detention, thus forcing you to fight enemies at night without any bonuses, making it much harder. Going to school grants stats up, such as speed, attack, or defense. During lunchtime, you can store snacks without having to buy any after school. \n\nAfter school, you are given 2 ""free times"". Think of free times as tickets of sorts. Hanging out with a character costs one free time and grant you a bonus that is related to that characters personality. The maximum limit to hang out with a certain character is 3. These events are meant to be more of a refresher from the action and violence and reward the player for completing them rather than just going home and skipping free time.\n\nHappy or Gentle characters - Higher Speed\nSad or Lonely Characters - Higher Defense\nAngry or Rude Characters - Higher Attack\n\nThese bonuses only last one night, so you'll have to choose carefully. \n\n\nDuring Night time, you can move around and such similarly to Day time, however there are new mechanics. Observe mode is one of these mechanics. Activating Observe mode will prompt a cursor to pop up on screen, and you'll need to use this cursor to click on clues or objects that may lead you to where the cult members may be hiding next.\n\nJust like any other RPG, there are battles. During a battle, you'll need to charge up an attack by tapping to the beat of the music. The more of a combo you pull, the higher the damage will be. Some enemies will cause the beat to disappear entirely, or speed and slow down the music at random intervals, etc. Basically enemy attacks mess with the music to throw the player off. \n\nThe game will follow a heavy narrative, be a bit more on the violent side, and won't be suitable for all since the game will feature kids killing other kids. The game won't have a leveling up system like most RPG's, leaving the player to up their stats on their own. Lastly, the game will be completely free.\n\n Please let me know what you think since I'm putting as much as I can into this game!"

eo113p,What would you like to see in your ideal survival game?,"I'm thinking of making a single player survival game where you preferably start with nothing and progress by collecting materials, building a fort, fighting off enemies, fighting bosses, etc. I don't have many ideas for this game a tall by this point, but I'm pretty experienced at game design and coding so I figure with a little help from this community we could really have something going! (It's going to be a 2D game, but I don't care if it's side-view or top-down)\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n* Where would you start? Would you start with nothing, with a little something to get you going (Like some food and a fort?), or would you start with a lot (like a business) and have to build up from there?\n* What would the end goal be? To live as long as possible and get a high score? To kill the final boss? To find your way back home? It could really be anything.\n* How would you progress? Should their be a boss for each ""step"" of the game? How long should the game be? How big should the goals be and how much time/effort should separate them?\n* What art style should I aim for?

""Jet Propulsion I"" lets it swim a bit higher off the ground, ""Crypto Camouflage I"" lets it stay hidden for a limited time, ""Sucker I"" lets it stick to ceilings and vertical surfaces to mount ambushes on unsuspecting prey, ""Hammer Fist"" turns a tentacle into a striking weapon, ""Compress"" lets it squeeze in small spaces in the map to avoid predators, ""Ink Cloud"" lets you evade predators using ink, ""Sacrifice"" lets you lose an arm to save yourself (decreases mobility), ""Bioluminescence"" confuses prey/predators, ""Aposematic Camo"" passively deters predators from eating you (also poisons predators when they attack you), etc.)\n\nAll these abilities can be learned, but it would behoove players to focus on a specific gameplay style they have in their minds.\n\nBesides other sea life, the ocean floor will be littered with manmade items that could be looted (ex. lobster traps) or used as tools (ex. heavy gold bricks that may be used to crush shelled prey).\n\nThings the player should avoid include environment hazards (ex. thermal vents), ocean carnivores (ex. sharks and whales), and researchers/fisherman.\n\nAs of right now, I'm not sure if a sandbox approach or a traditional ""clear each level"" progression would be best for the game.\n\nOctopi are such intelligent and multi-talented creatures that I think they would play well as a protagonist."

Can you guys help me make it more interesting and unique?\n\n\nThe player is stuck in a temple of some sort. The goal is to get out of the temple. To do this, the player must solve multiple puzzles that eventually lead to the exit. Most puzzles require additional information found in various places throughout the temple. These pieces of information can be obtained in the form of manuscripts, ancient relics, dialogue with NPCs, etc. The player can also find weapons such as swords, bows, or even spell books that they will need to use to fight off dangerous enemies that will attempt to prevent them from achieving their goal."

ene0td,MMO Strategy - Princes of Gardariki,"This is a very raw idea, so many things are not polished or even thought of.\n\n[b]Main Idea[/b]\nYou are a Prince and you play your Warband (Druzhina). Each member of Druzhina has a name, age, face and attributes that are trained by experience.\n\n[b]Mechanics - Hillforts[/b]\nEach Warband (Prince) occupies one hillfort. The greatest hillfort being Holmgardr, next Konugardr and other great predefined hillforts like Palteskja, Smaleskja, etc. \nMinor hillforts are generated when new player joins and names them. You can develop your hillfort, but to the limit (perhaps?).\n\nMain trick is - you may conquest a better hillfort, in which case loser Prince is demoted to yours. So, basically in the end everyone is going for Holmgardr. Taking Holmgardr and holding on it for number of Summers is the ultimate goal and glory. But ruling Konugardr (or other predefineds) would also have its share of fame.\n\nIt will be near impossible to conquer Holmgardr from minor Hillfort. Because [some] part of your war power comes from it. So, you make your way top, slowly but surely jumping from worse Hillfort to better.\n\n[Mechanics - Warband]\nYour men are first young and promising, then mature into battle studs, then grow old and try to die glorious in the battle. As a result it is hard to stay on top longer than for one generation. \nAnd lower Princes get their chance to climb the vacant ladder.\n\nBattles have two types;\nRaid - attacking other Hillfort for experience (to improve warband members) and resources (to improve war potential of ones Hillfort).\nConquest - conquering better Hillfort, exchanging it with ruling Prince.\n\n[Mechanics - Battle]\nNot figured out yet.\nConceptually - 12 druzhina men are leading whatever (semi-peasant) forces could be gathered at Hillfort. Druzhina skills matter way more than numbers of support forces.\n\n[b]Miscallenous[/b]\nFactions - Norse, Slavs, Finns, Balts, (maybe Turks/Khazars), (maybe Scythians/Alans). At first perhaps just for flavor (naming of war bands, persons, head gear/hair for faces, etc).\nProblem - not sure how to limit say poor Holmgardr Prince from constant wars with pretenders.\nDruzhina Training - when old man dies, you promote 16yo youngsters with attributes. You may get lucky to pull potential champion or just an average dude. Best years would be ca 25, so after 9 game years of experience.\nDruzhina Skills - not there yet. (But imagine defense, damage, sword skills, archery, riding, leading hillforters to the battle - may be important. Better to have each guy specialized at his thing than 12 averages)"

Each penis can level up and evolve into a longer, thicker penis, but some more than others(it doesnt make you any less of a trainer though) The basics of combat revolve around a fresh new cock/paper/scissors type mechanic, where every penis has a type that will affect whether it becomes stronger or weaker. Peckermen have movesets consisting of four moves, some of which are physical, and some are used to inflict status conditions called STD's. Some moves must be learned as they grow, and some can be taught via ""TM"" (Technical Member). And before you can catch a Peckermen, you must lower its ""HP""(which stands for Hardness Points) with things like cold water and pictures of your grandma. You can even nickname your Peckerman (my wife nicknamed mine)\n\nI dont mean to sound arrogant, but I think this is the freshest original video game idea since Fupa Mario, and I predict it will be a global sensation among women worldwide."

en4xor,Starcraft apex zombie survival hybrid,"Setting; a abandoned futuristic city surrounded by mutant/alien infested desert\n\n4 teams of 15 players per team each starting at a different corner of the circularesque city close to a respawn point and mineable resources. Players start with basic tools like a knives.\n\nThe abandoned city is filled with goodies, danger , and puzzles that take skill to access. Guns, futuristic weapons, armor, Powered armor, invisibility suits (that offer no protection), zeppelins, motorcycles, crafting components, power stations that need to be turned on to run the city for a short while to be able to hack into and access more advanced areas with better loot. \n\nThe main resource will power everything from bullets to motorcycles. Crafting, building, and upgrading,are to be vital parts of the game to protect your spawn point and resource mining. \n\nThe city is dangerous to go in alone, stray mutants, players, and security systems/defense robots being no joke, forcing players to cooperate and have scouting parties. The process of mining will be as automatic as possible with robots doing the work for you. Different components and goodies will be scattered across different parts of the map. \n\nIdeally you would start by making like bows and spears and over time getting more and more loaded with advanced tech. It would be awesome if it had a brutal feel, with everything if the game being scarce forcing you to squeeze the max out of everything and taking risks to get the advantage over the other teams.\n\nYou win by being the last team alive, a game being like 30 minutes. Eventually the mutants slowly come in from the desert incentivizing you to relocate base towards the center and by the endgame you should be able to solo curb-stomp the mutants making trips into the now infested city possible if necessary, but good luck trying to respawn with no loot from scratch then, you would need allies to go into the horde and protect you while you relocate to new base. By endgame you should also have tech to see where your opponents are on the map and track and kill them.\n\nSorry for this being a rant more that a constructive idea for a game I just think this is a really cool concept with a lot of possibilities. \n\nWhat do you think?"

en21o4,I have an idea for a (mostly) metaless card game.,"I've studied the basics of card game metas, more heavily with Yu-Gi-Oh, but also with MTG and Hearthstone to an extent. I know that metas technically exist in every game that is not 100% luck-based, and a game truly without meta would be meaningless as a game.\n\nThat being said, the way metas saturate just about every card game can get a little suffocating for casual players. ""I run three copies of this card, two copies of this card, and three of this one, of course."" And a handful of cards define a game's given meta. They try to work around this with set rotations, or in Yu-Gi-Oh's case, a ban list and an insane level of power creep. Hearthstone can tinker with this at any time just by tuning up the stats of individual cards without warning, which I think cheapens them.\n\nBut what if a card game had no meta in terms of cards to seek out and use? What if a card game existed where *every single card* in the game was totally unique, and you were the sole owner of that card? What if you had a deck of 30-40 of these totally unique cards, none of which had a twin anywhere in the world, and you played against others with totally unique decks?\n\nI have an idea for a text-based card game where each card has only one copy and would only go to the one player who purchased it. I would either produce decks for players to buy and/or sell the cards individually. I already have mechanics, card types, etc worked out for some time.\n\nThe main problem I'm running into is how to distribute the game independently. No publisher would go for publishing thousands and thousands of unique cards without being able to mass produce. I've found a way to have them custom printed, but how would I sell them? Patreon came to mind, but I'd like for people to be able to purchase cards a la carte as they choose, rather than getting a random assortment sent to them once a month. Or do you think people would go for that?\n\nThoughts?"

emx64b,B-17 Flying Fortress remake with multiplayer capabilities and extreme realism,"I loved this game growing up, but was always disappointed that, despite the ability to take over any station on the plane, there was no multiplayer. I would love to see a remake of the game with multiplayer and single player capabilities. The single player modes will remain the same, but with multiplayer, you can join a server with others and each person mans a station, a la Star Trek bridge crew or Wolfpack. There could even be an option to fly as an escort or even a German pilot trying to shoot the bombers down! (The option to have other player fly escort or intercept them could be turned off in the server settings, of course) I would also like to see a good modern damage model, including individual bullet holes fired from enemy planes or even chunks taken out of the plane when there’s a flak burst nearby. In my vision, a single misplaced bullet from an enemy plane could even kill or wound a crew member, depending on where they’re hit. For all of us who enjoyed this game as a kid, imagine it with these features and modern graphics. No small undertaking for a studio, but I feel it would be a popular game among those who are into simulators, WWII games, and multiplayer, team based games!"

emw0zv,A Pokemon MMORPG,"**Introduction:**\n\nSo we as fans clearly want a unified pokemon world where we can visit all the regions, catch all the pokemon, and hang out with our friends at the same time. And Nintendo clearly wants a steady source of income. I think for a company as big as Nintendo, making an MMORPG based in the Pokemon world would not only be doable but also profitable.\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n* Nintendo Switch\n* PC\n* MAC\n* iPhone\n* Android\n\n**Features:**\n\n* All regions available eventually. (Starting with one and adding a new one every 1 - 2 years if possible).\n* Multiplayer pokemon experience.\n* All pokemon available eventually. (Pokemon would be partially region-locked and would be partially intermixed to provide flavor and depth)\n   * Legendaries would be more like summons, to help preserve how special they are. So if you defeat a legendary pokemon (like a boss fight), you can then summon it in a battle to fight for you. This way you reconcile the whole ""10 year old commanding god"" problem while letting people battle with them AND while letting legendaries remain special.\n\n**Graphics:**\n\n* 3D but from a 3/4 top-down perspective like in the original games. This keeps the draw distance down, appeals to nostalgia, and makes sure the game can run on both tiny phones or powerful computers.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nA continuation of the core Pokemon gameplay from the handheld and console games. With some differences:\n\n1. You would have your ""battle pokemon"" which would be limited to 6 pokemon, as usual.\n2. You would also have 4 slots for ""utility pokemon"" for HM purposes. These pokemon could not be accessed in battle.\n3. The maps of each region would be re-imagined to be more realistic and sensible. No more having a major route to a city being blocked by a single bush or stone. Instead you would have normal roads and bypasses to places, with wilderness areas available off the beaten-path.\n4. Pokemon could learn more than 4 moves but only 4 moves could be registered at a time for battle purposes. This way you get more mileage out of your pokemon while also maintaining the rules from the original games. You can set what moves you register for battle through the menu.\n5. You make money via several methods: battling other trainers, completing minigames, trading items with NPCs or with other players, doing missions/jobs for NPCs, and daily rewards.\n\n**Potential Pricing Options:**\n\nObviously Nintendo would want to make money off of this game, so the way to sell it to them is that the game would be to have one of the following pricing methods:\n\n* Pay to download or buy the cartridge + Nintendo Online subscription required. (Like World of Warcraft)\n* Pay to download + regular MMO subscription. (Like many MMOs)\n* 30-day free trial + regular MMO subscription.\n* Pay to download + regular MMO subscription + Nintendo Online subscription required. (Inadvisable, would lead to backlash)\n* Free to download + Nintendo Online subscription.\n* Free to download + regular MMO subscription.\n* Free to download but buying the download gives you a good starter pack + regular MMO subscription.\n* Free to download + Free to play (but limited to one region); Subscription required to access additional regions.\n* (Other)"

Let us get started!\n\nLincoln's sisters are macking a racket, as they always are, and Lincoln (the player) is tasked with calming each of them down within a certain time limit before Rita and Lynn Sr arrive home. To calm each sister down, you will need to talk with each of them to tell them to calm down. Certain sisters can pose obsatcles to calming the others down (e.g. Luna's guitar can prevent the others from hearing you, and if Lynn is still active she might occasinally tackle you and force the current conversation to restart). Some of the sisters can also present hazards of their own (e.g. if you stand too close to Lucy when talking to her, she will begin reciting a long poem, which cannot be skipped, and you will not be able to do anything else until she is finished).\n\nOf course, if you fail to calm every sister within the time limit, Rita and Lynn Sr would believe the mess is Lincoln's fault, and you lose a life. Lose all of them, and it's game over!\n\nThere is also a ""Los Casagrandes"" toggle available at the title screen. Toggling will enable Los Casagrandes mode. In Los Casagrandes mode, you instead play as Ronnie Anne and are tasked with calming her family down, but the gameplay is the same, just with different hazards and aestetics.\n\n2-player mode would involve both Lincoln and Ronnie attempting to calm their respective families down within the time limit."
em1ig6,Time travel games.,"Ive always like the concept of time travel in games  but most of the time its just replacing the timeline, not interaction with one timeline or anything like this.  Heres an example. \n\nYou walk down the hall, but the doors is locked.  You from the future unlocks the door for you.  You now have to go back in time at this side of the door and become you from the future.  \n\nThe main problem is allowing agency in a game like this.  This could be explained storywise by saying there wasn't agency in the first place.  Another solution is letting people, ""summon,"" theme from the future.  You could have a stat choose how much you time travel and how much control you have."
em1g0h,"""Battle Royale"" but instead of killing each other you cooperate in order to survive a scenario","You drop into a free for all arena, but there is no way to directly kill another player. Instead, your goal is to survive an apocalyptic or deadly scenario. This could be anything from zombies, to rising lava/water, unkillable monster on the loose, or any such scenario or combination. You *can* indirectly kill others by locking them out of areas etc. but you may not want to as cooperating can help you survive. The last player living wins, or the last group of players all win by a certain time limit, or any player who makes it to an objective wins."
em0pcf,Middle East Strategy/Management Game,"A game where you play as private contractors, coalition forces, or major Middle East nations."
elzzbt,Beastiak Online: If Pokemon was rated M and had more of a space opera tone,"Beastiak - pronounced bees-chi-ak - is an action MMO where you play as a tamer of different creatures in the galaxy to your liking, with a limit of five starters (you can have more when you level up). Set in a multi-hubbed yet gritty Milky Way circa the 32nd Century, you create your own monster trainer from one of 18 intelligent species including Human.\n\nWith seven skill trees upon starting the game, the player will automatically have their bonus points added to certain trees based on the species they choose - so no need to pick your brain over this like in Fallout. The main plot involves a extreme paramilitary group called the 2-No Brotherhood, which seeks to overthrow the current galactic government three years after a devastating war. Half the races are sided with them, the other half is pro-government.\n\nAfter creating your trainer, you set out to tame and train your creatures, be they from Earth or otherwise. There's thousands to choose from, but be weary: This game has permadeath. Your monster can die if you do so much as battle someone with higher leveled beasts. Maiming, munching heads off, and gore included. So prepare to be humiliated at your own risk.\n\nAlso unlike Pokemon, you can straight forward name your monsters and take care of them in multiple methods. Play them death metal! Or have them fetch for unsuspecting folk nearby get in trouble with the authorities! The choice is yours. Dementedly. \n\nThis is an idea that crossed my mind yesterday. And as far as the art style, it's in the style of seinen (more realistic) anime like Berserk. Feedback is welcome. :)"
elzwyl,"If there were no technical limit in designing a game where thousands or millions of players interact in realtime on the same screen, what (best if simple but lots of it) kind of gameplay should they do together?","I ask cuz as a researcher of computing theory, I believe it is possible to have a million players on the same screen in realtime, even if only 1 pixel's color is controlled by each, or gradually between that and fewer more influential players. Its just hard to experiment with that without a specific proof of concept in mind."

elwi69,Xcom basebuilding + Battletech + Spelljammer,"So in the waking hours a few days ago i thought of this game that I would love to play.    \n  \nSet in the D&amp;D spelljammer universe, you have a [ship](https://www.google.com/search?q=spelljammer+ships&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQIJvwaz8uVkWeNyTydIkSNlVC21w:1578507425016&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiunt-yzvTmAhVKJzQIHT9PBtwQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=914) that you can customize and build up as a base of operations, fly around to different realms and complete adventure missions similar to Battletech.  The overarching story could take you to a variety of environments and the NPCs you choose pick up along the way could determine what you can build on your ship and how you use it or it can be based on your class like the base in Baldur's Gate.  Arcane laboratory, rogues den, armory, etc...\nmaybe you're fantasy space cops or pirates or a arcane cult?  \n  \nalso a pixel graphics spelljammer FTL would be pretty boss also."
elw995,What would a Star Wars lightsaber multiplayer dueling game look like?,"I'm thinking something similar to the Revenge of the Sith game, but I need a detailed breakdown of how I'd make that possible. Maybe first person for big modes  (16-player) and then a more fighting game-y approach for 1-on-1s. What would you like to see included? I'm trying to make this as far away from actual Star Wars as I can, so force stuff won't be an option unfortunately."
elvyh8,massively multiplayer games like Heave Ho (video) and World Of Goo (video) except grabbing eachother only works when both are grabbing from that part so you can still swing and throw eachother but its not possible for anyone to hold anyone else against their will like you often have to argue about,"Heave Ho [https://youtu.be/ECYkPCnu\_Vc?t=236](https://youtu.be/ECYkPCnu_Vc?t=236)\n\nWorld Of Goo [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NPa\_5\_ug40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NPa_5_ug40)\n\nIn Heave Ho theres max 4 players, probably cuz its hard to work together when anyone can grab anyone else and refuse to let go. That could in theory scale up to 1000 players on the same screen, and they dont have to be shaped like just 2 grabber arms but could have any number of grabbers... if the only thing that can grab eachother are pairs of grabbers on different players and both have to be grabbing on that speciific grabber at the time. If theres many grabbers per player then you could play slower by selecting a grabber and to grab or ungrab then move on to another grabber.\n\nI'm unsure what controls would work fast enough to be fun."

elrmte,3rd Person Bullet hell shooter,"Fellas, let's be honest. Ever since Uncharted 4,the third person shooter genre has become rather stale and repetitive. \nOn the whole, the mechanics haven't seen any radical changes (with the exception of the amazing Splatoon)\n\nSo I propose third person bullet hell shooter.\nGuns and enemies shoot different patterns of projectiles, like in Nier Automata (great game BTW). This allows for more kinetic and fast paced gunplay, and avoid the classic pop-into-cover drag. Each pattern has different speeds and heights, forcing the player to jump, slide or weave. \n\nTraditionally, bullet hell shooters only work from a fixed isometric camera angle. So how do we make them work in a third person view?\nEnter the anime Gun Gale online. I believe there was a game mechanic called Bullet line, which allowed players to see the trajectory of any incoming projectile (for the fraction of a second). This could bypass the limits of a third person camera (I think) \n\nSame can be (minimally) applied to a 3rd person angle. But how can we avoid the screen becoming a seizure inducing hazard of lights? What if it only applied to enemies within a certain range?\nI'm not sure tho.... \n\nAnyways, as usual, I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas to properly implement this mechanic."

elqiug,Top Down Twin Stick Shooter,"It's definitely borrowing from games like Smash TV and Robotron: 2084, but with my own spin on it. The theme of the game is largely sewing related, with the player character(s) being rag dolls and the enemies consisting of buttons, spools of thread and a pin cushion. The player(s) would fight through waves of enemies by throwing pins/sewing needles at them, to clear each room, collecting power up's and loot along the way to boost their score before finally making it to the boss level. I figure it's a simple enough idea, easy to implement, but is it something people still want?"

A true FPSMMORPG. Honestly, graphics wouldnt need to be that crazy, you could run Halo CE graphics and people would love it. \n\nSetting:\nProbably scyfy. This would allow for the most additions to the game later on, be it in weapons or things like mounts. \n\nSize: \nDoesnt need to be crazy big. Just please, dont do that multiple planet shard thing that destiny does.\n\nEndgame ideas:\nRather than bulletsponge bosses or heavily mechanized rooms, why not have hard missions that require 40+players. (Oh no, the enemy is attacking the city so now you and 39 other people have to team up to fight off an army)\n\nGraphics:\nLike I said, simple is best. Look at games like Kotor, one of the best RPGs ever and yet its graphics are simple. You could run halo CE- World at war level graphics and I doubt many people would have an issue. It gives a level of gruff to it that modern graphics can't attain.\n\nVoice acotrs:\nForget A list actors. Fans are the way to go. Just have fans audition for voice acting parts and boom, you now have a labor of love both you and the fans create together."

In dungeon, u can recuit fantasies, fight enemies and explore the dream world. Dungeon will be time based. The money is earned from a job. The more u go into dungeon, the more chaos the “real” world become.

(Rumours and materialisation like from Hanako-san)His story will be that his parents didn’t support and believe him as a child. The player will an agent(like Gru).

Banishing the monster give u minions(like mokke or minion) Tasks will be given by children in the street and job aspect to this\nGameplay:\nSolve puzzle to banish monster created by rumours \nDo basic quest like collecting balloons for children.\nThere would also be a job for the player. As money gain from job can be use to make utilities and to upgrade minions\nControl minions to solve puzzle and gameplay will depend on how u solve puzzle(order, time)\nThe player can become good or bad. Bad side will be a secret, and player have to negatively perform tasks to be bad(like popping thé ballons after collecting, smashing children’s cake)\nIf u r bad, u can collect spark fragments, defeat the current villain and take over the world"
feuza6,Space survival coop,"We're a few developers wanting to make a game. We know we want it to be a space game where 1-8 players cooperate. We just don't know what/why.\n\nIt's a procedurally generated universe, where you can land on planets/moons etc., and you can travel between solar systems, and maybe even galaxies.\n\nWe are thinking a mix between Space Engineer and Kerbal in terms of space, as in you have to think a bit more about physics, not just enter and fly away (e.g not No Mans Sky).  A bit like ""Raft"", in terms of spawning in a moving/controllable space station which is your base for the entire game (expandable). Maybe a bit like factorio/satisfactory in the sense that you need to gather resources and craft/construct components, maybe even having a ""pipeline"" of resources (though, hard to solve when moving to another system).\n\nWe don't know where the line between realistic and surrealistic goes, but we don't really want space pirates or aliens. Just our players. Maybe aggressive planet animals, but not like intelligent hostile aliens.\n\n We were thinking that in the beginning, you can't physically land on a planet. You are on a space station, which obviously can't land (though this one can move between orbits/systems). To land you need some landing module/shuttle, which you can't build yet. You can however land a rover and control it from the station. Though, we don't know why you would/what to achieve. Then later, you either unlock, learn or gather enough resources to build a landing module/shuttle to actually go there yourself.\n\nAnd we like the concept of that certain tasks would be best if one player stays at the station, and another is on the planet/moon, and ""solve"" it together.\n\nAnd there are a lot of possibilities of things to ""unlock"" during the game. Different radars, telescopes, modules for the station, rovers, landing pods, shuttles, suit upgrades, drilling tools etc.\n\nBut why? What's the goal of this game? What keeps the game interesting. What's the motivation for playing? Is there an end game? We're struggling to make these ideas into a single game that's captivating to play.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nFeel free to turn things around, like change it to ""40 minutes pvp"" if it makes it easier to ""solve"" as an idea.. Or that each player get their own space station..  We just want as many of these aspects as possible and make it into a game. But initially, we were looking to make it a survival-style game. We just don't know why people would want to survive."
feub2d,Mental Illness Game,"Their should be an educational game, maybe similar to The Sims, where your character needs to do everyday-things, like study/work, chores, socialize, pay bills, personal hygiene etc. Every task costs energy. The kicker though: You never know how much energy you‘ll get until you wake up. Some tasks cost more energy than others, but you have to complete as many tasks as possible. Tasks never disappear, so if there‘s one day that you don‘t do anything, they‘ll add up to the new tasks."
fes4er,"XCOM like game, but the setting is the drug wars in South America","The Autodefensas rise to power strikes me as somewhat similar to XCOM.\n\nYou have an organisation that is trying to tackle a rising or present geographically disperse threat that kills lots of people. In XCOM that's aliens, in South America its cartel.\n\nAs for funding, in XCOM its the governments around the world. In this game, it could be local business owners and families.\n\nThe complexity could be in having to work out how much to straddle pragmatism vs idealism of funding your Autodefensas, should you gain funding though illegal means but then open your org to moral corruption and cartel infiltration? Or should you stay strictly ethical, but have difficulty of getting resources... but then be more trustworthy at a later game stage with other communities you expand towards.\n\nYou of course have to balance your relations and perceived threat level with the government, cartel and community. Too dangerous early on will get all the cartel banding together to kill you and your family. Too corrupt and the community will reject you. Not playing the political game with good national PR and the government will take you out for essentially embarrassing them.\n\nI am seriously surprised I haven't seen such games yet. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupos_de_Autodefensa_Comunitaria"

Starting the game with 1,000 Debris, aka the games currency, you use them to start disasters, like Cyclones n' stuff. You use disasters to rack up points by destroying property, and you earn Debris in the process, essentially one big cycle.  \n\n\nUpdates go here:"
fenhj0,Creature Collection + 2D Strategy,"I love party building games, Pokemon in particular. I've been a bit bummed, though, with the development of the series over the years. Gamefreak seems to be growing away from a focus on game mechanics and toward a focus on marketing. I really want a Pokemon-like game that gives players more party building flexibility as well as a more meaningful gameplay goal. I think this could be achieved by combining creature collection with Divinity Original Sin, Disgaea, or Fire Emblem style 2D combat.  \n\nI'm imagining combat where units from two teams are dispersed across a 2D grid. Turn order is assigned to units throughout both teams by speed, but every unit moves once before any unit moves again. One trainer/summoner/etc starts as the only unit on each side. Each trainer turn, they can bring out one creature (this preserves the roles like leads, mid game sweepers, and late game cleaners). The goal of combat is either to clear all of the opponents party or to kill their trainer. \n\nEach creature would still have a limited movepool and stat ranges that gave players choices when using them but still dictated a role for each creature. Moves and abilities could be greatly expanded, taking inspiration from any 2D strategy game. Maybe some creatures are purely focused on movement, teleporting their allies and enemies around. Some could be tanks with skills that provoke enemies into targeting them. Some could be stealth units with skills that make them invisible to the other player.\n\nStats could include the usual physical and magical offense, physical and magical defense, health, agility, and speed. The physical magical split could be further divided up with resistances or weaknesses to types of damages. Speed would determine unit turn order and the number of spaces a unit could move per turn. Agility would determine the number of actions and unit could take per turn.\n\nI also think the 2D grid would tie in great with the use of types/elements. Fire attacks would set a tile on fire, and if water was used on the square after, it could create a smoke screen. Poison tiles could be converted into healing tiles with a light/holy type attack. This could be expanded a ton with relatively little development effort. \n\nOverall, I think it would make creature collection even more exciting and satisfying if I could see my entire party working together and synergizing. It would allow/force me to diversify my PvE strategy, and it would enable even cooler PvP interactions. I think in general this would scratch a gaming itch that I've had for a while. \n\nThanks for reading! Let me know what you think."

fe8ulg,a HUGE 3d MMO turned based tile game.,"the idea, a mix of EVE online, Space Engineers, and XCOM. think of a table top game, or turn based strategy games like XCom, Battletech, or battle brothers. then expand that to a 3 dimensional ""board"" 500 Trillion cubed, with suns, planets, and asteroids. . . . . . so the scale of EVE online, if not bigger. the ""ships"" are completely custom like Space Engineers, but they only show on the map as a tile pieces based on their size. the turns, each will end every (24 hours)\*, any orders start the next turn. since there will be no moving animations this can be played in any web browser. all player will be on the same massive map, with NO NPCs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Character, you are a general that controls upto 500 agents, who can control upto 1,000 peasants. peasants are the workers running production, food, ship building/disassembly, mining, gunners . . . . based on the level of the agent that controls them. the peasants can be put in schools to become agents. additionally this will be communication based system, so if an agent is too far away from ""you"" it will take time/turns for him to report back to you and/or start a new order. your general can be put on ships for getting tasks done faster. if a general is killed an agent can be picked to replace him, if all agents are dead your game is over, but your ships will remain to be found by someone. you'll start from fresh, so you it will be a long time before you back to that location, unless your in a group.\n2. Characters levels, 1-100. based on level determines what it can do, and have. plus a point system in things like piloting, navigation, laser shooting, research, mining, construction, destruction, luck . . . . . . . but you can't max everything, you'll have a limited amount of points. and you can re-educate an agent into something new, but this will take time to do.\n3. THE map, HUGE! you will get updates on things your agents see the turn they send the reports. so if a comm from an agent is 5 turns old, then any ships there could be gone, new ships could be there. . . . . . . . . what is seen will be based on sensors of the ship and based on the agents level.\n4. Sensors, tell you whats around you. 3 basic types, omnidirectional for basic intel, directional for more detailed intel, and mining.\n5. Communications. like said before it take time/turns to get and send orders. using different types on comm arrays can decrease the time. basic, hyper speed, and jump comm, are the 3 i can think of. there is a plan for comm jamming.\n6. Movement. 3 types basic, hyper speed, and jump drive. basic is like we have in real life, burn rockets to move to a new location. hyper speed will be the same as basic just faster. and jump drive will jump you from 1 point to another. blind hyper speeds, and jumps can be done but is VERY dangerous! hyper speeding through a suns, planets, asteroids, or even an unlucky ship will get your ship killed, and the same with jumping. scanned hyper speeds and plotted jumps can be done but take time to do.\n7. SHIPS! unlike Space Engineers you won't get to place each ship component where you want it, instead you tell the game which components you want in your ship, and it places it ""smartly"" i haven't figured that out yet. each component will have a scale size 1-100. for each ship you can make blueprints to build clones of or sale to people.\n8. Combat. missiles, lasers, plasma, projectiles, or you can just run a ship into another.  the numbers will be a dice roll based on the scale of what fired it, the agent character points, shields, the components being hit, and armor rating. killing a ships cockpit/command center will kill the ship, then you can go in loot, inspect, disassemble. any agents or peasants left can be killed, sold, bribed to work for you. \n9. MINING. randomly generated minerals on each planet, and asteroid. then each mineral will have to be processed . . . . .\n10. Markets. if there are no NPCs who runs the markets? each people can run there own, set their own prices, and make their own missions. their is no plan for ""money"" so it will be a trade based system using the ""mineral"", blueprints, ships, agents, RL money. . . . . BUT whoever is broadcasting their market maybe leading you into a trap, or the ship that just jumped in can shoot down your market stealing everything there. building amnesty shields will help against any pirating.\n11. Research will be random, no tech trees. to learn new things your have to send your agents to laboratories to randomly discover things, inspecting dead ships or planets, and blueprints you buy/find.\n\nSure I'm missing some things. feel free to add your thoughts and questions. thanks for reading."
fe8iee,Procedurally Generated Quests,"I've been thinking about this for a while but haven't had time to develop it myself so bear with me. \n\nI really enjoy linear game experiences, usually the most immersive story is one that doesn't have other stories to compete with. That said, a game in which, based off of the few prebuilt quests you've done and the state of the world (maybe an MMO or a game that sees your friends activity in the game) can create new objectives and interactions.\n\nIt may be a little bit of a hassle but I think that the unique experience of a quest based off of what YOU have done, and not the character you're playing as is a immersive and personal.\n\nWill definitely use the idea in the future but for now I figure it's more useful here than in my head\n\nTl;dr: a system in which quests are generated based off of your friends activety and your own in a single player game"
fe7opo,Action turn-based rpg idea based on a few games for a story not yet told that I’m writing just for myself rn,"TLDR Basically take Legaia 2 Duel Saga gameplay &amp; Shadow Hearts Covenant teaming up, combos, fusion,  &amp; hard hit/launch/etc with quite a few things added then mash it all together\n\nSo battles will be random encounters (or visible ‘random’ encounters not sure which) much like the two games that inspired it. In battle, you would have access to Attack, Spells, Team Up, Guard, Fusion (would be accessed much later), and of course, Run. When attacking you would input attacks like Legaia with more buttons to use making it more like a fighting game then just the ‘up down left right’ of the former game, making for more skills and combinations. There’s quite a bit more to that but I’m sure how to describe it. Also there is a Action point system that you could use during an enemy’s turn to either counter, guard a attack (if your not already blocking it will block 25% to 50% more damage or if your already guarding 75% damage), or use a special attack (that I haven’t thought how it’d work).\n\nThere’s more to spells and elements that I wanted to say maybe even adding Chrono Cross’ element boost thing but... I’m tired so I’ll leave off here. Just wanted to post about the game (even if it’s a little bit of gameplay if not story) that I would have loved to create."
fe5g3v,Edge of the universe,"So it’s like outer worlds, but you can actually visit a bunch of star systems (70 is what I’m hoping for), and you can go freely around everywhere whenever you want. Within the story’s play through (like fallout 4) you can go where ever you want (it’s open world). Do what ever you want to. There are 3 modes: normal, survival, and colonist. Normal is easy mode, hunger and thirst and normal health regeneration. Survival is a bit harder with less health regeneration. Colonist is like crazy difficult, where you die from like 4 shots and you can’t regenerate health. You also re-spawn from the last bed you slept in, and all the stuff on you at the time will be lost."
fe5a6e,A post death 2d action platformer game where you travel through the 9 levels of hell.,Hey r/gameideas its my first time here so sorry if the title was overly generic. I was thinking about making this game with my friends where you play as an angel tasked with traveling through hell in order to defeat Lucifer. You gain interchangeable special attacks and break your way through the 9 levels of hell. The story goes as follows - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* You travel through the starting areas of hell and eventually run into a demon who looks almost identical to the main character\n* You slowly lose your sanity and become tempted by Lucifer\n\nThe rest of the story is still being thought up but in essence you eventually pair up with your demon look alike in order to take down Lucifer together. You get the chance to play as both characters. I just want to hear your opinions and ideas to make it sound a little less generic or a little more interesting.
fe4vrb,Abandoned Mansion Point and Click Fantasy Puzzle Adventure Game,"A point and click adventure game, in which you play as a boy waking up in a decrepid, old and abandoned mansion with no memory of how or why you are there. The style would preferably be a artsy polished style, with shaders and whatnot. The protagonist and other encounters do not speak, but rather talk via texts on the bottom of the screen.\n\nYou ""wake"" up in a main sort of room, where trees and plants have taken over the walls and roof, cracked windows, broken down furniture etc. The goal of the game is to explore and find out the lore of the mansion, and in the end, a way out.\n\nWhen exploring rooms, you find other creatures in which gives you puzzles to solve, and afterwards, keys or other items in which to get past obstacles. These creatures could be anything you want, from fantasy creatures to almost alien ones.\n\nI haven't seen one of these in a while, i'd love to hear what you guys think of this, would be an awesome game (oh and this whole idea, came in a dream)"
fe2yzq,Spot dodge in darksouls?,"Hey I'm a game design who's worked on a few games,I've had an idea for a game for about 10 or so years, its kept on changing for a bit but one thing its had was elemental powers and fast action.\n\nSo for the past 3 or so years I thought making the game a souls like would be fun and I've been designing it in my head, I want it to feel like an anime fight whenever you fight a boss/group of enemies, and I was thinking of adding a spot dodge there would be almost no end lag and you would be in the same spot for an attack, there would still be a normal roll/back roll that would be much easier to pull of but I'm wondering is there any thing I would miss, is this game breaking? I know I haven't given alot of info this is just a design bit I've been thinking about for the past 2 or so weeks"
fe0ujm,Theme ideas for open world looter shooter,"Hi everyone, I'm currently working on an open-world looter shooter in a post apocalyptic world. This is a passion project and I'm making it under unrealengine with a group of people. I'm trying to get ideas for the story. \n\nThis is a multiplayer game, players are able to kill each other. They are also able to team  up. Loot in inventory is dropped upon death. You will be able to find  loot around the map (food, guns, materials, armors, helmet, etc.. )  There should be monsters or alien-like monsters. Haven't really thought  about what kind of monsters or creatures to put into the game as it  would need to relate to the theme.\n\nThe story is the world was destroyed due to x reason and now the post apocalyptic world is held together by a variety of machines that's keeping it alive. I know that's very short and sound very vague but I'm looking for ideas to build this story. Also more than happy to compensate someone monetarily to help as well through discord or something."
fe0f97,A randomly generated post apocalyptic survival game,"The game would take place in a big open world. You would spawn as a random character with only one goal - survive. The map itself would be the same each time, but stuff on it would be randomly generated, like resources, locations of bandits and other survivors, etc. You could also find a companion to come with you on your adventures, and it could be another person your age, a kid, a pet, or whatever. You and your companion would level up skills and find better stuff to help survive. If any character dies, the game would continue with whoever lived and they would then find another companion and the game would keep going until both the companion and the playable character die. There would also be communities of survivors and it would be totally random how they'd react to the player.\n\nThoughts?"
fe0a6g,A game of teamwork and greed,"4 players start at the first level, and start looting for junk that will be sold when the game ends (everyone dies)\nthere is a time limit each level. Once it hits zero, the level will start breaking apart. If you are greedy, you will fall, but if you are fair, You will make it to the next level. Looting a certain ""box"" or ""chest"" will take time, so if something looks large and cool, a ""vault"" it will take a lot of time to open. \n\nIf your teammate is greedy, you can knock them out while they are still looting and take them to the next level, they will lose some junk but not all. It will not be stolen by the one who knocked them out. \n\nSometimes it's not if you are greedy. Let's say, a roof falls on you. You can call for help, and it will take no time at all for your teammate to remove the debris, and then they will have to carry you. You will not lose junk but you are still technically ""unconscious"" \n\nThe things you can open and loot will progressively change. The one that take longer to open will have the largest increase in loot and the ones that take the least time decrease. you cannot just skip the looting as there will be a penalty to your junk amount, and you will not get anything.\n\nOnce everyone dies, they can sell that junk for upgrades.\nYou can increase speed, decrease loot time, jump height, etc..\nYou can only knock out teammate when the timer has run out and they are looting. \n\nThat is all so far."
fdzsoj,A zombie world game where you never be killed by zombies.,"Hello r/gameideas! I really want to share fresh ideas of my dream game. Sorry if my English is not good enough. Enjoy!\n\nThis game name is ""Pacifist"", a wholesome zombie apocalyspe game. The protagonist has perfect immunity to zombies, it means that she can't be detected or infected. Moreover, there are people that have the same blessing, or only have one type of immunity. The non-detected but still infected is called ""Ghost""; and the opposite is called ""Knight"". The zombie abilities are similar to the ones in Train to Busan.\n\nThe protagonist (Evie) is physically weak, but instead has a bright mind. Of course, her main job is collecting and scouting. With her help, some survivors successfully built their own fortress. However, that's only the begin.\n\nThere are still troubles, but Evie knows how to get through. As a player, your currency is Heart. Evie mission is winning love and affection from everybody. If she can't, she could be killed from any selfish/envious survivors, gangs of psychopaths, or mistaken/aggresive marksmen.\n\nTherefore, Evie collects people's favorite goods. Not only she brings to the base food, drinks, cattle, crops or other basic necessities; she also acomplish personal requests: she take back your pets, ""raid"" library for books, find games and music discs, ""rob"" some jewelry, etc. She can do everything with ease, as long as no living human shot her. And that can be solved too! Evie is ready to learn any instrument. A harmonica can help her a lot to prove she is sane and healthy, or lure zombies away. If she wants, she can play a whole concert for the zombies! The game will introduce you to variety of lightweight musical instrument and how to play them. When the goods are just too heavy, she can use neutralized zombies (no jaw and arms) to carry for her. Player can decorate those zombies and her truck, tame pets, or try if the sword is sharp enough by slashing a whole horde of zombies in sparetime.\n\nThe game's main story is about Evie making peace between groups of survivors, escaping and defending from people who wants to kill her, and discovering secret lives of infected strangers. She must carry the huge amount of responsibility, knowledge and tatic to save every people she can. It's why people called her ""Pacifist"".\n\nThank you for reading my post! This is just a dream, but i hope someone can make this very new type of zombie game into real life!!"
fdxplk,Fighting game without healthpars,You remember the old bones stages in the old Street Fighter games like the berrals or the car.\n\nNow imagen 2 player fight in those stages but the goal is not to beat each other but to get the highest score in the stage.\n\nYou can beat the other player so he won't get more points or to throw him on a barrel to get points but beating the other players won't gave you any score directly.\n\nThere will be so many stages each one is a different mini game.
fdulpj,Game where you play visions by looking at clouds,"Crazy idea, basically, you begin the game in a car or a field, and you walk looking at the sky and clouds, each specific cloud has a certain shape to it, example being a sword, when you look at the sword cloud, you can interact with it and you will be taken into a vision of something the has to do with swords, like a medieval battle, this goes for any weird object, so go crazy lol."
fdua1n,A depressing game for a depressing world,"I recently read the short story [I have no mouth and I must scream](https://wjccschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/I-Have-No-Mouth-But-I-Must-Scream-by-Harlan-Ellison.pdf) (great read but be ready) and it got me thinking. The story follows a group of survivors navigating a world constructed by a machine and is one of the most depressing stories I've read with absolutely no hope. The game would be set in a post apocalyptic world, full of empty cities, vast deserts where seas used to be, snowy peaks at the top of the world, and underground cave networks. You are an entity, full of curiosity but unable to physically interact in the world, you wander this barren wasteland, clueless to what happened. As you're navigating a beautiful city once full of life, you encounter a wounded man, he cannot see you, yet he knows you're there. In his hand is a photo of his family, around him there's nothing, no supplies, no weapons, nothing. Just you and him. You converse about this once glorious place, he talks about his family and how they would sing to him when he was sick, you comfort him in his final moments, until death slowly takes him away. He leaves this physical realm, gone with the memories of a joyous time.  Wind whistles past as you as you venture forward, finding the last inhabitants in a broken world.\n\nBasically the game would centre around the world. Lots of environmental storytelling with survivors few and far between. The only interaction would be with them and some objects, such as statues and monuments in which your character would conjure up dialogue or their own thoughts. Just think a bunch of random encounters. Writing would need to be on point to provoke emotion and create a sense of dreadfulness. Graphics could be minimalist but  still somehow captivating, as it is the focus of the game. First-person, third-person, isometric, top down, I reckon they could all work. When interacting with characters a image or sketch could appear with dialogue to the side (similar to [Darkwood](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/cb/55/52cb55a4c51b779ae52dc9524d50cd84.jpg)). Main point of the game would be to reinforce a world with possible sparks of hope, although death would be about all that's delivered.\n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated."
fdu109,Jedi: Knights of the Clone Wars (Star Wars Game Idea),"A new game where you create a play as your own Jedi Character and fight in some of the most epic battles from the movies and TV shows. \n\nOverall Gameplay: The story would start at the Battle of Geonosis and then progress to 7 different planets, each with about 10/12 missions on each, much the same as Destiny. Each planet would feature a boss fight in the form of a Sith/Bounty Hunter/etc. With also a Count Douku raid being available after the game is completed. \n\nThe Planets would be locked by locked by level with the 7th plenet being locked to level 70 and a max level of 80. Each level would come with a damage increase and health increase. Scenario: If you were level 60 going to a level 50 planet and your friend wanted to play but he was only level 20 you can put the Padwan Machanic into effect which would boot their level to 49 meaning it would be difficult, but they'd survive. \n\nAll, with the exception of the first mission, will be co-op (the first mission would be available to co-op after its completion) up to 3 Jedi. More than that the game wouldnt be worth playing because you'd be over powered. \n\nThe real hook for this game would be the classing system. You start the game as a Jedi Clone Commander with 4 other classes becoming available at regular intervals, levels 20, 30 and so on. Unlike Destiny however, the class you select will not dictate your overall level, if you change class only your abilities will change, so any upgrades to your saber, health and damage will be the same. Each Class has its own 4 abilities; left, right, class and ultimate, as well as a passive ability. Left right and class abilities can be upgraded and once you've fully upgraded each class to max you will unlock a new title called ""One with the forces"" which will give access to a White Saber, as well as the option to pick any abilities, from any class, AS WELL AS, the option to have 2 passive ability.\n\n\nSabers and Upgrades:\nLightsaber upgards will level from Level 1-10 in each of these areas. These levels will be on a skill tree, kill enemies with your saber to unlock saber points. You will be able to pick and choose how you want to upgrade it. \n\nDefection duration: much like battlefront 2's ""Stamina System"" the deflection rate is a metre which will decrease the more you deflect. While each class has its own deflection duration, you can add points to your saber to extend it further. When the Deflection Duration is max level it will unlock a Double Saber\n\nSrike Speed: the speed in which you swing your saber. Once maxed it will unlock Duel Wield Sabers \n\nStrike Zone: Strike zone is a yellow circle that sits at your waist, when an enemy is in breach of that circle it will turn red, signaling that they are in range to kill. Once maxed, it will unlock a Broad Saber - a longer Saber with a ""Ren Cross"" at the hilt, only instead of being an actual cross it's more of a V."
fdt91d,"New Genre Idea: 1v1 auto-battler with absolutely no interaction, just watch your team battle another","Basically if you liked those CPU vs. CPU custom battles in fighting games but want a game built around that concept. Both players will own a team of ""heroes"" that battle it out to the death. Whoever wins a certain  number of rounds reigns victorious! Progression is basically the more you ""play"" the more you can unlock different heroes and cosmetics.\n\nWith the popularity of Autochess games ala TFT and Dota Underlords why don't we take it to the next level and make a similar game with no skill needed? just sit and watch hoping you get lucky while cheering on your team that you selected for the match. Perhaps we should call this genre of games ""spectating""\n\nSomeone should make this in DOTA or Overwatch Workshop. :D"
fdmc1a,Recycling related(ish) arcade game,"Do you guys have any ideas of what would be a fun arcade game to put in a physical custom arcade machine connected to a device that gives you credits (lives, game time, etc.) for recycling your plastic bottles/paper cups/cans?\n\nIdeally it has to be executed in 2-3 months by a 3 persons team in Unity. Both 2D and 3D options are open.\nWe do have quite a few ideas but we appear to be stuck. Today we received some mixed feedback and we are looking for some different perspectives.\nRaising awarness about recycling and sustainability is the main goal ofcourse but the game doesnt have to be educational. \n\nIf you have some suggestions for maybe fun mechanics or concepts around the theme of ""recycling"" it would be much appreciated."

fdb5td,Puzzle platformer idea,"Puzzle platformer where you play as skeleton. Main mechanic: you can attach/detach your limbs, depending on your “limb”-state you gain/loose movement abilities. \n\nExample: when you have only one leg, you cannot jump high and your speed reduced. \n\nExample 2: when you have no arms you cannot grab items and climb.\n\n\nOther than that, you need to sacrifice your limb(of your chose) in order to use it as lever in some mechanism. Another idea I had, you need to throw your limb to distract some monster(probably scary dog, they like bones:))\n\nPuzzle aspect here is that you need to figure out what limbs to sacrifice and in what order to complete the level.\n\nWhat do you think guys? If you know similar games please share."

fd9nw7,Fatal Impact,"Due to a nuclear war, alot of the world started to devolve and create new mutant creatures and even giving some humans powers.Years after the nuclear war a group of people created a competition know as Fatal Impact. The Fatal Impact Games were basically some of the sports have in time time but a lot more dangerous. Fatal impact grew and became a new source of entertainment for the people who survived the nuclear war.\n\n\n\nThe sports in this game there is soccer,basketball,footbal,tennis,hockey,volleyball,and racing. They all have new edgy names in this apocalyptic future but I couldn’t come up with anything. In this game you can select a character each with their own special powers\nand ultimate ability. The longer the matches go on in a game the more dangerous it gets with hazards coming in to make it more difficult to score. There is multiple maps for each sport that takes place in different and shows what has happened to the countries or cities years after the nuclear war. You can play this game online or play it split screen with friends. Also if you players dont want any of thw hazards they can just switch to the alternative no hazard version of the sport they are planning to play."
fd8hdd,A story focused sidescroller where you play from the perspective of an animal,"The world has ended, or rather the world for us humans has. A virus (very topical I know) has wiped off human civilization as we know it and now our pets are left to fend for themselves.\n\n  \nIn this game you would play from the perspective of one such pet, exploring a cityscape and peicing together exactly what happened and where your owners went. Ideally the game would have a tragic and sad aspect to it with the majority of the story being told through the scenes of the game- as dialogue as an animal is kinda hard. When you do find your owners after making your way through the anarchy ruined streets they seem to be taking a long nap in their car. Luckly someone broke a hole in the window and your crawl in to take a nap on their lap, waiting for them to wake back up. Think of the scene in Futurama with Fry's dog.  \n\n\nFor gameplay aspects you would be trying to solve puzzles, manipulating the environment so you can make your way around. In addition there would be [a very creepy and mischevious looking cat](https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PRC_136966015.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=644%2C338&amp;ssl=1) occasionally creating more obsticles for you.  \n\n\nThings like rain and a darker colour pallet would help to set the mood of the game while street lights and metallic objects reflecting light could help to set atmosphere  \n\n\n*Disclaimer: this obviously lacks replayability unless the puzzles were fairly open ended, but I think some games just need to tell a good story*"
fd6zir,Farming and zombies,"My idea is a game where you grow a farm to keep yourself alive while simultaneously fighting hordes of zombies.The way you fight them off is with guns, fences you can place and repair when damaged, and traps you can create using parts you can scavenge turning them into zombie massacring contraptions (somewhat like how you build vehicles in the mobile game “Bad Piggies”)"

fcvwka,Minimalistic traffic controller,"Something similar to ""[Mini Metro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.codepoint.minimetro&amp;hl=en)"" but instead of building a metro network, you don't build streets or highways (the layout is already given) but you rather control traffic, to avoid jams and accidents.\n\nYour goal is to detect conflictive spots, and place maximum speed signs, stop signs, traffic lights.\n\nFor every car that reaches its goal you earn money. Not sure how to establish a ""goal"", maybe each car has a target destination: a highway exit or a certain street they need to get to.\n\nFor each car that misses its goal you lose money.\n\nFor every crash you lose more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking this as a top-down minimalistic game, similar to SimCity's representation of traffic where you don't individualize each car, but the number of cars show how dense the traffic is at a certain spot. And maybe show jams with some sign or exclamation mark or whatever, and show smoke or fire where accidents occur.\n\nDoes it exist already?"

You must find a way to intercept the assassination and keep the target alive. Killing the assassin is allowed, but only under certain circumstances. You also don't have to kill them.\n\nYou win if:\n\n1. The assassin is killed without anyone knowing it was a murder/ away from everyone without them finding out.\n2. The person is stealthily knocked out and captured; this is a good way to get info.\n3. Another way is found to not have the assassination take place.\n\nYou lose if:\n\n1. Innocent Civilians see you knock out or kill the assassin.\n2. Any innocent civilians are harmed. You're a good guy, you don't do that.\n3. The target of the assassination is killed.\n\nThere could also be some sort of online multiplayer.\n\nThe Assassin could be working with people and have decoys to throw you off.\n\nThis game is meant to test people's creativity."
fcg7pn,A concept for a puzzle (be honest if it sucks),"There are 2 big skeleton hands lying still and a locked door. The left hand is completely dark and the other hand extremely lit. There are 6 spotlights in total with 3 on each hand (the left are all turned of and the right all on) you would have to quote ""give them the same amount of light to open the door"" by using 3 controll panells that turn on or off a number of spotlights (for example, the first panel could turn on 2 left lights and 1 right light off.)\n\nThe catch is that no matter what combination you put in, you can't give them the same amount. The only way to complete it would be to go to the spotlights and break them. With that, both hands are completely in the dark, technically having the same amount of lights, which is none. The hands spring to live and open the door."

fbwll3,"Reverse Battle Royale. Rather than be ""last to die"", you must ""collect N flag(s)"" to win. All flags start with a giant shrinking hurtbox dome. If you die your collected flags scatter nearby with new smaller domes. KotH/CTF/Assault for team vs.","Mockup:\n\n* https://i.imgur.com/ww6WX1w.jpg\n\n\n**Versus game types:** slight twist on common game types\n\n* CTF - Capture the Flag - The domes are colored Red/Blue. If you are on blue team the blue dome does not harm you. You must get the red flag from the shrinking red dome and bring it back to the blue base.\n* KotH - King of the Hill - Gray shrinking domes contain a gray flag that you must stand next to long enough for your team to convert the flag to your color. After converted the longer you stand there, the more seconds rack up (reach N seconds to win). If two people from opposing teams stands on the hill at the same time, it becomes contested and no one's time goes up until the hill becomes uncontested. When the flag is converted to your color, so is the dome and you stop taking damage from it.\n* Assualt - carry a bomb from one base to the enemy base that has a shrinking dome. plant and set off the bomb. This can be defense/offense turn based rounds (asymmetrical maps), or both teams are on defense and offense at the same time (mirrored maps).\n\nCan be 2D or 3D. Can be FPS, or completely non-violent. Can be literally any kind of theme, this is just a game mechanic.\n\nDoesn't have to be a ""flag"", can be any mcguffin. Can be one giant dome and everyone spawns on the edge. Can be multiple domes with semi-random spawns. Can follow the fortnite bus approach of letting you pick where to land, then the domes appear. Whatever, it's your game, you should game test to see what makes sense.\n\n**TLDR:** What if fortnite, but the bubble is inverted and you have objectives."
fbw7rv,"A puzzle game made by aliens who live much slower than we do, so you're forced to glitch it to be able to play it","The game is a Portal-type of puzzle game that has been made by the [sloths of Zootopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0woPde7OE1k) and everything (except yourself) is slow motion. So much so that you'd have to wait years for the first door to open after you interact with it. Luckily, there are plenty of ""bugs"" (actually features, unironically) that you can use to be able to go through these barriers. The player has stolen this game while it was being developed so there are plenty of notes explaining the bugs. \n\nSome examples of mechanics (which are usually bugs in other games) and scenes are:\n\n* While you're jumping, you can clip through (some) doors, to escape the first one. This can be implemented by changing collision of some objects while the player is on air.\n* A chamber with a simple elevator that lets you go to the second floor, but the elevator would need an entire day. Luckily, there are some teleport devices (originally made to come back to the previous chamber) and there is one that teleports you where you want to be. The player has to use [wrong warping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gso4MuNSuV8) with another portal near them. This could be actually implemented with a simple inventory, and teleporting the player to a portal with id the one of their first item. IDs and all this information would be on the sloth debugging notes.\n* All the cutscenes must be skipped because they're way too long. However, some of them are ""unskippable"", and if you enter them the only option you have is to reset the level. The player has to somehow [die as they walk into the cutscene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZglaUkY8imU) or [talk with an NPC as they walk into the cutscene](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/NPC_event_skip_glitch) to skip it. This could be implemented by checking player position even after their HP is 0 for a second or two, or checking if they have interacted with any NPC.\n* There is a pool of poison, with a lever, but after pulling it it takes some time. So you have to enter the poison and touch a checkpoint behind a door using the clipping technique of the first chamber, so the game changes the player zone a it death warps them to the next zone. \n\nIn general it's just thinking about puzzles in which the player is forced to use an intended mechanic that is an usual bug in other games, other mechanics would be walking out of bounds, or using that some games phisically push you when your box is trapped between two objects, and that is sometimes used to jump high. The backstory about sloths/aliens/whatever slow life form also lets you write funny scenes and moments.\n\nI've read some suggestions of the ""Using glitches as mechanics"" and and I've seen some games, but I feel this would be fun to play because of the story."

fbucys,First Person Shooter but you steal the enemy weapons as yours,"Basically the player is able to 'snatch' enemy weapons using the 'force' if the enemy is close enough.\n\nCore gameplay:\n\nIts reminiscent to old school run and gun gameplay. The player duel wields weapons but the weapons will be immediately thrown away once the magazine is finished. \nGuns on the floor will either be automatically picked up within the player radius. If not, the player would have to snatch a weapon from an enemy. \nGuns picked up/snatched will have around 25% to 100% ammo remaining. \nGrenades could be taken from an enemy and thrown or you can cook them until the grenade explodes which supply you a one shot 'shrapnel shotgun' \n\nAdditional gameplay:\nSharp objects/props in the environment could be used as a last resort should the player fail to aquire new weapons. \nIf the player snatches a weapon from an enemy, the enemy will be surprised for a moment and switch to a sidearm, if that is also taken, the enemy will either flee or search for a firearm. \nThere's a special skill where the player could pick up all the weapons around him and fire it all at once, which will  lead to a massive depletion in reserve weapons. \nCertain enemies will have their weapons ""welded"" into them  so the player cannot snatch it and the enemy won't drop weapons. \n\nSetting:\n\nThis is irrevelent but I'll just put a totalitarian government where they are taking away the guns. \n\nLevel design :\n\nThe levels should be built around the enemy types and placement which in turn dictates the capabilities of  the player. For example, the player had shotguns at first but because the next area emphasize on enemies with timed grenade launchers with a few riflemen so the player could either target the riflemen first which would give him a temporary range and accuracy advantage or just simply switch to a grenade launcher or just use the shotguns for a while."
fbsvba,An RPG where you can only progress by deleting previous saves.,"(Haven't researched whether or not there is a game similar to this idea. Also haven't decided on a genre)\n\nBasically the plot of the game is that something, or someone, has been terrorising the world for ages, always ending with the world being destroyed. (Or a save being deleted, outside of the game) The main character is the only person who remembers their experiences from the previous world. With every save that's deleted, more paths would become available to take, revealing more possible ways to stop the destroyer.\n\nThe basic premise I came up with:\n\nIt's the earth's final days, society is just gone. Everyone's already said their prayers, and most have given up. The only way anyone could have stopped this is if someone had convinced them in the past that this thing was real. Fortunately, or unfortunately, you just so happen to be that very person.\n\nLet me know what you think!"
fbqiuz,A 2D Open World Platformer,"I was thinking about a game which I may or may not ever work on where the world is open but it is a 2D platforming world. The idea that is the further up you go you go into the clouds and skies (maybe there are sky kingdoms) and the further down you go takes you into dark underworld settings an maybe eventually a lava core to the world. There is also traveling left and right to reach different locales in the world. There are no ""levels"" really just a big open jump and climb world with different things you can gather to shoot, jump further, glyde and so forth. Some of these items help you get to new places in the open world but nothing is level requiring. Of course, like any open world game this might mean you can go into places that you are not ready for and face things that are going to be very hard earlier on. \n\nYou could even have a ""level"" system for the player themselves, with reaching new levels increasing your life bar, increasing your jump height a bit, the power of powerups, and so on."
fbp1om,Shoplifting in VR. The focus is on stealing things right under NPCs' noses.,"Robbing a shop owner blind in Skyrim [by putting a bucket on his head](https://youtu.be/PBbGxEb6YrA?t=78) has always been kind of funny to me. This VR would try to recreate that sensation of stealing right in front of the NPC with methods that have no business working in real life, while retaining the thrill of a stealth game.\n\nIn this game, all you have to do is pinch items in the short windows of time that the NPC is looking away (or multiple NPCs in harder stages). While they aren't looking, you simply grab an object and hold it to your chest to tuck it into your shirt. As you steal, the growing bulge in your sweater becomes glaringly obvious you've stolen to anyone smarter than a sour lemon... but not to these NPCs.\n\nLarger objects take longer to stuff into your shirt, so you have to find clever inconveniences to distract the NPCs for longer. You'll often rearrange their stuff so they have to painstakingly put them back in order. The room has several Rube Goldberg Machine setups to inconvenience the NPCs in various ways, much like how *Untitled Goose Game* does it. So you might need to get the NPC to accidentally mace himself with bear spray to blind him long enough to steal his ice-cream machine.\n\nYou have a checklist of things you MUST steal, and those often require clever problem solving. For example, you might be tasked with stealing the shirt off of the NPCs back, so one step involves ""accidentally"" spilling some red wine on it so the NPC takes off his shirt. While the NPC is pulling his shirt up over his head, you might use that time efficiently to pocket some of his stuff."

fbfwxn,"A player that can control lightbulbs, flashlights, lamps, TV screens, and anything that uses light to investigate a blackout in the depths of an abandoned city.","The player has the ability to control light waves from a phone to a light on the ceiling. While he explores, the player can hold lightbulbs and place them on the ground to light up the dark areas and always carries a flashlight.\n\nAny object that can hold his light energy can keep holding the players light no matter if its plugged in a wall or not. The player goes into a slow motion view that shows any object that can hold his light and can choose items to shoot light into within the players visual range. (Perhaps the player needs to ""charge"" by gathering light energy from the sun or other places.)\n\nTheres something that feeds on light energy within the city and will try to destroy light sources so the player has to hide himself in certain areas.\n\nI'm thinking that when you go deep enough below the city (to where its pitch-black) theres shadow soldiers that patrol the area protecting the shadow god that feeds on light waves. If you shine a light on them, they will feed on the light and eat up the light waves until the object stops working and takes all of your light energy from your body. (Resulting in your death) they also can ""steal"" light and take it to the shadow god as an offering. \n\nJust thought of this idea, I'm sure theres a game like it but can't find it."

There may be libraries but will be incorporated with academic services for teaching and learning minor spells.\n\nHuman invaders shall vary from police officers, curious neighbors, military soldiers, reporters, vigilantes, street thugs, and occultists.

fbccho,A Multiplayer Zombie Survival/A twist on the battle royale genre,"Title might sound complex but the idea is quite simple. First person shooter, players spawn in random spots together with a team and a hundred or so other players on the extremities of a circular map set in a destroyed city filled with zombies, with the sole purpose of reaching the centre of the map where a safe zone exists. As players get closer to the centre, zombies become more dangerous/common, players become concentrated in a smaller area and loot rates change. First \_ people to reach the safe zone are evacuated/win, keeping number small as an incentive for attacking other teams on the way."

The city of Interzone would be heavily based of course on the 1950s tangier international zone which would make the game very historically interesting."
fb9wtr,"ASSIMILATE: A spiritual successor to Overlord that takes place in a sci-fi setting, with the player being the leader of a robotic empire aiming to turn all other races into mind-controlled cyborgs.","The game would have more depth in both systems than the original Overlord. If you're not aware of Overlord, I would highly recommend [MandaloreGaming's video on it](https://youtu.be/xmPI6CLLUoM). You would have to command a more complex variety of minions, and make use of a more complex set of abilities, yourself. I'll go over it piecemeal after a quick TL;DR:\n\n# TL;DR\n\nYou play as a robot overlord who is monstrous in combat-- think of a musou protagonist, clearing swarms of enemies in a couple strikes; if a single alone dares to face you, he'll be executed horribly. But in addition to this, you have an army. Your basic unit can perform objectives, but more importantly, they can turn enemies into cyborgs who serve you. The cyborgs are the meat and potatoes of your army, so you always have to be converting. The setting is a semi-parodic science-fantasy setting reminiscent of Warhammer 40,000, with each faction flaunting certain genre tropes. The objective is to assimilate all other species into your own.\n\n# The Player Character\n\nAs the player, you control a sort of Ultron-esque figure, taking a purely robotic but humanoid form. You were built by this AI to serve as a perfect leader, and as such, are very powerful. On top of having a beat-em-up/musou style melee moveset, you have a number of special attacks, both melee and ranged, and even defensive/buffing abilities. As you defeat enemies, you will gather nanobots made from their flesh(more on that later) which refill your health and your 'mana' meter, as well as serve as EXP to be spent on upgrading abilities. Most enemies in the game are weak mooks who are meant to fight your own weak mooks; you're so far above them, you can execute any of them in a single move, either with a wide attack that will kill many, or an 'execution' where you choose one poor soldier to grab up and both brutally and casually eviscerate, gaining many more nanobots in the process. Stronger enemies can also be knocked into an executable state, leaving you with a deluge of nanobots in the wake of it(and a cool animation to watch). Think of low-tier executions like DOOM's Glory Kills, which serve to reward you for combat as well as make for a way to regain health, and higher ones more like classic God of War executions, which are more so feats, and deserve special reward, like a full(or at least major) HP and MP recharge and XP to match. Essentially, this combat is built to be more involved and complex than Overlord's, without overshadowing your other option: since, of course, you don't always want to be the one fighting, as you'll be killed by attrition that way, you need your minions' help.\n\n# The Minions\n\nYour minions are never, ever, ever yellow, as a rule. Your minions are what makes you a real overlord. In the original Overlord, you had a small variety of buildable minion types, but little room to use them creatively. The solution here would be to no longer restrict minion count('Want to make an unstoppable horde of minions to wash over the battlefield like a tsunami? You're the boss, boss!') and also to increase variety. However, too much variety would get confusing, so to keep things simple, you'll just steal your enemies' minions. You have one basic unit type only, Drones which you build using your Nanobots. As you progress in the game, your Nanobot accumulation(and the price of upgrades) will increase near-exponentially, but Drone prices will not. Drone can do three things. They can pick up loot and transport it to you, they can move large objects(from clearing rubble to pushing obstacles to toppling tall objects), and they can attack enemies with a simple swarming melee(which may be upgradable to a short-range laser or something later). They are very weak in combat compared to enemy units, and as such are really only suitable for utility purposes. But thirdly, they can take any corpse that is relatively intact and re-animate it as a cyborg to fight for you the exact same way it fights against you(They will typically leave corpses intact for this themselves and can be upgraded to automatically convert anyone they kill). This is the enemy-stealing mechanic. The bulk of your forces, the important ones who are actually effective in combat. They all have their unique weapons, abilities, tiers, speeds, ranges damage types, and damage resistances. All things you would expect from a light-RTS unit. However, because it would be cumbersome to command a complex army of units in the middle of personally fighting, yourself, each unit has pre-determined AI and tendencies to it. When you order units to take up a sniper position, only sniper-type enemies will go there. If you order units to protect you, only units who can actually do so will(so your typical infantry dudes won't just huddle tightly around you, they'll just stay relatively close and focus fire enemies who either get close to or damage you). If you order an attack on an enemy who can only be damaged by explosive weapons, only your units who can deal explosive damage will target them). This restricts your commands down to simple ones: Move to a position pointed out by the player, with cover, sniper perches, and ambush points all marked to work contextually with this command. To focus fire on an enemy. To focus on protecting the player. To order drones to either attack or do an objective(they will default to converting corpses without orders, and will protect you if there are no corpses). And finally, to go into Overdrive. Overdrive is your limited super-ability-- when ordering Overdrive, you will automatically heal units in range of you, give them increased attack speed and defense, and they will go berserk, focusing only on killing enemies until the Overdrive wears off. In addition, during Overdrive, you can build Drones for almost free. If you're in a tight spot, Overdrive can give you time to retreat and build up a large Drone force while also massively damaging the enemy force. It's your ""Oh fuck, get off of me"" button-- or, if you're doing well, your ""Finish the fight already"" button.\n\n# The Bosses\n\nAs you progress through the game, you will encounter bosses. Bosses are, of course, very powerful enemies. Typically you will not always be in prime position to damage them. They may have your minions too occupied to help you. Minions can help you by damaging the boss, of course, but minion damage will also weaken the boss, slowing it down and reducing its resistance, putting you in better position to damage it. Some bosses may have gimmicks to them, such as having their weakened state be dictated by having a certain special of minions alive, by some kind of arena interaction such as having your drones topple a pillar on top of it, or by a special attack only a certain minion type can do(meaning you must find and possess these minions to open up the boss for major damage). Most enemies force you to choose between executing them or converting them. While executing a strong enemy will give you a large supply of Nanobots and HP/MP, possessing them will let you control them. Bosses allow for both. After executing a boss and being rewarded appropriately, the corpse can still be converted, which will take time depending on how many Drones are on the task. And from then on, they're yours to use-- until they die. After they die under your command, they're dead forever, and sources of healing for them are scarce. While there would be mandatory bosses, most of them would actually be optional, meaning you will have to choose-- do you try to kill a boss and risk likely the majority of your army, or do you leave it alone and just keep your big army? You might be in a situation where you know you could just barely kill that boss, so is it worth that to have it? Maybe you want to go the majority of the game without them, then collect them all at the end and steamroll the final levels, or maybe you want to see how this one will do on its own, or maybe you even want to try and take one to another and have a boss fight club. The game rewards all of these.\n\n# The World\n\nThe setting of the game is, arguably, the least important part to this pitch, so I will keep it brief. In a similar fashion to Warhammer 40K, the galaxy(or system, or whatever scale) is at war with many factions all vying for control. The human faction, who wield sci-fi gear but still fire bullets and rockets, and have a sort of Vietnam-war-movie-ish attitude to them... but also draw aesthetic notes from the Romans, and follow an Emperor, because why not? Their emperor is no god, though. You have the oncoming hive-mind swarm of vaguely-insectoid monsters, who also convert units(meaning you're sometimes competing with them to gather the most of a third faction's units), and have some kind of ominously-intelligent leader mind. Space monks who are one with nature but also wield high-tech hard light weapons and psychic abilities. An alliance of many races that with a different one for each unit, all of which are kind of drawn from well-known/stereotypical alien races-- humans-but-they're-blue-humans-with-a-weird-thing-on-their-head/face, lizard people, semi-insectoid weaklings, psychically-powerful upper-tiers, and others. The other robot empire, but these ones reject even cyborgs and seek to destroy all organics. Guys that look like demons and have spikes on everything and live on a fire planet, but they're not actual demons, of course, we promise. The ancient evil awoken again, who have weird semi-robot things powered by not!magic. There's a lot of different ideas one could come up with, since they don't have to be very original, but just have some small twist to make them interesting. Even that would be better than the utterly generic other races from the original Overlord.\n\n# The Campaign\n\nInstead of having a story with an order of events, the game would instead be focused on creating replay variety. Your goal is always to assimilate the whole universe. The difference is which races are where. Maybe some aren't even present, or maybe one or two are massively dominating the universe already. Maybe one will show up by surprise midway through the campaign. Ideally, there'd be enough factions that they'd never all be there. Random events like bosses appearing, factions launching large offensive campaigns, random misfortunes harming other empires(""A power plant on planet Delta Prime accidentally ruptured a subspace battery, sucking the entire solar system into an alternate dimension where they are lost forever."" ""A science team on Mars unearthed an ancient superweapon and mistakenly activated it, destroying the human empire's capital system."" ""The human empire has bio-engineered a deadly disease and unleashed it on the bugs, weakening them across all systems."" The major war is largely done without you. You only order troop movements to the next system you choose to personally invade, which will result in a large, but ultimately limited(and nowhere near planet-sized) level for you to beat, with different objectives, enemy types present, maps, and even small random events happening mid-level, like a large ship crashing on the battlefield or an orbital strike being ordered.  With the actual unit count in a battle being in the hundreds, typically, reaching near 2000 at their very largest, the mission and the map will often really feel like a chaotic, out-of-control and violent warzone. The quiet parts of the map will be littered with corpses and rubble, implying that there may not be a large battle here now, but there was one just before you got there. Sometimes you'll be in an area where no battle has happened, but then while you're there, it starts, and enemies clash from multiple sides with you stuck in the middle. You can see enemies coming and ambush them if you watch the map... etc., etc. The content may become stale after multiple playthroughs, but its randomness creates replay value, similar to XCOM 2 or any number of roguelikes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is obviously a massive project, too large to ever expect anyone to do for such an outlandish gameplay concept, but it's cool to think about, I guess."

Eventually said weird stuff formed into a game idea that I later wrote down in a group chat, here is that idea: ""I just dreamt up a game idea, you're a PI (or the PI's daughter, cause what kinda person is going to believe in demons and needs to take care of her.) going to investigate a mansion, but you start finding weird shit, like voodoo dolls and corpses, and you start feeling weird and get flash backs in your dreams and you eventually you realize that the boy who lived hear before this place got so infested and overgrown to the point people won't come near it was getting possessed and his psychiatrist believes using the demon powers for healing, but all the boy wants is death, but they won't grant that and eventually the demon takes over kills his family and more less make sure no one will ever come back, and the longer you stay and slowly go and insane you start to see him, but just shadows walking in the house where you sleep until the final fight where you see him in the house and he attacks you. There would be a crafting system, but the recipes are based on what you find in the world, like you find an old Archer tank destroyer in the brush and over grown and you gotta build a mechanism to get it out and slowly drag it up river back to the house and use the tools you find to turn it into an armored boat instead of the flimsy ass wooden one that has giant bites taken out of it from the creatures the demon has corrupted on the grounds of the manor\nand your boss, a kinda big chunky black man comes and visits every once and awhile to see how you're doing and gives you random material when he sees you're making progress, and the demon comes around during some times even when it's not the boss fight like I mentioned before and you got to quickly make a symbol you learned in the manor to ward it off for that day, but as the game goes on it gets weaker and weaker."" - apologies for the bad grammar, I wrote that post at 3:00 AM."
fazhjd,An interesting top down 2D town builder,"So you know Minecraft, terriera, Starbound and fallout 4 right? What do they all have in common? Small Town building vibes, I've been searching the internet for one and I can't find the specifics ive been thinking of, so of course it's be too down, maybe in the style of the escapist or stardew valley, but if you've played stardew valley you know about the character Robin, well now that's your job, build and expand a town and eventually be the mayor, something a long the lines of my sims kingdom minus the weird mechanics, you have a mine and a forest that you go to for resources, ores, and can even grow different types of trees, now ik your saying do it in Minecraft, but that's not what im looking for, im looking for interactable characters with dialog that you have to convince to move into town and they either have minor needs in a house or have thier own house idea so you can use your own ideas or if your out of idea ask someone on like a laptop hey we have a nice community would type of house would it take for you to move in, and then you can build like shops and things for people who would like to run a shop, again this would be too down 2D but like the homes aren't load zones, the space they take inside would be the space they take outside, being able to wire houses also wouldn't be bad, but that's like a lil more complex, and may be hard for some players, in addition to that maybe it'd be like a survival game as well where people try to come take over your lil town and you have to have people who can fight them off, now im not saying apocalypse themed, but it'd be interesting to also have to balance the needs of food and water, and yeah I guess that's kinda fallout 4 but I don't want it to be focused on a story, or be limited extremely in the ways fallout limits you, as well as that's not a simple 2D game, also I want it to be like maybe not post apocalyptic, but like the midst day but we are plauged at night by fantasy monsters, kind like how some final fantasy games are where they have phones and tech but are also in danger from like for example from FFX they have sin and ""machina"". Now maybe the final feature is a sort of skill system, where the more you do something like the more you can do, like the more houses you build the more options you have to make a house ie different floors walls outer walls and roofs, or like combat you deal more damage, or mineing you can dig up different types of ore or rock. I know this is kind of a lot to ask and it's real complex but I have been craving something beautiful and endless, and I don't know it's maybe something really difficult but I and maybe many others would be super grateful and pay a good amount for it!\nSo yeah if anyone is willing or up to it and would like some more info on my ideas I'd love to help out, like maybe if there are dungeon type places I could write the lore for them! But anyways let me know what you think and if you'd also love this idea!!!!!!"
fayff2,"Europa Universalis 4, coronavirus inspiration","With all the craze surround the coronavirus and me playing eu4 every night for 2 weeks now, I've been thinking. Could these 2 concepts be merged? I've taken about 20 minutes to write some quick ideas down below. Let me know what you think and if you'd be interested in playing such a game, as I'm looking to work on something this summer.\n\nPicture an eu4 world map, but in modern 2019.  \n\nYou control one country. At game start, or some time later, a virus spawns in one random province in a random country. The province and country are determined by various factors such as wealth, poverty, medicine, technology, concentration of people and the type of virus, which itself is determined by player at game start (or maybe at random during play time). The goal is to survive the virus, which could be a flu type of virus, or others such as bioweapon, worm or other viruses inspired from Plague Inc.\n\nThe game has no war mechanics, only peaceful ones. However, there’d still be units such as air and ground units which can reduce the population of provinces in order to help stop spread of virus, with drawbacks of course.\n\n \n\nMechanics:\n\n* Virus spread\n   * Base mechanics\n      * Can spread to adjacent province\n      * Can spread to provinces which are linked by ports/airports, depending on security checks (links between provinces in the same country wouldn’t be the same as ones between different countries)\n   * Influencing factors\n      * Province population density\n      * Wealth/tech/development/medicine/policies\n* Virus fighting\n   * Policies\n   * Population reduction, displacement\n   * Investments\n   * Allocation of resources (cannot create new ones, only import or displace current country resources from one province to another)\n* Population density\n   * Decreases/increases naturally by daily tick, either with population growth/decline or by travel to connected provinces.\n   * Can be modified by policies\n   * Can be killed off with military\n* Population types\n   * Upper class\n      * Needs to be in provinces with high development to contribute to society\n   * Middle class\n      * Needs to be in provinces with med development to contribute to society\n   * Lower class\n      * Can be anywhere\n* Policies (laws)\n   * Internal displacement (moving population from at risk provinces to safer places)\n   * Quarantines\n   * Foreign involvement: A country with weak military could ask another to bomb its own (infected or not) population. Could ask/provide for tech/medicine support.\n\nThese are only \*some\* mechanics that I could come up with in 20min. Every decision and mechanic would of course have drawbacks and limits. For example, provinces would have a max population cap, so you can't just displace everyone further inland. Bombing your own people would cause some huge unrest/economic problems etc. It's like reverse Plague Inc., but from the countries perspective, only deeper with Paradox style complexity and mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you guys play something like this?"
fay52d,A game where you defend a dungeon from the hero,"The game premise would be that you're the bad guy in charge of protecting your treasures from pesky heroes who've come to raid it. Each level would be a simple layout, varying in each attack. Before a round you're told what type of hero is coming and set up your dungeon room accordingly. To do this you could have skill points that you can use to purchase more mobs or upgrade one mob with magic abilities, healing abilities or fighting abilities. There would also be environmental things you can trigger or try to use as traps. If you successfully defend against the hero you can loot their gear for use on one of your units. The fights would automatically generated based on your unit placement and choice, so it would mostly be about strategizing positioning, unit selection and appropriate gear."
fauynb,Total War/Assassins Creed merger.,"Combine the grand campaign and pitch battles of Total War with an RPG like Assassins Creed/Shadow of Mordor. \n\nEvery settlement on the grand campain map can (after a loading screen obv) be explored in 3rd person (AC style) and you directly perform assassinations, spying, sabotage actions etc, that relay back to the campaign.    \n\nI made a quick video to show what I mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Ami58FVT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Ami58FVT4)"
fau65o,How would you guys feel about a Isometric RPG dungeon crawler where you build your own Dungeons?, Its not a fully fleshed out concept more like a random thought.\n\nI know that ideas mean nothing and its all about how well you execute on them but I was wandering if its worth exploring and why there hasn't been one yet.\n\nIs there a demand for something like this? And what would be the impediments or how should I go about exploring something like this. Thanks
fat2ry,"Snake, the Roguelike","I had an idea of a game where you control Snake and traverse through a maze of rooms filled with enemies, puzzles, items, and things to do. It'd be either a turned base game or a regular roguelike. Snake's controls would be exactly the same, but you start off with one spell. At the start of the game you can select your starting spell from a pool of four. Spells consume mana according to its effect. The title could be a reference to Snakes and Ladders (for example, Snakes &amp; Dungeons).\n\nYou'd have to accomodate your long body. You start with four other body segments, five health, and four mana. Getting hit on the head causes one damage, but getting hit on the tail results in no damage. Spells are close range, and regular attacks only hit tiles adjacent to the head, so you'd have to be careful in order to not get damage. At the end of the room, you get a Snak for SnekTM. You get to choose one more spell from a pool of three this time, but as a downside, you get one more body segment. You can block enemies better but you'd have a harder time navigating. \n\nEvery three rooms or so the Snak for SnekTM will give you one more point of health and more mana. Every few rooms will have a puzzle and some have an objective. Maybe some have both! You'd have to juggle between fighting, solving the puzzle, and doing the objective. For example, you have to push three puzzle blocks to its place while defending a gem from the enemies. \n\nIf you do decide to create this project let me know on Discord. I'll try to help if I can, either by ideas or something else. Thank you for reading too."
faqwdl,"Justice Bird: Hero during day, prosecutor at night","Justice bird is a parody of batman but instead of being edgy and brutal is lighthearted and friendly(basically if batman had the personality of superman). I imagine his voice to sound similar to skipper from Madagascar.\n\n\n\n\nIn the game there is a time mechanic to keep the game going. Basically the main missions and side missions are only open at a specific time in the game and once the time runs out to go to the mission you can no longer do the mission. Side missions are optional but the main mission is mandatory. The fighting is similar to arkham knight but a bit more animeish and I imagine the characters to be over the top like in metal gear rising.Like the title says during day you fight crime and find evidence on the main villains so you can out them in jail for good and at night your are Prosecutor Max Eagle who must show evidence on how the villain is guilty. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso everyone in this game is human, they aren’t animals, Justice Bird is just the heroes name.

fan292,Space Smugglin'," \n\nHi all,\n\nI was playing Rebel Galaxy Outlaw recently and it made me think of a Han Solo themed game. I know a lot of people already associate Rebel Galaxy Outlaw with that Han Solo feeling but to me, it was more in theme than the mechanics. \n\nFor a ""Space Smuggler"" styled game, I still liked the dogfighting/piloting aspects but what other systems do you think could make the game really special? What kind of systems do you think would be fun to play around with? What kind of things would you want to do in a game like that?\n\nChef"
fam1oc,Merc Company Tycoon,"I'm a hobby game developer and creator of https://indiegamedev.net so I'm sort of using this as a bit of a soundboard as opposed to putting it out there for someone to make.\n\nThe gist of it is you run a mercenary company. You start off small, just yourself, needing to go out on missions, but you soon hire a second guy etc. I think your first guy is only ""you"" in the sense that it has to start with one guy, I think the player is more like the merc god. \n\nIt would be like other 1-room games where you manage everything (specifically like Gamedev Tycoon). You don't see the action, just the After Action Reports.\n\nStyle-wise I think it can't be too ""serious"", as in I'm thinking pixelish graphics more akin to Tycoon style games than something like Jagged Alliance, though I can see some merit to serious look. Maybe halfway point like Prison Architect.\n\nThe core loop is missions come in at infrequent and random intervals. You can choose which missions to take and which not to. They involve a period of inaction for the people you send, expenditure on flights etc, you're equipping them for the mission costs money in a sense that you previously needed to order that equipment. Each mission also has income and danger-level as well as minimum number of people you need to send.\n\nEventually you hire another guy, then another. You get a quartermaster, a diplomatic guy, hostage negotiator etc. \n\nYour guys can get killed in action, funeral costs etc. Basically the player is constantly risking their business because you need to purchase/hire the things and people you need before you need them. You can always go broke and end the game. \n\nThoughts?"

fak0yu,Saw (movie) inspired co-op puzzle/survival game,"Basic idea:\n\n* 2D local/online single-screen game\n* At least one player must survive a set of levels\n* Each player has a character with properties like health, having/missing limbs, sanity etc. Players could have randomly generated strengths/weaknesses (like fear of spiders, anemia, etc.)\n* Players together play a set of levels containing various puzzles/traps. It would probably be rogue-lite, meaning death is permanent\n* Solving puzzles would carry a risk of getting hurt, so players would be put into situation where they would have to risk or sacrifice themselves or other players\n   * For example pressing a button could start pouring water into a room with a player. Players would have to solve a puzzle/find something/run somewhere until the player in the water room drowns completely\n\nThat is the basic idea - you'd have to treat players health/sanity as a resource, be willing to risk/sacrifice it and assess who to sacrifice."

fah1nx,Question for game devs on this sub,What do you all think of the dreams game for ps4. It seems pretty legit as far as a game creation goes. As far as I know there is no way to export your games off of there but i think it could be a really good sort of testing stage to see what your ideas and thoughts about a certain game could be and how the mechanics could work. It also could be a way to see if people are interested in your idea since others can play your games.

f9uqsf,MineCat Game,What is Game Idea Without Game Engine
f9tjr3,Need help with game idea/story.,Hello guys! I started making a game after a long time of wanting to start game development. I’ve used Unity before but I would say that I am still in the beginner/intermediate level of game development.\n\nI want to create a 2D pixelart platformer (level based) but I can’t think of a catchy backstory or purpose for the player in the game. Without a backstory I can’t think of what traps/enemies/powerups to include in my game since all these are related to the story/purpose of the game.\n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction for game design? I would also greatly appreciate it if you tell me what ideas/thoughts you have for this game.\n\n[VIDEO LINK](https://youtu.be/i-VnDnfLrEw)
f9supz,Pilgrims Journey - An Instanced Dungeon 2D Fighting MMO,"Hello, this is my first real game idea that inspired me to begin writing a little and I discovered this sub as a place to post my thoughts. I've broken down my thoughts as best I can but they are still quite abstract at the moment, any criticism would be greatly appreciated.\n\n# Inspirations:\n\n* Absolver - A 3D fighting game where you develop your own customizable combat style through repeated use of moves, blocking / dodging new moves, and utilizing your defensive abilities on others.\n* Maple Story - 2D side-scrolling open-world\n* Dragon Nest - 3D Instanced Action MMORPG\n* 2D Fighters - Street Fighter, King of Fighters, Dragon Ball Fighterz\n* Dark Age of Camelot - Open World PvPvE world where you fight for control of open-world objectives which then grant your world benefits and bonuses\n\n\-----------------------------------------------\n\n# Core Mechanics\n\n* Instanced Dungeons - The Bread and Butter of the World (Maple Story / Dragon Nest)\n\nThe game is 2D and will have environmental obstacles for players to navigate. Platforms, tunnels, ladders, and other similar tropes will be applied to add a depth of movement. Enemies will range from your typical slimes to bandits and eventually larger foes that would require a full party to take down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Open-World Objectives - End-Game Raids and Guild Wars (Dark Age of Camelot)\n\nPlayers may hop from instanced to open-world play at any time, and may choose to develop their skills in the open world arenas. Here they will face high level mobs and other players in a PvPvE world. In these worlds, there are castles or large objectives ruled by Monster Lords that grant boons and benefits to all enemies in the world.\n\nPlayers may form Guilds to battle these armies and claim the castles for themselves, earning bonuses for all players everywhere, but also granting those in their guild special bonuses as well. At set intervals, Monster Lords will arise and attempt to reclaim these strongholds, and it will be up to the Guilds to coordinate their defenses and hold on to their boons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Your Customized Character - A Sandbox Gameplay Experience (Absolver / 2D Fighters)\n\nSince I was thinking of making this my first project, I envisioned 8-bit sprites, but if an actual developer were to take this on I'm sure they could do what ArcSystemWorks did by using 3D tech to make 2D animations  (super cool btw)\n\nEvery character begins with a basic toolkit: 1 light attack, 1 strong attack, 1 block, 1 dodge, 1 fire stream, 1 water sphere, 1 air blast, 1 rock throw, 1 light orb, 1 dark orb. Characters will also be granted a basic set of weaponry to select from: 1 sword, 1 shield, 1 greatsword, etc. The idea is to allow every character to have the full set of basic equipment they would require and give them ultimate freedom to choose how they will develop. There are no classes.\n\nGameplay will be similar to a 2D fighter, where you will need to time your attacks fighting your opponents. This is a relatively straightforward process, but I would like for specific skills to be unlocked as players prefer certain playstyles over others.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Flurry of Blows - The player's light attack now unleashes 3 swift strikes in succession. None of these blows can be critical attacks.\n   1. Unlock Condition(s): Utilize 3 light attacks on an enemy 100 times\n   2. Unlock Condition(s): Utilize only light attacks to kill an enemy 100 times\n   3. Unlock Condition(s): Achieve an APM of at least 60 to kill 100 enemies\n2. Parry Attack - The player's block will now activate a parry attack when timed precisely, automatically scoring a critical attack.\n   1. Unlock Condition(s): Perfectly block 200 attacks of any type\n   2. Unlock Condition(s): Follow-up a block with an attack of any type immediately 200 times\n   3. Unlock Condition(s): Achieve 200 points of damage when following up from a block 200 times\n3. Firebolt - The Fire Stream spell now unleashes a bolt of flame that trails fire, damaging all who linger in its' wake\n   1. Unlock Condition(s): Accumulate a total of 100 minutes of use of the Fire Stream spell\n   2. Unlock Condition(s): Follow-up a block with the Fire Stream spell 100 times\n   3. Unlock Condition(s): Follow-up a melee attack with the Fire Stream spell 100 times\n4. Enemy Step - The player may now jump off an enemy while in the air to extend their aerial combo.\n   1. Unlock Condition(s): Accumulate 500 points of damage from aerial attacks\n   2. Unlock Condition(s): Perform 200 3-hit aerial combos\n   3. Unlock Condition(s): Kill 200 enemies with aerial attacks\n5. Mage Armour - The player may now ignore any ONE magical attack or effect. Cooldown is 1 minute \n   1. Unlock Condition(s): Dodge through 100 magical attacks / effects\n   2. Unlock Condition(s): Block 100 magical attack / effects\n   3. Unlock Condition(s): Kill 100 enemies who have dealt magic damage to you\n\nThe idea here is to develop a skill tree where every skill is a logical progression from the basic toolkit provided, with compounding skills being developed on top of those. Every skill should also have 2 - 3 conditions that should be met to reward players for playing in a specific way. In theory, this rewards players for playing in a certain way by upgrading the skills used most frequently or granting them complimentary skills to open up their playstyles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Instanced Dueling - Pugilistic Supremacy \n\nAnd of course, you will always have the option to challenge players to duels. These duels will transport your opponent and yourself to an instanced arena, with your standard platforms and ladders. The idea is that you can use the environment to your advantage to perform strategic retreats or create specific set-ups for your combos.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------\n\n# Key Challenges\n\n1. Skill Tree - The skill tree will be ridiculously robust and deep, and setting up the conditions alone will drive developers made. How do I register if a hit has occurred just after a block? How will I determine if a player has killed an enemy who has done magic damage to them?\n2. Condition Problems and Farming - Even with the attempt to colour the skill tree with a facade of randomized rewards, I am absolutely certain someone out there will farm and figure out how to unlock every damned skill in the tree in an attempt to be some sort of god.\n3. Starting Small - How would I even begin to take my idea from a thought in my head to a playable demo? Is the idea I have even feasible? \n4. Balanced Combat - A common complaint once magic is brought into the picture is that mages are OP. So the introduction of anti-magic skills will be necessary, yet the flexibility of magic should be preserved as a boon to that particular playstyle. Balancing will be incredibly difficult.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------\n\nWow, my thoughts snowballed as I wrote this post. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments on this daydream of mine! At the very least, I hope it was an enjoyable read for you, or perhaps this may have sparked an idea of your own!"

f9jqrj,Earthbound/undertale Style game but in VR,"Imagine an Earthbound style RPG but instead of the top down view it's a first person view in VR. The Overworld would be filled with mini games and the character interaction so you don't get bored while walking around you can equip different weapons and armor and things like that check your stats that kind of thing. The battle system would be something like beat saber where you dodge block and make certain poses to avoid attacks. To attack you have to select attack on the UI that appears in front of you.( your other options would be,  Bag, run, etc. That kind of stuff)  When you attack you will have to select the attack you want to use and do the hand sign for it in hardmode it might not even show you you'll just have to do it yourself  IDK that's the basic just of the game. Thanks for reading."
f9j2g4,"A tank upgrade/progression that takes place in early 20th century (1914) or late 19th century (1896), alternative Earth","This idea takes inspiration from a flash game called [armored warfare 1917], which is a tank upgrade game, set in the first world war.\n\nThe game takes place somewhere in the between the years in the title, where at that time a great war had begun, called The Grand War (yeah, very creative) in an AU earth with slightly different geography (differently shaped land). All major countries are at war and even some smaller ones too, to gain some land or such. As a bit expected, most smaller countries are wiped out by the major ones.\n\nYou are a soldier in one of those smaller countries called Dogerland (look it up, btw not there like it was on earth, on a mainland), a highly scientific country at that time, and Dogerland is already mostly invaded by other smaller countries and a major one attacking them.\n\nYou are chosen to be the first tank operator because of your mechanical knowledge and are paired with an artillery soldier for the weapons on the tank.\n\nBecause of limited materials, the very first few tanks are made of wood and are equipped with bike wheels, a simple motor, a small machine gun and a simple mortar.\n\nIt's bad, but gets the job done, and enough to fight with the other smaller country right next to yours, called Slalom. So you set way in your wooden tank and fight.\n\nControls are similar as [armored warfare 1917].\n\nAs you progress through the levels and upgrade your wooden tank with materials you've earned, you managed to take back Dogerland with other similar tanks. Then you'll progress to the next part/chapter, where you now actually invade Slalom.\n\nBecause of the bigger availablility of materials, the tanks now are more like actual tanks, but more like armored cars. With new featured to be again upgraded and more levels and terrains to complete, you continue.\n\nThe game ends, when you now have an actual tank and now being the commander of your tank fleet, have invaded a major country, finaly ending the war.\n\nThe idea is a bit rough, cuz I'm writing this at midnight, on a phone and as a unpolished idea.\n\nPlease give your ideas and if anyone decides to make it or at least make art for it, I'd like to see it."
f9gi6m,Stealth/logic game inspired by Japanese pop culture.,"Hi!  \nI am not very familiar with Japanese pop culture or what people there believe or do on a daily basis but I have noticed that there might be a common trend for teenagers to have fun with the ouija board. And that urban legends about kids that committed suicide might be common too.   \nSo... the idea is the pretty easy party of kids decide to lock themselves in school after classes and have fun with the ouija board. But unfortunately, they really summer vengeful ghost. Kids run away all in different directions and you as one of them have to hide too.   \nYour job is to walk around the school to save your friends and find clues on how to unsummon ghost. You walk around and find clues about who it was and what happened. Eventually, you notice that ghost was a victim of cruelty and your friends might be involved. So you have to decide to save them or let ghosts have their vengeance.   \n\n\nThe game would be much like old series like **Hunting Grounds** where you barely can fight and mostly hide from danger.  \n\n\nI think it would be easy to make because the environment would be simple and repetitive (school) and characters don't have to be really fancy (with no offence to Japanese people but it's common to have uniforms for schools right? That means that cloth design is little easier) No fighting makes it easier. It deserves a good story and good characters thou. Would attract fans of anime."
f9dvni,The Daycare [Horror],"The game starts with found footage, a live-action video of a parent filming their kids at a daycare (or several parents filming each of their kids, and asking about their dreams or what they want to be when they grow up). The setup of this live-action sequence is to get the viewer attached to the kids. In each of the videos, the Babysitter can be seen, but she looks sick in every video. Sort of depressed, not feeling well, sort of look. She never looks at the camera, and looks through people when looking at them.\n\nCut to down the street of the daycare, 20 years later. Present day. You're now vieing a game cutscene. Two parents are driving and talking in a somber manner about their child who was killed by the babysitter. In fact, all of the children were. The camera pans to the backseat where an empty carseat still sits. They drive by the daycare, which has since been abandoned, but they slow down and look at each other. They pull into the daycare.\n\nYou are given the choice between being male or female. This determines who goes into the daycare. The player enters the daycare alone, equipped with a flashlight. The place is severely falling apart, and much bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. After a short tutorial of how to move, jump, and introducing your goal of picking up child's drawing, the player encounters The Babysitter, which sits dead and motionless in a chair in her room. She looks dead, rotting, but she still has a blank stare that looks past you. You learn that she doesn't move until 60 seconds after you find her and already started looking for pages. You'll then hear footsteps constantly, and the babysitter will be following you. The more pages you grab, the faster she gets, but she has to walk around obstacles, and take longer paths to reach you sometimes.\n\nIf she reaches you, there will be a 1-3 second delay, and perhaps the footsteps will get louder to indicate she's right behind you, but it cuts to a jumpscare of her catching you. Game over, start the game over, leaving off right after where you first encountered the babysitter.\n\nIf the player is skilled enough to collect all the drawings, the babysitter catches up to you, but instead of a game over, she just stares at you, enter cutscene mode. The player hears a child ask ""mommy?"" (or ""daddy,"" depending on gender chosen) The player reaches out for the child, who appears alive. noticing that their own hands and arms are decayed and falling apart. They look into a mirror and they appear dead and grotesque like the babysitter. They scream.\n\nThe scream lasts a long time. The credits roll during this sequence. The camera fades and pans up out of the daycare. The parent waiting in the car hears the screams, gets out of the car, and runs into the daycare. New Game Plus begins, where you are now playing as the other gender.\n\nThe game proceeds the same, from tutorial, to encounter, to collecting the drawings. Only this time, the kids are walking around the daycare now too, each appearing with a different mode of death. If the child sees you, they scream, alerting the babysitter early, or if the babysitter is already after you, she speeds up as if you picked up another drawing. The speed at which they scream varies. They could also be sitting on the ground instead of walking. One of the kids is headless, and instead of alerting the babysitter by screaming, will run to her instead. \n\nIf you are successful in picking up the last page, the babysitter stops and stares once again, but then disappears. The other parent is a walking corpse. The child, who is also dead, holds their hand. The player character screams and cries as they reach out for him/her, their hands are decayed as they cover their face. Cut to black. The crying continues briefly. Credits roll again with music over them this time.\n\nAfter the credits, there is a cutscene showing the parents car getting towed.\n\nCut to black, fade to main menu."
f9dexu,"[OC] The Last Citedel . Horror Action. In an attempt to find work to leave the concentration camp &gt; In the beginning, I conceived this as a game. But mb can make a series of this.","I apologize for my English and rather you miss this post ... I had an idea for the game. Which could be a series.\n\nThis is the story of a dreamer. He came to the city with dreams and hopes. But the reality is cruel. When he found the important things for themselves. Sometimes this incident on the excavations. The plot is tied to the main character and his friends.Changes will check on the city where it all happens.\n\n At the beginning of our history, this guy arrives in the city of his dreams. And he thinks it's the best thing that has happened in his life. And so it is. Friends,girlfriend. the work of which he dreamed. But not all so simple. And everything in this life has a price.\n\nDuring excavations in the castle, we find a strange room with a mirror. The first who discovered her, we will also be ourselves. In this room there will be a small collapse after which we will go to the hospital. This is the point where the light changes in history.\n\n(\n\nI just did not write that we left the house in search of adventure and to escape from the circumstances. This event also made us stay in the city where we ran away. But earlier we had to return home.\n\n)\n\nIf you are beginning to envy him. That you're wasting it. Not all so rosy as it seems. The trip was also not accepted by all. And when our heroes have to because of some events back home and what happens is that our world has turned.\n\nTo be engaged in favorite business well. But our world is cruel. Yes, and to explore what was studied the length and breadth not rewarding business. But ... By coincidence of luck. Or rather, on the fatal failure of our hero finds an unexplored corner in the citadel. This is the beginning and the end point is not the return of our hero. They begin to happen strange things. Friends character change. The city is changing with them. Once paradise turns into a dry desert. And many do not pay attention to it. They think that it was, or should be. And because of this, our hero begins to suffer more and more getting into different situations with ""new"" friends.\n\n📷\n\nThe Citedel\n\nBut do not think that we will be unarmed all the time.  At key moments in the story, we will always find the right thing at hand.  Is it a coincidence? These moments are the starting point for the further significant development of the plot. These are moments of remembrance, and misunderstanding of why everything happens this way.  Also at these intervals, you can explore the available locations of the city to get some information.  There may also be skirmishes at these points. But they will no longer be so brightly perceived by our hero.\n\nThese moments are the point of departure for the further significant development of the plot. These are moments of remembrance, and misunderstanding of why everything happens this way. Also at these intervals we explore the city. We observe changes. And notice that ... Does it have to be like this?  The light should not go out, Where did those people go? they were just there. They will no longer be so brightly perceived by our hero.\n\nWell, I’ll reveal something else from the plot ...\n\nQuestion. That is, they forgot or did not notice the murdered? Answer. This is the disappearance of a person both from memory and from all places of photographs and other things.\n\nAnd here again, the display plays a major role. In the beginning, the whole world plays with colors. Then it’s more noir. Paints are dark with some shades. The main plot references.\n\nQuestion. Where people disappear. Answer. During the events with ""friends"" not one civilian was injured.\n\n📷\n\nThe Hall\n\nAlthough the main events will occur in the citadel. We will spend time in the city where there will be plot twists. Loss of memory of friends and referrals to friends. Each person took a place in the life of our hero. Both people and objects will show changes.\n\nAs you can see in my first screenshot. In the corridor between air and earth. The corridor will pass.\n\nIt will be a battle between our hero and Max. In the dark corridor I saw him. I tried to shout him and ran to him. He stood with his back to me. When he turned, an incomprehensible force threw me back. On the edge of the corridor, streaks of fire began to sprout. My friend has become different. He was enveloped in an aura of fire. When I tried to turn to him again, the corridor shuddered and began to crumble after the cry of a friend.\n\nYes, I also wanted to tie all the moments tied to the elements. Associate with the harmony of the elements and their resonance.\n\nStart at the end. We began our story when we found a strange room with a mirror. The mirror does not just play a major role. And here will be the last battle in the hall. A dramatic battle with the girl we love .\n\nThe girl worked in a flower shop. This gave her the look in which she appeared before the hero. And how should each drama have to kill her by freeing herself from the curse?\n\nOn this our sad story probably could have ended. After all, usually. When all battles are completed the story ends. But. Our hero saw a reflection in the mirror that attracted his attention.\n\nWe are upset by the loss of friends. Our hero sees his reflection in the mirror. And our reflection begins to separate from the mirror and leaves it. Our mirror double asks the hero. Who is to blame for everything? Can everything be fixed? Or maybe they are all alive ...? he says grinning. Events related to friends appear in memory. The hero, while remembering, is even more desperate. And blames himself. He says how they can be alive if he killed them all. And events with the fight against ""friends"" appear. Mirroring double interrupting our hero says that everything can be fixed.\n\nThe hero turns his eyes to the double who begins to disappear before his eyes. The hero, not understanding what is happening, begins to try to grab hold of the smoke from the mirror clone with his hands. Now the speech of the double is filling the whole hall. The main essence of speech. Is he ready to sacrifice his life for his friends. The hero claims to be ready for anything. And the clone from the mirror appears again with a smile on his face. In his hands he grips the hero's torn heart. The hero in these fractions of seconds tries to shout NO! He does not understand what happened. We hear the sounds of the heartbeat begin to fall silent ...\n\nWell, all the movie guys ended the credits light went out. And you go and eat the popcorn back. Is it just that? We hear that ...\n\nAgain we are hear heartbeat\n\nI'm trying to find work to leave the concentration camp. So I come up with different stories in the hope that I will be lucky. Somehow I can get out of the bloody concentration camp from the terrorists that they are killing us here. The financial pyramid just sucks us to the last drop of blood. Terrorism is the same disease as cancer or another deadly disease. I just offer my ideas. In the hope that suddenly it will be possible to remove the series from this. And it will bring me money. I can get out of the concentration camp. I will have food, a house, medical assistance will be provided ... Maybe sometime I will learn to drive a car. I can live a normal life. Which you can only dream of in a concentration camp ... Where you can not speak against terrorists and words.\n\nReady to learn. To the best of their abilities. I just do not want to be in a concentration camp with terrorists. I’m scared that they even learn that I said something against them, because this persecution continues. And they can kill anyone who is against corruption. Who is telling the truth. They just brainwash everyone using people as they please. That terrorism, that coronavirus is a disease that must be eradicated.\n\nI just want to find a job related to games. I'm trying to find a way to evacuate from a concentration camp.\n\nI honestly don’t know how to escape from this terrible place. I thought to apply for i589, but this must be checked out first.\n\nAnd I don’t even know how to submit this form from the concentration camp. All examples are only when you are in America.\n\nI do not want to live in the world of the financial pyramid of terrorists. There is no future in it. No life. Even a family cannot be created and maintained.\n\nAfter all, these are constant threats to life emanating from terrorists."

bq3t7w,I need a setting / story for a Claymation Metroidvania,"I’m a couple months into development of a Metroidvania that’s being made entirely out of clay. In this Will Vinton inspired game, the player controls various clay creatures, each with with different abilities. In an almost Kirby-like fashion, to gain new abilities you abandon your current form and absorb an enemy to take over their form. \n\nI have the visual style and the game mechanics all working to a level I’m happy with, but I’m struggling with a setting and character motivation. Some sort of elevator pitch for where the character is and why they are doing what they are doing.  As examples, this is how I would summarize other similar games:\n\nMetroid: bounty hunter exterminating the last of a dangerous creature\n\nShadow Complex: investigating / escaping from a secret underground military complex\n\nSong of the Deep: exploring the ocean in a submarine in search of your father\n\nHollow Knight: exploring a dying world of bugs in search of the source of corruption"
bpxrso,The Blitz and the Broomrider,"This game will be a Diesel-punk shooter about defending a country form areal siege as  a cute anime broomstick riding witch.

Out of desperation the government implores the local witch community to defend their skies. In movie terms ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" meets ""The Battle of Britain.""\n\nGame play would be split into two modes: intercept and fight. \n\nWhile in Intercept mode the player sees a country map with enemy contacts approaching major cities. They use this view to navigate their broom stick riding witch to intercept the enemy contacts or return to base to restock on mana and health.\n\nIf the player intercepts an enemy  contact the game will switch to fight mode. In this mode the game works  like a twin-stick shooter where the player guided the direction of  travel and direction of attack while launching various offensive spells  at the enemy bombers and fighters.\n\nGame play sessions would last the length of a day in the game world with waves of  bombers being launched in the morning  and returning to their bases  off map in the evening. The player's saved games would be a multi day air campaign where the damage done by the enemy bombers and the damage done by the player to the enemy bombers add up until one side sues for  peace."

bprfhx,A real-time 4X game about colonising new planets,"**Core Idea**\n\nThe core idea of this game is that you are part of an ever-expanding empire and have been tasked colonising a new empire for the continued growth of the empire. \n\n**Concept** \n\nThe player would start by choosing what empire they want to ally with for their new game. You could have empires with goals ranging from military, economic, scientific, manufacturing, trade, and environmental. The goals would range as follows: \n\n* Military empires want you to first establish yourself as a forward-operating base, and then as a fully established military production planet. \n* Economic empires want you to establish strong economies by exploiting natural resources and turning them into saleable goods to then trade with manufacturing empires. \n* Scientific empires want you to establish centres of discovery and learning to create 'scientific patents' which are then traded with other empires and used to improve your own empire. \n* Manufacturing empires want you to build a strong economy by importing primary products and producing high-end products to sell on to other empires. \n* Trade empires want you to create planets based on the turnover of products from one empire to the other - buying low from some empires and selling high to others. \n* Environmental empires want you to build a strong empire focused on creating a strong economy through environmental tourism and scientific research. \n\nEach empire would have to rely on other empires in order to produce their own goods and keep their economies strong. Some of the trading options - which will make up the core of the game - will be detailed below. \n\n* Military planets need to import production goods, primary goods, and patents. They export military goods.\n* Economic planets would need to import production goods, military goods, and patents. They export primary goods and fuel. \n* Scientific planets would need to import production goods, military goods, and primary products. They export scientific patents. Patents are different in that they can only be sold once to each empire but generate strong passive income. The more patents a scientific planet produces, the higher their passive income. \n* Manufacturing planets need to import primary goods, military goods, and patents. They export production goods. \n* Trade planets import and export all goods, taking what they need from imported goods. \n* Environmental planets are the most challenging. They must import all goods they don't otherwise produce, but generate a passive income (similar to science planets) from a steady stream of tourism based on their tourism index (a mechanic based on their growth).\n\nWhile any planet can produce any goods, which helps them overcome their native consumption, they are far superior at producing goods for which they are inclined from their empire choice. The difference between, say, an economic empire and a manufacturing empire is that an economic empire can produce fuel and primary goods with around 10 times the efficiency (goods/minute) than a manufacturing empire could. This makes trade a core mechanic in the game as a single planet cannot simply produce all needed goods, instead profoundly encouraging specialisation over generalisation. \n\nEach class of goods have 4 subclasses, as specified below: \n\n* Primary goods: Fuel, food, natural products (like wood and glass), and mined products (like oil and metal)\n* Military goods: Civilian ships, military ships, large (ship-based) weapons, and small weapons. \n* Production goods: Consumer goods, high-tech goods, industrial goods, and military goods. \n\nWhen in the game, the player would see their planet laid out in hexagons, each with an associated marker for things that can be produced there. They will need to first place a city on an ideal location and build from there. Once placed, population builds passively and can be 'spent' to create new cities. From the new cities, the player can place satellite cities on exploitable resources in order to exploit them. Once built, cities and their satellites can be upgraded for money to increase their production. Cities have needs that must be filled to keep their population growing strongly and to keep happiness high. A city that is lacking in a particular good will find their happiness and growth declining steadily until that need is filled. The player will need to ensure that one of their satellite cities are a spaceport to begin trading and players can choose which empire to buy which goods from and sell which goods to based on a constantly-updating graph showing the selling and buying prices for each good. Various disasters can affect prices, as well as how much supply (both from the planet and from automatically generated market forces) is in each empire's market. Players will have to keep an eye on the trade graphs to ensure they are constantly getting the most money for their products and are buying at lower prices. Players can hold a significant stock of each item, and so can withdraw purchasing or selling until more favourable trading conditions arrive to the market. Since any of the production empires can sell to any other empires, it will likely be favourable for them to switch on occasion to take up new opportunities in the market.\n\nAs the planet grows, the player will need to create new cities and keep them upgraded and functioning. A lot of this is unlocked with research - although, the player can purchase patents which give them unique unlocks for their cities and can bring about better production. \n\nThis is about all I have right now, but I may add more as I think of it. I hope it wasn't too long a post, lol."
bpr9d4,Game that breaks 4th wall like Undertale?,"I really love Undertale. I love how it makes you truly connect with the characters and feel something towards them, so it’s genuinely upsetting when things happen to them. I also love how Undertale eerily breaks the 4th wall in ways that sent a shiver down my spine a few times. \n\nThere are so few games like this, so I want to make one that has those components, and I am a developer. Though of course I want it to be unique and different from Undertale still.\n\nProblem is, I can’t think of any good ideas. I can’t think of a good story to serve as the foundation of my game. All I know is that I want it to break the 4th wall and have a few or all of the characters be aware at some point that they are in a video game and being controlled. I also want a story that would make the player connect with the characters, possibly having multiple endings and plot twists.\n\nAny ideas or inspiration? Any storyline ideas that I can work with?

bpokbp,Fresh RPG Combat,"Hey! I am in the designing stages of a game using Unreal Engine with a small team. I have a story I'm quite happy with but the main issue is I want to add some freshness to the combat system. My most enjoyable combat experience in an RPG game has to be Dark Souls. However, it really seems like many other people feel the same way. Lots of games are taking the Dark Souls approach such as the indie game ""Ashen"" and I feel like it's going to start being difficult to stand out in any way, especially when huge games such as Sekiro are being released with brilliant teams. I know I want to do something similar to the combat system in Dark Souls or the Witcher 3. However, I am trying to figure out how to give the combat system a creative and fresh feeling. Does anyone have any suggestions? Some ideas I have thought of is a disarm mechanic, or an option to cancel animations if you drop the weapon you are currently holding. For example, a heavy attack with a large sword could be canceled if necessary to protect oneself if the user drops the weapon. These aren't fantastic ideas, but I'd love to hear what you guys have to say on the topic."

I don't want to take anybody's time so please don't read this all unless you can afford it. \n\n\nThis idea is inspired by two things: \n- Isekai anime (where protagonist is put into a robust game world)\n- Minecraft factions servers (players forming guilds and collecting resources to control land)\n\n\nIn Isekai, NPCs are portrayed as sentient beings with their own free will. They handle everything from issuing quests to running government. So I thought ""what better way to make players feel like they're living a second life than to replace the function of NPCs in a sandbox game with players?""\n\nI come from a minecraft background so I know that 50-player servers can get pretty intimate and you make friends with the regulars pretty quickly. The problem with minecraft town/faction servers is that the game doesn't have dedicated mechanics to let players create towns/factions (it's all done through server-side plugins and text commands) AND there is no motivational structure in place for players to create a robust world similar to Isekais. \n\nInstead, faction recruiting is usually done through spamming global chat instead of it happening through encounters between players in the world. Everybody is quick to kill on sight and factions have no incentive to work together other than to defeat a rival faction. Factions have no incentives to become rivals in the first place other than ""that's the gamemode"". Within a faction, you can't damage your own teammates, you can't leave a faction without everybody being able to know, and you typically literally can't step foot in another faction's territory. Finally, a player can survive perfectly on their own. There are more problems with minecraft factions that prevent an organic world from developing, but I wanted to keep this brief.\n\nMy dream is a small 150-player fantasy world with perma-death, AI enemies, pvp always enabled, a leaderboard, and a player gameplay ecosystem (the rest of the post will explain what this is).\n\nTo get more powerful, some will spawn kill noobs, betray, scam each other, and do other vile acts using the same motive that people in minecraft factions use to kill on sight. They'll naturally need to do this to reach the top of the wealth leaderboard that everyone sees in loading screens and everywhere else we can possibly put it. &lt;-- this is the big obvious goal to help players who can't find their own goal. \n\nThe world will be brutal: Food, water, and shelter will be nececary to survive. Weather and biome will drastically affect what resources can be grinded for and what AI enemies will spawn. The key is that different classes will craft, collect, and resist the elements in EXTREMELY varrying levels of efficiency. &lt;-- an incentive for players to not kill each other on sight and to trade with each other. Surviving without taking advantage of another player will be comparable to playing Don't Starve in its highest difficulty.\n\nEventually, someone's gonna realize that they'll stop dying if they work together. And they'll defend each other's lives from the evil players and horrors of the world... in PERMA-DEATH. The intensity of every encounter with a player or  monster will be multiplied by the chance of it being their last. Not just the fear of death, the fear of not being able to play with the new friends they just made. And collecting resources will be loomed by the suspense of not finding enough. \n\nFor enhanced immersion: all chat will be local unless the player has an item or skill capable of letting them use global chat (like a passive communication spell or crystal ball).\n\nTo further incentivize player cooperation, everybody will have something that cannot be stolen on death, their skills. A player's skill tree can gain the nodes of skills that other players have used near them after a while. This way, factions can be notorious for having signature skills (ex: everybody in that faction is good at harvesting wood) if they have enough active players who, through class choice, usage choice, or through the slight randomization in player's initial skill trees, have exposed their teammates to their skills (ex: like woodcutting). Learning is faster when players are outside of combat, not in danger, in good health, near training dummies (a craftable item) and looking at the teaching player. This way, players can teach one another skills as a bargaining token or to increase the survivability of their teammates and, thus, their own survivability. \n\nNaturally players will build towns to be near one another. Monsters will attack locations with an increasing number of players. They, unlike in minecraft, can all break buildings (which are nececary to survive the elements), steal resources, and trample farmland. Since they threaten everybody's survival, it makes sense for players to build defences and have disputes over who invests the resources to do so. \n\nThe monsters who invade won't be random. They'll come out of the nearest dungeons or dens and anything added to their inventory will stay in it if they escape players. This gives players an incentive to go on their own quests for reasons other than loot. And to destroy a den, a player must break their nest. The nest is a peaceable item that lets monsters spawn and places itself if left on the ground...\n\nSome defences (that are indented to be used to defend towns) and endgame items will require copious amounts of resources to produce. This means that, if a town wants to get more powerful, it will be unsustainable to keep everybody's finances separate. This is where creating a faction comes in. One purpose of factions is to make it easy for players to have a small government. Within a faction, the leader can assign ranks and privileges to those ranks like a simplified discord. A faction can have its own spot in the leaderboard alongside solo players as long as it's treasury has been marked as a container somewhere in the world. There is no official ""territory"" but players can decide what territory they consider theirs when getting into disputes with other factions. To mark places for various reasons, they'll need to craft decorative items like banners. And a faction is the only way to achieve long-distance communication without an item or skill via the faction info screen. It can written by the leader and only viewed by members of a faction. What'll probably happen is that some form of rules and procedures will be written on the info screen.\n\nWith so many incentives to work together, would anybody ever play evily? I think loads would. It's just human nature to want to do something like that in a hardcore environment and the problem is magnified by the ""no real consequences"" nature of playing a videogame.\n\nEven if a server evolves into well-established towns and cities, this would only make being a villainous player more aluring because there wouldnt be the immediate need for survival.\n\nImagine the stories that could come from this game:\n   - evil organizations trying to take over towns.\n   - heists.\n   - saving noobs from spawn-killers to increase your faction's population.\n   - going into an enemy base, stealing their nests from storage, and planting them inside their own headquarters.\n   - saving a nearby town from monster attacks and putting them in your debt.\n   - a mobile faction is created that lures its lower-ranking members into a false sense of security before killing them, a scam.\n   - entering a tavern to regenerate health and mana for a low price while joking with your party about the raid you were just on.\n   - owning a potion store and haggling with a customer.\n   - getting into disagreements within your faction and with other factions.\n   - encountering a player while fighting for your (perma-death) life in a challenging boss battle and becoming friends afterwards\n\nDoes this sound like an Isekai to you? This game could probably be made within the same time span and amount of content as current minecraft + a few mods.\n\nNone of these stories will happen as a part of a campaign. They'll naturally arise from a player ecosystem and will feel more real, memorable, and special than any single player experience could possibly be.\n\nI haven't touched on combat or other fantasy elements because those aren't the core of what's unique about this idea. Obviously, I'd like an innovative efficient combat system but the game could even work with the pathetic  minecraft combat. Whats equally important is that players have things to do other than combat so they have something to fight for and to breed stories that aren't entirely related to death. Ex: minecraft has unpractical stuff like redstone, cakes, and minecarts. This is a nececary sacrifice to making it feel like a world and not a game. note: this is foremostly a fantasy RPG, NOT a casual sandbox.\n\n\nI hope you see the potential in this game and steal the idea for yourself (if u do, pls say so I can get excited). I'm in love with it if you couldn't tell. \n\n\nOther dreams I have of what could happen in this game with a little more content and a lot of player actions:\n   -  Someone finds a relic that summons a dragon with their name. It ravages towns and players share information to track it and stop it. \n   - A high level player casts a spell to prevent player deaths in a specific area. This area is now used by players for risk-free pvp. Someone, during a tournament, breaks the spell. Who did it?\n   - There is a fountain that can resurrect dead players for a cost but it's in an opposing faction's territory. Your faction wants to resurrect it's leader but there are members who would prefer to assign a new one."

bpjtul,Terran Pexeso - Game idea inspired by dream,"So i woke up with strange dream: It seemed that after death, all people reunite with God to play a game called Terran Pexeso, it was some kind of pexeso based on Earth. The idea was pretty important for Rosencrucian and Templar Knights, they had their own ideas about Terran pexeso. I feeled like it has to do something with verses in bible about Haven Jerusalem, the haven version of real world places is pretty common trope among religion. So it seemed to me that it is something like people with God play this to create new world and enjoy the creation. This was dream... But after that I had some idea for games based on pexeso, which are not really related to the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nexeso game mechanics:\n\nSo basicaly you play this game same as pexeso, but instead of taking the pair, if you discover one, you just mark it with token. When turning the cards, one of the card must be neighboring the other card you have marked. There is one aditional pair, those two just determine starting position of both players. So both players are turning cards trying to found pair, but they really can turn and mark such pair of card, that at least one of card is neigboring your allready marked card. Your goal is to capture more cards than your opponent, but you need to take care to not to get surounded. You can mix the rules with rules of go.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go\_(game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))  Your goal and point count in the end is same, but you take pair in the way written above. Alternatively, you can mix game with tic tac toe. Ït is abstract strategic game that includes memory and also chalanges you in strategy of observing your oponent and revealing your position. When you uncover card that neighbours you, your opponent also see it."
bpj727,Colorful 4D shooting game.,"So the game is pretty basic, it is just normal shooting game, but it is 4D. Position of object inside 4th dimension is determinded by its color. The 4th dimension is circular, as color space. Player can move in color dimension by changing color by wheel on mouse. Basically, you can not go through object of same color as you, if there is blue wall, you can go through if you are blue. The wall can go gradiently from one color to another as it is diagonal. Alternatively mouse wheel does not determine your position in color dimension but rather your orientation same as mouse is used for turning. You need to coordinate movement of mouse and mouse wheel to determine overall orientation in 4d space. Still you can see your color to know your position in color dimension. I See most players would not understand this, but you really dont need to understand this, you just need to intuitively know how to use it, and you would know, as it is same, as you use for movement in 3d games but you have aditional control on mouse wheel. Also all colors are kind of transparent, you can see through things, but if things are of such position in 4d space, that you should not be able to see it behind, than the thing is not to be seen behind. Whole game is set in labyrinth and is multiplayer."
bp9sir,A pirate based MMO.,"A pirate based MMO where you work to upgrade a ship. Your ship can come in a variety of types such as:\nGunboats\nSloops\nFrigates\nGalleons\nAnd more. \nYou'll start off with a gunboat, but by attacking AI ships, you can commandeer it, and proceed to upgrade it with materials obtained by farming AI ships, or sinking other players.\nEach ship type will fill a different role in both PVE and PVP. For example, a Galleon is a good choice for players who prefer firepower at a cost of speed, and Sloops will be the ship of choice who players who like to speed along.\nThere could be land focused PVP with guns and swords, and different islands to explore, and world events.\nSinking will cause you to lose any cargo on board. Cargo can be stowed in towns and from there can be used for upgrades. This will allow players to not lose much if they don't wish to PVP.\nI have much more ideas. If you're interested, dm me!"
bp85su,Execute your game idea in Dreams(tm),"Dreams is a title for the PS4 that’s currently in early access. It’s like the game version of unity (minus a few small things), except a lot easier to use. It’s comparable to project spark, except a lot more complex/customizable and not as shitty. \n\nDreams is a great way to make either a simple prototype of your game or make the entire thing from start to finish, whatever you’re up for. Plus you don’t have to worry about making your own assets and models as there is a huge library of them in game all made by other users.\n\nI thought you all should know if this title as it can be a great tool for mapping out your ideas and bringing them to reality!"
bp4zzs,Island Experiment,"Hi guys. I know that this is a place to post game ideas and mine is far from a good idea. This idea I have put forth is indeed a very large idea and could take a long time to complete if done in the set idea i have. So if you can think of something to narrow this scale let me know too. The game is similar to a small MMO. I'm thinking more like 15-20 people max per playthrough. But I would appreciate if you have any criticism to not say ""This part is a bad idea"" but instead ""this part could be this instead of this"". Thank you all and I hope you like this idea.\n\nPitch for game - We have all had the thought of how you could survive stranded on an island. Or what you would do if you and your buddies were stranded. Well in Island Experiment (actual name pending) you can try all of these ideas or come up with a whole new idea. Build an all for one and one for all society or every-man-for-himself chaotic world. The choice is not only yours but your other survivors as well.\n\nTL:DR - A game with a mixture of minecraft's diversity of creativity and building and the sims diversity of becoming who you want to be all in the context of being stranded on an island and having to create a new civilization. Its multiplayer so you have to work together to make everything work. \n\nIn this game you and several other people find yourself stranded on an island with no known hope of rescue. You must all work together to survive. But the catch is that you have the potential to do many things: create a fully functional  civilization, find a way off the island, survive until rescue comes(if it does), or kill off everyone so that you can take control of the islands many treasures and resources. But beware. Those same goals you have are the same ones everyone else has. Do you work together to a common goal or work apart and try to dominate the island as your own. \n\nKey features for the game would include: \nMultiple island versons. You may have an island with limited resources and space or an island with an endless supply of everything you need. \n\nSome islands have extreme climates. Some are pure tropical. \n\nDangerous creatures inhabit the islands. Some are giant like Godzilla. Others could be a whole other tribe of cannibals. But all have a unique set of abilities that make surviving on the island difficult. For instance, there is only one single Kaiju on the island, but one sweep of its fire breath can wipe out your entire community you built. Do you find a way to kill the beast or create a living that conforms the creatures lifestyle. Such as living solely underground. \n\nPast the island part you yourself have unique traits. Start off as a custom character or a random character with different skill sets. You may be the guy who is good at tracking and finding food, or be the guy who has the ability to create machines to make life easier. One could go without the other but would in the case you don't make it off the island you may need that person. You must decide how you want to live. \n\nIt was mentioned earlier but to extend on it some more, each playthrough has a different story so to say. Maybe you were on a ship that sunk or a plane that crashed or maybe something even more strange lead you to this island. Maybe the way off is waiting for a rescue. Maybe getting off is building a raft because the island you are on is not that far from actual civilization. But you and everyone else wont know. That is what you must figure out yourself. Maybe none of those things happen and you eventually all die off... or procreate and build a whole new society. \n\nAll in all it would be a vast game. And more than likely it would be a long extensive game. Or even just a simple mod and map for minecraft that does it all idk. In this age of games that are all multiplayer and quick 10-15 minute matches I dont even know if it would sell. \n\nThoughts and comments please. Or even suggestions or edits to the game."

boxbcl,Mortal Coil - 4 Player RTS with trading and tower defence,"***Mortal Coil***\n \nAnother Demon Door has opened inside the continent, and the Foresworn council send 4 mortals to defend the zone and contain the invasion, and ultimately locate and destroy the demon door. The gameplay utilizes isometric (ish) camera position, Diablo style combat with close area of effect melee weapons, ranged weapons firing arcing projectiles, destructive and control magic and defensive and support style magic.\n\nOutside of combat it is up to the mortals to build and maintain a defensive garrison that will house and aid the zone’s refugees, they will construct their garrison by building a fort, which creates an area of influence which permits building inside, this area of influence will grow with more refugees and garrison strength. This garrison will also hold the Mortals profession specific building, which will allow each mortal to upgrade their skills, craft equipment and consumables, or create components from reagents to be utilized in the various crafting interactions. (Like black and white style of building influence)\n\nLeading the demonic invasion is an immortal of death incarnate, who spearheads the invasion as the AI sends swarms of demons to destroy the mortals. They build unit producing buildings which feed of natural resources and solidify a foothold into the continent. This death incarnate has the goal of destroying the 4 other players and finally their fort, whilst also defending their demon door (which the players must find and destroy to beat the game)\n\n**Mortal Classes**\n\nMortals have 4 different classes to choose, they may all be played at once as a lot of interesting interactions can develop between each class. (This can be managed by a matchmaking to pair people who want to play a certain class)\nEach class has a profession that goes hand in hand with their class, and can benefit other mortals as well as their garrison. (It may become impossible to progress without another classes progression helping you - ie, blacksmith learning how to make a certain rare metal arrowhead before the woodworker can fletch their arrows - and the woodworker having the correct wood.\n\nWarrior - Blacksmith\nSword wielding, focused on using threat and stamina to draw monsters into him, soaking damage for his teammates and inflicting wide area of effect damage through heavy melee strikes. Great at charging into the fray and leaping into a vangard to spearhead assaults. Blacksmith profession will see the player gather ore, jewels and minerals from ore deposits or rock veins, which will require him to journey into caves and mines to find ore. The blacksmith will create the Forge, allowing him to build blacksmithing equipment to purify, alloy metal and create ingots, which are then used to hammer into sword edges, tool heads, nails, armor etc. etc…\n\nSorcerer - Cartography\nCombat is focused entirely on using magic spells to inflict damage in both area of effect spells and single target high damage output - They have little defensive ability and use evasive tactics to confuse and escape enemies or render themselves unable to be attacked. Mesmer like abilities will help with this tactic. Their profession is focused on exploring the map - setting up garrison waypoints using their powerful portal magic when they find areas of interest on the map. They study the world to find dungeons and relics that will aid the travellers. They can use terrain shifting magic to reveal mines or perhaps hidden areas - or setup defences in any garrison or inside the travellers base. The Sorcerer can craft the Wayfinder building which will provide points for players to use the portals the sorcerer sets up, by upgrading they can create more portal points.\n\nRanger - Woodworker\nCombat is focused also on ranged attacks, primarily single target damage. They are the most powerful at bringing down large foes as they can disable and kite using their wide array of arrows which each serve different purpose. They use traps and explosives to bait and control the fighting arena as well as crowd control techniques. Their profession of woodworking is focused on using different types of wood to either fletch bows, arrow shafts, staff handles, tool handles - also crafting different furniture to help the base - such as chests, work benches, beds for houses, and other vanity items which increase the value of the household and can attract higher value citizens. They require wood for all their crafting so rely heavily on the Sorcerer to find forests and setting up garrisons to allow them to bring back valuable wood they so desperately need. They can also craft defensive traps and turrets using their wood such as catapults or ballistae turrets or even static defences such as spikes or deadfall and pitfall traps\n\nDruid - Herbalism\nCombat for the druid is focused on healing and enhancing their allies - the use ancient magic to call upon the world around them to mend the wounds of their allies, as well as providing bonus enhancements to their damage or defence. They have a high skill cap to play because they rely on positioning heavily as their spells seldom have much range to them. They do have some offensive abilities that revolve around poison darts using various plants.\n\nTheir profession is that of Herbalism, planting herbs and crops that they will use to craft powerful potions that can be used either during a fight to heal or replenish mana or before to prepare for an encounter by increasing resistance to certain attack types. The druid can create the Botanical Gardens, which is where they can mix their potions and grow a select amount of herbs. They can also use their herbs to weave fibers and create linen clothes.\n\n\nThis is all just a draft - i intend to build this in Unity. Any suggestions are welcome!"

borcgs,Permadeath loot-based MMORPG,"I’m thinking like a modernized Realm of the Mad God, or an MMO permadeath Borderlands. The permadeath mechanic is challenging but addictive and a game like this would certainly fill a void for a lot of people. You have a character and your goal is to kill open world monsters and complete dungeons for gear. Enemies drop gear with varying rarity, including some super-powerful rare drops, if you die you lose all of your gear. Gear alone determines the strength of your character. A single use stat increase mechanic like ROTMGs is a possibility. 3rd person or FPS. Could be stylized in any way. Some cross-character progress would exist, but it should be minimal other than a vault that can store extra gear/loot."

To help the player out, as the event gets closer signals will start popping up that will alert the player as to what disaster it could be.

It would probably work nicely with taking a random autosave of this session and just add the troops you send through, giving you a massive advantage over your enemy.\n\n Just imagine, you are being rekt at the end of the game, being slaughtered by your opponent with no chance of winning, but manage to build a time machine at the last second and send whats left of your army to a save from 10 or 30 minutes ago and turn the tide.\n\nI'm just sitting here and thinking up of a whole bunch of other time related mechanics here now, tactical nuke that that destroys the object in all timelines at once ( like if it hits barrack, all units spawned by it die, because those barracks were made unexistant before the units were recruited, but also refunds the resources, because they were never spent) or a engineer unit with time dialation suit that can put him in other dimensions, like putting him temporarily in time before the game started, so you can move him to the enemy base location, maybe plant some bombs, than switch back to your time and then activate the old, now age rusted bombs.\n\nCould probably make the whole game with such mechanics, but would it be worth it / is it a good idea ?"

boeukp,"Infinite Demon: ""Enter the Gungeon"" meets ""Dark Souls""","So in many roguelike games, we've all had to face any challenging bosses with many sorts of weapons and tactics, but what if WE became the bosses? Like the EXTREMELY hard to beat bosses that we all fear.\n\nMy idea:\n\n* 2D, top-down roguelike game with multiplayer as a heavy emphasis\n* Gamemode: Demon's Curse of Eternity\n   * Basically, you're a boss that you can pick from a set of different classes, and as you kill more and more heroes that are trying to kill you, you regain some health and level up until you die, gaining more attacks, buffs, and abilities to keep on going for as long as you can or until you reach a goal\n* Gamemode: Mirror of Light\n   * Basically, it's the boss fight you just created, but instead, you are the single hero (chosen from a set of unlockable classes) going up against an AI-simulation of your boss (or several enemies in the campaign, as in ""Enter the Gungeon""), and you have to kill it with all the powerups you gave it, but you get stronger as you damage it more and more.\n* Gamemode: Mirrors of the Multiverse\n   * Basically Demon's Curse of Eternity, but one player is the boss and the other few players are the heroes.\n\nGameplay:\n\n* Main gameplay feature includes the Dodge-and-roll feature from “Enter the Gungeon” (click to roll to avoid and dodge attacks), classes, and simply click and shoot with a variety of guns. One-two special abilities per class.\n   * Example 1: Hunter class has a special ability to lay traps that can inhibit a bleeding effect on the enemy, or does more damage with a sniper-class rifle\n   * Example 2: Rogue class has lower health, but slightly faster character and can summon temporal clones (AI-simulated off of player) or can stun enemies temporarily with flashbang\n   * Example 3: Paladin class is slower, but can do damage to a wider area with some weapons, allowing for defense against attacks or able to hit more enemies.\n* Some characters for bosses are regularly sized, able to dodge-and-roll as well, or specially-made with special abilities instead, but without that ability to dodge.\n   * Example 1: Devil's Advocate is regular sized, same health as regular heroes (which is REALLY low compared to other boss health), but can dodge-and-roll and can spawn demon NPC's to help defend or attack heroes.\n   * Example 2: Snow 'n' Ball is bossed sized, normal boss health, and special skill is to roll in an invulnerable snowball attack that can freeze heroes temporarily if hit.\n   * Example 3: Unstable Phoenix is bossed sized, normal boss health, and basically can fire explosions everywhere, chaos and destruction to breakable areas of the map.\n\nGoal: \n\n* To create/beat the hardest bosses ever made.\n* To have a fast-paced, roguelike shooter game\n* To allow character customization and ranking in boss difficulties for bragging rights (lol)"
boe9e7,"[Request] ""Rage game"" idea?","Ok, apparently ""rage game"" is not an official term for this kind of genre, and if you put that phrase to a google/duckduckgo search they will output a game titled ""Rage"" (sigh); but I have seen some gamedev channels referring to the genre of games I'm talking about as that so I will use this term.\n\nThe genre of game I'm talking about is the likes of _Super Meatboy_, _Getting Over It_, _Trap Adventure_, and all other games with that nuance: if you don't know those games above, they are all super hard and frustrating game, designed to make players want to 'rage quit' sometimes, but at the same time curious and fun.\n\nNow starting to learn Unity, kinda want to make a game like that; but I have no good idea so far as to what genre to take and what to twist to make it creative and fun.\n\nAny good ideas? Any ideas are ok - but preferably a 2D game. It can be a modification of any genre: _Platformer_ rage games like all the examples above, _SHMUP_ rage game just like but not limited to the _Bullet Hell_ subgenre, _Top down_ rage game, _Roguelike_ rage game, maybe _Visual Novel_ rage game if it's even possible? Anything. Please let your imaginations run wild."
boc8nd,"Time is the 3rd dimension, 2D/3D puzzle game","You're a 2 dimensional being who has learned how to travel into the third dimension. 2d beings experience time by just traveling through the z axis. So they'd see something live and die but in actuality they're just seeing snapshots of an object as it moves around in a 3D space. This video will help you understand better if the explanation wasn't clear:\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6kn6nXMWF0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6kn6nXMWF0) \n\nSo this would be a puzzle game set in a 2D world that challenges you to reach a certain place at a certain time and in every level the only way to do so is by traveling into a 3D world that allows you to go back in time and traverse through obstacles.\n\nEvery level should have a series of events happening independent of the player. The level exists within a limited time window. Like, the level has 5 minutes of independent events and then it's over. In the third dimension, these five minutes are just the z axis. So in the third dimension time does now flow, and you're allowed to travel in time and space by moving around the 3D environment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the hook of the game. How the levels would actually be designed I've got no idea. Each level would have to be both a 3D object and a few minutes of little 2D critters moving about their lives. The biggest challenge would be in making both the 3D and 2D world look interesting and compatible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also know of Miegakure, a game about using the 4th dimension to solve puzzles. I think this idea sets itself  because it is about traveling through space but also time, and it would make it all very visible to the player. You'd have a lot of freedom navigating the world, placing objects around the 3D and 2D planes, changing time and space, which would create puzzles of a different nature."
bobv6h,"Top down, stealth, enemies have realistic senses but in each level they lack one sense completely.","Gameplay inspired on the first Metal Gear Solid. Top down view, lots of information about enemy sight/hearing range provided to the player. Lots of creative interaction between player, items and environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting could be something like an eastern monastery filled with Kung-Fu monks. Every stealth game I've played to this day, no matter how enjoyable, had enemies that didn't realistically see, hear or communicate. This is so the game is fun of course, but it also occasionally clashes with the sense that you're actually sneaking. So how to get around that? Let's see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Note: for sensitivity sake, none of the enemies need to be actually blind or deaf. They instead choose to keep a vow and deprive themselves of a sense/capability. Keeping up with the theme, the player's vow is to not ever take a life*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLevels listed in an order that increases both difficulty and novelty\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Blind level**\n\nChallenges:\n\n* The level is littered with traps, both deadly and to alert of your presence.\n* The monks carry a bell that allows them to recognize each other from footstep sounds.\n* Remember, enemies communicate a lot, so they'll ask you to identify yourself, failure to do so causes them to alert as many enemies as possible.\n* They have set up ropes around the level to guide them quickly.\n* They're armed with spears to keep foes at range.\n* They move in pairs and fight back to back.\n\nOvercoming them:\n\n* Observing monks to learn where traps may be\n* Stealing a bell to help you pass as a monk.\n* Moving objects to block their designated paths.\n* Acquiring a cutting object to cut off their rope paths.\n* Acquiring ranged weapons to attack them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Deaf level**\n\nChallenges:\n\n* The most conventional stealth level, enemies have great line of sight and will chase you down relentlessly, they use any weapon type.\n* Enemies can't communicate through sound but will communicate through sight, coordinating their movements and being patient.\n* Enemies have set up almost foolproof surveillance. It should look impossible to get through.\n* Enemies deny your hearing advantage by setting their monastery close to a waterfall and/or ringing loud gongs occasionally.\n\nOvercoming them:\n\n* Luring enemies out of their position and increasing chaos. Stealth games are all about watching things collapse into disorder as you screw up. In this level, that would be the optimal strategy. Get enemies out of their positions and circle around them the best you can, they won't hear you running.\n* Negate their visual communication with smoke bombs or heading into areas with many line of sight obstacles.\n* Anger them (throwing rocks at them, for an instance) into not waiting for their allies.\n* Sabotage their means of causing loud sounds, they won't know it won't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next two levels aren't a sense but they still fit the theme that an enemy is deprived of a basic skill:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Immobile level**  \n\nChallenges:\n\n* Enemies cannot leave their position, so they've taken the high ground and favor ranged weapons.\n* Enemies control doors and traps around the level from their position.\n* Enemies have once again set up a very tight surveillance but unlike the deaf level, they can also communicate and hear you.\n\nOvercoming them:\n\n* Place objects in front of their view position, so they can't see who's behind it.\n* Sabotage their machineries so they won't work.\n* Procure something that can be used as a shield against their arrows.\n* Make them line up their attacks so they attack each other with ranged weapons, they won't be able to dodge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mute level** \n\nChallenges:\n\n* Similar to the deaf level, tight security, but now enemies can communicate through sound, such as ringing bells.\n\nOvercoming them:\n\n* Same tactics as in deaf level, but now also ring their bells on purpose to attract their attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn all levels, the sense of smell should play a role. Wind direction and the places you crawl through influence enemy smell detection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story could be something like, the monks are training you and now you need to finish the levels to prove your skills. Even though you have a vow to never take a life, I guess the game shouldn't reinforce that so strictly. Perhaps if you kill someone and nobody ever finds their corpse, you're allowed to continue. This could interfere with the ending you get."

bo7pj5,Rimworld meets Diluvion meets Waterworld,"  \n\nI know this is probably too long so please give me feedback to cut it if needed and where to cut it down to make it more manageable. No feedback is lesser, I want to hear it all: the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Inspiration:**\n\n\-Diluvion (Setting)\n\n\-Rimworld (Graphics/Management/Events/Economy)\n\n\-Faster than Light (Graphics/Items)\n\n\-Binding of Isaac (Items)\n\n\-Don’t Starve (Survival difficulty)\n\n\-Endless Space 2 (UI)\n\n\-Oxygen not Included (Oxygen/Gasses system)\n\n\-Metro/Fallout (Currency/economy)\n\n\-The movie Waterworld (Seeds and growable soil being rare resources)\n\n\*With “items” I mean the amount and/or uniqueness of items\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genres:**\n\n\-Management \n\n\-Survival\n\n\-Base-Building\n\n\-Strategy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Setting:**\n\n\-Underwater\n\n\-Post-Apocalyptic\n\n\-Steampunk (Ancient Technology)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graphics:**\n\nSimple but likable. Think Rimworld/Faster than light/Dig or Die\n\nCan be more involved, but this is not the key selling point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key mechanics/selling points:**\n\n\-Lots and lots of content, loot and unique/rare trinkets. The base of the game and connected mechanics need to be made in a way that more loot/items can be added easily. You need to have that “HOLY SHIT I JUST FOUND THIS ITEM, IT’S SO COOL”- feeling that you can have when you play a RPG/Roguelike.\n\n\-Exploration: Done by a customizable sub which is a wreck, but it’s your most prized/valued possession. This is the main way of gathering loot. Secondary ways could include stuff like strainers on your base sitting in a stream. This doesn’t need to include real time strategics as the events and content are the main point, but stuff like real time exploration/combat would be cool if at all possible.\n\n\-Farming: Finding seeds/plants/growable soil is key to survival. They can partially sustain your food troubles, but you shouldn’t be able to multiply rare seeds. Your farm should also be customizable and with certain plants be able to change your oxygen production/usage. Seeds should also be really valuable when used in economy.\n\n\-Base-building: Should be more about adding and removing modules than physically shaping the base. You can change locations by refurbishing a wrecked/abandoned base that.\n\n\-Unique research: Instead of a classic research tree, you have parts of technology that you can loot which you can research. The more common survival research parts are easier to find and sell for less, the rarer ones can help you a lot in niche ways and sell for lots.\n\n\-Survival. The game needs to be centered on survival with wealth being a secondary objective. Oxygen-production being one of the main mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lore:**\n\nI have some ideas, but the gameplay is way more important right now. If interest is high I will maybe post some stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a game I have been looking for, for a few years now. A lot of games just can’t seem to fully scratch my itch and I even considered building it myself because of how bad I want it. If someone likes this idea and wants to build it I would happily talk about it and consider putting time, effort (and maybe even money) in it myself. I’ll admit that I already have accepted for the most part that this game will probably never exist if I don’t create it myself, but that is life. You can’t have it all."
bo6mcl,Deckbuilding RPG - Needs a programmer,"Think Slay the Spire mechanics with Dead Cells progression. It's the game I've always wanted to make, and I'm studying programming to consider making it myself, but I'd love for an advanced or experienced programmer to come alongside and do the heavy lifting with their unique skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the game is set up as a deckbuilding game, nothing too fancy. My only intentions thus far are to create a working proof of concept that can be pitched to a high level publisher. But if you're confident in your abilities, I'm sure we could really build the game ourselves and publish it. You hear of indie companies starting with one or two people all the time, that could be you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the game. You have a deck, you draw cards, cards are used for combat. Cards level up. Your deck levels up. Your card draw and usage levels up. For the first tutorial fight of the game you have four cards in your deck, and you have the ability to draw two and play one. Strike. Simple. You hit the main NPC of the game twice, he loses, you level up. Now you can draw two cards. He invites you into his simple tower, to clear out the dungeon. He gives you one starting colored card. Think getting your starter pokemon, it's special, it can upgrade, it needs to be leveled up. Now you have five cards in your deck. You enter the dungeon, fight monsters with your simple hand, drawing two and playing two. You beat the first level, and you can now draw three cards, and are still able to play two. You see where I'm going? You enter the dungeon again and again, fighting monsters for XP, and using XP to level up armor, get attack +1 bonuses, every use of your card is measured, which then level up and become more powerful. You can gain card draw for XP, you can gain card usage for XP, you can increase your HP, you can use XP to destroy a card permanently from your deck, heck of course you can use XP to buy a card, or upgrade a card from level 1 to level 2 .. 3 4 5, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe focus is on the snowballing progression, similar to Dead Cells, with battle mechanics playing like a limited Slay the Spire. I have the full idea flushed out, how the scenes will work, what the leveling rates will be, etc. etc. I just need a programmer willing to take on a small hobby project that could become big."
bo5v5p,Looking for inspirational reference to help me flesh out a cyberpunk (genre) idea?,"Hi all!  I'm wondering if anyone might be able to offer any recommendations for resources I can use for inspiration to flesh out a long-term idea I've had kicking around?  I want to develop a game set in a cyberpunk world, but more dark and gritty/psychological than the modern take on the genre.  I only have a few points of reference and unfortunately with Cyberpunk 2077 on the horizon, my research has been very muddied and inconsistent (not that I'm necessarily complaining - that game looks amazing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main source of inspiration comes from the types of retro-tech worlds like Akira or Serial Experiments: Lain.  I also really enjoy the look and feel of games like Super Metroid and Axiom Verge (although Axiom and Lain are probably the strongest influence for the type of world I want to build).  I've also been influenced a lot by some of the darker synthwave music that's come out in the last few years like Power Glove and - more specifically - Mega Drive's 198xAD record (the cover art for that record evokes the same sort of emotion I want to cultivate).  I also really like the dystopian feel of the Mega Man games and the story of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light and how their pursuit of technological advancement and feuding plunged the world into chaos.  The subterranean world of Hollow Knight is also a huge inspiration and will be one of the key references I use when I finally set out to building my game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just wondering if anyone would have any recommendations for similar books, anime, films, art, music, etc. that might help to better understand the world I'm building?  Or any similar ideas or media from this niche that might be off-the-beaten path?  Would anyone know what to even call this particular genre of science fiction so I might be able to find some more resources on my own?  Thanks!  I'd be stoked to hear any ideas or suggestions you guys might have as well :)"
bnya8a,A game idea with a twist,"This game is pretty 4th wall to be honest.

bso2vy,Visual Novel that you Type,"I’m sure something like this has been attempted, so let me know some games like it and I could try.\n\nSo visual novels are books that you play, but sometimes as I click and click I get disengaged out of lack of interaction. Even if the story is good. There can only be so many choices, and although some games have mini game sections to pad the gameplay, they’re often disjointed from the rest of the game. This got me thinking: why not merge typing and visual novel? It’s the perfect combination. You type out the entire story as you read it, so the gameplay is still idle but more involved. Whenever you mistype, your character loses Charisma points. These points are needed for making choices, like in the Fallout series. And did I mention, you also make choices by typing them out? There are timed tasks where you make choices quickly, and you fail if you don’t finish, so choose your words wisely. Mini games where you fight enemies by typing fit perfectly in the game as well."

Now you have to take on weird jobs and solve them.\n\nThe world is a frozen wasteland.\n\nLike dungeon exploring! Do you risk burning down the dungeon with your fellow adventurers or do you play it safe and only blow tiny fireballs? \n\nDo you focus on controlling your fire breathing or do you go all out? \n\nDo you kill monsters? Cook meat? (Eating anything not spicy will lower your fire power) \n\nYou meet someone who freezes everything she touches. For some reason, your fire power is ten times stronger around her."
