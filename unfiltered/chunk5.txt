kyswm3,A mobile beat rhythm game,Ok so you start the game off by selecting a music and hitting play and the game waits for you to hold your character to play. You then have to follow the beat by going in the beat sections with your character. There are obstacles (lines and various shapes of beats you need to go through) that block you along the way and if you fail too much the game will stop and tell you that you have failed and you must restart the level.\n\nYou gain characters by playing the game and completing various levels or by purchasing them outright. You can also watch an ad if you failed a level to continue playing from where you left off.\n\nI was also thinking that you could play on various difficulties where the hardest difficulty you would have to use two fingers to play the game.\n\nHere is an example I drew up quick of what I am talking about\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cuFV2pa](https://imgur.com/a/cuFV2pa)
kyrgny,fusion of niche: a genetics survival game and spore with some new mechanics. im open to critique and suggestions on this,"so firstly; the game  would be a turn based strategy game like niche. it would also have a similar genetics system to niche; but it would also have the stages of spore although they would be much less clear cut. also your creatures would never stop evolving throughout the whole game unlike in spore. it would also lack spores creature creation system.\n\nyou would start out in creature stage, witch would have very similar gameplay to niche. you would also have only two resources to manage at this point; food and nesting material. the starting island would be relatively large and have enough resources to last until tribal stage. \n\ntribal stage starts when you get a creature of high enough intelligence (witch is more or less randomized, but the average skyrockets during tribal stage and stays the same afterwards), you can craft a simple tool out of nesting material. only three tools would be available to you right off the bat; a flimsy spear (can be given to a creature and used by them to deal more damage in combat; but can only be used once because of how flimsy a spear made out of nesting material would be), something to allow the creature its assigned to to gather more food at once (i assume this wouldnt normally be being thrown at or hitting something so it can be used more times) and a flimsy axe (witch can only be used one time). the axe unlocks the 'wood' resource. with enough wood, you can craft better, longer lasting versions of the previous tools. but it also lets you craft a pickaxe, witch unlocks the metal resource. maybe there would also be a system where resources could drop from killed enemies/prey/rouge creatures that would be necessary in upgrading your stuff\n\nthe metal versions of these tools are the best versions available; the other resources are different.\n\nwith enough wood, you would be able to have your creatures craft a house. if you have your creatures sleep in a house, they cant be attacked during the night or be effected by any other hazards that might come about. eventually, you would also be able to craft stone and metal houses. you can never change what a house is made of, but you can upgrade it to make it more comfterble for your creatures. the different house types have different upgrades (some of witch would require the other resources), but a fully upgraded house will always give a creature that sleeps in it an extra movement point (in niche, creatures can only move or perform actions three times before they fall asleep and become unusable for the day) for the next day. i feel like it should also have some form of bonus related to reproduction and birthing, but im not sure what exactly.\n\nif you get enough wood (metal boats might be a thing but idk), you can craft a boat and put some of your creatures and a portion of resources on it (the more wood used, the bigger the boat, the more creatures and resources). this boat will sail off to a new island, but unlike in niche the creatures on the old island dont just vanish from your game when you sail off.\n\nwhen you sail away for the first time, you unlock a button that lets you switch between your islands. with enough wood, you can build a peir and connect it to any other island (only one island per pier, you dont have to build one on the target island), allowing you to ferry creatures and resources between islands. when an island no longer has any of your creatures on it, its removed from your list of islands. however, you can still use any peirs connected to it to recolonize the island.\n\ngoing back to resources, when a rock is mined, it will produce some resources, the amount always being a multiple of three. rock is the most common, metal is uncommon, and coal is rare.\n\ncoal can be used to upgrade houses (and maybe other buildings if i make those a thing) with coal stoves and stuff. i dont have many other ideas for civ stage but electricity is a thing.\n\nwith enough electricity and metal, you can have your creatures build a spaceship. it functions similarly to boats, but the ship itself works as an island of sorts. instead of just being a travel mechanic, you still play your creatures while theyre on theyre on the ship. you have a chance to come accross planets to beam a portion of your creatures down to.  these colonies start in civ stage, but otherwise it basically works like the game before space stage. you can switch between your planets and islands still.\n\nthere are sapient alien creatures on the other planets. diplomacy is a thing, and you can breed with the aliens for new genes.\n\nthe alien worlds would have biomes the features of witch are essentially randomly generated. so you might get a biome where it snows sometimes, but you also get wildfires and puddles that spawn clouds of mosquitos. this is not how it works in niche.\n\nconcepts that may or may not be things:\n\nother groups of creatures and diplomacy on the homeworld\n\nwar\n\nagriculture\n\nbuildings other than houses"
kyqfai,"What would you expect from a Game, where you are a Druid, fighting back civilization to protect nature?","I am currently exploring this concept as a game after reading it here.\n\nIn the Game you will be a __Druid__, and civilization is destroying ever more nature for its progress.

kynke0,Drone Wars,"Basically, you are a drone with guns chasing down a squad of enemy drones through a massive and very graphical city, idk just a random idea I thought of if anyone has any plans to make this contact me because I am a game developer as well."
kyjnym,A game about exorcising a ghost,"So I got massive inspiration from phasmophobia and had a dream about this, I think it’s pretty cool and would love to potentially make it a reality:\n\nThe game is more or less a ghost extermination game, there are several parts to it the first part is you’re given a random objective to collect things that the family left behind or that you need to get rid of the ghost, this could be money, objects, files, toys, ritual items like skulls, candles, salt, etc. These things can be found as you explore the house/map and look for them, be careful though because the more things that you remove from the place the angrier the ghost gets.\n\nThe second part of the game happens after you’ve found all the objects, depending on what type of ghost it is, which you do know at the beginning, depends on the way you are supposed to get rid of it. The different ways are a ritual, salt, exorcism, etc. once you complete this part the game ends and you’re given a score based on the value of objects you collected in part one as well as how fast you completed the entire thing.\n\nThere is money around the map that you can collect for later use in the game. You can purchase different things that you may need that can take time to find in the game like extra flashlight batteries or starting with some salt.\n\nYou can never actually see the ghost, the ghost is always invisible, sometimes though you can see the shadow of it. It can do things like hide under a bed, whisper/yell in your ear, turn on and off lights, even open, close, and slam doors. The more objects you take from the house and the longer you stay in the house or around the area that the ghost is in, the angrier it gets making it more likely to do the things mentioned above. As it gets angrier it’s more capable of things, such as writing things, speaking to you, throwing things across the room including items that are required for you to advance, making items seem to disappear (the item is relocated to a different room), and even shaking the entire house if it’s really upset.\n\nThere are also puzzles in the game relating to the exorcism of the ghost, in order to get rid of the ghost you have to do a puzzle, these care given to you though an object that you find in the game which tells you what you need to rid the ghost in the form of a riddle. It tells you things one by one so as you collect stuff it gives a new riddle until all items for the ritual/exorcism have been collected.\n\nYou can also interact with nearly every object in the game. You can wind up alarm clocks, pick up noise makers, Jack in the boxes etc. which can be used to draw the ghost to one room, giving you some time to explore other parts of the map, the angrier the ghost is the quicker it will deactivate something that makes noise."

ky7qs0,Ark survival evolved with clash of clans formula on mobile,"If you ever played ark survival evolved then this would actually a pretty good game to have the clash of clans style on mobile. You could build your base/walls with the same materials thatch/wood/stone/metal/Tek. Have the defences like turrets and different types of villagers with melee or weapons in ark. And when you attack you can use all the different dinos in ark including the mechs, titans etc. clans would be replaced with tribes. Just an idea I had and thought would be cool to see one day."
ky6dnk,Vampire's Creed (Assassins Creed + Vampires),"Ofc the name is just a nice pun but here me out:  \n  \nImagine a game with Assassin's Creed like mechanics and the fantasy of being a vampire.\nI noticed there are not many freeroam vampire games with solid mechanics. The new Bloodlines game looks ok but worried about the development from rumors I head.  \n  \nOk so let me go down a few things:  \n  \n*  You are a vampire, hence you can climb buildings, the setting could be an urban or city enviroment, lots of allyways and people. The combat will be a mix of action and also the ""counter"" style gameplay seen in some Ubisoft games, the counters will be dodges of bullets and silver weaponry. There would be a stealth element of course and is the main way to feed, however you can also do combat feeding if you counter perfectly.  \n  \n*  You seem ""human"" so you can walk around and blend into the enviroment, however your bloodlust decreases overtime and you have to escape to an ally or out of sight before your ""vampiric charm"" wears off and people start noticing you.  \n  \n*  The game is about luring people and feeding on them, battling different clans, the more you feed the greater your ability points. I had the idea like you can ""climb buildings"" but after a while, you gain a dash to make it quicker, then eventually you can run up them.   \n  \n*  If you attract too much attention you will get chased by authorities then the ""vampire hunting"" association, they will send advanced weapons and usually wont stop until you are dead or if you go back into hiding, they might also crack down on the whole sector and you will witness your clan fighting them in random areas. \n     \n*  vampire hunters use weapons that are more effective on you and are more deadly, however you can take advantage of their weapons to fight other vampires too. Vampires clans maybe have their own ""wanted system"" and their own weapons and abilities.  \n  \n*  A multiplayer aspect could be either a fully open world experience with clans fighting each other or perhaps a more intimate Vampire Hunter mode where you have to find 1 vampire as 4 vampire hunters.  \n  \n*  I want the roleplay aspect of a being a vampire to be a part of it like how AC Black Flag made you feel like a pirate. So the story should have that fantasy be realised, maybe have a different story based on which clan you pick or maybe as simply as a good or bad vampire.  \n  \n*  Each clan will have their own signature abilties and maybe their own looks. They have their own territories and I am imaginging the ""post end game"" to be basically a game of territory claiming, kinda like with GTA San Andreas. There could be dynamic quests to hijack a bloodvan and also to disrupt vampire hunters and vampire clans operations. Maybe even a dynamic hunting mechanic where you have to find 1 specific human and feed off them.\nMaybe as well, you can have a ""Blood Council"" faction of Vampires that are the ones that internationally keep watch on all other vampires in order to try and keep their existance secret. They can maybe be the ones that send vampire agents to try and kill you if you have too high of a profile, having their own unique equipment and their own powers.   \n  \n*  Perhaps a day-night cycle could be implemented, where you have to keep low profile in alleyways, but it might also just be a nuisance to gameplay and feel like an un-needed hurdle. There would need to be something you can do during the day that at night you can't. Perhaps an underground  section of the city opens up as vampires retreat for the day? Like sewers and stuff? Who knows.  \n  \n*  It would be cool to find like, other mythical creatures hiding in the city, I even through of a ""werewolf"" character that maybe can be a DLC mini-story afterwards that you can play through. It doesn't just need to be vampires, could be the whole spectrum and all having their own abilities!  #\n  \nSo yeah what do you think? I've had this idea for the past couple of days."
ky62e6,Need a multiplayer horror game idea,"I am a programmer working on a project making a game on unity for me and the boys. I want it to be a multiplayer horror game but I cant think of something. I am looking for something similar to Phasmophobia, that has that scary puzzle aspect to it. Any ideas would be appreciated."
ky3j58,My post apocalyptic survival game idea,"You start as a Gunsmith entrepreneur and survivalist expert, you're at your shop one day when on the television you hear a broadcast explaining that there's a giant asteroid heading for the planet and its too late to do anything. That there is approximately 76 hours until impact. You have 60 hours to gather any supplies you need and get to the bunker that you had built just in case anything like this happened. Then once you gather everything you need you go down, you had it specially made to go 40 feet underground. You already had enough food to feed 2 people for 6 months comfortably, but your wife divorced you 7 months ago. If you do choose to ration the food you have, it could last you 2 years. \n\nYou can have a look outside every two months to see if it is safe to go out and look for supplies or weapons, but until then you have to keep your senses and skills somehow. So you use the small gym that you have in your bunker to stay in shape, and the small rock climbing wall to keep up those skills too. You also maintain a small garden down there so you have fresh stuff, because most of the food you bought was not very healthy but was high on calories and lasted a long time. \n\nOnce you are abel to go back outside, you see that the world has gone into a state of nuclear winter. So if you're going to be outside, you need a base to protect you from the elements. You first need to check your surroundings for supplies, tools, weapons and to see whats left of the small town that you once lived in. So you go to grab your winter gear and any weapon that you have, no telling what dangers await you. You shortly find out that an alien race has come to your world and made base domes and took any surviving people as slaves and prisoners. \n\nNot too long after you make that discovery, you are knocked out. You wake up in a place you recognize, it's your old buddy's basement. Where you and him would spend hours together, working on projects or playing video games. He doesn't recognize you, because from you being underground for 18 months it has changed the way you look just enough that you're unrecognizable. However you somehow convince him that its you, and that you aren't trying to hurt him. So he tells you whats going on and anything else you need to know. You have a choice to stay together and have better chance of fighting off anyone or anything that comes, or stay separate and only together in extreme emergencies so you have less chance of getting found.\n\n\nBut to put it like that, this is my idea that i hope someone can bring to life."

kxxdmr,Small multiplayer game with a twist,"I have this idea that I can't put into a real game since I don't have enough knowledge in 3D games. Basically, it's a competitive game where the weapons are what you find in the map. It can be a pencil, a plate, even a chair. You can fight with most of the map. \n\nThe twist is that you have the power to teleport yourself around by clicking on the mini-map. Each time you teleport, you lose your actual equipment. So when you teleport next to a player to kill him, you need to grab the first thing you see. It's a bit of a decision game where you choose if you take the risk or not.\n\nI DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A GAME WITH RANKS!!!\nThe idea is made to be fun and NOT competitive. The goal is to have fun with friends or online stranger. (Maybe bots) \n\nI don't expect to have huge map. Something the size of a house is ok. I would make this game free, but you can sell it if you want.\n\nThat's all I had to say. Sorry if there is some errors, I'm not an English speaker. Thank you!"
kxwtub,My Nightmare could be turned into a game. (Ocean based),"Literally 30 minutes ago I woke up from a nightmare where the plot could have massive potential to be a unique, never before seen game concept / concept setting for a game.\n\nFeel free to create your own storyline to my nightmare.\n\nI only jotted down what I remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ocean Nightmare Concept Art](https://imgur.com/gallery/wQMwjdN)  \*\*\* &lt;--- Click Link to visualize my nightmare as I explain it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Character:** Normal human being. Can breathe water and air.\n\n**Setting 1:** Deep, Dark, Vast ocean. All landmarks are upscale &amp; massive. The waters give of a ""nightmareish"" type of vibe. Your character swims and breathes water when in the vast ocean.\n\n**Setting 2:** Bottom of ocean floor. Gives off a false sense of reality, as if you're back on land w/ clear blue skies. Your character walks and breathes air when on the ocean floor.\n\n**Transition Point:** The layers between Setting 1 &amp; Setting 2. Crossable at any point in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Game Start:** Walk into the ocean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Monster 1:** Lives in Setting 1. A massive shark/monster the size of a ship. Mouth shaped as a black hole. Incredibly viscous, relentless, and fast. It's main purpose is to locate &amp; kill you.\n\n**Civilian Puppets:** Lives in Setting 2. Any living soul on the ocean floor. They look like normal people, animals, etc. Because Monster 1 cannot cross into the ocean floor, it uses the normal civilians as puppets to kill you / force you back into setting 1. If a living soul has you in their sight for more than 5 seconds, they will transform into viscous monsters w/ the demeanor of zombies from ""I am Legend"". Their main goal is to kill you / force you back into the vast ocean (setting 1) where monster 1 is waiting to kill you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to Transition Between Setting 1 &amp; 2:** When in the vast ocean, Monster 1 knows where you are at all times. However, you can hide from monster 1 within the false sense of reality... That is the ocean floor. You do this by swimming through the transition layer (located 10 meters above the ocean floor), which passes you into the false sense of reality, that is the ocean floor. You can then re-enter the ocean, by climbing buildings / landmarks large enough to reach the transition layers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Weapons:** In the ocean, items/weapons are weightless and can be thrown at very high speeds. However, on the ocean floor, the weapons became it's realistic weight to your human character."
kxstm6,A supernatural sci-fi action game with survival horror elements.,"Story:\nYou're a space-faring mercenary that was sent to a research facility. Before losing contact, they reported had a breakthrough in their efforts to reverse-engineer the the technology of an extinct civilization of ancient extraterrestrials that harnessed an unknown fundamental force to pretty much invent magic. The last thing they reported was they may have found what caused the civilization's downfal, so they sent an expert in combating biohazardous creatures.\n\nGameplay:\nYou have to explore the ruins of the facility and the ruins it's connected to using a little puzzle-solving and parkour-based platforming, all while combating biohazardous creatures that infest them and the malfunctioning robots.\nEarly on, you discovere the fruits the scientist's research. They call it the Focus and by loading Catalysts into it you can harness all kinds of supernatural abilities like emitting energy in various forms of bullets, creating various melee weapons of altered energy, unleashing various forms of transformed energy such as fire, ice, lightning, wind, acid, poison, and gravity, harnessing a few utility based abilities like switching positions with a object, telekineticall lifting and throwing large objects, fixed-point hovering, gliding, limited flight, and immobilizing moving objects, and creating subservient energy beings called guardians. New cores are found by exploring along with HP and Stamina upgrades, and upgrades to the Focus allowing for more Cores to be loaded at once and the ability to link to Utility Cores which can modify the player's actions depending on what cores they're linked to.\n\nThe Monster:\nEventually, the player discovers what ruined the place even with such powerful technology at the researcher's disposal: an anomalous bio-mechanical being called the Selector. The Selector can't be killed, but it can be temporarily chased off, however every time you do so it becomes impervious to what you used to defeat it. You can choose to hide from it, trap it, or distract it with various gimmicks in the game world, but these only work once as well. Your only saving grace is that the Selector's body is only suited for traversing its current area, every time you move to a new one it has to load its mind into a new body with a different form and capabilities but doing so resets its immunities and adaptations.\n\nThe Goal:\nYou have to explore each area finding the researcher's data hidden throughout. You can move on by collecting a certain number of data caches in each area, but collecting them all unlocks the best ending and final boss.\n\nThe Final Boss and Best Ending:\nAfter a while, the Selector gathers enough data to evolve into a Perfect Form, and its first act upon being encountered is to destroy your Focus and all your Cores. But shortly after you realize that you've grown so accustomed to wielding them that you realize your body naturally produces the fundamental energy that they and their abilities run on, along with every living creature in the universe. After harnessing it, you have a final showdown with the Selector and upon destroying it for good you go onto teach the rest of humanity how to wield the energy and they go on to colonize the rest of the universe and eventually create new life to populate it."
kxrcik,Left 4 Dead-inspired Co-op Survival Action-horror Krampus Game,"This idea was too long to fit as a Reddit post (without deleting some of the best details), so I wrote it on Google Drive and published it to the web.

kxr87g,"A game like the modern Hitman games, except with ""silent drop-in multiplayer"" (you aren't told how many players are sharing your world or who they are) and any player can get bonus scores for making another player get caught.","It's a stealth game in levels full of NPCs and you start each single-player mission with a randomized character appearance. **It's not an assassination game;** rather, your story mission objectives range from things like stealing documents and finding a target's password, to planting bugs in a room and reverse-pickpocketing to plant evidence on an NPC. You still have some non-lethal combat options which are mostly used to steal disguises.\n\nThe twist is that you can be dropped into a level that already has other players hidden in it going about their own story missions.\n\n####You can't assassinate each other.\n\nInstead, if you spot some NPC acting like a human *you can report them.* You see, a main feature of this game is the ability to mislead guards (and other NPCs) by walking up to them and reporting suspicious activity. You get a prompt to give them a description and/or location, which leads them investigate or call it in (which in turn might clear a path for you if they leave). If your shenanigans lead to them getting caught, you get a sweet bonus. You might even disguise yourself as a guard NPC to scare them into trouble if you're confident they won't realize you're just another player.\n\nThere are other ways to mess with other players, such as throwing something loud near them, locking doors on them or planting a tracking device in their pocket (inventory), to name a few examples. Finding other players is a little rare (especially since they tend to be blending in as best they can), but it's just common enough that you're always on edge."
kxoe8q,"Alright... let's try this again, shall we?","#Hey there. So uh... I think there was a misunderstanding with my recent thread. I actually need suggestions for additional ideas. So I would be happy if you had any to share. This is the main point of this post.\n\nSo I had this idea for a while, which won't ever happen because of the amount of resources it would require, about a Final Fantasy-inspired series of JRPGs. Among other things, there are 2 features that stand out the most, and are a staple in every entry in the franchise, those being the probability-based combat system and the discovery system which is how the player discovers new things in the games.\n\nFrom what I have realized, all the discovery systems that I came up with fall under 4 categories\n\n**Standalone Object Discovery (SOD)** - There are\n\n**Combination-Based Discovery (CBD)** - A system where the player takes 2 or more object and combines them, resulting in a unique effect.\n\n**Observation-Based Discovery (OBD)** - A system where the player is required to observe their environment and choose an\nobject of desire. This system, for the most part, requires the player to use their imagination.\n\n**Time-Based Discovery (TBD)** - A system where objects reveal themselves to the player based on real time.\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nAnyways, I'm trying to come up with new ideas for both the combat system, which is based on a real-life aspect that already exist, and the discovery system. The problem is, I am dry out of ideas at this point. So I would like to hear what kind of ideas you, my fellow Redditors, might have with the prerequisites that I have set.\n\nThis is more or less the entries that I currently have in the series. It is a summarized version of how each system works, since if I had to describe them entirely, it would take more out of me.\n\n\n\n\n#1st Entry\n\nCombat System: Dice; higher rolls means more hits\n\nDiscovery System: 200 characters; just go around and find them (SOD)\n\n\n\n\n#2nd Entry\n\nCombat System: Unique system of combinations with 3 types and 3 numbers with 27 different results\n\nDiscovery System: 8 characters go around and place objects in designated locations to receive a summon, with 27 different summon per character (CBD)\n\n\n\n\n#3rd Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on Poker; different hands yield different effects\n\nDiscovery System: Characters (amount to be determined) go around and transform objects, either everyday or peculiar, into creatures. Approx. amount of creatures: 200 (OBD)\n\n\n\n\n#4th Entry\n\nCombat System: Most likely based on either Pai Gow or just Dominoes\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. There are 21 statuettes to collect; two can be combined, for a total of 210 different results (CBD)\n\n\n\n\n#5th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on Chess; a deviation from the usual probability-based combat system\n\nDiscovery System: Most likely has 2 playable characters. The player goes around and places objects in peculiar locations to summon mercenaries (OBD)\n\n\n\n\n#6th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on Russian Roulette\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) gains different powers based on how long they waited in real time from a designated location, up to a maximum of 216 hours (9 days) (TBD)\n\n\n\n\n#7th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based around the Gregorian Calendar, most likely to be probability-based\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) gain different powers based on the real-time date (TBD)\n\n\n\n\n#8th Entry\n\nCombat System: Based on the cardinal directions, most likely to be probability-based\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) utilize different powers based on the location they are in, with their being 216 different locations distributed on a 6X6X6 grid (SOD)\n\n\n\n\n#9th Entry\n\nCombat System: Undetermined as of now\n\nDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. Supposedly the character(s) enter different locations by going through 1 of 3 doors 5 times, resulting in 243 different results (CBD)\n\n\n\n\n#10th Entry\n\nCombat System: Undetermined as of now\n\nDiscovery System: Most likely to have 2 characters, with one wielding a sword and the other a gun.

kxdcub,Why does health or mana have to have non-negative real numbers / integers as values? Some more exotic choices...,"The most obvious choice would be to allow negative amounts of health or mana. Negative health might have something to do with undeath, a weird perverse state of being where healing potions bring you closer to death (defined as zero health) and damage from enemies makes you stronger. Maybe a world with living and undead beings side by side, with a matter-antimatter sort of relationship - the undead can harm the undead by attacking, the living can harm the living, but perversely, when either tries to attack the other, they heal instead.\n\nMore weirdly, you might try using values in a cyclic group - the most obvious choice being the circle group - which for non-mathy people is ""pretend that 0=1 and the number line rolls up into a circle"". Then full health = no health (i.e. death), and healing too much would actually damage you - but if an enemy tried some sort of overkill attack, it would actually heal you instead by wrapping your health around ""below zero"" to a high number close to 1! This could be the outcome of an eldritch ritual that makes you a creature beyond standard laws of nature.\n\nAnother choice would be a two-dimensional health bar. (Health square? Health circle?) The origin, or a small circle centered on it, would be death, and every other point would be a distinct health state. Attacks or healings would be vectors added to your health, with attacks tending to move it closer to origin, and healing tending to move it further away, but by some sort of ""life force rotation"" mechanic you might shield yourself, diverting an attack and turning it into something that heals you - but of course, your enemies can too. Or, if they can manipulate your life field, an enemy could curse you to take ""damage"" from a health potion this way. That said, you could ""spiral around the drain"" indefinitely without actually reaching death at the origin, if you're very careful!\n\nWeirdest of all, perhaps, might be health (note, any of these could apply to mana, currency, or any other value also, of course) that takes values on a tree - such as the free group on two generators. (Set of all expressions with two types of symbols that look like ""2a+3b-a+2b"" etc.) Reaching zero / death (the empty string) would require going backwards on the tree, retracing every step your health bar has taken all the way to zero, which would require the enemy to know your history - but of course, the same thing goes for damaging them. I can't even imagine how to describe that in terms of worldbuilding or meaningful analogies. But it's cool as heck.\n\nFeel free to use these ideas or not use them, however you like. But I love putting weird math stuff into game designs!"
kxbp5e,The King's Chef - Medieval Fantasy Cooking and Combat in VR,"Worldbuilding: In a toon-like medieval fantasy world where fruits and vegetables are animate creatures and meat is primarily sourced from large untamable beasts, those who walk the culinary path are revered as champions of flavor, hunger, and thirst. In this world, agriculture is limited due to the trivial number of domesticated animals and ""safe-to-grow"" produce. Lower class cooks may purchase their ingredients from the local markets, but the highest quality ingredients can only be found in the wild. To the best chefs, cooking is only half the skillset; hunting, trapping, prepping, and transporting fresh ingredients is the other. It is common to find experienced cooks in the wilderness donning culinary themed armor and weapons -- for example: half-plate and leather on top of a chef's uniform, with a cast iron shield and sword-sized kitchen knife.\n\nIntroduction / Tutorial: as the King's personal chef, it is your sworn duty to prepare whatever meal or feast the King and his royal family request. At first, this can be accomplished by hunting for ingredients in forests and meadows surrounding the royal castle, serving as an introductory tutorial for the game's primary mechanics (hunting, trapping, combat, prepping, transporting, and cooking).\n\n* Hunting: searching for and tracking down ingredients by following footprints, unique sounds, etc.\n* Trapping: many of the smaller creatures can be trapped in devices you can purchase from vendors around the map. These may resemble foothold traps, deadfall traps, cage traps, etc. Just set the trap in a viable location and wait.\n* Combat: physical swordplay similar to Blade &amp; Sorcery, or really any VR game with melee combat. Could also include physical archery (with either unlimited or purchased arrows) similar to any VR game that has bows.\n* Prepping: after trapping or slaying a creature, it may need to be skinned, chopped up, etc, in order to store it in a medieval ""food truck"" cart pulled by a trusty, un-killable horse. This cart follows you everywhere you go while outside the castle walls, and serves as an infinitely large storage box to hold your ingredients.\n* Transporting: in addition to serving as a storage box, the aforementioned cart is also used to cook food for yourself and peasants (similar to a modern day food truck) while on the road. Cooking for yourself will provide food you can eat to heal yourself, and cooking for others supplies you with coin to purchase traps and upgrade equipment. This makes transporting ingredients more engaging than simply a long walk between towns. Additionally, sometimes bandits will try to steal your ingredients on the road, forcing you to fight them off lest they steal your hard-earned loot.\n* Cooking: physical cooking in VR. Let your imagination run wild, but keep in mind it is not meant to be a hyper-realistic cooking simulator. Think Job Simulator with a bit more detail.\n\nPlot: after the tutorial section, the King and royal family fall ill with some plague-like disease. The castle is blocked off to prevent further spread, and the King's chef ventures to the hut of an eccentric Kitchen Witch to query about a cure. Luckily, the Kitchen Witch knows of a cure which comes in the form of an exotic stew. The stew requires many ingredients, some mundane (as explored in the introductory section) and some dangerous, the latter taking the form of grand boss battles. You must now travel far and wide across the open-world kingdom to collect these rare ingredients, transport them back to the castle, and cook up a life-saving stew to restore the King."
kxbmev,An RPG where your character's face get's destroyed shortly after going through character creation,"I just randomly had this thought that it would be cool if the next Fallout game had your character be a ghoul (basically a man with melted flesh). I think it would be an interesting twist to put on an RPG where your character experience some form of disfigurement to their face. So players don't feel like all their effort is wasted, maybe the disfigurement works around the facial features and stil produces a somewhat unique look based on the character created. Or it could just replace the face entirely with a default face that is the same for all players; maybe the game has some kind of running theme with finding your identity or something.\n\nAnyway, just thought it would be a cool twist on modern WRPGs."

kx8vox,Master and Commander game,"Sailing Game set during the Napoleonic Wars. *First Person Perspective with no HUD*. Hardcore realistic ship simulator. 1:1 scale of the actual ships in the early 1800s.\n\nI envision a game where you take command of a ship in the Royal Navy and as captain you call the shots. You would have a full crew of interactive AI that move about the ship working and maintaining and creating an atmosphere of actually being on a ship. \n\nYou can play solo or you can play with your friends who will take the roles of the various officers on your ship or you on theirs.\n\nAs Captain, you and your officers (friends) would be responsible for things such as hiring a crew, filling the ship's inventories when at port, and deciding on a voyage, as well as obviously commanding the sip while at sea. \n\nYou start off with a beginner ship and the more successful voyages you complete the higher your rank will climb and the more money you will make. You can then start to acquire newer bigger and better ships. If you are constantly having unsuccessful voyages, then your rank may fall and you will only have access to  smaller/slower ships. Your standing will also dictate the type of AI sailors/marines that you can use for your ship.\n\nYou will also have access to your house while in port and obviously the more money you make the larger and more opulent your house/estate can become. \n\nYou can join a Fleet (clan) that participates in large scale battles or can form convoys for delivery missions, etc. The Admiral of the Fleet will have to purchase a Guild Hall that members can pay into and then congregate at whilst at port. Your Guild can even host Balls where other members of other Fleets can attend in full Battle Dress and meet.\n\nWhen playing as a solo ship by yourself or with your friends the list of voyages you can partake on will be obtained at the Navy Office. Example voyages can include: Escort delivery ship from port a to port b, track and capture a specific vessel, find and eliminate pirates at this location, locate and rescue a damaged ship, patrol this area of water and ensure no enemy ship gets past, help relieve an attack on a port, escort marines to a new fort, bring a naturalist to an island to explore, deliver a messenger to a new prospective trading partner, the possibilities are endless. \n\nDuring a voyage you will have to instruct the crew on the heading to sail, where to stop and resupply, how to wage battle, etc. You will have to delegate to your friends to command their specific sections so for instance you could have a friend in charge of the marines, a friend in charge of the cannons or a section of cannons, a friend in charge of the sails, etc. When you issue a command with the command interface menu the AI crew will then immediately carry out the orders.\n\nYou will have to rely on reading charts to navigate, and weather, sickness, battle with random French/ pirate ships, mutiny, and more will all play a part on determining the outcome of your voyages. Sail too far North and you could be trapped in ice, land on an uninhabited island for resupply and you could be attacked by natives or wild animals, sail into a storm and risk losing you ship and being marooned, run out of supplies and starve... \n\nThe ships can be customized to a large extent and each officer will get their own room. The Captain's quarters/great room at the rear of the ship is where the officers gather in down time or for meals or debates when planning anything. \n\nI could go on and on, but if you've read this far you get the gist of what I'd appreciate in this type of game hopefully. Think Master and Commander movie/ The Terror show. Being able to walk around on those old wooden ships packed to the brim with a bustling crew and sailing with your friends would be extremely pleasing. \n\nI have played SoT, Naval Action, Age of Sail, etc. and none come close to a FPP sailing game that I wish was on the market. Sadly, I know this game is more than likely too large and too complicated to probably work, but I feel like having it on this thread is at least cool for others to read and dream about. Feel free to add other ideas for this game in the comments."
kx62cx,"In a hypothetical universe, I have unlimited time and budget to make a series of JRPGs with special features. But I ran out of ideas and want some of your suggestions","So I had this idea for a while, which won't ever happen because of the amount of resources it would require, about a Final Fantasy-inspired series of JRPGs. Among other things, there are 2 features that stand out the most, and are a staple in every entry in the franchise, those being the probability-based combat system and the discovery system which is how the player discovers new things in the games.\n\nFrom what I have realized, all the discovery systems that I came up with fall under 4 categories\n\n**Standalone Object Discovery (SOD)** - There are\n\n**Combination-Based Discovery (CBD)** - A system where the player takes 2 or more object and combines them, resulting in a unique effect.\n\n**Observation-Based Discovery (OBD)** - A system where the player is required to observe their environment and choose an\nobject of desire. This system, for the most part, requires the player to use their imagination.\n\n**Time-Based Discovery (TBD)** - A system where objects reveal themselves to the player based on real time.\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nAnyways, I'm trying to come up with new ideas for both the combat system, which is based on a real-life aspect that already exist, and the discovery system.

kx4mpp,"A ""detective"" game with ""after-death consciousness"" as a one of its mechanics","This is a very loose idea I had after playing return of the obra dinn (on the idea of a detective with ""supernatural"" powers)\n\nBroad concept:\n\n- narrative/exploration game, lots and lots of dialogues, point'n click mechanics maybe\n\n- 3D First person\n\n- A mystery to be solved in a small town with crazy people and a negative attitude toward strangers\n\n- player is a detective of some sort and has to resolve mystery\n\n- player has some powers at its disposal\n\n- One of these is the ability to remain conscious after dying; this would be used when the town's people would eventually kill the detective when he puts its nose too deep into the town's affair.\n\n- Consciousness means: hearing people talk and maybe even looking through player's eyes; the player becomes a ragdoll and npcs will start doing what they want with the corpse (eventually bury/burn it)\n\n- Death are mostly dealt by individuals/small groups; most people would have a reason to make the detective disappear. Public execution could be a scenario\n\n- After some time being dead (when he's buried for example) the character would begin it's journey again with full memory of what happened. (time loop essentially)\n\n- Death is not the main point of the game, only one of its mechanics, the player shouldn't be compelled to die. Mostly he should talk/explore; people will try to ignore him rather than be agressive unless certain circumstances are met.\n\n- Player may have other powers: ask the dead, hear through walls, detect lies... He might use them from time to time but they should remain secondary to the intrigue.\n\nWhat do you guys think of this? Ofc the execution is very dependant on the quality of the story/writing but I haven't seen this mechanic yet and think it's cool/interesting."
kx3wzt,Horror mechanic game idea,"Hey, I'm stuck on a project, its a side-scroller horror game. There's not much decided as for the story yet, but it takes place in a forest, I'm thinking of using a sanity mechanic. Something follows you, to proceed you've got to go right but as you go your sanity is starting to drop. To refill it you've got to look behind you with your flashlight (just to check if there isn't anyone there), you cant move and look behind you at the same time so each time you look behind you you've got to stop moving. At first nothing will be behind you, but as you move deeper into the forest you start to see ...things.\n\nWhat do you think about this idea, and would it make a fun gameplay?"

kwy96y,"New game idea, any feedback appreciated","Ok so, I had this idea of a racing game borrowing many elements and mechanics from other games because those inspired me.\n\n\nThe plot: You, the player, are a student going fresh into college sometime in the late 90s to early 00s. You’ve just gotten your first car and decide to start racing. After a while, your car is destroyed during a race against the top dogs new recruit, whom they bet big money on to have him win. You encounter a student at your school who shows you a junkyard to get yourself a new car to race again as he’s also involved in the racing scene (by now the players 2 or so hours in so he’s/she’s made some money). The player now has to climb up the ranks to make his way to the leader of the top dogs, a business owner and local member/leader of a violent gang. (More details about the plot available if you’re interested).\n\nTransportation: it’s a racing game so you’ll have access to many vehicles, such as:\nCars, bikes, boats, aerial vehicles, trucks, etc.\nThe player can also move on foot, in which he can walk, sprint, jump, crouch and even fight.\n\nCharacter: the player has a wide range of customization, like gender, hair, facial details, build, height, facial hair, tattoos, piercings and clothing. The player has three or four fighting, walking, sprinting and crouching animations possible. Nothing too complicated just some variety.\n\nThe map: the map is divided in 4 sections:\n\nThe city: has a grey filter to it, depressing, polluted, kind of like the cities of old tony hawk games, like New York. More stuff to buy, newer cars, clothes, and safe houses (to store cars, manual save, change up outfits and save them, etc). There’s a highway to do pulls\n\nThe forest: the forest is more saturated and colourful to make it nicer and happier in a way. No dealerships, stores or anything like that. Players can do off-road racing, find collectibles, hide from cops, buy a safe house or two and play some missions/side missions. Nothing much to do because of its remoteness. Can drive up the mountain and drift down it though.\n\nA smaller island beside the main map:\nYou can access it with a boat that you can get anywhere. On the island, there are jeep races and old nascar-esque races on the beach. It’s a section because it’s still pretty big and I think from the drawings I have it looks pretty sizeable. Players can buy the mansion located on the island if they have enough money. Players can unlock some cool exotic items, which are shipped to the port, in the city. This mansion is customizable as it’s an end game item which gives the player more of a sense of accomplishment. \n\nThe suburbs/university district:\nMost safe houses located here, plenty of unlockables and the university is here for the player to attend school (more on that later). It is where some gang members hide so the player must be careful until he’s completed the game not much going on here, rather peaceful.\n\nMechanics:\nThe cars:\nThe cars have a perma-death of sorts, if they’re crashed too badly or something along those lines, that car is gone for good, players can still load up an original save or restart the mission if they want. They can overheat or have the tires pop so the player has to be mindful of that. It can also be impounded if busted. Car parts can be ordered online or purchased at a store and then they’re either shipped to your safe house of choice or you can load them up in your car.There’s limited storage in the trunk of a car for parts. Used car dealerships have cars with reliability issues, all random. New car dealerships have cars without issues. Import dealerships offer imported vehicles unavailable in the USDM. Junkyards have cars with immense issues and horrible reliability, they require a lot of fixing, all damage is random. Everything is modifiable, visuals, functionals (components for engines and such) and interiors. There’s a button for headlights if the player wants to toggle them (looks good on cars with pop-ups)\n\nThe player:\nThe player can be arrested and fined for speeding or street racing and fees are added for evading arrests. The player can fight the police or try and break free to try and escape or get back in their car. The player can also use a skateboard or a bmx bike to get around when not in an actual vehicle. The player doesn’t have a voice, adding to a more rpg feel. There’s dialogue options for cutscenes, just leading to other answers, nothing special. The player has to go attend school, go to parties, etc because they’re still a college student and need to go there. There’s, math, science, all the basics.\n\nThe World:\nThe map is semi destructible, little objects, traffic lights and all that jazz are breakable but they do do some damage to the car. There are marks left with burnouts, npc’s react to the players actions. If a wall is hit by a vehicle, there’s cracks and little pieces that will fall out. There’s a day-night cycle, the weather has rain, overcast, sunny, sunny with clouds and thunderstorms included. The dorm rooms are accessible at the university if the player buys or rents one. Police come by waves and reinforcements the longer a chase goes on.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I haven’t figured everything out yet. For example, I haven’t figured how I want the driving style to be, maybe more Arcady like the old nfs games or sim-cady like Forza horizon. The damage model I’m looking at is similar to gta IV’s or beam ng’s. \n\nI’m not gonna start this project for a while because I have to get used to the game engine I’m using, the codes required are quite complicated and long because of what’s necessary. I also don’t really have anyone other than me on this project so I’ll probably have to wait until I’m done with school and have some time to work on it. If anyone’s interested in this project and wants to take over be my guest. Just let me be able to help here and there as I’ve been thinking of this project for a while now. It’s pretty daunting and don’t have that much spare time to program due to school and other stuff. \n\nAny feedback is appreciated, I really want to hear your opinions on this.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCamska"
kwurzs,I need some simple ideas for a game for a beginner!,"I'm a beginner with unity, I've made some games before with it but nothing really good or polished or, fun really lol. If anyone has some relatively simple or small scale ideas to share with me, I'd super appreciate it!"
kws6t4,Can I get feedback for the plot of Fnaf Fan Game?,"This fangame takes place before even Fredbear's Family Dinner. The player stumbles into a strange funhouse - They have a hazy memory how they got there, not being an employee there. It's strangely vast and everything is made of sickeningly bright plastic. Each section resembles different outside areas; A garden, a farm, a camp-sight and scrapyard. The individual sections have its own humanoid animatronic, that matches the stereotypical theme. Like the farm, of course, having a farmer animatronic.\n\nFor gameplay, the players enter a new section each night. It's not like the main series where the player waits in one location and utilise their resources to seal off multiple enemies. Instead in this fan game, the player needs to sneak around the single resident animatronic and escape. They need to observe the animatronic's routine and finds creative ways to sneak around without detection.\n\nThroughout the game, two mysterious robots stalk the player from a distance, though never tries attacks them. Until the fifth night. The player stumbles into a new section with a countryside cottage filled with robotic parts. At the end of the night, the player is ambushed by the two mysterious robots, pushing a device into the player's head.\n\nThere, the player's vision suddenly changes and the plot twist is revealed. The player is animatronic; programmed to falsely believe everything else is artificial. The two mysterious figures are William and Henry as young adults and this cottage is their home.\n\nThe player is Henry's grandmother, who he escaped his troubled household with. The best they could afford was a small cottage since the grandmother was retired and Henry was in college. In college, he met William, joining them as a roommate. The boys were so distracted tinkering with robotics for their future business, they failed to realise the house was unsafe for an elderly person. Until one day, the grandmother snagged her foot on a beta springlock laying on the floor -\n\nShe collapsed on top of Proxy, the prototype of Henry's animatronic designs. (Inspired by a test model in Fnaf VR, called the 'Proxy the boll')\n\nThe grandmother's spirit possessed Proxy, which was how Henry and William discovered animatronics could be possessed. Fearing the potential consequences, the boys trapped Proxy in the cottage. Though she grew dangerously agitated, so Henry changed her programming, tricking her into thinking she was alive. However, it worked too well, making Proxy think she was the only living thing, breaking out of the cottage in fear. In reality, the gameplay was Proxy running through random locations, trying to avoid humans, including Henry and William in pursuit of her.\n\nAs an epilogue, it's shown how the grandmother's soul finds peace. Years later, Proxy takes a puppet-like role for the victims of Henry's faulty springlock design - Which costed the lives of serval employees. Once all employees souls have been put to rest, Proxy can finally move on herself."
kwqs5n,Monster Hunting Game,"So, obviously I know of monster hunter world, but I had a different idea in mind. It’s a 2D game and you are a hunter who wants to give the monster a fair chance, so you cannot bring anything into habitat where the monster lives. You have to scavenge for food and various materials to make traps to kill the monster. The monster is only susceptible to a few traps, however, and you have to study its movement and interactions in order to decide which might work. If you fail, if will get angry and probably kill you. If you die, you don’t get any money go down a level of prestige or something that is used to buy food that you can bring so you don’t have to scavenge.\n\nSorry for the long string of ideas lol. Any thoughts?"

kwhdxr,Need opinions for a game idea.,"I've started work on a game idea I've had where you pilot a space ship through a randomly generated universe, exploring derelict ships, raiding ships, exploring unknown world and upgrading to be the best space pirate around. I want to also have very limited UI with all inventories being physical places.\nYou also control your ship and can go around in 1st person.\n\nWhat are you opinions on the idea and is there anything cool you'd like to see."
kwghmg,Let me hear Your ideas for a Space Station Management game!,"Hello, my current project is one of the earlier aspirations that led to RimWorld. A management style game, but set in space onboard a space station. Combining this with ideas and the hostiles from Space Station 13, I'm sure there are plenty of interesting mechanics that can be explored. Basically a top-down strategy game where you manage your spacemen.\n\nNevertheless, I would also like to hear what you like/would like from this style of games - or better yet, what you don't like about them. Bigger ideas, smaller mechanics, ideas for the control scheme and anything are all welcome!"
kwgchf,A Great Idea for a Game: Geocaching + open-world RPG,"**edit: this doesn’t necessarily need to be an AR game, your phone could fundamentally be used as a birds-eye map/GPS, where if your near a player or enemy you can click on their dot and see what they look like in 2D. Give players the ability to design the looks of the items so they have more agency to paint a picture of the story they’re trying to create.\n\nGeocaching should mix its real-world cache database with an RPG game. Maybe it would be a separate app. Make it so that players can create a customized character with certain abilities/skills, and then they can explore the real-life cache world in forests, mountains, urban environments, bridges, etc and when they find a cache, they are awarded with a weapon, a piece of armor, a magical scroll, or a written note that guides the player along a storyline created by the placer of the cache. The awards could either be: \n\n1. Randomized\n2. Higher value if more difficult to find\n3. Customizable by the person placing the cache, so they can write their own narrative/story by placing notes into the cache, which urges people who continue trying to find the caches\n\nThe caches themselves then could be made to look like treasure boxes, swords, scrolls, notes jewelry, etc. so it reflects the RPG nature of the game itself.\n\nThe game could then have their own NPCs created by the cache-placer who you can interact with on your way to finding the caches, as well as enemies who can either guard the caches, or are just scattered all over the land, so players either have to fight them or sneak around them.\n\nMaybe if active players are in proximity to each other, they could either form an alliance or fight each other. \n\nSo basically, it’s like mixing Geocaching with Elder Scrolls/Skyrim/Mass Effect/secret agent role-playing/alien investigating and/or DnD. Use real-world objects and locations to create an open-world RPG that the cache-placers themselves can customize for the players!\n\nLots of potential here! Especially when you give people the ability to create designs/stories/items/enemies themselves.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
kw7l89,Feedback on a 1v1 gulag-style fighting game,"I've been trying to think of a game idea that can be played 1 versus 1, and I believe I've got a somewhat good idea going\n\n-----\n\nBest of three rounds\nMostly hand to hand combat, most weapons are things like bricks, pipes, and rocks with occasional firearms.\n\n    MOVEMENT MECHANICS:\n        Dodging: Smoothly shift in any direction to avoid oncoming attacks, at the price of movement speed afterward. With the right timing it can be used to dodge subsequent attacks from enemies.\n        Slide: Used as a temporary speed boost, mainly to get from point A to point B quickly. Can't be performed around enemies.\n    \n\n    ATTACK PUNISHMENT:\n    Each attack will shift the player in the attack direction, while also reducing movement speed. Should the attack hit an enemy, the player's velocity goes back and they can move, while the enemy's unable to move.\n\n    WEAPON DROPS:\n    Should a round go on for long enough, a powerful weapon (such as a revolver) will be dropped into a central point of the arena to move things along.\n-----\n\nThe last fighting game I created was a bit limp and wasn't very fun, so hopefully I can find some ideas for fun combat for this."
kw7gda,Orienteering - Folklore - Adventure - Hiking Simulator,"The orienteering from Death Stranding, but rather than facing world-extinction after avoiding ghosts and looters you instead face darks woods housing a coven of witches, werewolf bandits hiding near confined pathways and wendigos lurking in the darkness. Technologically the setting should be equivalent to the Industrial Revolution period.\n\nPlayers deliver resources between settlements, complete side quests to unlock blueprints for gear that eases their traversal and helps to build permanent structures, and slowly build the attributes of their character as they do certain actions. These core goals would largely not be tied to main storyline progress.\n\nStoryline progress could reward the player with QoL benefits, but would not gate pivotal mechanics or tools behind progression. Storyline progress could however gate the advancement of settlements to their next stage of expansion, so long as it doesn't negate the progress a player has made. I imagine main storyline progress being tied to things like eliminating nests of wendigos, clearing werewolf bandit camps or burning down coven houses. These quests could make the area ""safer"" so that more people inhabit the settlement, expand its borders, increasing the resource production rate of that settlement. These quests could reduce the occurrence of encounters with the specific enemy type that was eliminated, so as not to empty the world of threats but still have some impact on gameplay.\n\nPerforming basic actions such as walking, running, climbing, jumping, and even falling would slowly progress specific stats like increasing your stamina, strength, balance, jumping height/distance, and your ""stumble recovery"" speed, just for a few examples.  Players could also expand their capabilities by completing quests for various tradesfolk that reward blueprints and recipes for equipment and items that help them better deal with terrain and the dark threats in the wild."
kw5v19,Dark Souls with Survival Mechanics,"Similar combat mechanics to Dark Souls, but you also need to worry about things like hunger. There is some pretty heavy crafting, with less durable weapons and armor. There can still be epic boss fights, and you can establish bonfires as camps to rest up.   \nThe world would also have to be more open to give the player more options. There would still need to be relatively linear regions of the world, like classic Dark Souls, but the player could technically access any area of the map at any time. The survival mechanics take a pretty difficult game and make it even more difficult, so it would be good to cut down on things like farming and boss difficulty (health, damage, etc.)"
kw550m,Monkey Collecting Gacha Game with dating mechanics,"Let's not talk about the morality of games that are specifically designed to syphon money from the wallets of easily addicted asian youths, just hear me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a cellphone game in FE Heroes style, in which you are a dude/chick that is now stranded in the middle of an unknown jungle island, which is populated by all sorts of wildlife - Most notable an extremely varied range of primates; Chimps, monkeys, baboons, gorillas, everything inbetween and everything beyond (Drawing a line at human-like sapience, so no Neanderthals)\n\nThe premium cash is bananas, and for each banana you get to roll a monkey drop (If you use 4 bananas in a row, you get a free roll) and each monkey has a gimmick and skills related to his gimmick,  chef monkey, librarian gorilla, surfing chimp, the sky is the limit - And here's the real kicker...\n\nEach monkey has a relationship stat, which ranges from 0-10+\n\nat 3 hearts, the monkey declares you his friend\n\nat 5 hearts, he declares you his best friend\n\nat 7 hearts he starts showing signs of deeper affection\n\nand at 10 hearts you can get banana-bonded (married)\n\nIm gonna put my ear to the ground because I know this is one of the best ideas of the last decade, I already began talks to get some sort of patent or copyright so you better watch out"
kw4cu8,Subverting Character Creators in RPGs,"I had an idea about an RPG character creator. \n\nWhat if, after the player has created their custom character and chosen the personality type they want to be, the player character actually starts the game as the exact opposite or a random variation of the player's customized character, and it is revealed that this is the player character's ideal self, the person they want to be but can't be at the moment because they lacking in something. \n\nFor example, you decide you want to be an Optimistic Altruist but you roll as a Pessimistic Egoist, so you spend the rest of the game pursuing goals that help your player character slowly become more like the customized character.  \n\nI have no idea how much work this would take to implement or if this is something that might annoy players but any feedback would be appreciated :)"
kvzcqa,Danganronpa Spiritual Successor,"I thought of an idea for a spiritual successor to Danganronpa (this is just a concept that may or may not happen in many many years from now or ever) and this got me thinking. How do I give it its own identity and improve on the mechanics of Danganronpa? So far I have is livelier text that whizzes by fast and in a confusing way (pausing time lasts for a limited amount of time until you shoot internal thoughts), stringing sentences together in a fast-paced bomb game, an eldritch effect that makes words even more convoluted and time goes by faster, scrum debates, panic debates, and one on ones. Lie bullets were unnecessary as lying isn’t a theme (plus it smudged up the story a bit). Aside from this, I still feel like there could be more done so that it isn’t called a ripoff or a clone."
kvxkcr,There should be a Mount &amp; Blade: Warhammer,"For those of you that know the Warhammer Universe and have played the Mount &amp; Blade games (progression, army building, sieges, battles). Imagine if developers created a Mount &amp; Blade fantasy game in the Warhammer universe. Playing as an Orc to plunder, ravage and spread WAAGH! Throughout the old World, or as a Human/Elf/Dwarf each with their own power struggles and Inter faction politics. The campaign would be a lot more epic as well. The Mount &amp; Blade campaign seems underwhelming to me, no story beyond the power struggles in the kingdoms. Bring in the Warhammer universe and the posibilites are endless. The gear system would be a lot more varied as well. With each faction specializing in their own weapons."
kvvui7,The Muppet Show (Minigame Collection/Party Game),"I was just reading some Muppets comics and this came to me. Basically, the game would come down to different ""episodes,"" which are a series of minigames based on skits from the show. Each episode could be based around a certain theme, and there could be a story mode where in-between minigames, the characters talk and interact behind the scenes. It could also have Stackler and Waldorf (the two guys on the balcony) as the ones rating your performance after each minigame. There could also be some sort of audience mechanic, where if you do poorly enough, they start leaving and you're left with empty seats. Thank you for your time. And if anyone else has already posted a similar idea, sorry, I didn't see it."
kvvhwp,Idea Opinion,"I have this idea for a game i want to make... Basically you have a random shape, the game selects two points on the shape somewhere and draws a line. You have to cut the shape between the points that are generated, the piece falls off. when you cut perfectly you get points, when you cut randomly you lose points. Once you get to the middle you get coins, which you can use to get upgrades(no purchases necessary), for example the points are slighly closer together, or the line is thicker. Any ideas for more spice?"
kvu8td,MMORPG Syndicate Wars,"Basically an online community of syndicates, cults, government and anarchists fighting over a huge city set in and based on the early Syndicate and Syndicate Wars games before EA bought it. So far it's a pretty flakey idea but it'd be cool to see the Syndicate universe made as an MMORPG.\n\nAgent players participate in third or first person as a citizen and may select one of the above mentioned factions as an agent or just go about their daily lives. When joining an organization they may run around the city and gun down their opponents or blend in and try to infiltrate opposing organizations as well as make personal purchases. When their character dies they are permanently dead then start again as a citizen on another randomized server. If agents go crazy and just mow down citizens (up to a 5 or more) they are expelled from the server then have to start again as a citizen elsewhere.\n\nMultiple players (4 maybe 5 or more) act as the 'leaders' like a RTS. They buy up properties as well as install its security such as auto-gun turrets, thicker walls, security doors and cameras then delegate the building with a purpose such as a consumer store, a church, an underground club, a governmental center, a research facility, arms manufacturing, cybernetic body manufacture and so on which may reduce the cost of items, increase the amount of time used to research items then create new ones or generate an income. The leaders also approve cybernetic upgrade requests for agents at the cost of the company, delegate them money as payments for work, approve satellite strikes, purchases battle droids, vehicles or heavy artillery such as tanks."
kvqrf9,Outlast fatal frame,Take the Outlast gameplay (minus the hide and seek style) and mix it with the ability to fight ghost using a camera. I think if done right we could have a really cool game. If anyone sees this and has stuff to add on I'd love to see how ambitious this can get.

kvntqp,Strategy/Manager,"Strategy game where you are leader, but instead of you controling each and every troop, you issue orders to your commanders/champions (depending on theme) and they would control armies depending on their skill/character/loyality so you can argue that this could be considered a more manager game that strategy.\nI think these game mechanics could allow some interesting features to be added like insurgency, familiy trees and succesion (and battle for it), traitors, ... I'm personally not a fan of linear storyline, but could even easely see some story added.\n\nI personally don't have time in my hands to make game of this scale, but my hope is that maybe someone else picks this up and considering how many additional features you can add and that lately there hasn't been any memorable strategy game (that do not focus on multiplayer aspect), this idea has really great potential IMO, what you think?"
kvn5tz,Why is there no coop focused games which are like Day Z but where you don't get killed or shoot on sight?,"I was messing with my multiplayer game I'm making when I had this idea.\n\nPremise - multiplayer instanced open world where you are encouraged to play with other people not fight , when looking for supplied to take make to base.\n\nYour base will be a hub like world with other survivors that will also go out on raids, you can queue up with others at the gates to leave into the waste land together to gather resources or go it alone\n\nThe waste land will be where you collect resources like food, water, wood etc, there are I don't know zombies. \n\nThe coop element - you are all start in a hub world with venders, each vender will have an opinion about you, so if your just shooting the shit out of players they will start to dislike you and give you less money or resources when trading. if you work together with strangers you get rewarded with better loot, trades etc. \n\nJust an idea I would like to share."
kvlwyc,Chemistry/Physics game,"I would imagine the player having an open book in front of them, a textbook filled with equations, elements, and a couple examples with what they can do with these tools. \n\nThe only things that they can spawn would be a whiteboard, pencils, notebooks, a computer, a map, a watch(coordinates, time, measurement, recorder, or flashlight) and a floating TV. These would be near essential tools depending on how the player would like to play. Ex. As the player could be playing a video of Veritasium while they perform their own lab in front of them. \n\nNow, how is one supposed to create when they can’t spawn in materials? I’d have them venture for it like in Minecraft, perhaps not survive but thrive in creation and development. There would be basic measurements for nature and perhaps you can use the watch as a teleportation device to get to certain places for materials, maybe borrowing things from the school (in game of course).\n\nWith the setup of the game, what would be the goals? I think finding notebooks of physicians would be one for physics and finding all elements and a note to be discovered for when you find each element to teach the player who the first person to find that element was and possibly hints to what they might’ve done used the materials for.\n\nOf course there’s plentiful that I have in mind that could be added, but I wouldn’t want to lose your interest through my perspective.\n\nExtras/Uneeded:\n\nI’ve always dreamt of creating an educational video game. But this one, I don’t want it to have that dreadful name to it. Of course though, I can’t work on many projects right now since I still have to deal with high school for a while, but I’ll be grateful if somebody would set a good example for this great source of imagination for those who can’t afford to test their imagination.\nThough if I could work on something like this with a team I could depend on, I would be elated to help study these fields and make sure that the game is the best it could be."

I'll handle the visuals in 2D, and even have a mobile version of the game.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are the traits, or elements rather, I want to utilize or restrict myself to:\n\n\*1. Some sort of procedural generation\*  \nCould be procedurally generated enemies, so each one is different with unique traits and makes for a new experience every time you play. Could be procedurally generated map, so that I can just design the generation once and there can be theoretically infinity levels.\n\n\*2. Single player, but utilizes global leaderboard\*  \nWith leaderboards added, it'll give the players some sort of incentive to be competitive and aim to grow shoot up in ranks. \n\n\*3. Must not require too many complex assets/graphics\*  \nAs I mentioned above, it's going to be a 2D game, and I can handle creating all the art myself.

kv7p9j,How I write my protagonists and antagonists | Plot,"So I don't do... Fantasy, or that wholehearted stuff - instead I do dark stories. The stories the whole community stopped doing in favor of the stuff they do, some good and some not --- that's just the truth. But to be holy honest all are just...meh, didn't add too much. \n\nSo. How I do my plots are grim and dark stories with mature audacity, like Agony (2018), that game was mature. An had a actual good story unlike the rest on here. I don't think too happy or sad, it's more on the 'both' scale. Don't have a happy ending, don't have a special character, don't give the character a plot armor or not be special. Have that character die even if they are the main character, have them lose an entire arm and not giving it back - in return making them disabled. I do like horror, psychological horror, cosmic horror, anything that isn't like a happy-go-lucky RPG. Like 'Death Stranding', that game had an amazing story, without giving any details. and I know you're thinking ""But Death Stranding isn't horror."" I know but it isn't a plot like any other boring plots, it's a plot that is fascinating none the less, I'm not just restricted to horror genre. I make my plots like a dark but not too edgy concept, it is hard but my brain can handle such process. Oh! And the story style I like was from the anime called 'School-Live' where the main character has a psychological issue where she thinks everything is normal, and people are still alive when she's in a zombie apocalypse, and the show still goes on with the Kawaii stuff transitioning to the zombie genre to kawaii genre, that is genius in my perspective. That's mainly my inspiration of genre, the rest of my little rant of course - to clear things up. \n\nAnd now the protagonist and others: So How I write mine (S) are...well don't make them important, I know that's the main problem everyone has here, make them a mongrel - don't make them plot armor, or yeah. I like to make them...a total useless character, the one I attempt at making a interesting one without making them into a total main character, sorta like a side + protagonist= Good character in my thoughts. If I give my characters a special ability I'd give them consequences for using it, like losing a...let's say...

And you have a chance to work those careers aka work in the ranks. \n\nHave a lovely day and if there is anything like this let me know, if there is something in works let me know or if anyone wants to make this let me know i could finance it easly"

kuy04g,"A game where every class has its own individual story, or at least feels really relevant to the plot","Star Wars the Old Republic (SWTOR)  is a good example, each class has its own story line, ship, companions, etc. Almost every other game just has you as some protagonist fighter and it doesn't really care how you go about it. SWTOR made me feel connected to my character because it wasn't a one size fits all story.   \n\n\nI'm not sure exactly how to go about this theme as far as genre, presentation, and gameplay go, but it would just so cool if you were a rouge and treated as a shady guerilla warfare expert, which would differ greatly from a respected scholarly wizard. Its really just a way to make roleplay seem more genuine."

kux2lh,"An simulation RPG that starts you with a randomly flawed character, and you are tasked with role-playing your quirky protagonist through quests in ways that will complete his unique character arc.","There is no world-saving main quest storyline in this game world. Rather, the story is what you make for the character you rolled. You roleplay them toward a goal and put them through situations that will force them overcome their fatal character flaws. If you succeed, they will have completed their story.\n\nUnder the hood of the game is essentially a character arc generator.\n\nThe game starts your protagonist with two randomized character flaws, much like the [negative quirks in Darkest Dungeon,](https://i.redd.it/1flaye2lqnd21.png). You then roleplay them in such a way to succeed despite their flaws so they have something to lose, hit rock-bottom, then play out their redemption arc to conquer their flaws once and for all.\n\nIf your character is a gambling addict who can't make friends, you have them gamble away their money and look for a party companion desperate enough to not turn you away. Then you have to go on enough quests to finally make them a friend, at which point you gamble away your party's earnings in roleplay so your friend leaves you.\n\nIn a sense, it's like if Darkest Dungeon and Dwarf Fortress had a baby that allowed you to take command of a single NPC to give them their own side story in the game's world."

kuu71f,A game where dying affects the story,"This is just a game idea which i think would be fun to play\n\nThe game would take place in medieval times and be a single player game, the games starts off with a party of 5 and the group of 5 wants to resurrect their 6th member which died many years ago\n\nThe goal of this game is killing bosses, not exclusively but it would be the games defining feature. in between the bosses the characters would travel through different dungeons and towns and fight mini bosses and doing quests. in this game characters wouldn't level up as a whole but rather they would level up certain skills kinda like skyrim. and they can collect loot they can use during boss fights.\n\nI want there to be at least 15 bosses excluding the final boss. During boss fights you cannot choose which character is fighting the boss, which motivates you to invest time into all of the group. each group member would fight at least 3 bosses giving every one a chance to die. \n\nDuring each boss fight there is no restarting, if your character dies during the boss fight then in the story he dies. If everyone in the party dies the story ends with all the characters dying. but if at least one makes it through the 15 bosses and gets to resurrect his friend i have an idea for whats to come.\n\nOne of the 5 killed the 6th and no one else knows about it. when the 6th gets resurrected and the 5th group member is still alive, the last boss fight will be the 6th against the 5th. its kinda hard to explain on Reddit but i think it would be a great twist for someone who got this ending, other endings might have similar twists also.\n\nAfter you ""beat"" the game you get 5 extra bosses unlocked and depending on the results of the final boss fight you can use the 6th group members as a character.\n\nGroup member ideas\n\n1 - Barbarian / brute like\n\n2 - Knight\n\n3 - Sorcerer\n\n4 - Wizard or mage\n\n5 - Archer\n\n6 - Previously assassin, now ghost assassin\n\nPlease reply with problems or ideas you might have noticed with my story or game idea, im very curious"
kusmq5,Looking for 3D multiplayer co-op survival game ideas,"Hi,My initial idea was a co-op Survival game with a D&amp;D-like stats system (with skills/ability checks).The graphics style would be low-poly and the perspective in First Person.\n\nI didn't really want to think about all the features at the beginning as i would probably start throwing everything that pops in my mind and ending up with an MMO (which is pretty unrealistic/really hard to make as indie).\n\nBut because I'm getting close to finishing the networking and starting implementing the actual gameplay and mechanics of the game I wanted to ask you guys if you have any ideas.\n\nThe thing I need the most right now is a goal that the player(s) would pursue, but feel free to share your thoughts and ideas about game mechanics that you'd like to see in this genre or an entire game concept, and if possible keep it simple because I'm not a AAA studio \^\^'\n\nThe amount of players can be anything from 2 to 100 (preferably not more than that) and the server management would be the classic player-hosted dedicated servers that appear in a list of a server browser inside the game (basically like Rust/ARK).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Share your first-person survival co-op game end goal and/or mechanics that you'd like to see."
kurc2a,Gameidea might be a dead end,"I started prototyping a little game (my first game) and don't know how to improve it to make it actually fun.\n\nHere is the basic idea I implemented so far: There are two players, a farmer who herds cows along a map into a barn and a UFO that tries to abduct the cows. \nThe farmer  basically has to walk behind the cows which will always walk away from him and if he walks too fast they will spread out and he has to lead them together to a bunch.\nThe UFO is basically hovering and can abduct the cows with its beam.\n\nI already implemented a level and the basic mechanics, there is only one problem: The game itself is quite boring. It is a bit cumbersome for the farmer to keep the cows together and lead them on the way and it is pretty easy for the UFO to abduct the cows. In some test runs, the UFO almost always wins, cause it is too easy for it (or too hard for the farmer, depending on the viewpoint)\n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to make this game fun? I'm almost about to throw this idea away because I can't figure out how to make it fun."
kupqkr,A short monster game about not being evil but people fearing you.,"I put intermediate because it depends on how you want to go about it. You could do a visual novel, sure, or you could go a more interactive route like Unity and make a first-person deal. You can go the overt or subtle route with the plotline, it's all down to what type of monster you imagine.\n\nThe first way, the overt, is more in your face and kinda a horror. You could go about your daily life, do a few things, but you slowly start seeing or hearing things. An axe in a tree, a glimmer of a person running by, you're basically being watched by humans as you just try and live your life, never bothering them. Possible endings include being killed, hiding in your lair out of fear, fighting back and giving them reason to hurt you, it's not very original but I just thought of it while typing so you can evolve with it.\n\nThe second way, the subtle way, is more of a stealth game or a walking simulator. You go around (I imagined a town or a city in my head), watching people, spying in windows, maybe taking a trinket or two. It's never proven you're a monster, there's no super powers or murder sprees, you're just someone who's people watching, enjoying their day (or night). You could make it so you NEED to avoid detection, you could have a moment where you run from pursuers, but the idea is ultimately that you're peaceful and curious, but still feared and hunted. Think Francoeur from Monster In Paris, when he's remembering how he came to be.\n\nAs I say, it's a simple game idea and short overall. If you want to go big, like REALLY big, sell on Steam big, you can expand the stealth idea, make it an open world game in a world hellbent on murderizing you just for existing as a creature different to them. But I'm just putting out the short version as an idea, hopefully it's interesting."

kuj7nr,Fighting game but choosing moves with machine learning,"Some time ago I tried playing Toribash, seemed like a extremely fun game but with the insane learning curve it has I gave up playing on the first two hours. \nThen today I saw [this video](https://youtu.be/PYylPRX6z4Q) (for speedrunning skip to 9:20) and I'm thinking about how cool would it be to choose ""analog moves"" from a given set, not predetermined but created at the moment, instead of setting up them in advance. Sure the technology is probably pretty young and fragile but seeing it in prospect that gives me the vision of much better fighting games with more realistic feeling and less fixed moves"
kuddjr,"A Battle Royale, but its Horde Survival with Teams of Players, like COD Zombies in an Open World","I just thought about an Idea and I think Fortnite has had Halloween Events similar to what you might think of when you imagine this Idea, but I will explain my Idea nonetheless.\n\nImagine a Battle Royale with a very vertical and open map, jumping between buildings, wallrunning, dash moves etc, first person. When I think of the movement I think of something a bit slower and more methodical than Quake, but faster than COD, recently played ULTRAKILL and really think something akin to that would fit well. All around the Map are Loot Chests, Random Drops of Loot and Horde Enemies who might drop better loot, you can rush through the map with your team of four and kill as much as you can. I imagine these aren't fodder zombies either, there are tiers of different horde enemies to kill, even some that might resemble a miniboss that can actually keep up with your movement, I think most enemies will be shooting since else they wouldn't do much harm to someone who can move as vertically and fast as the players. You'd have to kill some of those Miniboss enemies to get better gear. \n\nNow I think this will be a battle royale in a different style than others, since you won't have to worry much about other players, there won't be as many. They only become more problematic when the map shrinks and you now have to work around zombies and players to survive. Still think last one standing would be the most fitting, no other win condition like many battle royales tried recently. \n\nOne of my biggest gripes with Battle Royles and why I don't play them as often is that there is so much downtime that when action actually happens, you kind of need to get back into the groove. So having action to keep you on your toes all the time without the fear of people who might not be too skilled having a bad time because they just get killed by more skilled people who they werent ready for sounds like a good idea. I'm terrible in battle royales and I always die to some dude who literally curbs-stomps me because I wasn't ready. Making you always on your toes by filling the map with horde enemies and making players more noticable by giving them insane movement will give people more time to prepare and be ready for the next firefight. hopefully giving people who originally didn't like BRs for their action cycles a nice one to play."

kua6t6,"""procedural""(?) sci-fi cooking game","ingredients are defined by their tastes, textures, smells, consistency. think about the way we discovered certain ingredients pair well with each other because of complements or contrasts, and how cooking things a certain way will change their properties a bit! the game uses real-life ingredients, pairings, and recipes as a baseline; for example, we know apples pair well with cinnamon, and stuff like rice is neutral enough to pair with both sweet (for example, anko paste) or savory toppings. \n\nthe kicker is that the game might throw ingredients at you that are COMPLETELY alien; the names, shapes, and composition can be almost batshit. however, once you get a grasp of real-life ingredient pairings, you might find something sweet, crunchy, juicy - hey, that sounds a bit like a pineapple! i know that pairs with things like bananas or mango, what's the closest ingredient to a mango? as it turns out, some kind of alien meat product. of course, some ingredients might not have good real-world analogues and it might help to think outside the box.\n\nof course, it's not perfectly realistic, and there's definitely more factors than tastes and textures that factor into what makes a dish Good in the real world. however it can be a fun, silly exercise to come up with hypothetical dishes, and it has a lot of ""sandboxy"" potential. maybe you can make up new dishes to assemble in the real world! a game like this might fit a cartoony atmosphere on a spaceship or space-restaurant, to exaggerate the goofiness of the whole thing."

ku9v4z,Tactical strategy RPG with 2D fighter combat,"Ive had this idea since i was a child playing games like Shining Force and street fighter.\n\nWhat if in a tactical strategy game like fire emblem when you use your units to attack you are taken to a combat layer where you now have to react live in limited time, giving bonuses for initiating attacks, have support units with special attacks that require classic fighting game inputs to pull off, levelling system that opens up offensive and defensive options as you progress, specialty moves, desperation moves, combo chains, different classes and character specific classes that all have distinct playstyles.\n\nIve been looking for a game like this for years but it seems like a major headache trying to tweak. Worth it?"

ku7lpk,Shooter Training Course,"So I recently replayed Modern Warfare and just in general did a lot of military research and firearms, aiming practice. Anyways, I would like a game that takes Modern Warfare 1 and 2's training courses, along with influence of Hotdogs, horseshoes and handgrenades when it comes to weapon variety, SWAT (tactics, technology and potentially multi-player.) Along with various obstacles.\nAnd target practice course.\n\nOf course this isnt no triple A game just a fun little thing."
ku799b,US Special Forces (Green Beret),"So I just realized there is little to no media depicting Green Berets. Both movies and video games. I mean think about it? Likely the most famous groups are the Navy Seals and Delta Force. But Green Berets, while I am sure people know of them, they aren't really... popular? Cool? Ya know? So I am curious as to why that may be. But as this is a game idea of course, I would like to offer a more unique idea. I could tell you make a tactical shooter with green berets. But then your main selling point is their green hats. So a more interesting idea would be a game about running military courses? Maybe add different levels.\nSuch as boot camp, then you can move up to US Army Ranger training, and then Special Forces. \nCould mix elements of SWAT and Modern Warfare 1 and 2 training courses."
ku6qs8,Real Life Simulator/RPG,"Single player game.\nA game that takes place in a large city. Kinda like  Sims but it’s a third person RPG. You can have different jobs, cars, activities. You can have your own house, your own family. You can even be a dog. The game changes depending on how you interact with others, if you do crimes or not. Quests and missions are basically everyday tasks. You can buy stocks and companies. You can also choose which era you wanna be in, and the city will change depending on it. (Medieval, Modern, Futuristic, etc.)\n\nLevels are like age, every level you get up, you get older, unlock more rights, things like this.\n\nIt’s basically bitlife, but open world.\n\nI think it would be an interesting concept.\nLemme know if you like the idea."
ku67hm,A realistic shooter with fully procedural multiplayer maps,"Realistic shooter meaning a game along the lines of Red Orchestra, Insurgency, Squad, Post Scriptum, etc.  Start out with procedural maps that change every match.  Start out with wilderness only maps without buildings to make it a little more feasible.  Things like trees, rivers, cliffs, ravines, hills, fields, etc. could impact every game quite a bit.  This eliminates map memorization as arguably one of the most important skills and puts all of it on aim and tactics.  I realize this is probably very difficult otherwise someone would have done it by now."

Later in the game, you've discovered you done something terrible while blacked out and your other half has planted traps to impede your progress."
ku4u1n,Space Station Mystery that you must solve before it drifts apart.,"The central idea that captivated me was that most space games don’t use the void of space itself as a challenge. \n\nThe game starts off with casual life aboard a research station. An explosion goes off, breaking the station into 4 different parts that slowly drift away. As one of the last Security Officers, you must try to solve the nature of the incident, and save anyone that you can. As the game goes on, the different sections of the station get further and further apart, making it harder, to downright impossible, to travel between them all. \n \nGameplay: \nFirst person, light to no combat.  \n \nChallenges: \n1. Repair mini games that take real time,\n2. Requiring parts / key codes from other parts of the station,\n3. Everyone *seems* innocent, but clearly there are 1 or more guilty members who will accomplish *insert evil goal here* if you don’t figure out the mystery, \n4. Fix as many escape pods as you can,\n5. Finally, get as many innocent people off the station as possible. \n\nThe idea would be to fill the game with multiple times more puzzles, emergencies, people in danger, and audio logs / collectibles than you could realistically do before everything drifts apart. \n\nYou would need to carefully figure out who you should take, if saving someone was worth the time investment, if you should risk going to a far-off section with your limited jet-pack fuel, and of course, who the evil intruders are."

ku2l74,star wars game idea,an open world rpg where you can customise a young padawan and let it grow through teenage years to adulthood. not cannon but still not too far from star wars. just an idea i thought was cool
ku28ab,Need help refining a very basic Stealth game idea.,"First and foremost - feel free to use this idea for yourself! Yes, I am also making a game based on this, but I believe each person has a different way of thinking and will come up with something totally unique.\n\nSo about 2 months ago, in November, I got this amazing idea for a game. The character is a computer virus and their main objective can vary from stealing some files, to leaking information, creating a backdoor entry into the system, etc without being spotted and terminated. The ""guards"" in the game is the antivirus. Different levels have you infecting different machines, and as such, have different antiviruses with different characteristics. For example, one machine can have a free antivirus while another could have a paid one, with the paid one having more security features, making it a potentially harder level. Stealth I have in mind is thief and MGS inspired.\n\nA neat little ""powerup"" idea that I came up with is as follows:\n-Before deploying the virus to the target machine, the player can customize it by adding ""mods"", which are basically additional pieces of code to ""powerup"" your virus (eg. a security bypass into a specific folder, an encryptor if the virus is a ransomware, etc). Each powerup you add, however increases the virus's file size and larger sizes makes it seem more suspicious to the antivirus or the user of the machine. \n\nSo my problem: I can't for the life of me imagine what a level in this game would like. What I envision so far is that my ""virus"" is a spider, controlled in third person. However, due to a surprising lack of games taking place *inside* a computer, I have literally no idea what that would look like. \n\nHelp?\nMaybe you have better imagination than me and can think of something, or you have some totally random idea for the setting or theme that is not even remotely related to mine, please put it in the comments! Thanks!\n\n\n\n**TL,DR;** You are a computer virus and your objective is to infect computers, steal info, etc. I can't imagine how this would look, so I have grinded to a halt on the production, as I need something to work off of to make this thing."
ku0kgp,Blacksmith weapon creator game,"So I have had this idea for a while for a game in which you are well, a blacksmith. I searched for such a game but everything I've found seemed to be not quite what I wanted. Most of the games I found were like ""Fantasy Blacksmith"". While such a game has some ideas that I would like to see in the game I have been thinking about, it also vastly differs.\n\nSo getting to the point the idea is that instead of a limited pre modeled number of blades which you ""craft"" in some kind of minigame, it takes a realistic turn and you start out with a block of metal you have to heat up and model using tools as a real blacksmith would, and then be able to test them, the shape, weight and model affecting how it behaves. Also it would be nice to have something like materials from which you can choose to craft and each would have different properties, regarding it's durability or how easy it's hammered into shape.\n\n I can see how problematic to program this would be from many points of view. Some problems I thought of would be about how to make a system that lets you model a hot chunk of metal with hammers and pliers, since I have not seen anything of the like anywhere but I think this is still doable somehow. Another big problem I thought about would be about how do you calculate the durability of the blade in such a way that a very thin sheet of metal would not be the best blade to ever exist, as realistically such a thing would not be able to cut anything cause it would bend before cutting anything. Of course everything else like sharpness, force and durability are also quite hard to compute but I think they might not be as bad as the previously mentioned ones.\n\nI don't know if this is hard to program, or it's harder to get something in which you have decent FPS but nevertheless I think it would make for a great game or if not it would sure be an interesting mechanic to implement into RPGs as it would make the usually boring weapon crafting into something engaging that it could focus on a lot more."
ktwjjp,A surreal (horror...?) nature exploration game with your faceless classmate.,"A surreal (horror ...?) half- open world half- visual novel taking place in a forest-y area that appears normal on the outside, but has restricted areas only accessible by performing a ritual and doing witchcraft. The deeper you enter the forest, the more surreal the area and its inhabitants become, your goal is to document as many organisms and landmarks you come across with your faceless classmate for a school project.\n\nThe forest is divided into several areas, each requiring a more ‘advanced’ ritual to enter. The rituals range from making cute dream hangers from twigs found on the ground to hunting invasive glass deer-like creatures THAT SHATTER when they die!!! There are shops where you buy food and items, many of them offering you tasks to do in exchange for money. The game takes place over a course of several weeks, every day you will receive a list of recommended tasks you should do, but the game allows you to make your own list as well. Because the forest you’re in is a dangerous place, you will have to stick with your classmate and spend (at least a little) time with him! The game does not allow you to run off on your own for longer than a few days because that classmate of yours has EXPERIENCE and does not want you to get killed or accidentally summon some stupid evil fairy.\n\nYou interact with only your classmate, some friends over the phone, residents, and the business owners you come across during your journey.\n\n**Inspirations:** Danganronpa (game mechanics) and livinthefuture on Instagram (art and game visuals) but really I just like exploring nature because THERE IS NONE in the place I live."

ktnv07,Ideas for a ghostly puzzle platformer?,"Hi, please forgive me if this post doesn't belong here, but I wanted to get some ideas for a game I'm working on. This is a 2D platformer (made in Gamemaker) where the main game mechanic is possessing different NPCs to traverse levels.

List of missions? Save or kill NPCs?). Just getting to the end of each level seems a bit stale to me. Also, I don't really have a story idea yet. Come at me with your creative plots.  \n\nIf you're interested, please feel free to share any ideas (but only if you don't mind me possibly stealing them - you'd certainly be listed in the credits but I have no idea if/when this would be finished, as it's just a passion project of mine). Overall, it will be driven by platformer controls, but I've got most of that perfected already and want to focus on the puzzles and world-building.  \n\nThanks, and happy gaming my dudes."
ktncw1,"A game like Escape From Tarkov, blended with the setting from The Division. Throw in the zombies from DayZ for good measure.","You’re a leading member of a group of survivors. \n\nIt’s New York City.\n\nIt’s winter time. \n\nYour people are cold. Starving. Can barely defend themselves. \n\nThe zombies are a serious threat, but so are the other groups of survivors fighting to stay alive in the ruins of NYC. \n\nYour goal? \n\nInfiltrate different areas of the city at varying times of the day or night (your choice), gather supplies, kill enemy players if you come across them. Take their stuff if its valuable. Then, find an extraction point and get out of there with all of your valuable loot to build up your hideout and ensure that you and your people will be able to survive against this zombie outbreak. \n\nLike EFT, you’ve got two options: \n\n1. Scav run (Call it something else if you want), every so often you get to send out a member of your group of survivors. He/she will spawn in with a random set of low to mid-tier gear. Basically no risk in sending them out because it’s free and there’s no real penalty if they die. \n\n2. PMC run (Call it something else, of course), your main character goes out there with your loadout of choice. You have a secure container that you can store stuff in that you will keep even if you get killed out in the field, which you don’t have on scav runs. But the secure container is small, so you have to decide what’s worth going in it. Other than that, same deal. Loot. Scavenge. Kill. Survive, then extract. \n\nAll of the same mechanics from Tarkov (maybe simplify the bullet systems), just in a Division-type New York City winter setting with zombies. \n\nThe zombies are slow, none of them are runner zombies, ever. If they were able to run, this would force every player into a stealth meta of staying crouched and quiet all the time so as to avoid having to get into fights with sprinting zombies. \n\nNo, these zombies just walk. This keeps running around and making noise as you usually do in EFT safe and viable. But what it means is that over time those few zombies trailing behind you can eventually start to form entire mobs, which can become a problem. \n\nIt also forces you to stay on the move. Can’t camp a perch for too long, can’t sit in a room looting for too long. Quick decision making would become routine and thinking with your feet often would take precedent. Might just have to leave that guy’s dead body behind even if you didn’t get to fully search his backpack. \n\nThe zombies themselves would be scattered all over the map, and some of them would naturally spawn in as full-sized mobs, so a wary sniper can’t simply look over at a mob of zombies across the way and automatically assume that that means a player is nearby — they’d have no clue if the zombies simply spawned that way or if a player caused that to happen. \n\nAI scavs would also dot the map all over the place, just like in EFT. They regularly get into fights with Zombies. Everyone is fighting a three-front war, basically. The other players, the scavs, and the Zombies. \n\nWhat this means is that the sound of gunfire and combat all across the map would be a constant thing. Rather than how EFT usually is which is about 10-15 minutes of pure silent looting before suddenly hearing a gunfight pop off nearby or get involved in one yourself. No, in this game action is a constant so you always have to be on your toes. \n\nThe zombies themselves have a chance to drop minor loot, usually just a few rounds of ammo or maybe some minor valuables, things you can pawn off to traders. \n\nIf you die in a PMC run as your main character, your injuries persist after death. You can either wait out an in-game timer before your character is fully healed again, pay for medical services, use your own medical supplies to immediately heal yourself, or go back into another PMC run all fucked up from the last time if you’re really that desperate to get back into the action for some reason.\n\nWeapon selection would be a little more slanted towards primarily firearms of American origin rather than Russian, though of course some popular Russian weapon type exports would still be available, such as different types of AKs and such. There’d be a greater selection of common “civilian” type weaponry— the kind of self-defense/hunting firearms you typically find in gunstores. Bolt action hunting rifles, shotguns, sidearms that Americans typically open carry, etc. Would make the higher tiered weapons of military surplus type equipment more valuable. \n\nAdditionally, throw in an optional “Hardcore” mode— Where the winter weather becomes an additional threat to your survival. You have to make sure you’re dressed appropriately for the cold weather... but the problem is, the more layers you wrap up in, the slower your character is. But on the flipside, your pockets can also hold just a little bit more loot. Have to decide just how much you want to wrap up, because no matter how many layers you have on, the cold will be a constant threat in Hardcore. Can’t risk too much cold exposure, gotta come inside or find a heat source at least every once in a while. Limbs can take frostbite damage that slowly makes you less effective in combat over time. \n\nThe upside to it? The zombies have a hard time surviving the cold, too. Mother Nature is inadvertently helping you out, a bit. Freezing zombies in place making them no longer a threat, freezing their limbs so badly they fall off and can no longer swing their arms at you or even walk. \n\nHardcore mode, fighting off the cold at the same time as everything else, ultimately results in emphasizing speed over everything else when going into raids. Grabbing what you can and getting the fuck out of there before your character gets too cold to even be able to hold his gun steady."
ktml6i,"A relaxing city builder where instead of building sprawling cityscapes of skyscrapers and districts, you focus on growing a small suburban town.","This just came to me, and I'm surprised I've never personally seen anything like it before. Imagine City: Skylines, but scaled waaaay down. You're not building a city, your building a small, middle America town with good, simple people. \n\nThere would of course be your usual city builder elements, road construction, planning, deciding on laws based on what's going on in the town, and so on. However, I think the unique gimmick would come from a focus on individual characters. Every character would come with a simple backstory, a set of stats, and relationships to other characters. Think CK3 characters, but once again scaled way down. Less feudal, more neighborly.\n\nYou would assign characters to certain roles within the city, like sheriff, and watch them live their lives. In terms of minute to minute goals, i'm imagining a sort of random event type of mechanic. You might be faced with a big company wanting to buy out a whole neighborhood to build a megamall, and you, as town leader, would make choices that affect how those events play out. Different characters would have different opinions on each event and your choices would lead to new developments in their lives. Additionally, each character would have random events happen to them individually, though the player would only be notified if these when it directly impacted a characters ability to fulfill their role within the town. Through each character's page you'd be able to see a break down of their entire story so far. \n\nIn short, the game would take aspects from both city builders and the CK games and scale them down to simpler variations. The point would not be to grow or conquer, but rather to experience the history and story of your town as it plays out. All of this would be set to a lo-fi score and minimal graphical design to make the world pop and breath for a relaxing, story telling experience."
ktjp93,100 rando survival,"Main idea:\n\n100 random players are dropped into disaster situation (ala Disaster Report or Day of Crisis) and must escape the oncoming death i.e. tornado, rising tide, raining fire eruption, etc. Zombie Apocalypse?\n\nThe game area may be urban, rural, wilderness. Many paths to take, but each one has their obstacles. The fastest path would always be the path that requires teamwork. Can you trust your fellow randos to come together and put in effort to save more than themselves? \n\nCan you sacrifice a win for someone else's?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote:\n\nNot necessarily to be a core of a game but rather a game mode on the side of a party multiplayer game. Not enough couch games that go online.

You tell me). \n\nI'm not asking for a new game, I'm asking what is your actual favest game and why so in order to create something as addictive (but with a new idea)."
kt7v5v,Titan Tipper (a cross between Super Meat Boy and Shadow of the Colossus),"First off this is idea is not related to Attack on Titan or any other IP. I use the word ""Titan"" for the fun alliteration. The basic idea is the player is part of a swarm attack of tiny soldiers trying to bring down a giant single enemy that acts as both level and antagonist. The player plays as a single soldier until they die, then spawns as the soldier behind them. They get to watch the ghost image of their earlier lives as they press their own assault."
kt69fl,Either a new game or complete overhaul of Civilization where you play as a soldier.,"I honestly think this would be incredibly amazing to see.\n\nEssentially, the game would strategically operate the same to Civilization. However, the difference would be on how battles are done.\n\nInstead of just commanding soldiers to attack other soldiers like some RPG mechanic, you physically place yourself *in the war they're fighting* as one of the soldiers you send out. There would be gun or melee options, like in some FPS, depending on the technological advancement and unlocked weapons of your civilization. (Swordsmen only have swords, infantry have old gun models, jets have modern weapons, etc)\n\nSoldiers would also be reduced to numbers rather than physical units. You garrison a certain amount of units at any outpost or city, which would also double as the amount of soldiers defending that specific area. Battles would start either by you moving your garrisoned troops to enemy territory, or by enemies moving their troops toward your territory. If the territory has no garrisoned troops, it is conquered instantly. If it does, then a battle sequence will start. The ""join battle"" option will be completely optional though, and you can either fight in the battle or just leave it to the AI.\n\nIf you choose to fight in the battle, you will be controlling one of your soldiers. Whenever the soldier you're playing as dies, you switch control to another soldier still in the battle (NPCs will fight aswell). Once all your soldiers are gone, however, the battle sequence will end. If you are on the *defensive* side, this means you will have lost the city and it will get conquered by the enemies. If you are on the *offensive* side, your troops will be gone but the damage done will still remain. I'm sure you can guess what would happen if you won the war.\n\nHowever, there is also an option to send reinforcements from troops garrisoned in different areas. The only catch, though, would be on how their time of arrival would depend on their distance away. If the troops don't arrive in time, and all your fighting troops die, you will still lose the war. If they do arrive, though, then they'll obviously just join your military fighting force.\n\nObviously, this would only be when it comes to military troops. Stuff like scouts or settlers could require stuff like military escort routes (which can maybe be sabotaged by enemy troops).\n\nBut yeah, overall, I genuinely would love to see this become either a mod or (most likely) an entirely different game altogether. Civ 6 is definitely not a bad game, and is far from it, but to some people (like me) it can become boring having the simplistic RPG combat system for what seems like a military-based war game."
kt4pbi,Just an idea for a 3D superhero game.,"So . . . It's a superhero-esque game, with simplistic 3D features. you'll be a flying superman that punches giants monsters and launch laser beams at them.\n\nYou will fight monsters that invade some kind of city you reside in. Some other superheroes with special abilities will help you fighting the monsters. Finally, after each round, you will fight big monster bosses.\n\nThe huge monster bosses will be funny and comic-esque. Your character will occasionally give speeches about freedom, love, justice, etc.\n\nAfter the speech, or after you defeat the boss monster, you will return to a house of some kind, where it seems that you live alone. You can interact with some things in your house. Just for fun, not plot changing. To end the day, you can sleep in your bedroom.\n\nAfter you sleep, you will wake up in a darker version of your room, with lesser items or some kind. There will be somethings that are covered in red auras. Your character will automatically run away if he's too close. There are some auras that are dimmer. If you proceed to approach it, it will reveal red shapes that seems to have monochrome patterns, some which are random numbers and texts, some are random drawings.\n\nIn the darker room, you must search for 'A glass of water."" You must then drink it. After that, you have to exit your room, and go to the 'Cleansing Room.""\n\nYour house will be a little darker.  And there will be one or two ""Demonic Presences"". They appear as glowing red humanoids. They move randomly. If your character if too close, he will run away. You must maneuver through your house to enter this room. \n\nAfter entering this room, a loading screen appears. And after it loads, you will be out of the room. You must go to the bed and sleep. While moving through your house, you will encounter the demonic presences again, and you must get past them.\n\nLater in the game, you will be rewarded with some key items, The Book of Light, The Astral Trigger, The Holy Water, and The Holy Fire.\n\nThere will be some bosses that are creepy and grotesque, and you must fight them alone. They will insult you, or say generally bad and depressing things. After beating them, you wake up again in the darker version of your house.\n\nThe final boss, which you will fight after fighting a super big monster as a superhero, is a doppelganger of yourselves. Insults will appear on random text boxes that appear frequently when fighting him. Finally, when the main battle is over, the screen will turn into a hall of some kind. \n\nThe doppelganger will give a rant about how useless and bad are you, and occasionally talk about ""Them"", which he will portray as two evil beings that manipulate himself and you. And about how sad and miserable you actually are.\n\nThe doppelganger will then give you three offers :\n\n1. To be free from your misery and achieve happiness : You will be instructed to take the Astral Trigger, point it at him, and then trigger it. The Astral Trigger is then revealed to be a gun of some kind. He instructs you to shoot him. After you shoot him, the screen cracks, and after awhile, it goes all white. You will then acquire the **""Happy Ending""**\n2. To purify the demons which control you : You will be instructed to pour the holy water through the halls, and after that, you will drop the holy fire. Lights and aurora will appear through the hall, and soon, the screen shifts into a white screen. You will get the **""Vengeance Ending""**\n3. To reject his offers : The hall will soon crumble, and you will automatically wake up in the darker version of the world. A cutscene happens, where your character will walk to a table, and turn on the table light. He will then proceed to read a book, and finally, the screen shifts and displays ""**Redemption Ending**"". \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nAlso, should this game get a psychological horror tag?"

kt0dmg,"An open world, Pokemon RPG where you can play as Pokemon you catch and battle in real-time","Don't have anything super detailed but I'm imagining an open world game set in the Pokemon universe. You create your own character and go out on your own Pokemon adventure, similar to recent games in the franchise. Though, when you catch Pokemon, you can choose to play as them and walk around the world as them. Literally controlling the Pokemon, as your trainer follows you around as an NPC. Each pokemon could have unique stats (some can run faster, some can jump higher, some can swim quicker than others, etc). If you need to fly to a location, you can switch POV/control to your Charizard and literally fly him through the sky.\n\nBattles would be in real-time, perhaps similar to Pokken Tournament. As you do battles and complete world tasks as Pokemon, you level up and unlock perks for that Pokemon. Maybe each Pokemon has their own skill tree.\n\nI was thinking there could be several different types of missions to do, some requiring you to play as your trainer, some requiring you to play as a specific type of Pokemon. The game could include a limited loot system where you can find potions, equipment, or even cosmetics (a way to finally give your Pikachu a hat or scarf to wear during its battles). \n\nI know it's ambitious and would be a very experimental title, but I could see it being a hit. What do you guys think?"

ksnryu,"A driving action-adventure game with fixed camera angles. When the camera switches to the next section of road, you'll have to quickly react to what shows up. It's not a racing game though...","The idea was inspired by the trailer to [art of rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQiukq82xs) (a fantastic indie BTW) to which I started imagining myself controlling the game through the cinematic camera angles used in the trailer.\n\nThis game idea wouldn't be a racing game however. Instead it would be an action-adventure game set through the winding roads, streets, alleys and backroads of a strange mountain borough. In a sense, the control and camera system is akin to the original Resident Evil, except zoomed-out to an eerie mountain township. The slower-paced moments would be punctuated by scripted action setpieces with you chasing down or outrunning pursuers.\n\nFor example, one action setpiece might have you trying to escape into a mountain tunnel with the camera pointed back at your pursuers, then the next shot points forward to reveal an oncoming train, then again backward to help you avoid the ramming attacks by your pursuers (but now you don't know how close the oncoming train might be) until nearing the tunnel exit the camera switches forward once more with barely enough time to let you decide which way to steer out of the train's path."

ksco2d,Openworld Time Travelling(Environment Adaptation)single player game,"This game should feel like a God of War 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima and some of the other popular 3rd person single player games.\n\nYou (Bruce) will be a cyborg very early in the game that will lead you to find a 9yr Old Ancient Egyptian girl (you can't understand her at all even with your translator) in 2100 where you will go on a time travelling journey that Bruce can't properly control and so visits multiple timelines in different countries.\n\nEach timeline and country will force Bruce to adapt to the culture around him by generating specific clothing each time that gives different play style and abilities that will give a different and unique new experience to each timeline you visit. \n\nFor example, in a visit to ancient Japan, you'll go to different parts of it, one in which you'll fight like a Samurai, one on one, no sneak attacks and just your katana and arrow and bow. The other part, you'll play like a ninja, sneaking and throwing shurikens and smoke bombs! Medival England, you'll fight like a traditional Knight \n\nBruce has certain constant abilities. Primarily, you have a constant ability in which you pick a weapon from the enemies or surrounding or buy from someone, when you hold the weapon, it is upgraded to a technologically advanced weapon, for instance, holding a katana will make it a lightsaber like Katana. \n\nYour Dog(Rex) acts as a guide, instead of having to open the map every time, he leads you to the main objective. Since you are a Cyborg, you also have beams of different colours showing what tier this place is(Main or Side quest) and you can also choose the location to go to in which your dog will lead you there. No need to open the map and try to navigate through it all. \n\nBruce will do a small sidequest at the beginning that is mandatory so he's able to buy food, which is needed for him to charge his time machine(2100 is a bit more futuristic than now but nothing crazy. Bruce is the first cyborg and is infused with nanotechnology that functions like his normal human cells, as in they aren't charged rather take glucose and other food minerals to produce energy to maintain themselves and reproduce when necessary)\n\nAlthough in 2100, it looks familiar to ours, back in the past like in Medival England, Scotland,etc. you might face some mythical monsters such as were Wolves, Vampires or Lochness Monster, Dragons,etc. Laying traps to hunt them and many similar mechanics from Horizon Zero Dawn. (But these monster huntings are rare and not overused)\n\n(The game preferably would be a trilogy with around a total of 180hrs, 60hrs of average gameplay per game)\n\nSome of the locations you'll go to and their timelines include:\n\nStone Age\n\nAncient Egypt \n\nMedival Japan\n\nMedieval England\n\nAncient China\n\n2019 America\n\n(There are so many different times and locations that'll be visited, these are only few examples)\n\n(The following is just the brief story- not much details)\n\nGame opens with a cutscene of you (Bruce) and your best friend (Dwayne) in year 2100 recieveing a mission as secret agents. You start playing with quick and efficient Tutorial on how the gameplay works, picking up a weapon and fist fight combos (similar to Spiderman and Miles Morales hand to hand combat) and during the game you are overpowered, killed and see Dwayne running to you, the character's eye close. Cutscene starts and Bruce opens his eyes to find he has cybernetic parts and freaks out seeing scientists working on his body. He breaks free and is mad but Dwayne holds him down and Bruce's Dog (Rex) calms him down. Bruce talks to Dwayne while the scientists are covering his cybernetics with artificial skin to look normal. \n\nBruce's boss walks in and is giving a new mission to them, Bruce tells him to fuck off and he leaves the agency for good with his dog. Minutes later he is hit by thieves and goes into a comma. When he wakes up he finds out they took Rex with them. He is mad and while trying to find those crooks, you get another hidden tutorial to discover your new abilities as a Cyborg, such as UV Vision and laser beams, Plasma Canon, etc. You'll fight 2 mobs before you face a mini boss, once you defeat him, a cutscene starts and you force him to talk. Bruce then chokes him and you go to the location he said your dog is kept at. You kill multiple hordes of crooks. Find your dog and then you scan there computers to find that your agency are behind this as a way to get you back in the job. Rex is barking at a far distance and you follow him to find that there's someone crying. It's a 9 Yr old girl. \n\nA cutscene starts and Bruce tells Rex to come along so they can leave but he doesn't want to and keeps signaling to him to free her. The girl looks at him and he frees her. The girl's cloth look nothing like any modern clothes. Bruce is going outside and he is then attacked by his old agency and they capture him. \n\nScreen goes black and then slightly opens to a wierd dream in which it would be shown the reason he freed that girl was because she looks alot like his daughter who was captured alongside his wife and both killed by an enemy agency. \n\nBruce then wakes and you are in control now, you hack the technological handcuffs that hold you and free your dog who's in the same room. Rex functions as an easy guide to follow to achieve the main objectives and you go into rampage mode where you kill anyone that tries to stop you. \n\nYou reach to where that girl is kept and find Dwayne guarding her. You find that she's a 9yr old girl from ancient Egypt with some interesting abilities that were the reason the agency kept her- for study purposes. You fight Dwayne and when you pin him down, he accidentally shoots Rex, Bruce changes his Arm into a blade and scars Dwayne's face and rushes to get Rex and take the girl while they are running away and he goes to the lab where he quickly grabs a time machine(in a watch format) that infuses in his skin and he quickly escapes with Rex and the girl. They jump into 2019 first and he tries to help Rex sustain the wound which he accidentally heals through cybernaticlly fusing Rex with some of his Nano cells that make Rex have special powers as well as better guiding system.\n\nFrom this moment forward you wander each timeline to find a place that you can buy food from and each time you eat, there will be a small cutscene of you eating and overhearing some people talking about some stuff that will be mapped as side quests, most sidequests are ones you aren't forced to do, but you can do for a benefit in gameplay efficiency later."

ksb7gs,An action-based hack and slash reverse-Pokemon styled game where you combat and capture creatures to make yourself stronger.,"As the player progresses through the game, they can unlock more areas to serve as hunting grounds to either kill or contain a gallery of creatures and beings both original and folklore and myth inspired. Exploring hard-to-reach areas or fulfilling certain conditions can reveal different creatures of various rarities, with rarer creatures being harder to fight and contain but tending to offer better abilities.\n\nAs for the abilities themselves, one could draw comparisons to how Final Fantasy VII's Materia system. As the player progresses, they unlock more slots which captured creatures can be loaded into. The loaded creatures can offer weapons, active abilities, passive abilities, abilities that trigger under certain conditions, or just stat boosts. When the player kills creatures with creatures loaded, they can level up to offer more or enhanced capabilities.\n\nContaining a creature is very similar to Pokemon in that you have to weaken it first, but you have different methods available that can affect the margin of capture. The simplest would be a beam that adds to a meter that scales with the creature's current HP that once full contains it, however ""boss"" or ""legendary"" creatures would be impervious to this method unless certain steps were taken first. Some creatures need to be ""flushed out"" by fulfilling certain conditions. Some creatures live in ""lairs"" that feature gimmicks that either need to be interrupted to capture or kill the creature or can make it vulnerable to capture or death. Some creatures need to be caught in certain traps to be made vulnerable to containment, but will break free if left unattended for too long.\n\nExamples:\n\nSalamander:\n\nFireball: Can be changed to explode in a radius.\n\nBurning Claw: A slashing attack that burns.\n\nFire Elemental: Fire attacks heal, take double damage from water attacks.\n\nLiving Armor:\n\nSteel Blade: Equip a slashing sword.\n\nSteel Spear: Equip a piercing polearm.\n\nSteel Shield: Equip a shield that can neutralize all damage from the front when raised. Vulnerable to electricity.\n\nWood Elf:\n\nElven Archery: Equip a bow.

ksa3y5,A progression-based action psuedo-MMO with platforming and RPG elements.,"It's primarily a mission and instance-based and set across various world types, each with their own distinct gimmicks, events, and galleries of NPCs and enemies. Each mission can be as simple as reaching a goal at the end, finding or accomplishing multiple objectives, completing a dungeon with multiple puzzles scattered throughout, a boss fight, or something else entirely.\n\nThe player has a gallery of playable characters at their disposal acquired through progression, each with their distinctive weapons, fighting style, super/magical abilities, and at least one unique ability. Most of a character's capabilities scale off of their level, which range from 1 to 100 and can be upgraded through rewards obtained from completed missions or gathered within missions.\n\nThe RPG elements in accordance to stats aren't expressed as numbers but are more described as tier-based, in order of Extremely High, Very High, High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low, Low, Very Low, and Extremely Low.\nThe stats are as follows:\nHP:\nThe ammount of damage a character can take before needing to switch to another in the party. The player has many opportunities to restore a character's HP.\nMP: The resource needed to perform the character's abilities. Filled as segments of a bar through standard gameplay.\nDefense: the number of times a a character can neutralize all damage through their Guard action. If depleted, puts the character in a Guard Broken status where they can't attack, Guard, or move until they regenerate one Guard Point. If a character raises their Guard for a moment instead of holding it, it becomes a Deflect instead which deducts an enemy's Defense on contact.\nDefense Regeneration: How quickly one point of a character's Defense will regenerate. At low HP Levels, a character will enter a Pressed state where Defense Regeneration is greatly diminished, same for enemies.\nAttack Power: The ammount of damage a character's standard attack can do.\nAbility Power: The ammount of damage a character's abilities can do. An attack-based Ability with an Extremely Low Ability Power will always do slightly more damage than an Attack with an Extremely High Attack Power.\nAttack Resistance: How much of an enemy's Attack power is deducted from the character's damage \nAbility Resistance: How much of an enemy's Ability power is deducted from the character's damage.\nMovement Speed: How fast a character moves.\nAttack Speed: How fast a character can attack or raise their Guard."

ks80gm,AAA Co-op,"As I’ve been searching for a good game for me and my wife to enjoy together, I’ve come to the realization that, there really isn’t much AAA game experience. When I say AAA experience I am referring to games like Assassins creed / last of us / cyberpunk etc. this excludes mmo gamers like destiny, and battle royal games. Those games typically are very repetive, have little or no engaging story, and are convoluted. Not great if you want an in depth game with story narratives and varied gameplay that you could spend over 100 hours in.\n\nWhat I have not found many of, are games like fallout 76 or dying light. The fact that fallout 76 is the only open world fully co-op/multiplayer RPG is mind boggling to me. It’s no where near perfect but we can craft, build, or play what is similar to a single player version of fallout. Dying light has similar appeal but not as much content to keep going for100+ hours.\n\nIn addition, none of these co-op games strays too far from the standard themes and gameplay elements of multiplayer. For instance, most survival games are similar while, many of which are post apocalyptic. However, non try to take on things like rebuilding society, or utilizing the relationships with “co-op” characters in any meaningful way. A lot of times you get a silent protagonist that seems to not be important in any way yet the game try’s to make you feel like they should be. The base building is mostly geared towards multiplayer defenses but offers little utility beyond that or crafting. If fallout 4 was multiplayer I feel like it would be a bit closer in touching on the rebuilding of society, but even then I feel like we are missing opportunity for some really fun co-op. Also sharing the experience of a story and it’s events is really nice. \n\nI apologize for the word vomit as it’s late, but I’d really like to see someone focus less on mass multiplayer games and more on deep co-op and multiplayer experiences. I’ve got lots of ideas I wish I could see. Like a mass effect style rpg with the ability to build, craft, and form a society. Maybe some of the multiplayer aspect is like death stranding, where random built items can populate someone’s instance, maybe there is a strong choice system and various ways to either form or be part of a society."

kryyls,I need ideas for a pixel 2d game. It is my first major 2d game.,"Edit: As request I have some more info \n\nGenres like Adventure, Strategy, or Management.\n\nI want people to have freedom in it like if it was a city builder they can place things where they want, or an adventure game where you choose what to do next."
kry310,"A metroidvania where the character gains allies with different abilities, rather than skills of their own, in order to progress.","I love metroidvanias - they are my favorite genre of game - but they always seem to be solo affairs, with a character alone in a new world having to learn and become powerful in order to explore further. But in real life, developing relationships with other people is the primary source of progress and success.\n\nSo suppose that what your character can do, is absolutely static and unchanging, but you can interact with other characters, developing relationships with them (through some kind of quest arcs where you prove your worth to them), and getting them to join you on expeditions to explore new areas. These new areas themselves contain resources or treasures or information or etc which can be used to convince other characters to ally themselves with you, and so on. The goal is to develop, and maintain, your network of allies, and with their aid to move through whatever the overarching storyline is.\n\nPerhaps along the way you have to choose your allies in such a way that some people will become enemies instead, and this permanently influences where you can go and what you can do in the game, so that you'd have to play it through again to see what might have happened if you'd made different connections. This could be a way to gate different endings etc.\n\nNow that I actually write all this out, it sounds a bit like Mass Effect!"
krxj9l,A mechanic to make infections in zombie games actually means something.,"Usually in games being bitten by a zombie means you just take damage, even though for everyone else being bitten means inevitable infection. A way to balance this out so bites aren’t instant death but still carrying danger is this:\n\nIf bit, you’ll unlock an infection meter. An infection meter is like health, except that it very very slowly rises. If it reaches the top it’ll transform you into a zombie, killing you. Being bitten again only makes it go faster. How do you prevent being killed by this? You scavenge a specific medication that lore wise was made by the government before the fall. This medication lowers your infection, but it doesn’t cure you, meaning that your infection levels will rise again. This means that for the rest of the game you’ll have to always be looking out to scavenge this medication, because going to long with it will kill you. This will also make the medication rare, who knows, maybe others will try to raid you for it."
kru4ek,Most ideas here are like backstories,"I try to keep an open mind while browsing the ideas posted here, some give me inspiration, but most are more like intro to a game - like with a narrator telling you a story about why your character is there. Then there’s nothing. \n\nAnd the scale. Why does it have to be impossibly big? Adding infinite features to the idea doesn’t make it great. “A rogue-like minecraft-y cyberpunk post-apocalyptic open-world multi-planet system, with zombie-like vampires and werewolf mario-looking pokemons, with customizable weapons which you craft by harvesting and magic system which combines elements to make 100+ spells, played in a turn-based battle royale MMORPG survival mode.”\n\nMake the idea simple. “An apple fighting worms to survive”."
krtsnj,Archery Castle Defense FPS for mobile devices,I have an idea for a game where the player is an archer that defends a medieval castle from an enemy assault force. The player shoots arrows from a FPS perspective but moves by clicking on fixed defensive positions in the castle from a top down map. \n\nEach defensive position will have a limited field of fire and repositioning between different positions to cover the current phase of the enemy assault will be an important game play mechanic. As the enemy takes over parts of the castle the defensive positions the player can redeploy to get fewer and fewer until the player is forced into a last stand or the enemy morale breaks and the assault routes.\n\nThe alternative movement mechanic is to enable compatibility with a touch screen device.

krs3az,A first person battle royale with customizable abilities,"(I’d like to preface by saying I’m not too well versed in gaming so if a game like this already exists please let me know :) )\n\nI came up with this idea and thought it could be fun\nIt’s a battle royale with 100 players meant to be played with 1-5 friends but you can go solo if you want. You can find weapons around the map but the pièce de résistance is the ability system\nEveryone has 4 abilities that they can choose at the same place you’d apply cosmetics:\nYou have a passive ability which sort of runs in the background and doesn’t have a cool down\nYou have a minor ability which do small but useful things \nYou have a major ability like a minor one but more powerful with longer cool down\nFinally you have an ultimate with big reward but an enormous cooldown.\n\nAbilities are categorized by what they do and can be damage, defense, or support. Simply put, damage abilities are for taking health, defense abilities are for preserving health, and assist abilities are for giving health. Passives have a movement category that allows for gliding, double jumps, and faster running.\n\nThe core mechanic as previously mentioned is letting players fully customize their build to find what best fits their play style. You can also choose from presets if you prefer and save builds you like.\n\nI think this could allow for some fun game modes like a scramble where your abilities are chosen at random, a mode where you can’t use abilities, or a mode where you can only use a certain category of abilities (i.e. only defense or only damage)\n\nI’ve explained it the best I could. If you have any questions, ideas, or criticisms please comment them.\n\nTl;dr: Overwatch but battle royale and you can choose what abilities you have"

krm1l3,Bones management,A game where you have a limited amount of bones to insert in your body (would start with a human character but it would shift to more complicated and fantastic creatures) and you have to fulfill tasks that require certain limbs. Maybe in a level you need both arms to pull some levers but you wouldn't have to be standing because you can crawl to the exit. In another you need at least one leg and one arm because you have to reach a high positioned lever.\n\nI imagine it something like Saw's escape rooms but for zombies and undead creatures
krk41w,"A battle royale game with few players per match (around 20), maps set in a single large building (think a hospital or a prison), few guns with most weapons being melee, and an alliance system that allows you to betray teammates.","Since this game is going for a more grimy tense feel, the theme reflects that. Bombs in the neck, run down settings, a mysterious announcer on tv telling you what to do. Anyways, the game would start off with you waking up in a random area of the map, maybe close to other players. Only one player can win. You can choose to send out party invites to any players you see, with a max party of 4 players. Being in a party with someone means no friendly fire, can see your teammates through walls and you can trade with them. Players can also leave their party on the fly, as everyone has an understanding only one person can win.\n\nThe gameplay mainly focuses on melee combat, as guns are rare. There is a limb system similar to fallouts, with legs, arms, head and torso all taking different damage and causing different effects. Blunt weapons would do bone breaking damage, causing players to become slower wherever they were hit if it was arms or legs, causes concussions if hit in the head, causes you to get tired quicker if hit in the torso, and also makes you cry out in pain whenever you make sudden movements. Blades do cutting damage, and will cause you to begin to bleed out if hit. If bleeding you’ll leave a blood trail and take damage. Bleeding out will either stop on its own or if severe has to be stopped with a medkit. Medkits have tourniquets and bandages to stop bleeding as well as painkillers to restore health. Each one has a unique animation, meaning you can’t pop them in the middle of combat. \n\nGuns are pretty straightforward. They cause massive bleeding damage and regular damage. Only issue is guns are rare and bullets even rarer. There’s be 3 types of weapons. A handgun, the basic gun, shotguns, basically being an instakill in close range, and machine guns, which shoot a lot but use lots of ammo. Guns can also stun and cause concussions if used to melee.\n\nThe inventory system would be pretty realistic, at first only having what you can carry in your hands. Eventually you’d find new items that’s give you more inventory like duffel bags, backpacks and Fanny packs . These would have a resident evil style inventory where you have to piece them together Tetris like to maximize efficiency.\n\nFinally, this game wouldn’t have an equivalent to the storm, but it would have other mechanics. If a player moves very little for a long time, their bomb necklace will begin to make loud noise, if they still don’t move it’ll begin to flash, and if they still don’t move the necklace will blow up. Once there’s only a few players left or the match goes on for too long, death match mode will be enabled. Stronger weapons will be spawned around the match and players will be able to see other players through the TVs around the map."

krerpd,"A ""role-playing game"" in the truer sense of the word","I've played almost all popular videogame RPGs (Fallout 1-4, The Elder Scrolls 2-5, the Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Mass Effect 1, you name it) and although I LOVE videogame rpgs, I have to say: they are NOT role-playing games. The game industry has forgotten what tabletop RPGs were all about: Immersion, creating your own story, being whoever you want. For example, lets take a look at Skyrim (the game that basicly set the standard for western RPGs) - sure, you can customize your character and give it whatever name and stats you want, but you always play through the same story - Alduin will always be defeated by the end, the thiefs guild will always be there in Riften for you to join, you're always the dragonborn, etc; It feels like a linear game with a single gigantic level.\n\nSo, I have a solution for that: a game with no main story whatsoever, but rather a really complex popularity system with lots of kingdoms/cities on which you can get jobs/contracts that after completion would give you a reward and a change of relationship you have in the world (for example, if you do a job for the king of a city, you gain popularity with them but lose with that cities enemies; if you become a assassin you lose your popularity with the peasants; etc) that not only applies to guests - if you become too rich you lose your popularity with the lower classes, if you travel enought/do heroic acts your fame will increase making more guests available. And of course, character customization.\n\nThis could work really well in a procedural world, but I'll leave that for you, the reader"

kr7pm7,Flying cafe where you travel the worlds and collect different recipes,"I want to make this idea come true so badly, but It would take so much time to do everything alone. So here is what I'm thinking.\n\nThis would be a story driven 2D, top-down, pixel style game (looks something like Stardew Valley). You start by working in small cafe in some village, and you find a secret notebook that your grandfather left, which has all sorts of rumors, drawings of other planets, species and their delicious foods and where you can find those recipes. At the end of the notebook you find hidden message which says that cafe has a secret dashboard, where you to put coordinates from notebook and your cafe takes off. The game takes place both in the air and on the ground. While you are flying, you can walk around your cafe and sometimes encounter random ships passing by. These ships can dock next to you depending if you like them to or not and you can have customers who could tell you more about your journey, or you could get robbed by pirates, or you could encounter a merchant which could sell you some furniture, fuel, or tools like axe, hoe, pickaxe, etc. These tools can be used when landing on planet and you have to find fuel, or you would like to craft some furniture. When you land on planet you always encounter other native species, which tells you more about their culture and share their recipes with you. When you finish gathering all recipes you come back to your home planet and share them with everyone else. And in short that's it. \n\n**IN SHORT: You have a flying cafe which you can upgrade and decorate by gathering resources on other planets and your goal is to travel all the planets and collect all recipes.** \n\nSorry for all my grammar mistakes or if sentences don't make sense, cuz I'm just too tired to fix them. I just wanted to share the general idea :D"
kr5655,"Inner World, The game of everything","  \n\n**Inner Worlds (The Game Of Everything)**\n\nThis game is meant to be played anywhere, at any time, with anything and everything. You do not need to buy anything other then you already do outside of this game, or if you want to buy an asset that you want to play in this game. These assets of course, do not need to be bought, they can also just be remembered, took a picture of, or anything else and then be implanted into the game. This game can be played online, on paper, in your head or a combination of these examples. Cause that’s what they are, examples. In this guide I will be telling you the ideas of the game, and examples of how to play the game. But the main focus will be that this game can be fully designed, controlled and played however you want it to be. Remember this, this is YOUR game, not mine and not someone else’s that is also playing the game, however, if you join another’s game, it will be only fair to play by their rules, as it is most important that the “host” of the game stays the one that has to continue the story. \n\nI will be discussing multiple topics in this guide, such as:\n\n\- **Starting your game**\n\n\- **Making characters / Making a story to start with**\n\n\- **How to implement objects, places, people etc.**\n\n\- **Playing with others**\n\nDisclaimer: Anything and Everything I say during the rest of this guide will be my interpretation of the game, the things I say are NOT, by any means the rules, playstyles, guidelines or anything else that you will HAVE to play with, you can change anything I say, leave out anything you don’t want, or add anything if you feel like it will be a good thing for how you want to play. I am just here to give you an general guide of how the game is thought of when I created it, how I think about I will play it and nothing else. Feel free to destroy my work and replace it with something you feel like is better, it is YOUR game, do what you feel is right and fun to play.\n\nAlright, now that that’s out of the way, lets start with the basics. What is the general idea of the game and how do we even start playing?\n\n**Chapter 1: Starting your game**\n\nOk, so you found this guide, and you want to read more, either because you think it’s interesting or just a plain stupid idea. But what is this game even, what do you I have to imagine playing it? Well, lets start at the beginning. In this game, the main idea is that you are playing a role in a story, sort of like D&amp;D, but my idea is to not only play with things that are made up, or in a fantasy story. Rather, I have this idea of implementing things from all around you, take a look around right now, what do you see? Anything that’s here with you right here, right now could be implemented in your game. But how we do this, we will talk about later. First we need to settle a few things. How do YOU want to play? Do you want to write everything down, draw pictures and make progress on paper? Do you want to search for images, and play your story online, on for examples Word, Tabletop Simulator or all over the web? Do you want to play everything in your mind, so you can instantly make any move you want right where you are, without have to have anything with you? Of course, you can also mix these thing up, to make you playstyle more fun, or easy to play with!\n\nYou will also have to set some basic guidelines, at least, if that is what you want. You could just skip this part and make up rules at any time or at any move you make during the story, or just play without, and let everything flow as you want! But if you do want to set some basic rules, Here are a few examples:\n\n· Never, will a player, objects or any other asset in the game, will have the power of infinite life, invincibility or another factor that will be considered “overpowered”.\n\n· The amount and level of loot found, will be generally determent by either a die, random number generator or (insert your method here).\n\n· “Safe Heaven Tokens (SHT’s)” will have to be acquired only in boss fights, marketplaces or (Insert your method here).\n\n**Chapter 2: Making characters and places**\n\nSo you got a general idea of how to want to play, and with what kind of rule settings you want to work with. Now lets start forming a story and a character. In the starting period of the game, my advise, if you don’t have anything to work with of course, is just to start rambling some things out. They do not have to make sense, let alone be actually played with, just think about some random stories you find interesting. Now is also a good time to start thinking about maybe if you want to play by a certain genre, or multiple genres at once. Maybe you want to play a Horror story, adventure story, action story or maybe even a horror adventure action story, I don’t know, you decide. Do you want to make something realistic, or something even World of Warcraft, Neverwinter or Path of Exile didn’t think of? Maybe you’ll outwrite Lovecraft at his own style, who knows what your imagination will create! \n\nStart thinking of a place. This can be an enormous universe, a world, a city, a house or even just a room you want to start playing in. You don’t have to create everything at once, except of course if that you playstyle. You can start really small and let in evolve into something bigger as you go. Or maybe your story fits in just that one room, that can lead into some interesting options as well. But don’t forget you can also just use a place you already know! Like a place in a videogame, movie or maybe you want to start your story in your own backyard, or that park you visit every morning to walk your dog. Play in the city you always wanted to go, at the club you used to go with your friends or the classroom you have to go to first thing tomorrow. Really, your choice.\n\nThen for your characters. You can start with the character, or characters you yourself want to play with. These can, but don’t have to be the main characters of your story. The main character can also be the god, or for examples end boos of the story. But you can also start with creating, maybe monsters you’ll face, if you want to add those. Whatever you want to make first. If you go for, let’s say, one character that you play as the main character of the story. Think of what is character is. Is it really you, as in the one writing this? Is it even human? Is it an animal or a different kind of lifeform? Maybe you want your story to play out as a group of cells, then you follow your species of cells as it form a bigger and bigger for of life. Maybe you want to play as a character from a movie, or the game you’ve been playing for years. So let’s say your character is human. Does your story involve magic? Are you a master of the mystic arts or are you just starting your learning program, for example: are you Dumbledore or are you first year’s Harry Potter? Maybe you want to play a game in a Medieval world, are you the King of a big kingdom? Or do you start out as the one who cleans up the mess others leave behind? Other things you might add are:\n\n· Personality\n\n· Things your character is good or bad at\n\n· Things your character carries around everywhere\n\n· The history of your character\n\nThese are all optional, and you can add everything else as your story moves on.\n\n**Chapter 3: Implementing objects**\n\nObjects can play a big, or a small part of your story. And there are different ways of using items in your game. Some items may not need really in-depth information about them, depending how what it is, when you use it or what impact it has on the game. If it fits into the game you could just say that you quickly ate an apple on you way to the castle, it doesn’t have to be a big deal. But you can also say maybe, you quickly ate an apple on your way to the castle, which refills your hunger by 10, and then threw it on a dog that’s sleeping on the side of the road, who then got angry at you and tried to attack you. Then it’s a bit of a bigger deal. Maybe your at a market, who sells apples. Then you want a price for the apple(‘s), and maybe what kind of quality it is. Does it have side-effects? Or does it just refills your hunger status? Now this was just an example of an apple, but this can be done with anything. Potions, weapons, technology, pets, houses, to just name a few.\n\nMaybe with every item you get, buy or find you want to write down a quick overview of that item, so you can remember the info later, and carry it around for a while. This can be a really short or really long description, depending on how you want to play, or what the object is. Maybe for a potion, you’ll want to write down the name of the potion, what it does, how many times you can use it and any side-effects it may have. Maybe for a weapon you can note the quality of the weapon, how much damage it does and what the durability of the weapon is. This can also be done with enemies you might face, places you visit, contacts you have and characters you play.\n\nHow do you get items? Maybe you start with some, but maybe at some point, you’ll add new ones. You can find items as you travel, when you defeat an enemy, buy them at a store or a market or maybe you trade your items for new ones.\n\n**Chapter 4: Playing with others**\n\nThere are two basic ways of playing with others, either starting a game together, or join someone in their already made story. Lets discuss both in separate parts.\n\n1. Starting a game together.\n\nLets say you have a group and want to play the game together, this one is easier then if you want to play in a game that has already been started by others. Just talk about what everyone’s ideas are, and form a story together. Are you all main characters? Are some of you the players and others the enemies? Are you two kingdoms facing each other for ultimate glory? Are you a group of special soldiers that have to take on a big enemy together? What rules do you agree on to make it fair for everyone? Are you going to play at a table with the group, in a D&amp;D kind of setting? Or is your story taking place in the real world? And do you meet, and travel to places in real time? Will you design your own map to follow your quest and story or do you go where ever Google Maps takes you? If you play in the real world, there are of course rules and laws you have to keep in mind. Don’t go into places you are not allowed to, and don’t disturb others when you are playing the game. But aside from that, go explore the world! Make the adventure as real as it can be in the world we ourselves live in! \n\n2. Joining another’s game\n\nThis one may be a bit more complicated. Since you’re joining a game that has already started, you will have to follow the rules and settings the Host has made. Don’t mess with the story of another player, as they designed it the way they want their story to go. Let the Host explain what rules there are, how they play and what the story of the game contains, make your character that makes sense in the story and follow the guidelines the Host gives you to do so. Go with the flow of the story and the rest will follow, as there could been made a lot of decisions already. Maybe when you join the game, the host was just about to start a war and now you’re in the middle of it! Maybe the war is just over and you come in at the point that the whole village has been destroyed. You don’t know, so ask the host for any info you need to play, and make sure everyone is enjoying your stay, especially yourself! Maybe you just want to play in the Host’s story for a little bit, if so, make sure you end your part of the story well, and not with open gaps. \n\nReally it’s up to you with how many players you want to play. If you enjoy playing with a group, make it a good time with everyone! But if you’d rather play alone, go for it! You can always decide later if you want more players, or else just create wonderful, amazing worlds and stories by yourself! \n\n**Chapter 5: Overview**\n\nSo, there it is. A sprinkle of what this game is, how it can be played, where and when! I will write more topics later, maybe going more in-depth into certain topics, and giving more examples of them. But for now I just want to give the basic idea of the vision I have when creating this game. This is only the beginning!

kr2r3h,Sonic Burst: A Sonic Racing Game,"I don’t Know how to make actual games at all but I do love making up ideas for games so here’s my idea for a sonic racing game please tell me your thoughts \n\nSonic Burst: Sonic Racing Game\n\nMain Idea:\nA Sonic racing game where sonic and friends(and enemies) are racing against each other for (an powerful item) that a (person) has and is making them compete for it.\n\nStory:\nThe main story/ending is the sonic heroes (sonic, tails, and knuckles) working together to make sure no one else gets the (item) and use it for evil but there is multiple alternate stories and endings based on the team/characters you use a example being team dark were shadow is racing for Marie back.\n\nRacing Mechanics:\nInstead of racing in cars like Team Sonic Racing or have them all run in a straight line like in Sonic Forces(the mobile game) it’s has the movement of Team Sonic Racing (free roam) well also having all the characters race in different ways examples being sonic running, tails flying, and jet using extreme gear/board. \n\nRace Tracks: \nMaps in the game are fairly simple with laps, rail grinding, dodging obstacles etc.\nAlso in the maps they’ll have unique parts to it like jump pads, secret paths, and loopy loops.\n\nItems:\nIn Sonic there are a variety of items in the games that are used for Sonic to help him in completing it. Items that I think would work in the game would be rings to prevent being hurt for a certain amount of damage depending on how many rings you have (up to 3), speed boots to give you extra speed in your movement, invincibility to make you immune to all damage, the chaos emeralds which turns you super making you faster immune to damage and deal damage if you hit other players, and there’s more items still that can be put in.\n\nAbilities:\nEvery character will have unique abilities to them like Sonic will be able to have a spin dash that dashes him forward, tails will have a mega buster that will shoot slow moving energy balls that will slow enemies, and knuckles will grab a boulder from the ground and throw it forward if it hits someone it will stun them. Your abilities will charge faster or slower depending on what place you are, hitting enemies, and doing tricks\n\nMultiplayer And Co op:\nIn co op you can play together with people on local play off or online in the story or just regular online play \n\nGame Modes:\nThere will a variety of game modes to play in online and local play like the regular 3 lap race, catch the chao were you have to grab the chao that’s running away from all the players and hold onto it for the longest, team battle and free for all were you have to knock out all the players against you, a tournament mode which could be a rank mode or just a regular mode where you have to qualify to get to the next part of the tournament"
kr2k6e,"The further you go in the game, the more insane the loot becomes","I don't mean like you get better weapons and armor, no, I mean at first everything seems fine, but as you go you end up finding really weird stuff where it should not belong.\n\nIt's like when you find an iron pot in a dead bear's body or gems in potery pots. The same thing but exaggerated. It would probably be completely useless, but it would be fun at least."
kqzsy6,FPS Idea,"I want to make a unique fps game. It can be like a mashup of several games or something new entirely, but what is an idea for an fps game that makes it new or interesting? All ideas are appreciated."
kqzoe8,A game idea I was chipping away at before developing an RSI,As an amateur game dev I was always aware the scope of my idea was beyond what I could do on my own but I enjoyed working at small parts of it anyway.\n\nI can’t work on the game any longer but the concept is something I still find myself thinking about daily and thought I’d share with anyone willing to have a read.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNmUGR7qFLvjNwUwAYOEMHMohgNo7Hrgjzvlbtc2Llc/edit\n\nIf you do manage to get through it please let me know what you think :) \n\nHope everyone has a good day!
kqzenw,Life Sim where the NPC's dialogue is powered by GPT-3,"For those not familiar with [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), it's a language model by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). It's a neural network that has been trained on a buttload of written data, from tweets, to classic literature, to fanfiction. You can get a good idea of how it works by playing around with [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, onto the game idea! Imagine a mashup of The Sims, Fable and Animal Crossing in terms of gameplay and world interactivity. The catch? All of the dialogue is written by GPT-3. This allows the player to type (or even speak) their own responses to characters and have their own unique conversations. The AI could be finetuned and told to remember certain aspects, such as personality traits, likes, dislikes and catch phrases. All while keeping track of the relationship status between the characters and the player!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concept was explored in 2006 indie title [Facade](https://www.playablstudios.com/facade), in which the player attends a dinner party with a couple.  You can say whatever you like to the couple and they will respond appropriately (ableit, with a lot of drama) and if memory serves, their responses are even voice modulated. It was impressive for its time and I believe the system used can be pushed much further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all I have for now, just wanted to get this written down somewhere! I'd love to hear any other ideas or expansions upon this."
kqz3vu,The game concept I’m posting here has been something I’ve chipped away at over time however have never fully committed to.,The reason for never committing to it has been the fact I’m aware the scope of the game is beyond just myself as an amateur game dev who has now developed an rsi injury\n\nHowever I still find myself thinking about it daily and hoping for something like it some day. So I thought I’d share here just to see if anyone has the patience to have a read through what I see as a basis for my ideal game.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNmUGR7qFLvjNwUwAYOEMHMohgNo7Hrgjzvlbtc2Llc/edit\n\nLet me know your thoughts if you actually do read through it :) \n\nHope everyone has a great day!
kqyp8q,Open World RPG idea,"Here's the idea. It's open world as in the title, but it has many dynamic systems.\n\nFor instance, let's say there was a village in a tundra that relys on the wood from the forest to create fire so that they can survive the winter. Burn down that forest, and everyone either dies in the winter and some migrate. But in doing that, a nearby village now has more space and resources to grow and prosper in the absence of the old village. Maybe if you help them enough, they trust you so much that they swear allegiance to you and you begin to create an empire.\n\nOr you could be a dungeon Explorer, and defeating the monster imprisoned in one of the dungeons releases magic back into the local area or something, amplifying everything natural in that area.\n\nMaybe you could be mining to the bottom of earth to find the strongest materials, only to break through the bedrock and create an opening to the nether or hell. A few days later, demons begin to set up outposts and nests across the world as they prepare for a massive invasion. Maybe during the invasion angel's get involved. After the battle, much of the land is barren, resulting in a dark age of sorts.\n\nIdk just throwing some ideas around. This may be pretty hard to make though seeing as it may be extremely complex. \n\nThoughts?"

kqqrre,Lovecraftian Style horror game where your PC crashes if you see a monster,"Lots of horror games try and fail to capture the mind breaking depiction of the Cthulhu mythos, I think it could be interesting to implement some out of game consequences for encountering these reality defying creatures such as your PC crashing or your copy of the game being deleted etc."
kqosj5,GTA should collab with Cities: Skyline to create an infinite amount of maps to play on,Each city built would have its own strong suits and flaws in design and maybe gta could center its story around the corrupted urban development and have dynamic quests that take the stats and layout of your city into account.
kqok68,HOW To Make YOUR GAME IDEA worth considering/better.,"Now I know there is Pinned Post but i want to add my part to it.  \n\n\nSo there we go...(wall of text ahead)  \n\n\n1) Make sure your Idea doesnt belong to a Copyrighted IP.  \n   But what is an IP you ask. A Games (or Franchises) IP is but not limited to:  \n \n\n* Source code\n* Characters\n* Choreographies\n* Buildings\n* Maps\n* Conceptual art\n* Box design\n* Soundtrack and sound effects \n* Script, dialogue and the storyline   \nBasically anything that is an identifiable characteristic of a game or franchise e.g The Mandalorian,Jedi etc from Star Wars. Middle Earth from LOTR etc.   \n\n\nAnything like that is off-limits because it requires a license that comes with a hefty price and for most indies coming here its not an option(and probably not worth it).  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\n2) Now i know there are people that might disagree with this and want an idea to be much more ""free""  \nbut trust me some guidelines help on the imagination.  \n\n\nFor Example: I have an idea for a Single player (campaign) Shooter Game either FPS or TPS where the Character is a Commando and he and his Squad fight Aliens/Terrorists/Invaders where the bond of these men and them misssing their loved ones is expressed through their voice lines/or they are tough and badass AF and they just steamroll throught endless waves of enemies.  \n\n\nYou could also explain other ""mechanics"" that the game might have.  \n\n\nLimited Ammo/crafting etc  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\n3) Preferably has to be original.The competition and amount of games being made is enormous and for a game to shine and make profit (or just be played if free) it has to be entirely original or have that ""something special"" about it that makes it different from the others.  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\n4) And Last but least and probably MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL is imagine if you or your friends would play/enjoy that game for a considerable amount of time.  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  \n\n\nThat's all i had to say i hope this post helps some people get some good ideas out or any gamedev to make his own mind because trust me its really hard to find something original that you like and can implement (not just as much as bugfixing tho that just sucks)."
kqm9ez,Chibi Style Life Simulator,"Hello!  \n\n\nI would like to work on a mobile game where you can create a large number of customisable chibi characters, and much like the 3DS game 'Tomodachi Life', you can look after these chibis by feeding them, buying them clothes, playing minigames with them, etc.  \n\n\nMost importantly, though, I would like these chibis to interact with eachother and form a social life based on predetermined character traits. The player themselves has very little influence on how well two chibis get a long, all the player does is watch the chibis live their life and make sure they are being looked after.   \n\n\nMy problem is that I'm a begginer programmer, I would love to develop this idea more but I would like some help accomplishing this.  I would also like help with music and sound effects as an optional thing, but I want to focus on getting the game working first."

kqcttj,FPS “tower defense” game,"Before you enter your match, you can decide on what weapons you want to use. You also decide what kind of spells you want to use. You can unlock more... with more gameplay. \n\n\nYou need to defend against waves of “enemies”\n\nYou shoot enemies to stop them.. when it gets intense you use your spells. Spells varies from big blasts, to freezing, etc \n\nYou can constantly be moving around the map since it’s a FPS, get the best angles. Best choke points. Decide what spells your gonna use to work best with your teammates.\n\nCertain enemies (randomly) will drop bonuses like CoD zombies, ammo refill, nuke, spell cooldown halves, etc \n\nThis game is similar to dungeon defenders. But certainly different.\n\nYou have guns &amp; spells. You don’t place turrets on the path. The game is very open on how you play each round."
kqazff,An FPS game where you play as info_player_start in Hammer.,"Take Valve's Hammer Editor for Source, or GoldSrc or whatever, and place the player inside of the info\_player\_start entity. You're tasked with going around different maps shooting and destroying entities (e.g. light\_environment, etc.) The caveat is that each time you destroy an entity, its function also stops. For example, if you destroy a light entity, there won't be light there anymore. If you destroy logic entities, then their purposes won't be fulfilled and whatever was in their I/O system will stop. This makes the player have to plan out how to beat each map, since if you destroy certain entities first, it will make things harder or even impossible.\n\nHowever, this comes with the downside that maps might have only one set way to beat them, which you can't really get around of except something random being added, like random spawns or random weapons you use, or multiple weapons to choose from, some only destroying light entities, etc. You'd have to search around for the weapons, but then that could make it boring having to search the whole map for a certain weapon just to destroy a few entities.\n\nNaturally, there would be a level editor for people to make their own levels and maps. Yay.\n\nWell, there it is. I'm not good enough to make it, and it requires more planning work also. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\n(I guess this is a dream idk)"

kq4bji,One Room Game Concepts?,"Hi guys I have just started learning how to make assets in blender and I was thinking of making a game that’s visually similar to gone home but I’m struggling to come up with the actual game part. I’d like to design a 90s retro apartment but beyond that I’m stumped. I could go with a horror game but that’s not really my interest and escape rooms seem overdone. Anyone got any ideas? \n\nI like the idea of a more casual relaxing game like the Sims where the goal is to earn money to pimp out your apartment. I like games where you need to maintain health and happiness stats. But without having an open world, this would likely get boring really quick."
kq050r,"I made a little demo for a space shooter, what kind interesting things could people like to see out of a space shooter?","I made a small demo of a space shooter game when I was first learning to program. Here is a short clip of the gameplay: https://streamable.com/no0j7c\n\nThe health bar was intended to be tied to a score that increases with enemies killed. It's the circular bar on the left. When it reaches 2 different levels it will add a sentry to fire with the ship. \n\nThe bar is just a visual representation of the firing speed.  And the symbol on the inside is showing the weapon type. I imagined the player being able to switch weapons during gameplay similar to Ranger-X. \n\nI had an idea maybe to make a space shooter rouge lite, but was not sure if it was a good idea or even how I would go about making it. \n\nDoes watching this video and seeing the mechanics spur any ideas? I am interested in all ideas. I'd love to make something more complete with a better idea to follow."
kpz2ye,Alien Hunter*,"Game where you hunt aliens.\nPremise: You (MC) live in a world dominated by aliens. You with a small group of rebels to wish to free their planet. The planet itself is set in a futuristic post-apocalypse where the only main civilizations consist of aliens and human slaves.\nThe explorer/scavenger in your group finds a alien who managed to die in an event (tree falling on them, collapsed building, hit by car, etc.). He grabs everything he can and radios in for the researchers to come to the location to get the body for analysis. He delivers the “goods” back to base. The alien researcher notices that the explorer brought back a strange watch. This watch, which was wore with the face facing the incide of the wrist, turned out to be a weapon, or rather a prototype weapon the aliens were developing. It apparently, besides giving the user a minimal hud (vitals, etc.), had the ability to mimic/copy other alien weapons.\nThe watch itself, besides having a holographic hud (used to swap weapon type and ammo type), is holographic, meaning it produces a gun hologram. This is fine because the alien weapons are all energy/plasma/gauss (electromagnetic) based."

kpwrfs,"Ok, so hear me out: contra but in other video games.","Basically your standard arcade run and gun at the core, but each level/world is themed after (and has a gimmick based on) other video games.\n\nYou start out in your home game but then end up in a  homage to super mario bros. (Of course with the names and characters changed), where you can stomp on the unique enemies (but not the enemies that work for the main villain, say, a computer virus or a character from a failed mascot platformer in-universe), get a mushroom that makes you grow big, and the weapon pickups look like flowers. Then there's an rpg level where you have a recharging magic meter that works like ammo, but also a melee weapon for certain enemies and in other stages where you have limited ammo (like the fps and survival horror stages), and enemies get weaker the more you kill in the level (Complete with a level up window). Then there would be a puzzle game world where you climb a tower of falling blocks, like that stick figure animation with the tetris blocks. There could be a rhythm game world where you can only shoot to the beat (think crypt of the necro-dancer), a fighting game world where you fight a bunch of mini-bosses 1-on-1, the aforementioned survival horror stage (where you are relentlessly pursued by the level's boss), and finally, the console's OS, where the final boss is fought. Basically, the levels are different genres, usually with a specific game in mind, that each have gimmicks, enemies, and level designs that bring to mind that genre/game."

kpvoe5,A battle royale but lava rises from the floor instead of the circle shrinking,That’s it
kpvg81,Open world kart racer based on an original IP,"So basically my idea is to start from the ground up with an original IP for a kart racing game, and have it be open world much like the later Need for Speeds. I like how for instance Splatoon has it's own unique style and visual design within the team shooter genre, and for me every kart racer outside of Mario Kart kind of just seems like a way to milk an already established franchise. \n\nBest concept I can come up with is a large island inhabited by puppets, fairly similar to the Jim Henson/Sesame Street style. Maybe they've been created by an actual human and exist on an island of make-believe that's developed into a full blown metropolis. In my head I see a central area of the city with a park and a large statue in honor of their absentee creator (he'd probably look like a Fred Rogers or a Walt Disney type). Perhaps on their own the puppets found out that something on this island works fantastically as a fuel source so motorsports becomes their big past time.\n\nYou'd drive around the city, maybe doing deliveries at first, then illegal (sesame lol)street races, and work your way up to the big leagues from there. You'd have the option of creating a crew, perhaps being able to create one of each weight class(probably just 5 weights to start out with), with the weight classes having their own perks and abilities beyond just being heavier and having different stats. Maybe they can choose from their own pool of ultimate moves like so many games have for characters nowadays. \n\nWith the puppet aesthetic, creating custom characters in a myriad of visual styles should be relatively easy. More like a Mr Potato head than something like Cyberpunk or an MMO. Heavy weights could look similar to Sully from Monsters Inc, or even Big Bird, with the middle weights at about Grover's size, and the smallest like maybe sock puppets or something.\n\nKart modification would be deep, but not overly complicated. Not using full sized cars with full size body panels let's you have more control over the visual narrative (sometimes too many options can look messy, Rocket League cars are guilty of this when players just throw the most obnoxious things on). Performance enhancements would be visually represented with exposed parts, along with affecting stats like acceleration, top speed, handling, etc.\n\nThe island itself would be big enough to have varying environments, drawing inspiration from real world racing clichés. Centrally located and perhaps sightly north would be a distinct mountain/range allowing for ""touge"" racing, and leading into a snowy northern section of the island. Basically dead center/East of the island would be the main city with plenty of urban areas for street racing, and also an elevated highway like Japan's Shuto expressways/ Wangan-sen. Further West leads you to a very LA inspired area with concrete slopes like the LA River, along with desert racing/salt flats. South of the island would be very European/Mediterranean, reminiscent of race locales like the Monaco Grand Prix. \n\nThe environment including the cities, streets, and landscape in general would be cartoony and exaggerated adding to it's make-believe nature. Driving around the city should feel lively, yet restricted in terms of not being able to just get out of your Kart and run around on foot (less interaction than GTA but more than NFS). Designated areas could let you get out of the kart, say to visit ancillary characters, or to sit on a beach and watch the sunset.\n\nGameplay would be about what you'd expect from a kart racer, ""official"" races would cut off certain streets of wherever you are to create the tracks, the racing itself feeling very arcade-y but with a skill curve, like learning to get sparks and boosts in Mario Kart.  I also really miss the different race types feeling distinct from each other in the first 2 NFS: Underground games so I'd probably use that idea too, perhaps you'd need differently built karts to compete in straight drag races vs drifting/touge. \n\nWhew, that's about all I can think of at the moment."

kpt99b,FPS based on old Netrek mechanics,"Admittedly I don’t play video games anymore but I’ve always had an idea that I haven’t ever seen deployed in a first person shooter.  When I was younger at university, online gaming was really only occurring between colleges, cmu, Texas and many others with extremely limited graphics so games has to be imaginative to utilize the very little bandwidth available.  One of those games was a 2d 8v8 game called Netrek, I’m not trying to revive that game but have a lot of good memories of the competition.  There is a wiki to get a concept of the play but basically you had to kill opponents in dogfights and each kill allowed you to pick up armies which you then beamed down to opposing planets to gain territory.  Zero kills? No ability to pick up armies, 1 kill? Two armies could be picked up, 2 kills, 4 armies and so on.  The class of ship you picked affected your maximum payload, top speed, fuel and weapon power.\n\nI’d like to see if this would catch on as a variant to battle royale in a first person shooter, like a better version of capture the flag.  Netrek was won and rebooted anytime one side was able to capture all 9 of the opposing planets in the opponent territory and since players spawned next to their core 5 planets after death, each last planet was increasing harder to take.  The game would proceed with players joining and quitting at will, basically an ongoing war front which could last 10 minutes or days depending on skill of the teams.\n\nThis game hooked a lot of smart people in comp sci and related fields from undergrads and graduate students and while the time has passed for it, the format would be interesting to see in a modern adaptation.  I hope someone runs with the idea and not looking for any credit."

Later he finds out that he is actually dead and that the world in which he was wasn't real and much more but I think this is all that matters about the story. I thought it would be cool to have a hot guy with an umbrella  so I tried making a mechanic around it.\n\nI made a box pushing puzzle where you summon a strong wind and it moves the whole row. The goal would be to get from point A to point B without being seen by guards (in our case girls)  with moving boxes so you create the path and block their vision.\n\nI'm afraid that this mechanic is just too generic and I don't know if I can make interesting puzzles with it so I'm thinking about something else.\n\nI would appreciate  all suggestions.
kpph8v,Black Flag but a BR,"I played assassins creed black flag a few times and was thinking what if they made pretty much the same game but multiplayer, so a lot like sea of thieves. Not about that but make it a battle Royale. Im pretty tired of every game coming out being a br but I feel like making a pirate game like black flag and adding a battle Royale element would be very unique and fresh. Imagine starting out at your own cove and setting out looking for enemy pirates. You could fire on them with your cannons and board them for sword fighting. The winner gets ammunition and maybe better weapons. Being able to get off your boat and take refuge on an island would also be a good way to force close combat and be a good place to find better equipment for your boat, crew, and captain."

kpnx5t,"Anti-building, anti tower defense strategy.",You are a druid responsible for protection of forest which is home to many dangerous but rare creatures. Unfortunately some foolish people started mining resources in your area and built a city there. New people are coming and the city is always growing. You can send your beasts to roam and destroy the city but it is protected by towers and mobs. Your enemies are continualy upgrading their technologies. You need to aim for strategic buildings. Most importantly you need to take care of woods because only healthy woods can generate enough creatures and mana for you to utilize.
kpmhyh,I need game ideas for this controller!,"I've been working on this controller for 2 days now, which is super fun to play around with.

Let your mind run free, most often the crazy, wacky ideas are the best.  \n\n\n[https://youtu.be/k1VCpdTVENc](https://youtu.be/k1VCpdTVENc)  \n\n\nThanks in advance, and happy new year!"
kpm1xo,Space Gangs - but with a personal story,"A gang member goes through mental trauma whilst living through the pain of being a gang member. He lives in Starrington - a town in Sygmus (Planet). They sell illegal weapons and unregistered dogs - mainly used for protection in this world. In addition to that, they rob banks, stores and raid rival gang residences in a linear storyline and world, with non-linear game design. His dream is to ultimately found his own movie production company, but know he can't succeed in his gang. He and majority of his gang have been wanted for most of their lives and the premise of this stops him from leaving his gang. Not to mention, his loyalty to his family and friends. But as all his friends begin to die and go to jail, he tries to convince his fiancee (who is also part of the gang) to run away and start a new life in another city in Sygmus. However, a day before their runaway his fiancee is killed by a rival gang and he decides to live as a professional gang leader for the rest of his life, killing and murdering in cold blood, without regard of the value of life, including his own.\n\nBut with the contemplations of him staying in the gang and leaving far more difficult. The world would be somewhat inspired by Star Wars planets, but Sygmus is a planet with perpetual snow every year, except for north-east of the world where it's a pure sand desert. Vehicles and buildings appear different from the ones on Earth and in Star Wars. The main mechanic of the game is shooting and other forms of combat, with driving and the ocassional, odd games in Starrington.\n\nThat's all I've come up with so far!"

Players can rate the notifications they got and the best notifications get sent to more people. The players who create best rated notifications gain score.

kpje5o,Music based magic system,"I just got idea for magic system based on music. Basicaly players would cast spells by playing various melodies. The musical aspects as tone variations, chords, rythm, key etc would all define the effect of the spell. The more precise one is in replaying the spell, more succesful the spell is. Players would try to acquire various musical intruments to be able to cast new spells. Certain spells could interact and harmonize same as real melodies would. The spells does not have to be neceserary preestablished by developers, instead developers could define effects of various aspects of melodies and then let the players to compose their own melodies. You could also incorporate possibility for singing. The players could create music of all genres. For example you could specialize as a techno necromancer. You could also acquire some powerful ready to use scrolls with real life songs. Also I could imagine this game to have various forms. open world rpg, pokemon go style or just graphics simmilar to stardew valey or nintendo pokemons but I think it should be multiplayer so people can meet together."

kpgwht,A space rogue lite similar inspired by Star Traders: Frontier and the Starsector,"**Gameplay:**\n\nThe game is divided into space travel ,planet exploration and space combat .\n\n* *Space travel* is turn based, moving a one turn usually  takes one in-game day(at least in the beginning) and consumes Helium-3 and Supplies (how much depends on the ship engine type, number of crew-mates and their condition and number of equipment).Traveling through jumpgates also require a lot of Helium 3.As player travels through space, they encounter  merchants, law enforcement, mercenaries ,pirates, etc.\n* *Planet exploration* is also turn based, except  that one turn only consume Supplies and the random encounters are mostly text based.Random encounters vary from encountering other explorers(either friendly or not), discovering a mineral vein, encountering wild alien lifeforms, etc.\n* *Space combat*  is in real time and is very similar to Starsector.\n\n**The Player:** \n\nThe player begins the with a single multipurpose mothership that would serve as the player's mobile base.The player can't own more than one mothership and motherships are only sold by the major factions at an extremely high price.The mothership requires Helium-3 and Supplies The mothership is extremely customizable , so the player can turn it into heavily armored cargo ship, rather fast destroyer or even a mobile factory ship.The player can also hire escorts to protect the ship and if the player has combat shipyard and advanced habitation upgrade, they permanently hire mercenaries to their fleet.If the mothership is  completely destroyed, the game is over.\n\n**The Universe:**\n\nThe universe of the game is divided into mostly randomly generated sectors. Each sector contains about 5 to 25 star systems connected by jump gates, with many trading orbitals, outposts and often rarely, fully colonized worlds.Each sector is also inhabited by mostly randomly generated factions. Sectors can be heavily populated with a strong central authority (most of the time this central authority is major faction) or mostly sparse, with the sector mostly inhabited by isolationist hermits, veteran explorers, pirates clans, cultists or **\[REDACTED\]**. \n\nThings the player can do in a sector:\n\n* Trade commodities between colonies (Mining colonies have high demand for agricultural products)\n* Land ,mine and explore on planets and moons (At first you only limited to barren worlds with a surface. As you gain better equipment and more crewmen, you can safely explore more types of worlds).\n* Become a bounty hunter or a pirate (The player can automatically gain money from killing pirates or any rival faction of the ruling authority of the sector if they have a bounty hunting license.The player can also hunt Galactic Bounty, who are high value bounties given by the major factions.However the player can also get  a bounty on themselves if they piss off a faction too hard).\n* Do Missions (Most of the missions at start are going to be rather basic like delivery or mining.The missions given by a faction  has more rewards, but they are  a lot more riskier).\n* Gain points with a factions by doing mission for them or through defeating their rival factions (Sadly you can't actually join the randomly generated minor factions, however they would give you a  reward in form of perks, like major discount on upgrades and free repairs in the station or even  allow the player to hire some of their ships to be permanently part of your fleet ).\n\nTo leave a sector and travel to another sector, the player has to travel to the local Hyper-gate. All sectors have at least two Hyper-gates.Travelling through Hyper-gates are costly and they require a lot of Helium-3 and a special jumpdrive , so first prepare yourself in your local sector before venturing out.\n\n**Major Factions**:\n\nWhile the most of the factions the player going to encounter are randomly generated and only exists in their sector, some special factions are large and powerful enough have to presence in many sectors.These factions are not randomly generated and the posses equipment not available to other minor factions.The player can join major factions, though it can only be achieved late game.\n\n  **TL;DR : Turn based space roguelike set in a mostly randomly generated universe, inspired by Starsector and Star Traders:Frontier.**"
kpg9fg,A game based on the 2019 Hong Kong protests,"This game will literally never come about due to china's tyranny on free speech but it still should.\n\nThe game would be faithfully based off the 2019 Hong Kong protests for independence and would go through the real events using a cast of mostly (possible completely) fictional characters. The biggest bit of the game would be [the seige of polytechnic University ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_Hong_Kong_Polytechnic_University) which would probably engulf 85% of the main campaign. The university itself would be a main hub area where you can progress main missions, side missions or engage in other optional activities. You can also enter into underground passages to escape back into Hong Kong as a city, the city wouldn't be a big open world but it would have collectibles and secrets to explore, think the open world of God of War 2018. Big enough to give you stuff to do but not completely overwhelming. T\n\nhe Gameplay would be split between base defense in polytechnic University and stealth scavenging in Hong Kong, stealth would be based around understanding your environments and utilizing pathways, the world will be designed so every street could be a stealth arena, in them your only option is to escape as the ability to take down police officers would be few and far between.\n\nBase defense would be MUCH more personal than most games, your controlling a single character not an army so you'll have to manage your own recourses and have to account for the time it takes to pick those recourses up, rocks will be a constant necessity to breakdown car and other situational things, to get these things you'll need to travel around the university mid seige meaning you'll have to split your time wisely between getting material and using material.\n\nThe Story would follow a rag tag group of protesters from ideally hoping for the best of their little camp to realizing how it's fall is inevitable, the main character could have growth between idealism and nyalism ultimately settling on an unpleasant realism. it would end in a monolog while Free Hong Kong would quietly build up in the background culminating in it being the song of the credits."
kpg7c7,"Political, Decision-Based (Open World?) 3D RPG Set Around the Presidential Palace and Political Institutions","Seeing the success of a certain newly released political game, I think the time is ripe for a (First Person?) 3D political game based in the presidential palace and other political buildings/institutions (Situation Room, Party Headquarters, Congressional building) where you mostly hold meetings in the palace and shape the country however you see fit. Maybe the player can visit presidential palaces from other countries during diplomatic visits (depending on the devs' budget), as per the storyline. \n\nThere should be no set way on how the player could shape the country, although of course, a strict planned economy will probably make the country less efficient, or a laissez-faire economy with no intervention can have frequent economic crises and sky-high inequality. The player should be able to see the effects of their policies, either through the news showing the changing landscape of their cities, interactions with other characters, or by visiting cities on their own (in presidential style). The possibilities are endless, and I would be very interested in hearing what devs or fellow players think about this :)"

kp9y5c,A first person shooter that takes place on a planet full of talking pigs and cows who declared war against each other and use weird/strange/unusual weapons,"My idea is a first person shooter that takes place on a planet full of talking pigs and cows who declared war against each other and use weird/strange/unusual weapons. These talking pigs and cows eat food and wear clothes like cartoon animals and their weapons are things such as “Microwave Mines”, brooms and mops, the “Ice Cube Pistol”, potato cannons, soda can bombs, the “Hot Sauce Bottle Flamethrower”, “Peanut Pistol”, “Blank DVD Gun”, “Meatball Cannons”, popsicles, a flaming (on fire) food fireing microwave, drones made of PVC pipes, glue guns, portable chemical toilet missles, plungers and “carrot chain gun”. \n\nI have ideas for various multiplayer modes such as “Team Deathmatch”, “Capture The Flag”, “Search And Destroy”, “Battle Royale” and “Zone Control”. I also have the idea for two different campaign modes which both have different levels, one of them is the “Pigs story” and the other one is the “Cows story”. What do you think about this idea?"
kp6ig1,I need game ideas for a possible series on my youtube channel.,I had an idea for a series on my youtube channel where I make your game ideas into actual games. All I need is some game ideas so post them in the comments and I might use it in my vid.
kp618v,Classic RPG with a Twist,"A standard medieval turn-based rpg similar to Fire Emblem, but with a more realistic battle mechanic whereby depending on how much of a character’s hp has been lost (percentage-wise) further damage increases. For example, an enemy knight deals 5 damage to my wizard with 20 hp. Now that my wizard  is at 15/20 hp, or 75%, that means he’s lost 25% of his max hp, so if the knight attacks the wizard again, the base damage would still be 5, but it would increase by a factor of 1.25, becoming 6.25 damage — rounding to 6. I think it would be cool because realistically on a battlefield, having sustained more damage a similar hit would hurt more."

kp48hx,Complete construction simulator,"I have played the construction sim already on the market but it is a bit disappointing. What I would like to see is a full onconstruction game where you start by having to buy the land, pay for architects services, then go on to lay the services (water, electric) to your housing estate by digging the trenches etc. Then you buy the materials, dig the foundations, etc etc. When your housing estate is finished and you have sold all the houses you move on to a more prestigious location with more luxurious house options."

kp0y0j,IDEA: idle game that requires players to actually be idle,"Before I begin, I am posting this solely as an idea that may help others come up with other ideas. This game, if actually created, would most likely be a complete failure. However, I do think the concept is interesting and explores how games can effect our world.\n\nConcept\n\nAn idle game that only awards points for idling if the player is actually idle. The game would require a player to wear a Fitbit to track steps and heart rate. If the player takes no steps, they will earn points for idling in a traditional sense. The heart rate would merely be used to ensure that players are actually wearing the Fitbit and not just leaving the Fitbit somewhere as they do other things. Points are earned so that players can purchase upgrades similar to other idle games. If players wish to not be idle and still earn points, they can purchase an Active Idle Boost using in-game currency. This would award players a set amount of time for them to get up and move without penalty. The game would have a global leaderboard, awarding players who are the least active.\n\nWhy\n\n-The game is less about playing and more about creating. It would serve as the outer limit that an idle game can be pushed to. I like to see the creation of the game as a statement as opposed to an experience. It would be the most extreme idle game in existence. It takes the over-saturated idle genre and creates something truly one-of-a-kind.\n\n-The concept of the game is rooted in nihilism. It takes a Fitbit, which is designed to make people healthy, and subverts it into something designed to make them sick. It is a joke that the people that play the game would be in on. It is a celebration of self-destruction. The people who play the game would see the people at the bottom of the leaderboards as the actual winners as opposed to the people at the top.\n\n- While I personally think that the game would be destined for failure, I do think that the game would appeal to certain segments of society. The extreme nature of the game would potentially lead to some publicity and many people checking the game out. The nihilistic and ironic attitude of the game could also lead to the game being seen as a “meme” which could generate players. The people that would be drawn to the game would play it ironically.\n\nIssues\n\n-Requiring players to have a Fitbit would doom it to failure. That is a steep price to pay for a item that is rendered nearly useless in order to play a meme game.\n\n-If the game is played properly, it would potentially lead to the shortened lifespans of its most hardcore players. This threatens the longevity of the player base.\n\n-Technical limitations may hinder the game from working as intended. Having a game sync with your Fitbit in real time 24/7 may not be possible as far as I know.\n\nIf anyone actually would want to make the game, all that I ask is that I get mentioned in the Credits. “Conceived by SwoopDoza” would work fine. Feel free to provide feedback."
koxove,Scattering extra lore in translations,"I just heard that French translation of Super Mario Galaxy reveals some extra information about Rosalina's father. This kinds of translation differences from different games pop up from time to time, and I think they are at least mostly unintentional.\n\nBut what about if the game makers would intentionally reveal different pieces of extra lore in different translations? The translations would seem like legit translations from the surface, but little choises of words in different translations would reveal little things about the lore. \n\nI think this could bring the gaming community all around the world together to solve the complete lore behind the game.\n\nAnd just to be clear: The overall gameplay would not revolve around this and the players wouldn't be informed about this in any way. It would be something that some players interested about the deeper lore could find out by themselves."

kow0um,Alien Abduction,"I'm trying to refine a story for a point-and-click adventure game. The influence comes from [*Flight of the Navigator*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091059), however I'm trying to work in a buddy comedy too. Essentially, it would encompass a sci-fi story like [*The Dig*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dig) with the gameplay/writing of [*Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/sam-max-hit-the-road).\n\nAt this point, I'm trying to map out the act/structure. So far I have...\n\n**Act 1:** The protagonists are abducted by an Alien AI. They awaken aboard a space craft, which has suffered damage and is in a low power state. They player solves puzzles while they explore the ship, trying to figure out what is going on. As the player progresses, the AI gradually awakens.\n\n**Act 2:**  The player is tasked with helping the AI restore power/repair the ship and decipher their location. The protagonists can be beamed to local planets and solve puzzles in the form of errands.  \nBut I'm not sure how to make this fit the narrative, e.g. are the planets populated with civilisations? Do they speak english? Do they not freak out when two humans/earthlings arrive? How does this help the AI? ... Am I over thinking this?\n\n**Act 3:** The player solve some puzzles relating to restoring the ship, and the AI agrees to return them to Earth.  \nAn alternate idea, is that the AI doesn't intend to return them to Earth. It had manipulated the protagonists, in order for their assistance in restoring the ship. This could then result in an additional puzzle for the player to out-power the AI and gain control of the ship.\n\nAny suggestions, ideas or inspirations would be appreciated. Even some puzzle ideas would be of great help.  \nThanks in advance."

kordcn,A teddy bear game,"You are a teddy bear protecting a child from nightmares. The setting can be in a bedroom with the kid sleeping, and you have to go into the kids nightmares and kill the nightmare beasts without being caught by the kid inside of their dream, and without having the kid get attacked by the nightmares. So kind of a stealth roguelike game because there could be as many, hard, and wacky monsters you could fight. Also, get creative with the dreams!

But you, the corgi, gets geared up with whatever, could be guns, could be a katana, could even be a magic wand. But you go on a bizarre adventure, and in the end, have a huge battle with that dang squirrel that took your ball away from you, but before you end him, he turns into something. You decide. A transformers/power rangers mech, an alien of colossal size, a necromancer who summons the remains of the roadkill, a literal lord of demons, or whatever the heck you want, but all for your tennis ball.

koqe7y,A scooby doo game idea I just came up with,"A game the opposite of Scooby doo where you and the gang have to hide from the villain who sets traps around an environment/arena and you have to hide from him/her/it. Each member of the Scooby doo gang have special abilities, like Velma making contraptions to help her hide and or escape from traps, Daphne can be less suspicious to the villain and/or help out a team if you ever make it multiplayer, Fred can make game plans for the team, if you make it multiplayer, or be able to find traps and make more complicated hiding spots/ costumes due to the plans to make it more to what you want and make it so you don’t fly around everywhere trying to come up with a hiding spot, Shaggy is the fastest and time can slow down when traps are activated so he is the one who is best against traps, and Scooby can be more flat in his hiding spots and go into smaller holes, and fit into more places. The villain can change depending on what map is chosen and at the end, you can trap the villain and get away, with Velma being the best at making the traps while Scooby is the worst, or you and your gang get caught maybe with the iconic “lets see who this really is” phrase."

konnj7,Manic Energy at Maximum,"So this just came to me as a fever dream. I want someone to take this from me and just run with it because honestly I want to play it.\n\nSandbox medieval fantasy MMORPGs, an idea done to death and back but I've been playing MMOs since Ultima and I'll likely spend the rest of my life playing them. I'm tired of the gear treadmill formula, I'm tired of the NPC bosses and the months without content waiting on the next patch. I want a game where the players are the bosses.\n\nLets say the game revolves around cults, the players in these cults slowly performing rituals and such to funnel into the cult leader who after reaching a point can use their cults power to transform into a giant dragon, demon, titan, whatever. This suddenly makes them the global threat. Several cults could be working towards this goal, there could be several of these player monsters at a time. Maybe they're working together, as tends to happen with mega clans maybe one decides he just wants to use his new status to kill everyone else.\n\nThe transformation is permanent, once you become a giant dragon you can't change back and the way you interact with the game is permanently different. When you log out the giant monster remains static, sleeping in the world and still attackable. It becomes your cults duty to protect you while you're offline. If you are killed as a giant dragon your cult is immediately disbanded, and your character is reverted to level one.\n\nAs a mitigation for cults bullying solo players they could be able to pool resources themselves, and after maybe a month transform themselves, creating a dynamic of constantly studying your agressors and learning their routing, and storming their leader when he logs off to try and decimate them while they sleep.\n\nTear it apart, tell me I'm dumb and why players are never given these options on their own, start a kickstarter I don't care. I liked Conan Exiles, if you're curious and its obvious what my favorite feature is."

l4y39c,Elder Scrolls 6 plot idea,"K so, I was at home, bored, playing Skyrim. I was wondering what the plot could be for TES6. Then it struck me, wouldn't it be cool if it was set in future Tamriel? K here is my idea; You start the game playing in regular medieval Hammerfell. You beat a couple dungeons and come across some challenges. In one of the dungeons, You find a journal... your long dead wife's journal. you read it and find out that you and her had a child you didn't know about and that she sold him to a group of marauders for 90 septims. you get a quest called ""The 90 septim son"" which sends you to find your son. You save him but are killed on the way out of the cave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to 878 years later.... You wake up in a bed. You now get to customize your character and name yourself. You are in Hammerfell but in the future. Argonians riding cars, Redguards with their face in their phone (much more high tech than today's phones.) Orcs in a wrestling ring.

l4v89u,A game about evolution and natural selection,"The game would be based around a number of core mechanics. First, it would be split into a number of servers in the style of an MMO - for each server, everything about the player’s creature is saved. Second, each server would be wiped after a set amount of time. Thirdly, directly after a wipe, a set of randomly generated “species” are created with random stats and traits (both of which are explained later). Upon joining a server, a player is given a random set of these creatures that they can choose from. From then on, the objective is simple: work together with others of your species in order to become the dominant species of the server by earning more points overall than other species. Points would be earned by completing milestones before other species and of course by eating/combat. Points can be lost for your species from dying as well.\n\nEarning points for your species would allow you to upgrade stats and traits. Stats would refer to basic values like your health, armor, speed, etc. which would merely be increased by upgrading, this would simulate aging in the game. Traits would be special abilities or effects that would be applied to your creature; like the ability to fly, block hits, inflict bleeding or poison, and/or perform special maneuvers like a charge or something. This would simulate unique features of your species, and upgrading could do a multitude of things; unlock new abilities, or increase a value like damage or duration.\n\nThis way, after each wipe, the meta changes; it never remains constant, although certain traits could certainly match well together."
l4serb,Replayeable Heist Simulator (similar to Hitman),"A game similar to the Hitman series, where you're meant to replay each mission many times over again, creating your own perfect scenario to complete the objective while trying to complete the challenges. Only this time, you're trying to rob the place rather than assassinate a target."

I'm working on a project that NPC and Enemy AI can share memories with each other and react to them depending on their personalities and relationship with others. Even though the system was complex I managed to design a RTS style system that NPCs and enemies driven by themselves while they react to different events immersively.\n\nI'm thinking of developing a RPG with this system. We are only 2 person group. So there are limits. I'm not thinking of using AAA graphics and a Complex story. But I want to keep the immersion of the world with the system I have.\n\nWhat you guys think about this and what do you think should I implement to give the game more life and immersion. Any thoughts? Sorry for my bad English.
l4mm6l,Open world game set on a dying planet with a heavy focus on cybernetic enhancement,"Pretty much the title, you’re character is a survivor on a dying world where the only way to survive outside of a few pockets of safe spaces is with heavy cybernetic enhancements. Think enhancements like Cyberpunk or Deus Ex, but you can go much further with the upgrades, to the point where your character might not even be humanoid anymore (I.e spider tank, four legged sprinting machine). \n\nThrow in an npc to egg on your transformation and one that gets progressively horrified the less human you become and you got yourself some good old fashioned science fiction."

Who would be a good idea to contact and what's a good way to approach them?"
l4k9us,Star Trek/fantasy but in the perspective of the no contact world.,"This can be a Intermediate, Experienced or AAA game depending on how far you wanna take it. It could be 2d or 3d bouth is possible but 3d is preferreable. \n\nAt the start you can only choose the middleage setting. It is wartime and you are fighting in it.\nBecause of plot you find a stone that you can channel magic with. You fight some more and people get scared /hate you and want to kill you if they see you using magic. You can now skill in normal combat or the mistery magic. \n\nThats when you get up ducted by space pirates (because of the stone) . Now you have access to their technology and you can fight in the conflicts of the different worlds. But if you use the wrong weapons the people will hate you. (like bringing a laser gun or chemical warefare to the middleage people) or will praise you as god if their religious. \nYou can also visit the stone magic planets. \n\nYour old skilltree is now 3. Where you had bow previously you have now range weapons like guns. \nWhere you had swords you now have melee weapons. \nWhere you had the stone skills you now have magic. \n\n\nIm not certain about the endings but they could be like this. \n1) you just kill every side on every planet and become the hated ruler. \n2) you are loved because you decided the most historic battles (being like a god to the middle age people, a partner to the star and magic people ) \n\nIt could be a sandbox war game mix or a moratity game\n\nGame mechanics:\n-the 3 skill trees\n-Transporting animals and other stuff from planet to planet (like bringing a dragon to the middle ages and totally wreck their society/enemie encounters) \n- diplomacy/morality funktion that is planet independent \n-fights in:space, the normal and magic world"
l4j5kf,SENSE," \n\nGame idea\n\nSENSE\n\nYou awaken in a building unable to  see, touch or smell. \*It's not covid don't worry.\* All you can remember is an experiment that you were put under for by a strange company. Awakening you hear a voice tell you that something went wrong and “ they “ are loose. To regain certain senses back you need to find the right syringe escape and succeed in the trial you were actually here for. To make this a fair trial,  the voice will allow you to keep your hearing and tells you that the only way to regain your senses is to  find the other syringes. To do this all  you need to listen for is the radio static. However the voice also warns you to not be lead astray as not every sound is friendly and you are not alone in the building. \n\nThere are 4 creatures in the building with you, each one is hunting you based on its ability. \n\nThe creature of Sight preys on those who cannot see, mimicking sounds mundane as electric humming to the radio static and human voices. It stalks along the halls and is purely an ambush predator. It is a gigantic wolf-like creature with long claws and very very sharp teeth. It is entirely deaf and relies on its ability to mimic to lure in its prey. Hiding as well as avoiding suspicious out of place sounds is the best way to avoid this predator    \n\nThe creature of hearing preys on the deaf, listening in to the stumbling of those who cannot see with its massive dead eyes in the dark corridors. Like an aye aye it clacks its hands gently against the walls to guide itself. While it cannot see it can hear amazingly well so hiding from it would be your best best. It looks almost like a gigantic mole with the eyes of a blind cave fish. \n\nThe creature of touch is blind and deaf, but unlike others it can open doors and feel  around so hiding behind doors is no safety should it decide to look around where you happen to be. The easiest way to avoid this horrid creature of tentacles is to simply hide and pray it decides to move on. \n\nThe creature of smell is a creature blind deaf and consistent of a single desire. To feed. The creature follows single mindedly a scent trail it picks up and follows relentlessly at a slow pace until it finds what is following and devours said prey. From this horrid monstrous hungry slobbering creature you can run, but you cannot hide.\n\nEscaping the facility requires the use of different use of your  senses and you can only use one at a time. Each sense can be found via a syringe in different areas as well as finding and opening doors that require the ability to sense an active sense of touch. The surgery has blocked your ability to feel what certain items feel like and the facility has many false access cards. You can only hope to use the right sense strategically staying alive while trying to escape."

Does anybody have an idea what this game could be about?\nThanks in advance!"
l45p58,A PVP Zombies game!!,"So basically if you combined Cod Zombies, with a better system of gambit from Destiny 2. So two teams of two or 4 play zombies. There can be the typical waves and gets harder with time and also Easter eggs and little fun things to do but the other team is playing the same map and with money you accumulate from killing you zombies you can sabotage the other team. Like for instance you can pay to close an room or pay to swap a perk. Or pay to summon stronger bigger zombies. Winner is who can survive longer. I’m sure this can be expanded so it’s not dry maybe could also be whoever does the Easter egg first wins but ultimately it’s a game of sabotage. And also maybe similar to gambit you can enter the enemy teams map and try killing them but that sounds like it would be a little hard but still what do you guys think about this idea?"
l44ucg,Casual mobile game about breeding cute and rare creatures,"My idea would be a cute pixelated game that you have little creatures. You start out with a basic creature, but by crossing the genes and sometimes from random mutations, you can make rarer creatures and sell them for more.  \n\nIt would be a casual game. Maybe a few ads, potential for you to monetize certain aspects unless you wanted to make it with no IAPs. \n\nA cool mechanic would be a way to pay for gene results (dna tests) where you could see the potential outcomes for each breed pair. \n\nI really personally think this would look good as a pixelated game, but that’s just my own personal opinion. It would have a very cute and wholesome feeling to it, and I could see it being really fun to play."
l43vkt,Hacker FPS,"Aimbot, noclip, ESP, flying all of these are mechanics/skills in this FPS, aimbot is always on, flying can be turned on and off, but noclip and ESP are skills that can be activated for a certain amount of time.\n\nThe thematic would probably be cyberpunk or magicpunk."
l432yv,a platformer involving time travel,"Its a 2d platfromer where each level is a chamber and you have to get to the end. You have the ability to reverse time by holding a button, when you do so, your player stays in place while a ""time clone"" of yourself is created mimicking what your movements in the last few seconds. you can use your time clone as a platform, and once it catches up to the current time it just merges with you. and also if you die you become your time clone, so the level doesn't reset.\n\nThis idea might be difficult to program but I think it could make for some interesting puzzles."

We could get up from out cubicle and walk to a meeting and have a real meeting. We could walk around the office and bump into people and casually chat about upcoming jobs.\n\nWe could go outside and bump into other people who are in our industry and ask them if their company is hiring. \n\nWe NEED something like this. Young/new employees have no way of meeting people when all we ever see is our small team in MS Teams.\n\nCan anyone help make this?"

l3nep2,Judge Dredd: Open world Game idea,"I love games and want to work in the gaming industry in the future but for the time being all I can do is learn and think of game ideas which brings me to this one. I recently watched the movie DREDD and couldn’t help but think how cool it would be to have an open world Judge Dredd game. In terms of my Judge Dredd knowledge, I am familiar with Dredd but not a massive fan. Also I am definitely not a game creator and have more or less no experience creating games, just have plenty playing them and I just wrote down a list of things that would make up this judge dredd game. Please feel free to criticise and all advice is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The world**\n\n* Set in mega city 1\n* Mega city 1 is split up into sectors and when the game opens up you only have access to one as the game introduces you the mechanics and how it works - but the sector limit goes away quickly and you get a promotion from which you are granted access to the entire city\n* All buildings can be explored\n* It is fast and easy to get around the city and explore\n* Can go to places such as New York and Washington DC\n* Npcs will give you advice and ask for help as you patrol around the city\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gunplay**\n\n* First person\n* You can lean around corners similar to games like rainbow six seige\n* You start off with a basic pistol but it can be upgraded and use different ammo types, which is also true about every other weapon in the game\n* You end the game with: a pistol, an SMG, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, grenades and a grenade launcher\n* You can dual wield the pistols or the SMGs, you can also chose to put a grenade in your other hand instead of one of those guns which reduces the time it takes to throw one\n* Helmet visor also offers night vision and thermal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gangs and enemies**\n\n* If you focus on a sector crime rate will go down and make it more peaceful and safer\n* You can make crime rate go down by fighting crime and doing side quests and main missions will also affect this as well\n* There is many different gangs throughout mega city 1, with some being very small and inexperienced and others being bigger and more skilled and more powerful\n* If you take down a gang settlement  other nearby gangs will take it over, which can lead to gangs fighting in the streets and other judges going after them\n* Different gangs do different crimes and have different techniques\n* Gangs will also have different enemy types and use different weapons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DREDD**\n\n* Certain scenarios will have dialogue options - this can lead to good and bad consequences\n* Can choose what kind of judge you want to be - by the books or riding the edge\n* The more violent you are the worse reputation you will have which will lead to NPCs not being as inclined to help you and vice versa\n* If you are injured you will start to take damage overtime this can be reduced by taking pain killers but these injuries will eventually stack - you can fix this by  going into the medical menu where you can patch yourself up using a med kit  (think MGS3)\n* Can unlock and wear different uniforms and helmets\n* Can wear body armour to reduce chance of injury\n* Depending on what you choose to equip and take on a mission your appearance will change for example if you take a lot of ammo you will wear a bandolier or if you equip a lot of grenades they will be attached to your chest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Vehicles**\n\n* Motorbike - the vehicle you will start off with, fast and nimble (can mostly go anywhere)\n* Car - not as fast but offers protection against crashes and gunfire, you can also use vehicle weapons and you can also store items and guns\n* Truck - slower moving but takes very little damage and has the most variety of vehicle weapons as well as a canon, can store  more weapons than the car\n* Hover craft - an endgame unlock which you can use to fly around the city, only the judges have access to these so not many vehicles in the sky\n* Dropship - not drivable, what you use for fast travel and can be called at specific points throughout the city, what judges come in to help you and what co-op partners use to spawn into your game with\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Co-op and online**\n\n* You have a customisable co-op judge used for when you join your friends games, you can also use the co-op judge in free roam and do certain side quests and activities with\n* Customisation for the co-op judge will not be too detailed (not dark souls levels of customisation)\n* In co op mode you can free roam and do side quests and activities with them\n* Can do a main quest with a friend as long one of you is dredd\n* Can do 1v1s and 2v2s in a judge HQs\n* In offline, you can choose from a list of select judges to help you with a mission, including your customised co-op partner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Side activities**\n\n* Criminal activity you can tackle: drug busts, riots, hostage situations, robberies, car thefts and thievery, missing people, kidnappings, dirty cops and crime scenes\n* Other activities: shooting range, paperwork, training, other judges and finding collectables\n\nThis is my second time typing this up as I deleted my whole first draft when trying to copy it but anyways... thanks for reading :)"
l3mi1p,Camping Sim - Survival,"I've played games like the Long Dark, RDR2 and various road trip games (like Jalopy and The Long Drive) and I would really love a camping game.\n\nYou'd pick a route on the map, it'll show the general terrain (giving you hints on what gear you'd need), any locations (like small stores or abandoned areas that can be used for shelter), the length in miles and estimated how long it would take. You then choose which backpack you use and you're off.\n\nYou can get money by collecting plants/hunting/creating trinkets and other stuff from the world and selling them at stores, where you can buy supplies and gear. \n\nThere's an intricate fire system where you position your items so the fire can increase, with the dampness making it harder to light. You can use lighters, matches, hand-made fire lighers, firecraft gear. Fires can be used to access skills / skillpoints which you can pour into Firecraft, Bushcraft etc. \n\nYou need to eat, sleep, drink, possibly even piss and crap, as well as regulate body temperature. \n\nThere'd be two main modes - 'Camper' and 'Survivalist'. \n\nThe Camper mode will be more relaxed, with extended starting supplies, money, easier gameplay mechanics - it'll be for those wanting a game to simply relax to where they can just set up camp and do a virtual hike for a few in-game days.\n\nSurvivalist will increase risk and have only fewer starter supplies. When hiking, you may encounter hostile animals and get sick easily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA game like this would be that one game on steam I'd have 10000 hours in. I'd say, if one needed a AAA idea, that it was openworld with a bus/taxi/plane system to travel about."

l3jc5a,VR/Keyboard Multiplayer Game where the PC Players try to survive against VR Player in Horde Survival,"A game where a giant VR player is playing a MOBA/Tower Defense game trying to stop multiple FPS players from advancing by spawning enemies.  I think something like Left 4 Dead but with a currency system for the VR player to spawn enemies, definitely some kind of upgrade thing like in COD: Zombies for the FPS players too.\n\nI think this would give VR players more games to play with their friends who might not have a headset.  And with there needing to be way less VR players to play there wouldn't be a bottleneck for people with headsets."

l35tdz,An FPS shooter set in the Spanish Civil War,"Of all the wars in the 20th century, WW2 has been the most over-saturated setting in gaming. It's time we try another conflict that's more interesting, the Spanish Civil War.\n\nImagine a game where you play as both the Nationalists and the Republicans across several battlefields in Spain. It would be an FPS shooter with fleshed-out characters and moral choices.\n\nHere's my concept of how it would look like: The Story mode would have 2 campaigns for both the Nationalists and the Republicans. On one side you play as a soldier fighting for the Nationalists, while you play as a female on the Republican side. Over the course of the story, the two protagonists would fight in all the notable battles across Spain while having stories of their own, such as bonding with their comrades or falling in love with someone. The ending would show the 2 becoming old and reflecting on their past actions to future generations.\n\nThe multiplayer would be a mix of Battlefield and Call of Duty. You can fight as an infantryman, drive a tank and armored car, and fly a plane in the vast maps. Game modes would be similar to all the other games in the market. There would also be a game mode BF1's Operations where both teams would fight over territories on the map.\n\nThere would also be character customization. You could design what your soldier would look like and make your own class instead of picking one.\n\nOverall, the game would be also educational as it teaches the player about the war."
l35q79,Game where you try to enable an anti-virus while malware shuts down your computer.,"This is inspired by when I thought that was happening to me. Turns out my computer was simply glitching. Oh well.\n\nAs time goes on, your computer would get slower and lose more and more functionality. You might need to find alternate ways to solve problems to combat your computer growing more and more glitchy.\n\nDepending on the difficulty, things like whether or not the antivirus is already downloaded, the efficiency of the virus, and other things would be influenced.\n\nThis probably wouldn't have a whole lot of replay value, but still might be fun to see."
l35a5i,Hidden object game inspired by endless morning hunts,"I have a terrible time in the morning trying to look for things. My morning routine usually begins with me looking through the folds of sheets and blankets to uncover my glasses. Then checking through the laundry basket for keys. And ending with me sticking my hand through every crevice of furniture for my wallet. I have a bowl to keep my essential items, but it usually remains empty.\n\nWhy not a hidden object game, where you have to find items in your apartment by tearing up the place. Every item can be interacted with. From taking the cushions off the couch to emptying the recycling bin (Maybe you need to find an important document). Clues will be audible, which would be the player's recollection of last know events or whatever.\n\nHow would you make a ""Hidden Object"" game unique?"

The maps are huge already but what if a special event was arranged as 2-3 maps combined (or it can be each map) and the best and most famous streamers/players around the world ( Doesn't have to be tarkov players, can be any fps player) were given full decks that they can arrange anyway and made to fight till death?\n\nI know the game's concept is not rather battleground but the idea of an event where we can see full decked out famous players fight till last one survives, with the tense atmosphere and realism of Tarkov would be just like the movies where a bunch of rich people bet on some ex-marines on a fight till death. (There are quite a few movies like that). If legality was arranged we could even bet on these guys just like the rich guys in movies. What do you think?"
l31fbk,Three realm first person supernatural PVP,"Here's a game idea that's been brewing for a while. There are of course lots more details in my head but this is the short version:\n\n**Game play:**  \n\- First person ""goth""-flavor PVP with focus on balance  \n\- Three competing realms each with a distinctive theme.  \n\- Realms spells and abilities are mirrored for balance, only names and visual effect differ\n\n**Play as:**  \nVampire or Witch/Warlock of the Blood Realm  \nWerewolf or Druid of the Sylvan Realm  \nDemon or Dark Angel of the Nether realm\n\n**Features:**  \n\- Characters doesn't level, they age one year per real time day.  \n\- Character appearance/size/abilities/powers change as they grow older.  \n\- Character select size, which determine in game stats  \n\- Characters can fall in battle and be resurrected, or soul killed (very hard) and need to be reborn/restarted  \n\- Every real full moon, each realm elect a Realm Master with special PVP abilities.  \n\- Spells are not ""casted"", words are read from a book, forming incantations that generate effects  \n\- Players can ""breed"" their heir, that inherits traits and becomes playable if/when they die  \n\- Possible to play as human hunter, able to hunt all realms. Easy to kill and limited life span  \n\- Collect souls from players/NPC's to refill power and keep ageing  \n\- In combat, enemies aren't targeted, but affected by cone/point blank/AE spell/melee-effects"

l2xgfs,RPG game.,"You get incredibly random skills. That could either be truly terrible. Or god tier for fighting. And you can have 2. And it could literally be anything.

Extremely random. \n\nIt would also be a game type which i no joke forgot.\n\nIf all your party is dead. Game is over. And your party members most leveled character turns undead. Gets his stats leveled up 4X, Turning it into a boss. And drops a Armour that has his skill fused onto his Armour. Or weapon. When killed. That way you can regain your most leveled characters skill.   \n\n\nFor the multi skill thing. It would be trough Skill fused items. And chance. And sometimes skills work together really well. Cancel out each other. Or are so incompatible that the character wielding the skill instantly dies.   \n\n\nThe ultimate frustrating RNG game. Along with noita."
l2w3zb,Expendable crewman space battle,"I was thinking about a coop game about being an expendable crewman in a large warship durring a space battle. The players' job would be to keep a ship at optimal fighting capacity during a space battle. The players would run around the corridors of the spaceship in FPS mode grabbing stuff from wall mounted dispensers and moving it to where it needs to be. \n\nWhen the crap hits the fan there will be jobs all around the ship from moving shells from the armory to the guns, putting out fires, hauling injured crew members to med bay, and repelling borders. The speed and ability to prioritize will determine if the ship makes it through the battle or not.\n\nThere will be no external view of the larger space battle, but the AI captain will shout orders, give status updates, or warn of impending damage/ boarding action."
l2vhki,VR Puzzle game that uses voice commands to create objects.,"It would use your microphone and speech-to-text to pull from a pool of words that correspond to 3D objects that have functionality. You can also add attributes to the objects by saying adjectives before the object. I will admit it borrows from Scribblenauts, but the art style could be distinct, and the item creation method is different. The puzzles should also avoid being Scribblenauts like. Instead of helping people with a problem, you could have to use locomotion or teleportation to get past an obstacle or station that has clear objectives or functionality. There could be plot that reveals itself through your adventure through the physical space. The puzzles should require the player to think creatively and come up with their own real world physics solution to the problem. The player will also learn their own strategies that they can employ when needed. \n\nThe biggest challenge would be getting a big word bank and creating the 3-D models and properties of objects. Lots of objects will have very simple or nearly useless functions and may serve simply as shapes. There should be regular daily objects like cars, weapons, food, as well as objects that can be given magical properties through adjectives and even verbs. An object could be made to be flying or angry. Players should be able to make animals and different types of people. The art style could be similar to job simulator. It would be a lot of work to think of enough fun, creative ideas for what each object and person does. A simple AI would be a component. The puzzles can involve everyday problem solving or trying to get from one place to another, or moving a lot of things with a unique vehicle or method.\n\nYou should be able to die, and have adjectives applied to yourself. There should also be options to cheese puzzles with silly powerful objects that the player will have to choose to avoid for their own enjoyment. A sandbox mode is also necessary so the player can build something of their choice with objects.\n\nI think this sort of game, being VR, couldn't quite be $60, but it could be sold in early access and then have levels added as time goes on in development and more words are added. Players could also suggest items that the developers didn't think of. There could also be a level maker where the player can create 3-D spaces and walls, adding their own objects and win-states."
l2t9bb,Pikmin combines with Seaman,"The game would have you growing creatures from the ground and nurturing them using scheduled feeding times and cage cleaning. You then get the creatures out on a hunt for more materials or eggs by using a little robot to lead them. The creatures will attack anything that they are told to attack or will pick up any single item while going on with the scavenging missions. There are hazards like deep water, frost, poison gas, wind, and sticky sap that will hinder or kill off your creatures. You can however get materials to create said hazards and set them up in a different cage and put some creatures there. Eventually, the creatures will adapt and become immune or tolerant of the hazards (being able to swim, fire coat, flight, etc.) and can be added to the main squad. The creatures will grow up and become stronger over a course of real time, going from small blob, to having more facial features, to having limbs, and end up as buff,strong, tiny humanoids. \n\nThere is online play where you can combine your cage with another person’s cage to get breeding going or to get materials or you can invade someone’s cage to steal resources. Same can happen to you so you you must put up defenses like sap or fire.\n\nI was thinking of using this for myself but I have no motivation to use this so..."
l2roud,Score Frenzy Arena Shooter,"So, If you've ever played a shooter game that has different game modes, It's obvious that everyone has a favorite mode. TDM, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy, CTF, etc. \n\nI had an idea to make everyone happy simultaneously. Basically it's your standard 6v6 shooter game, Different classes/weapons and so on, but what makes this game unique is in it's core game mode. \n\nThe objective of the game is to score the most points, while playing all the game modes at the same time.\n\nAt spawn there is a bomb to plant on the enemy objective. At the enemy objective there is also a flag to capture, as well as a hardpoint that periodically changes position around the map.\n\nYou score points by doing anything. If you successfully plant and detonate a bomb. The bomb respawns and you get a point bonus. If you capture the flag you get a point bonus. If you kill an enemy you get a point bonus. You get points for holding down the hardpoint and so on.\n\nBasically the game is a super fast paced shooter on crack."

l2pacu,"If you can combine any/all games, what games you choosing? What’s the end result like?","This is my design: \n\n(Action-Adventure Hack and Slash Sandbox MMORPG) \n\nWhen you lock on to the battle zone or enter the battle zone, you will hear all the microphones of the players participating in the battle.  Players will also hear your microphone during combat.  Outside of combat, you can lock on to any player and listen to that player's microphone.  The player can also listen to your microphone.  All parties / guild players can always hear each other's microphones, even if the players are in completely different locations.  You can mute anyone's microphone at any time.\n\n To hear a person's mic outside the battle zone, lock on to another player or create / extend one open mic zone.  You can create an open mic zone only if you are not in another player's open mic zone.  The open mic zone creates an invisible barrier that surrounds the creator, including players within the radius of the barrier, without blocking anything.  The open mic zone allows all players in the barrier to participate in open mic parties.  Join with the push of a button and you'll hear all players' microphones from all players in the open mic zone.  Open mic parties are different from regular parties and guilds.  When you leave the open mic zone, you are no longer a member of the party.  For microphones, all mute options are always available.\n\n There are customizations for height, children / adults, fat / thin, clothes, equipment, armor, appearance, weapons, abilities, movements, skills, magic, and summons.  Customizing the appearance of the character is similar to the game ""God Eater 2"" and the game ""Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization"".  You can create up to 4 characters.  You can switch to control one character or one of ""your"" other created party members.  The character's AI can be set in the same way as in the game ""Star Ocean: Until the end of time"".  You can play the game with any character you create.  You can switch control of the party character at any time.  If you don't want to control your ""own"" character during battle, just set the character to AI.\n\n There are several specific places where you can talk to different NPC characters and enter different servers to advance the story.  These servers warp / teleport ""your"" different party characters to any section of the current story.  Each server has a limited number of players, and each server has all players of the same level within 10 intervals (eg Server 1-Level 1-10, Server 2-Level 10-20).  You can always enter a server above your level, but you cannot enter a server below your level.  You can earn certain things by completing different parts of the story.  There are many side stories, hidden ones, and optional ones, which are not part of the story.  There are also many gates and portals similar to the game "".hack: Infection"", where you can choose different servers and experiment with different dungeons.\n\n To engage in combat, you can either attack someone / something or be attacked by someone / something.  A character / player will not gain experience unless that character / player hits an opponent at least once.  The hit must be a hit even if the damage dealt is 0, not the damage caused by the status effect.  During the battle, the radius of the battle zone is automatically set according to the position of the first participant.  Only the first combat participant can lock the combat zone at any time.\n\n Locked battle zones have invisible barriers that keep battle participants inside, blocking entry into all other zones.  If the battle zone is unlocked, other players / characters outside the battle zone can join the battle zone and gain experience points.  You can only gain experience points if you are in the same battle zone as the enemy you defeated when you defeated it.  All different enemies have different amounts of experience points that players earn during their defeat.  If the enemy is defeated by multiple participants, the experience points will be evenly divided among those participants.  If there are no players in the battle zone for more than 2 minutes, it will no longer be an existing battle zone.  There are harsh environments that your character may not be able to tolerate.  The item ""Magic Battle Zone Lock"" creates a locked battle zone that surrounds you, including all players within the radius, and blocks fire, water, etc.\n\n Players cannot attack another non-enemy player unless one player achieves ""G"" status or offers a player-versus-player challenge option.  To provide player-versus-player challenges, get close enough to ""lock on"" to another player, select challenge options, and extend one battle zone barrier that surrounds all players / targets.  ..  All player-versus-player challenge participants must be within the battle zone barrier.  All players in the battle zone must select the option to accept the challenge to start the battle.  The battle music option for this battle allows you to vote / agree or randomly select one playlist from one participant.  ""G"" status is achieved when the bar / meter is full, either by attacking the target or by being attacked for some reason.  ""G"" is a ""special"" that all players can ""use"" with the push of a button.  If you achieve ""G"" status, you will not be an enemy of other players until you attack.  Once you reach ""G"" status, you cannot be attacked by any player until you attack that player or participate in a player-versus-player challenge.\n\n If a ""G"" attacks a non-enemy player in a battle zone, that ""G"" cannot lock that battle zone.  ""G"" gains all experience points from the defeated ones, unless those ""Gs"" do not attack allies.  The ""G"" status lasts for 11 minutes.  When you defeat a ""G"", that ""G"" loses its ""G"" status, is no longer an enemy, and anyone can revive the player.  ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are ""King"" / ""Queen"", ""Boss"", or ""Elite"" characters.  Also, ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are participating in a player-versus-player challenge.  If four or more ""G"" s attack an ally in a battle zone, that battle zone achieves ""Frenzy"" and all players can attack all players.  The frenzy battle zone can only be locked by King / Queen, Boss, and Elite characters / players.\n\n When a player dies, that player can wait to be resurrected by someone else.  Alternatively, the player can choose the option to return to the entrance to the place where the player died, choose a server to return to the open world, or go to the equipment graveyard.  If you die more than 10 times, the option to return to the entrance to the place of death will not be available.  Your mic still works while you are dead.  You cannot earn experience points or items while you are dead.\n\n There are many continents on the map.  All continents are made up of zones.  Each zone has its own enemies and neutrals.  In most cases, all enemies and / or neutrals in each zone are at about the same level within the zone.  When all enemies in the zone have been defeated or all achievements in the zone have been completed, the last remaining players must fight each other.  Anyone who conquers a zone has the title of ""boss"" for that zone, and that player can choose the enemies in that zone.  Players select those enemies based only on all enemies defeated in the game, except for all defeated players.  Also includes boss enemies (different color schemes for boss enemies).  Players also select the level of those enemies, but only up to the highest level of enemies they have defeated so far.  If a ""boss"" player's zone is conquered by another player, that ""boss"" player loses the ""boss"" title.\n\n There is one king / queen per continent, either as a player or an NPC.  All Kings / Queens will now have 4 elite characters.  Defeat King / Queen in battle to earn his / her crown and title.  Kings / Queens can choose an elite character from their list of friends or from AI characters created by King / Queen players.  When you become a King / Queen, you can get a special item ""Crown"" that raises your stats.  You can keep the crown equipped even if you are not a king / queen, but you cannot wear it visually unless you are a king / queen.  Elite characters are kings / queens, as long as the kings / queens who made them elite remain kings / queens.  Kings / Queens can enter any battle zone at any time, even if they are locked.  Kings / Queens can attack any character they like at any time, including other players.\n\n When you reach a boss / mini boss in a dungeon, temple, story progress, cave, castle, etc., the battle zone may be locked by another player who is fighting the boss / mini boss.  You can go up to something that looks important nearby.  Example: A small statue nearby.  At the push of a button, you will be given the option to fight the boss / mini boss alone or with other players on another server.  You will not be able to rematch with the boss / mini boss unless you re-enter the entrance.  You can enter the server with various parties.  Any part of the game can be completed solo or party.  A party can consist of all players and all AI characters created by the player for that player's party.  There are servers with lobbies for dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc., and players in those lobbies have to wait for the lobby to fill up so that they can enter dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc.  ..\n\n There are summons obtained by leveling up, summons obtained by achievements, and summons obtained by defeating enemies.  When you defeat the big bosses you face in the game, most of them will be earned as ""summons"".  You can only have a limited number of ""summons"".  The Summon option allows you to summon one ""summon"" to perform one of the most powerful attacks, or control the ""summon"" as an AI party member.  When summoned as a party member, you can switch between the control of the summon and the control of the created character.  Summons are only summoned for 4 minutes.  If you unsummon a Summon, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the Summon option again.  If you complete a very powerful attack summoned with the Summon option, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the summon again.\n\n There are mounts you can get.  Traveling with mounted beasts etc. makes traveling much easier.  You can get a ""mount"" for travel by tame them with items or defeat them in battle.  While moving with a mounted beast / ""summon"", it can take some damage before the player is knocked off or the mount gets confused.  At higher levels of speed racing, you can be attacked by racers.  Also, at higher levels of speed racing, others who are not racers can attack you.  If you tame the same species many times, it will be available as a pet or ""summon"" and can be summoned at any time.  Some mounts can move on / in any terrain, including water, walls, mountains, and even trees, so you can reach hidden areas, hidden treasures / enemies / ""summons"", and more.  Some species have the ability to fly.  There are also cars that you can drive for an easier trip.  ..\n\n You don't need a beast / summon to fly.  There are items you can get that give your party the ability to ""fly"".  With these items you can ""fly"" for 10 minutes.  There is a way to permanently acquire the ability to ""fly"".  In flight, it's the same as in the game Kingdom Hearts 2, unless you select the Ascend option.  Select the Ascend option to allow you to fly freely in all heights and directions.  There is one button you can hold to automatically fly towards a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  With the ""fly"" ability, you can reach floating or hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".\n\n There are competitive flight races and other races that you can participate in to win valuables.  Your character can gain the ability to transform your character's visual form into a variety of obtained visual forms.  One such visual form that your character can get is the form of a beast.  These visual forms are abilities.  You can unequip these abilities and select other options such as double summoning.  You can customize your character's race, color, appearance, and more at any time, except during combat.\n\n There is an ability called ""Unlimited Jump"" similar to ""Double Flight"" in the game ""Kingdom Hearts: Fragmented Passage"", but it is not limited to double.  Like the anime ""Bleach"", there is a function called ""Ground Lock"" that allows you to land in the air and run around as if there is an invisible ground in the air.  It turns off every time something / someone hits you.  With these two abilities, you can reach floating and hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".  There is another ability called ""teleport"".  Teleport to a random location next to a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  Every time you use this ability four times, you have to wait four minutes before you can use it again.\n\n All player characters can be leveled up to a maximum level of 370.  There are several level 400 optional ultimate bosses.  Some of these bosses always leave the player with a legendary object when the Ultimate Boss is defeated.  There are a wide variety of legendary objects, including crowns.  You can level lock your character whenever you want.  This will prevent your character from gaining experience until you turn level lock off.\n\n Tournaments vary.  Players defeat players, players defeat computers, teams defeat teams, teams defeat computers.  The status of players such as bosses, kings, and elites will be displayed next to their names if those characters are locked on by other characters.  As long as the other player is not an enemy, you are guaranteed to be able to see the other player's health bar.  There are items that can be used to warp to friends' locations, etc.  These items can be purchased or obtained.  When you warp to a friend's location, you will be teleported to the entrance to that friend's location or where the friend is.\n\n Equipment graveyards are places where all equipment lost / discarded by all players is scattered everywhere.  There are no enemies other than the player or multiple players who can attack you.  You can also approach a weapon or equipment and challenge it with the push of a button.  This allows you to fight the ghost copy of the player to whom the weapon or equipment / armor once belonged.  This includes the player's level / stats / abilities / skills / ""summons"" and more.  The ghost's weapon / equipment is in the same state as when the owner lost / discarded it.  When you defeat the ghost, you can acquire the weapon / equipment, and the weapon / equipment will be in the same state as when the ghost used it.  Only the player who challenges the weapon or equipment can get the weapon or equipment after defeating the weapon or equipment.\n\n All weapons / equipment have levels, stats, and optional qualities / effects.  All weapons / equipment can be leveled up and changed through the ""Inner World of Equipment"", as in the game ""Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"".  The color schemes of all enemies and all bosses are different there.  You can reset your weapon to level 1 if needed.  Doing this will reduce the statistics, but the appearance, quality / attributes, and ""effect"" will remain the same.\n\n You can always get things or buy things for their appearance.  With the exception of abilities, skills, ""summons"", crowns, and trophies, you can ""hold"", discard, exchange, or sell whatever you like.  You can give money to anyone you want.  You can get or unlock ""optional visual appearance"" stuff such as pointed ears, tails, various wings, wing colors, accessories, glasses / shades, jewelry, markings, tattoos and more.  All ""visual appearance"" combinations, except the character's visual form obtained from ""abilities"", can be achieved as soon as you start this video game.  Not all varieties are available for immediate sale, but any player can acquire, trade, or sell them.  Most of them are for sale from the beginning, and many are ridiculously expensive, but any player can give you free money or get you to get it.  You can't buy or get anything with real money.  Strictly speaking, it's just in-game money.\n\n There are different types of items, weapons, equipment, and cards with the same name.  These types include differences in ""look"" / appearance, statistics, abilities, effects, and attributes.  If a player uses the ""player skill"" ""steal"" / ""mug"" against another player, only weapons and equipment can be stolen.  You cannot use the ""player skill"" ""stealing"" / ""mug"" against other players who are not enemies.  Stealing attacks / techniques / skills can only be used during ""battle"".  When used against a player, the chances of ""stealing success"" vary between 5%, 10%, and 15%.  If you use it against non-players, your chances are much higher.\n\n You can collect cards and have the ability to turn enemies into cards like in the game ""Final Fantasy VIII"".  You can play card games with other players, exchange cards, get cards from enemies, treasures, prizes and more.  Cards can be converted into items.  Strong and rare cards can be turned into the best and rarest items.  You can challenge random players / NPCs to ""card games"" except during ""battle"".  There are card tournaments held in various places.  You can listen to or mute the microphone while playing cards.  You can also skip directly to playing a card game from the title menu, which has a server that you can enter just to play cards.  All cards and items are shared between characters in the actual game and in the title screen card game.  There are different card game rules in different places.  If no rules are set, players will either play with the agreed rules or the rules will be randomly selected.  The player who becomes the ""boss"" of a zone can choose the card rules for that zone.  Players who become ""King"" / ""Queen"" can choose the card rules of the card game that ""King"" / ""Queen"" plays.\n\n Author Jeffrey Robert Palin Jr."

l2hwdi,NASA style KSP simulation,"Hear me out here as this could take some explaining \n\nMost are familiar with kerbal space program (a space craft design and flight sim) \n\nA game designed around this notion of building and flying a space craft to the moon or other celestial bodies, BUT, the person flying the space craft has to rely on friends (a multiplayer aspect) to give out telemetry readings and countdowns to certain actions or marks\n\nThink like the old nasa/Apollo missions where a bunch of guys sat in mission control and told astronauts on board “go for separation in 3, 2, 1” , imagine that but it’s a rocket you and your friends have designed, and built within a certain budget and with what parts are unlocked at that time, your friends have certain roles (engineer, chief, pilot, etc) to cover and communicate in getting your rocket from earth to the moon\n\nAdding in faults and problems, working out launch windows and exact timing of launch, weather aspects, etc can all be selected in a prior menu to make it more or less realistic\n\nApologies if this is rambling, I’m not good at explaining haha"
l2g7q9,Best video game idea!,"So do you ever notice these open world games that have real life features to them such as the map being part of real life,the map being like as if you were walking in real life?\n\nWell I have idea,what if you were to create a game we’re the map is huge\nYou can play the game like real life and the only people able to make the map better is the people playing the game.\n\nYou can die in this game,People can kill you,animals can kill you,you can be hit by cars,elements can kill you and nature can kill you,police can kill you,military can kill you.npcs can kill you,etc.\nIt is in your power to survive and make your own story.\n\nmake some traders in the game to trade goods people need, ncps can talk and tell you tips on how to craft or secret places to go or help them with task to earn supplies.\n\nncps can turn into zombies,ncps can be killed and never returned,you can make an ncp child with a romance feature added to the game.\n\nIt is up to you to get food,make shelter,survive,make your own civilization,build an army.\n\nI want someone to make a game where you can shoot someone and only have to worry about real people in the game coming after you,see how the government turns out see how the civilization turns out in this game.Will the virus die or can we make it to the future.\n\nrole play features added such as school,jobs,military units police units,Air Force,Bandits,robbers,prisons and cartels\n\nYou can go to school and learn about things to help you progress in the game \n\nSmall or medium jobs in the game to earn some quick cash \n\nCrimes can be caught by the police and you can be captured and took to prison and from there,have good karma and get out have bad karma stay or escape or be a king pin.\n\nAir Force/military to help ncps,and you not unless you have bad karma.\n\nThis game should be made where you can do whatever you want,thus allowing the people who made the game to constantly have things to add to the game.\n\nI mean you can even make money in the game and go to the trader and spend  real life money for in game currency. \nWhy has anyone not made a game like this?\n\nYou don’t need cash to find supplies,you need cash for food,ammo,car parts,bags,clothes,etc.\n\nYou can parkour across buildings and run for miles and swim and climb trees and hunt and fish and drive cars and kill and smoke and drink and eat and fight and party you can do anything \n\nit’d basically be a fallout,rust,gta,call of duty,dayz,armored 3,just cause an many more combined \n\nProblem is everyone thinks on how are we gonna\nMake this game where people can do everything all on the controller well why don’t you go look at the layout of buttons on most of these games and figure it out.you can make the game you can make the controls lmao I’m just joking but please share this idea if you like I know it’s a great one."

l1mftr,A Black Friday game where you throw the items as weapons.,"The mechanic aspect of this would not only be the fact that you can throw items to damage other players, but the higher worth of an item, the more damage it does. The caveat of this is that the items break as soon as they are thrown at another player. This implements a good balance of choosing between damaging other players at the cost of your score or getting the highest score but being defenseless.\n\nWhile this could be for a Black Friday game, I could see this mechanic being adapted for other games as well."
l1md66,Another game idea I had where there is no way to change what happens,"So this is yet another game idea that I had in the past but I decided to think about it more to flesh it out a bit.\n\nThe main premise of the game would be that u are an Archeologist on the hunt for rare and unknown artifacts of the past, but unlike other Archeologist u decide to go into ancient places rather than dig up such artifacts.\n\nThis game would have u go into many places such as:\n\n\n* Ancient egypt; Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the desert during a sandstorm.\n* Japan; ancient temples, and Sacred forests\n* Africa; Exploring the wild jungle and caves\n* Ruins of castles in countries like Poland, Germany, Russia, etc.\n\nThere could also be DLC (or main game if not feeling like adding DLC) areas such as:\n\n* Mount Sinai in Egypt\n* Stonehenge\n* Easter Island\n* Atlantis\n\nEach area would have treasures that could be found along with some have ancient artifacts with mystical powers. After finding an artifact the player would leave the area and would be meeted by a shady business man in a white suit and body guards who's intentions are questionable. Then you would be met with a choice to either give the artifact or fight this man (this would happen everytime that u find an artifact and each fight would get progressively harder. Eventually in some of the later fights the business man would start using the mystical powers of his own artifacts to fight u)\n\nIf u manage to defeat the man, u would keep the artifact where u could do one of 2 things, sell the artifact for a hefty price so u have money for better equipment or keep the artifact in Hope's of uncovering how it works and using its powers to help u in battle. If u lose to the man however he will beat u unconscious and u would wake up in the same place u lost with the artifact taken (furthermore if in later fights he starts using artifacts he will start using the power of the artifacts that u have lost to him).\n\nIn each area where artifacts can be found there would always be a powerful boss protecting it that u need to defeat in order to get it: (this is a rough example bosses there could be for egypt)\n\n* Ancient egypt; Pyramid 1(A mummified wizard of the sun), Pyramid 2(A giant golden scarab), Sphinx(Cthulu), Sandstorm (A massive Cobra).\n\nThe story would revolve around you and that business man who claims to collect artifacts.\nEventually his intentions would be discovered if u managed to keep all of the artifacts and not sell any of them as that would awaken a powerful beast that he desperately tried to keep at bay but u managed to keep.\n\nThis game wouldn't have a canonical ending (unless u want to count defeating the final beast and collecting its artifact as an ending), there would also be a multiplayer game since this would be a free roaming world u could if u wanted to challenge your friends to see who gets more artifacts or simply battle them to see who's superior (or play with randoms).\n\nThe most unique mechanic would be that if u lost your artifact to the business man there would be not reloading to try again, the only way to get that artifact would be through reading with other players online or restarting the game completely (as unlike in WOW which this game idea might be compared to the boss and artifact would respawn, they are a one time thing per game)\n\nAs I said with my previous idea I am not a game designer I only have a creative mind, so if anyone wishes to use any of my ideas feel free to do so"
l1le65,Aetherian Lore,"This mind-bending story from the Aetherius Society is a gold mine for a game plot in my opinion. Sci-fi/fantasy crossover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Completion of The Alien Mission**  \n""A non-human alien intelligence, fabricated by entities outside of this Galaxy, was discovered in the lower astral realms of Earth. This alien ""android"" was programmed to take control over all life on the physical and subtle realms of Earth and had the power to do so! It was almost indestructible and had the capability of creating huge and deadly thought-forms. It had been dormant for millions of years but was shaken from its dormancy by the Primary Initiation of Earth in 1964. Because the position of Earth was considered to be strategic from a military point of view, the entities who made and programmed the android intended to make a base on Earth for future use as a striking point against the Solar System and other parts of this Galaxy.  \n\n\nThe battle took place in the lower astral realms, taking eight months and 24 sorties into the hells by the Adepts. For the first nine Phases, the Three Adepts battled alone but in later Phases, They were joined by Adepts Nixies Zero Zero Four and Nixies Zero Zero Five; certain Members of the Great White Brotherhood; and an ally in the lower astral realms, the ""Prince"" and his army.  \n\n\nAfter a horrendous conflict, the Forces of Light prevailed and the Five Adepts and Their helpers were able to evict the alien from its lair in the lower astral realms and send it out of the Solar System. The final battle in this Mission took place on January 22nd, 1966, three months after the alien was evicted."""

l1f3y0,A massive multiplayer 3d and or 2d undertale game,"small spoiler for undertale warning.  Ok so my idea is good in my opinion, this idea is a pvp undertale game, you start out with nothing but a few spins for a character or two, this game would be where you get to play as any undertale character in any au/alternate universe or the original game, as long as you win a character when you spend one of your spins for it. the game would probably have no microtransactions either. one concept of the game i have thought of was having to gain currency with the character you are lucky enough to unlock with your ""spin."" but the cool concept in my opinion is that once you unlock a character you have to upgrade every aspect of your character, from the dialogue to the personality to the attacks. did i ever say this game would have 2d multiplayer boss fights, in which one side plays a monster or a human and vice versa for the other side?   i never explained what a ""spin"" actually is though. it works as a spin the wheel but it's a wheel with every character from the au or game you are spinning for. it would be a really long-term project but it would be awesome. feel free to ask questions about the design of the game because i believe i haven't elaborated on the mechanics and gameplay, etc, enough."

l17flt,"You are Giant Sentient Candy whose only purpose is to be eaten. You can frolick around getting eaten bit by bit while getting smaller, lighter, and able to go more places.","So basically it's a reverse Katamari game, trying to get as small as possible. The starting size and shape is probably about the same as a large dog.\n\nA 3D game. You're in a foresty area. Some larger animals will come up to lick you, and that will shrink you by a little bit, but any creature in the game will eventually be satiated and lose interest, even ants (you need to find MORE ants.)\n\nMostly, though, you'll need to break off parts of yourself in sensible quantities for smaller creatures to chew on, by crashing against rocks and the ground. Human campers are sometimes around to eat your forest-floor-leftovers too, but they will run away if they see you.\n\nAll in all, the game is kind of an environmental puzzle. There are things you can only do while big, like reach certain heights. There are things you can only do small, like fit through holes.\n\nDifferent stages offer different actions to figure out.\n\nFalling from higher heights breaks off more bits of you, which is good if you find a spot where it can be consumed by lots of beasts, but if no animals are there, it goes to waste and lowers your final score. Falling from a VERY high height will crack you asunder, and the game will be over, likely leaving you with a low score. The score is mostly calculated from the percentage of your body that was eventually chomped. But there are additional bonuses, for example, map completion and managing to distribute yourself among more and more creatures. Don't just get chomped by a couple of large ant colonies. Spare a chunk of your sweet butt for the deer and raccoons and little girls. Record time will also be recorded, but wouldn't count against you. Maybe a time bonus.\n\nAh, if you accidentally break off chunks in the wrong section of the map with no animals around, you have a mouth that can pick up candy so you can drop it elsewhere. But you have to be careful because when you drop chunks for the third time, the mouth crumbles away, too. (In other words, you can use this skill three times, and the third time includes the mouth chunks too, so plan carefully!)\n\nNow, the reason you can move around is that your whole body is hard candy, except the four joints where your limbs meet the torso. Those are made of gummy! An important note about the gummy joints is that even though ants are your number one reliable consumer, if you stand around ants for too long, they'll crawl all over you and eat your gummy parts. If this happens for a while, eventually you'll fall apart where you stand. Then they WON'T eat big sections of the candy because they can't carry it back. Your score for the round will be low when large body parts are left over. So break off bits of yourself in their vicinity, but respect the distance!\n\nWater is also slowly dangerous. If you can dissolve yourself a little in a puddle safely, a creature might drink it. That's a valid strategy. But if it's deep or flowing water, say goodbye to the sugar. The good news is you at least float and can swim to shore.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the candy character shrinks EVENLY as it breaks apart and melts. It doesn't get one long leg and one short leg or whatever. I guess that could be fun in a challenging way, but probably aggravating to play and plan.\n\nWhen small enough, the game will alert you that you've reached Itty-Bitty Status! Now that you're really small at the end, skittering around like a twig-legged gobstopper, I want there to be Stylish Finishes. At this point anything can eat you as long as they aren't already full, but don't just get dragged off by a bug. Fall INTO the anthill from above, nothin-but-net style! Stylish Finish! Ride a leaf on the river to a secret scavenger's den! Uncover the super-elusive dung beetle in advance while you are still large, then track him down again later to get rolled off! Or dissolve away inside a little water-filled tulip to be drunk by a swarm of hummingbirds! Or roll onto the hand of a napping hiker at the base of a hill who eats you in his sleep while dreaming aloud, ""Oh, my sweet Marcy, baby! I found your wedding ring at last! Here in the grass, glistening like the day I put it on your finger! Please don't be angry anymore! Please don't throw it away again in tears! All this time I've been wandering the wilderness to get my mind off your fading love that became my own broken heart. What did I do? What did you ever need? Take me back, my love. I'll do anything! Wear my ring again, I beg you. And I seal it with a kiss... How sweet it is! The sweetness of your hand still lingers on this ring after all this time, all these years! ..."" Lick, crunch munchy-munch. "" Zzz, mmpphrrr, Marcy... Don't go...""\n\nYou get more points for this!\n\nThe name of the game is, well, ""You are Giant Sentient Candy"".\n\nI have no idea why I thought of all this, but now you've read it. So there."

l0yegl,Apocalyptic Randomizer,"""I knew it. The signs were all there. Maybe it was the dream that pushed me, but I knew it. The destruction of the world nears.""\n\nThis is an idea that I've been playing with for many years. I can't find quite the right game or have time to create a mod or obviously have the resources to develop it myself. Maybe you work at a AAA or something I don't know. If I put this out in the world maybe someone will pick up this game so maybe I can play it and the fun will never end.\n\nThe idea developed a bit from the best part of Fallout 4 for me, the settlement building. I would purposely set out to find the settlements so I could style a new place with a new theme and be able defend it as I see fit. Although clunky at times and an inability to test my defenses, just something about breaking down a car and some trees in the area to remake into a post-apocalyptic dream home was something so fun.\n\nTo the nitty-gritty. There wouldn't be an overarching story per se. This is something that the player would create (much like Rimworld). I will share more of this idea as it comes up. It would be much like a Civilization or Crusader Kings type grand strategy with the idea to ""conquer"" but not necessarily in the same way. It would be city-building much like Fallout 4 or Surviving the Aftermath that could be done in 1st person or 3rd person much like Metal Gear Survive.\n\nThe map would be a randomized open world (like what Civilization could do two-dimensionally) complete with a multiple climates including Tundra, Jungle, Forest, Plains, Desert, Islands, Urban, Suburban, etc. Although it could be possible with the way they do open world games with procedural environments (like a No Man's Sky), it might be difficult to be randomized because of how good I'd want the graphics to be (like Last of Us or AC Valhalla). Although The Forest got close, it's roughly the same idea in certain instances. The randomization of the world and scenario would be important because this would greatly raise the replayability because of what other similar games lack.\n\nMost of the game would be 1st person especially when fighting and exploring except when determining certain structures (optional) or what area you choose to take over next as you will read in a bit. \n\nThe major difference in this game is the **Prepping and the random type of Apocalypse.** \n\nThe Beginning\n\nYou can choose where you start, the type of person you are, amount of money/resources, and even the type of apocalypse or you just randomize it all. So maybe you're neurosurgeon relaxing in your weekend cabin getaway when everything goes down. Maybe you're with your wife and kids in an apartment. But when it happens, it happens. There'd be a predetermined amount of time to ""prep"" getting together all the different types of things you may need. This could help or hurt depending upon the Apocalypse. Perhaps you decide to start on a island and the oceans overflow. You wake up on a boat with only a few of the things you prepared with. Maybe you're perfectly set up in your weekend cabin and not in one of the many resource-rich, urban cities when the Zombies attack. That's much of the fun!\n\nThe Middle\n\nThe Apocalypse happens. Depending upon which one determines how you survive, thrive, and reclaim the world for the rebuilding of mankind.\n\nThe different world enders and some of which make them unique:\n\n1. Alien Invasion - (Difficult Enemies, Easy to Recruit \[make sure they aren't copies though\], Quicker Access to High Technology)\n2. Ocean Rise - (Easier to reclaim world \[smaller area\], Harder to get material \[flooded areas\]\n3. Financial Collapse - (harder to recruit lower class if starting in medium or upper class, Difficult Mercenaries for the rich enemies)\n4. Zombie - (Easy to recruit \[as long as they haven't been bitten\], Difficult enemies that evolve over time)\n5. Solar Flare - (Most old electronics unusable, slower settlement build)\n6. A.I. Takeover (aka Skynet) - (Easy to recruit \[make sure they aren't cyborgs\], Difficult enemies that learn over time, Easy access to high technology)\n7. Nuclear War - (harder to navigate areas because of radiation, Difficult Foreign Enemies and Marauders too)\n8. Plague - (Hard to recruit \[mistrust\] and lack of people, settlement building difficult because of possible outbreaks, difficult marauders)\n9. Asteroid Impact or Super Volcano (basically a long Winter Event) - (Hard to navigate except in certain climates because of the cold, settlement building difficult, lack of food resources\n\nOnce the event happens, that's when the real game gets going. You are now THE leader, sucks to be you. The goal is to establish settlements/defendable structures in a zoned area. Much like Civilization you can't build too close to another. So there's basically a grid to work with and they vary in size depending on the type of climate zone. Only one settlement determines a vast open area outside of it. If it's a pretty big area like plains or something, a zone wouldn't go any bigger than a certain size. So there might be several zones in the plains. How well you prepared beforehand can really come in handy. Like practicing how to work with electronics in order to send out a call to others who might come to your settlement. \n\nThe idea is to build a settlement that can meet the needs of everyone and be defensible. You deconstruct items or find raw material to be built into new structures. You recruit people (this would be finite and limited depending on the world-ender) and assign them tasks depending on their skills. This is similar in concept to Survivalist: Invisible Strain. A high building skill raises up your defenses and structures faster. Some of them could seek out and find resources, other people, or conquer areas. A high recon skill or fighter skill raises the chance better resources are found or a new settlement could be taken over or founded (much like a Civilization). **That's one of the main goals of the game.** To reclaim the world from other societies either by alliances or conquering. An area cannot be claimed until a settlement reaches a certain point. So if you nuke a neighbor, it'll take that much longer to clean up the fallout and build a new settlement. It's also harder to defend a settlement that's growing.\n\nThere are benefits to building settlements quickly as trade can help more settlements build quickly and also word can be sent faster to get more soldiers if another settlement or area is being attacked or if an larger force is needed for a new area to conquer. You can also provoke an enemy to attack thus weakening their defenses for a later attack. Remember all fighting is done 1st person or I'm willing to make it more like the battles in Total War.\n\nThe End\n\nMost scenarios end the same way. Either the entire world is claimed or time runs out and you get a score based on total settlement size, human population, etc. Some scenarios might have multiple end game. For instance, building a missile that could take out the Alien Mothership instead of just wiping them off the Earth.\n\nThen you do it all again!\n\nI know I would love something like this. To be immersed in world that may seem bleak is all the more fun when you work to rebuild, whether that be in a good way or a bad way. The choices are yours! So someone please! If you can do this. Make it happen!"
l0xw42,"I More ""Empire"" GTA Game","I wish there was a game like GTA, but where the real fun comes from building an empire than furious grinding, it's about literally taking over the city. It offers a lot of ways to commit crimes.\n\nFor example, the ""generic player"" may start out homeless, get a job, and run drugs on the side. Overtime, he either decides to move up the Drug Organization ladder and have a squad, and eventually runs the organization as a right-hand man. Or, you could quit and form a new organization. Start from solo-running and then withing a few dozen hours, you're a drug lord.\n\nAnother option would be governmental. You become a politician, win elections, and then sell out to corporations.\n\nThere would be plenty of other ways you could play. You could be a malware coder, hitman, jewlery thief, bank robber, identity thief, or other. Ypu could embezzle money from a company and commit corporate crimes. Commit fraud on the board of a company ot as an executive of a company.\n\nFurthermore, the game would also give you the ability to run a legit life. You could get a job or start a company. Or you could be an investor. The game would have a realistic Stock Market, housing market, etc.\n\nPretty much, a money sim that portrayed as a GTA-like crime game. The reason for the Crime is most people need to be hooked in, but the investing mechanics and alternative forms of gameplay would keep you hooked.

l0xt8k,A Horror game where you are being chased by farmers in a small rural village,"\n\nI have had this idea for quite a while now and I only really think about it while I am walking my dog.\n\nMy game idea is a Single player / Multiplayer game based in a small rural village. There will be A runner and 2 or 3 farmers (the chasers) I have not thought of the main objective but the goal will be to access something inside one of the 3 farms. \n\nAs the runner you will have to collect weapons, food and other general supplies. You will have to hide and most importantly, run from the farmers. You would be fast and weak.\n\nAs the farmer you will have to find the Runner, you will be big and strong but slow, there is a chance of having a quad bike, you must track down the runner and catch or kill them, you could set traps or distractions. The 3 Farmers could either work together to catch the runner, or they could work alone.\n\nThe runner would have to remain quiet and would have to leave clue to where they are, they can hide in houses, sheds, inside a school or in the woods. Their resources would be limited, limited ammo, limited food and water, limited storage, you get the point. Looting houses or shops would be almost essential so you could not spend the whole game hiding. The runner would have to be careful. Footsteps can be heard. Tracks can be followed, and any lights you leave on or doors you leave open can and will give away your position.\n\nThe Farmer(s) would be able to have an update every few minutes of the rough area the runner is in. On the odd chance the Farmer will have a quad bike the runner will be aware of this by the noise and the headlights that would beam in the sky.\n\nIf you were to play this by your self you could be a runner with AI farmers, or the other way round.\nI think the multiplayer is pretty self explanatory, Real people will play the Runner and the Farmers. Proximity chat is optional.\n\nIf you are wondering about the type of landscape I am thinking of you can look at ‘Spittal in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire’ on google earth\n\nThis is my first time so please be harsh, I need constructive criticism\n\nPlease give your view on this idea in the comments👍👍"
l0xcu9,Kaiju Battle Royale,"All players start out as tiny monsters. The more you eat, the more nutrients you have. Once you have enough nutrients, you can evolve into a bigger monster. You are vulnerable to attacks while evolving, but heal greatly once the evolution is complete.\n\nWhat kind of monster you turn into depends on what you ate. If you ate mostly birds, you’ll turn into a bird monster. If you ate lots of lizards and charcoal, you’ll turn into a dragon monster. You can eat anything, from wild animals to other players to fruit to wood to steel. \n\nYou can evolve multiple times, growing larger each time. There is an evolution tree that determine what you can evolve into. For instance, once you’ve turned into a bird monster, you’ll only be able to evolve into different variants of the bird monster. By the end of the game, you should be left be left with all the biggest and strongest players around. Any smaller players that are still around may be able to help take down a bigger player and then feed on them to gain a bunch of nutrients really quickly."
l9oxh0,A Space Age Nubian version of the the movie “Stargate”,"  \nFeel free to use this idea.\n\n  \nIn the movie Stargate, an alien took ancient Egyptians as slaves, and brought them to another planet in a distant galaxy.  In the game that I envision, a wormhole brought people from ancient Nubia to another world billions of light years from Earth.  Once they got there, they built a civilization, and over time, they became a space-faring empire.\n\n  \nThe architecture would look both Nubian and Space Age, similar to the movie “Stargate” (although Nubian architecture and art would look different than Egyptian).  Essentially, you have to manage your empire by colonizing other worlds, gathering resources, dealing with alien civilizations, doing research for tech improvements, and keeping your people happy.  You can be diplomatic with aliens, trade with them, avoid them, or fight wars with them.\n\n  \nYou would start on your home world, which would be very Earth-like.  The next step would be to colonize the solar system.  After 20 game years, you would begin discovering alien civilizations.  Some would be friendly, others would be businesslike, isolationist, or hostile. The decisions that you make would determine your relations with each civilization.  Over time, you would be all over the galaxy.\n\n  \nThere are several ways to win, which would be political, economic, military, and technological:\n\n1.  Establishing a lasting peace throughout the galaxy with your civilization becoming the central figure in galactic politics.\n2. Building up enormous wealth (1 trillion space credits), thus becoming the financial powerhouse of the galaxy.\n3. Conquering the galaxy.\n4. Becoming so technologically advanced that all other civilizations are dependent on information that only you can provide through your Galaxynet Information Superhighway.\n\nYou would lose the game if you are conquered by an alien civilization, or if one of them meets a victory condition before you."

l9o2fb,Space Clash Royale - Clash Royale meets FTL,"Currently started working on a small prototype for this idea, and I wanted to post it here to get some feedback in advance.\n\n**The general idea**\n\nBasically the game's mechanics for the most part resemble Clash Royale (mobile, 1v1 realtime PVP, energy recharges over time, cards, etc); mixed with a simplified version of FTL.\n\nThe major difference is that the combat itself is much more dynamic; having no static towers, and each player controls a single ""mothership"".\n\n**Movement**\n\nThe player can always give an order to move his ship to a specific destination on his half of the board.   \nMovement is relatively slow, and has a X second cooldown between activations.\n\n**Shields**\n\nPlayers have shields that defend the ship's hull, and will recharge if the ship hasn't taken damage in X seconds. Shields take -50% damage from energy weapons &amp; +50% damage from all explosives.\n\nOnce the shields are down, the player receives damage to his hull; once hull integrity reaches 0, the player dies and the other player wins.\n\n**Units**\n\nPlayers can also summon units (smaller ships/squadrons), that will fly towards the enemy mother ship and fight any incoming units on the way.\n\n**Ship upgrades**\n\nUsing a full energy bar, each player can upgrade 1 of 3 parts of the ship, up to 3 times **total combined:**\n\n1. Movement - Movement speed &amp; cooldown is increased by 25%\n2. Shields - Max shields and recharge rate is increased by 20%\n3. Energy - Energy recharge rate is increased by 15%\n\n**Meta game**\n\nPlayers unlock/upgrade abilities and choose their ""deck"" prior entering battles.\n\nPlayers can also unlock/upgrade ship hulls, each ship hull giving a different combination of base stats (movement, shields/hull, energy).\n\n**Wanted feedback**\n\nJust by reading this idea; do you feel it is unique enough to stand out as a game on it's own?  \nDo you like/dislike this idea? Why?  \nDoes this sound like a game you would play?  \nWhat design problems do you think this idea might have?\n\nPlease note, ***I am not*** ***looking for technical/business advice***; just about the **game idea itself**.\n\nThanks!"

It would be a sort of an ""unsimulator"" game where you must fight traffic, find parking spot, buy hot dogs, stop fans fighting, manage family's happiness, etc... There would be a fully explorable stadium and the baseball match would happen in real time so about 3 hours.\n\nThere would be many options like finding an exspensive seat without security finding out, getting player autograph, catching a homerun, breaking into the broadcast booth, getting drunk, starting fights, streaking, etc... You can even abandon your family and find and flirt with others.\n\nEach time you play again the baseball match would play out different and you would get a randomized seat. So in essence a sort of small open world baseball stadium that is fully detailed and is a wacky simulation.\n\nI got the idea because I've always imagined being able to move the instant replay camera in sports games all over the stadium.

l9jovg,Archaeologist Tycoon - A business simulation about archaeological excavation,"There has been a resurgence of the tycoon or management genre recently, and I don't think this has been ever done in video games before. I think a business simulation game based on an archaeological excavation would be a really fun concept to make a game out of.\n\nI got this idea while reading about Howard Carter, who discovered the tomb of King Tutankhamun. How he had no formal education of archaeology, persuaded an aristocrat to fund his venture into tomb excavations, and after years of nothing and right before his employer cut the fund, he accidentally stumbled on a stone that turned out to be the tomb. It's such an interesting story and it is something I wish to experience in a video game format, which is great at creating a sense of exploration and discovery.\n\nHere is the general premise. The player runs their own relic excavation camp, including designing the methods, who to hire, researching, and securing funding. There are various maps that used to be sites of the ancient civilizations, from Egypt, China, Europe, South America. Before digging something, the player has to buy equipment. You need the right equipment and the right people to a specific job. For example, you need a translator to read ancient texts that might give you a clue. \n\nThen you need to decide which location to dig by following the clues, and this takes a lot of time. Rewards are rare and big discoveries are a few. Big archaeological discoveries mean more attention and more funding. There will be times when you dig out nothing, which means you wasted time and money, and this causes the investors to be angry at the player and cut the funding. However, the smaller relics are more frequent and these will help the player to salvage some of the costs.\n\nOnce you find remains of the ancient civilization, for example, a pyramid, you have to send out workers to the site, and this section plays like an isometric tactical game. The player has to be careful of the environment since the haphazardly rushing the excavation means there can be damage to relics. Some rooms may be rigged with traps.\n\nIt also shares some commonalities with grand strategy games where long-term strategy rather than short-term tactics matter more. The game starts at the birth of the archaeological excavation boom of the 19th century and continues to the future. Historical events will shape the gameplay. The player needs to purchase better equipment and figure out new methods constantly. Buy medicine so the workers don't die from diseases or accidents. Wars can interrupt your excavations, damage the relics, and kill your workers. Some governments may not like what you do, and you have to bribe the officials. There will be times when you will go bankrupt, so selling relics to the black market for money is a tempting option, but this means a decrease in reputation thus locals and the press will not be helpful to your excavations, which will damage your business.\n\nThere are a lot of elements that can be gamified here. Frustratingly long gameplay sessions paced by short bursts of excitement."

l9adoy,A Real-Time Strategy game that is secretly an Open World RPG.,"Story: A new continent has been discovered and is in dire need of colonization.\n\nThis continent is our game-world. One singular, huge, open world - that is colonized and conquered by 4 warring factions (Orcs, Hhumans, Elves, Dwarves) over the course of the game - in real time.\n\nHere is the twist: The game starts as a Anno 1404-esque RTS game. You build a woodcutter, a fisher, marketplace, etc. But that typical strategy game / isometric perspective is actually a POV camera.You are literally a god, looking down on the people you command. And the people below see you as this kind of magical light in the sky.Suddenly, you get backstabbed by another god and thrown down into the mortal world. You find yourself in the middle of the town you have been building until now - you look up and see the strange light in the sky that used to be you but is now someone else.You were replaced and that strange god just keeps on doing what you were doing before, as if nothing happened. Now he is telling everyone where to go, what to build, etc.Luckily, you find yourself un-influenced by this new god's commands and keep your free will.\n\nOver the course of the game's story you re-gain your godlike powers (allthough the game never goes back to being a RTS), you can cut NPC's ties to their god and make them follow/obey you isntead.  \n**The game is basically Skyrim - in an open world in which 4 AIs / Gods fight and build and trade in real time and try to conquer the continet.**  \nOver the course of the game a trading system is established in which you can participate - reminiscent of the one in the X-Series. (Terran Conflict, etc.) You can build your own towns and settlements, if you want. You can play as a solo adventurer or make literal armies follow you.You can conquer by strenghts, trade or politics. -- But at it's core, all of **this is a 1st person RPG Game.**"

l96l05,17th up to/or 19th century Firearms FPS,"I would love to see an fps in a pre-automatic time period. It doesn't need glorious graphics or a beautiful story. I just want a randomized character with random stats that can affect how effective I am at everything from fighting to running, moderately large maps with ""soft"" borders, and variable quality weapons to fight with.\n\nFor the character, I think that they should have five stats: strength, agility, endurance, melee combat, and ranged combat. Strength affects how quickly they accelerate their melee weapon and how fast they can run, agility affects how smoothly they move themselves and their weapon and reduces how likely they are to trip, endurance affects how long they can run and how much they can swing their weapon, melee combat boosts both their melee weapon speed, and ranged combat affects how steady they are with their gun and how fast they can reload. All of these should have either a random granular value or several tiers that each have their own values.\n\nThe maps should include woodlands, farms, trenches, villages, etc., as a ""battlefield"" isn't just a flat, open plain used for combat, it can be wherever, whenever, however. I also don't want bodies to despawn. They should remain on the field until the end of the game and be a constant hazard to the players, as they might trip over them and their weapons. The borders of the map should give you a warning, but not kill you based on time, rather distance from the boundaries of the map. These areas should be really disadvantageous to be in. I think three or four maps or map archetypes would be great: city, fort, farm, and wilderness, or any combination thereof. The more militarized, the more military equipment (like artillery and mantlets) should be available for the players to utilize on the map.\n\nFurther adding to the topic of weapons, the player should choose absolutely nothing. They should get a pop-up message when they spawn of the stats of their character, armor, and weapons, but besides that they get no other ui besides the number of bullets they have for their weapons. They should get a random large weapon and two random small weapons. The long weapon could be a pike, shotgun, blunderbuss, rifle, musketoon, whatever type of weapon is proper for the period chosen. The small weapons could be a hatchet, hammer, maul, pistol... again, whatever is appropriate. If they land with two small melee weapons or small firearms, they only get one of the two. They should also start with a random amount of ammo, which can even be nothing, to begin with, but they can pick up ammo of the specific type that their weapon uses from dead bodies, which might take a few seconds to search.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, there should be rather standard firearms combat- movement should affect aim sway, you should be able to steady your aim somehow, can prop your gun up, etc. I'm not too concerned about that because that is a well-beaten path, though there are some changes I would make and concerns I have. Rather, what I am worried most about is the melee combat. If you approach somebody with a melee weapon out, you should have a soft lock-on with them. Your aim should be slightly slowed down in this area. Your weapon should come out of a relaxed stance and into a combat stance. You should be able to move your weapon into different positions by moving your view around a little bit. For thrusting weapons, you should be able to make a lunge by using the regular fire button and then move towards your opponent. With swinging weapons, you should simply change the position your weapon is in to make a strike in the direction of the change of position. The same stabbing method would apply to weapons like sabers and cutlasses. Parries would be made in the same method as cuts or strikes. Firearms of this period should take a while to reload. IIRC, in many periods, a person could shoot two or three times per minute. I would want the game to hold true to that. It would make bayonets and melee weapons totally necessary.\n\nOptional additions: destructible terrain, weapon durability, mounts, boats, fortresses, artillery, etc.\n\nTL;DR: I am disorganized and don't know how to code, but I want a game that has early-firearms warfare. (I might learn to code just to do this myself)"

So thank you this is my first post!\n\n\nI don't know what the story could be, but basically my idea is that you start off with a basic story mirroring early Atari/NES days and or a or a primitive character from the Atari graphics era, and slowly throughout the game, you morph into the 8-bit era, 16-bit era, transition into early 32-bit 3D, followed by PS2/XBox graphics, moving into XB360 graphics and ultimately PS5/XBSX, etc.\n\n\nI've thought about it and if there's already a game like this I'd love to know. There's an Oculus game kind of like this but it's not all gens in one game. \n\n\nI think it'd have to obviously be early early Atari 2D at the start (maybe even earlier?) but at the end of the game, the transition, the characters, the story, all of it, we'll get to see it all ultimately transition into an open world, (a la Red Dead 2 graphics) graphically stunning game where the story comes to an end, possibly with a 'to be continued' type ending pointing to the idea that visually and hypothetically, videogames will continue to expand into new dimensions, new types of games, new ideas and the characters will continue on.\n\nAs for the KIND of game. It would obviously need to start off as platforming but it could blend and mix as the story/game progresses."
l95v9m,"A card/board game I had about a year back, needs fleshing out.","Card/board game idea: a mix of Clue and Are You A Werewolf. Played like if the gang from Scooby-Doo was in The Shining.\n\nConcept: A murder(s) happen at a remote resort only accessible by boat/helicopter/snow bus and weather has delayed the arrival of the authorities. The killer has 48-72 hours to escape/dispose of the evidence, and the authority figure has that time to catch the killer and preserve the crime scene.\n\nPlayers are given cards at random that define their roles. Most will be innocent, while one (or two on special occasions) is a murderer/maniac/serial killer/etc., and another will be a detective/cop/security guard/etc.\n\nInnocents all get generic decks of action cards, while killers get special sabotage decks, and the authorities receive counter measure decks.\n\nCertain cards are played during your turns (so killers and authority have generic cards as well so both can maintain a cover) and a separate deck played at the end of a round.\n\nThe board is a simplified layout of the resort, with defining search times for each area. The border of the board is the countdown for when the ragtag investigation has to end and the actual authorities take over.\n\nThe game starts with the handing out of the roll cards, then everyone leaves the room (or cover their eyes), then one by one each player returns to the board to claim their personal deck. Each innocent has to do something and leave evidence/alibis that they were in a specific area of the map. The killer takes this time to hide their evidence/body in different locations across the resort.\n\nAlibis are character cards that can only be placed in a selection of places, and they confirm whether a player is innocent, but if a killer gets to them first no proof can be gathered.\n\nInvestigating any area takes the amount of time determined by the ""cost"" on the board, but if the killer is part of the group, they can foil your search and make them fail and/or take longer. An investigation works by one or more players declaring a search, then they put their investigation bonus cards (or sabotage cards in the case of any killer) and it fails or succeeds depending on total bonuses, so it's either progress with evidence or a waste of time.\n\nEvidence is collected, and eventually a vote must be made, which also takes time.\n\nThe innocent win if they detain the killer, and it's pretty obvious how the killer wins. Unless certain killers have special requirements between rounds. Like a serial killer that has to kill more people or has to leave a calling card. Or a cannibal who can only eat people so they keep bits of their kills hidden as leftovers for later, but the pieces can be found as evidence."

So you go through the game dumping files on forums and speaking with your friends via chat your main objectives for the first half are to find files and game history and dump it onto the forums you frequent with you chatting with your friends about your discoveries slowly though throughout the course of the game you find sprites that don't fit with the game strange hidden messages from seemingly the developers and your friends the more involved they get with this find strange people following them and weird messages from people you don't know are becoming more rampant. I think the game should be simple enough so the players can navigate it and find things to post about you start each day with a set amount of objectives like find out if this is real or dump sprite sheet like that. And slowly your friends get picked off by a group of mysterious people that you can save them from.\n\nEndings:\n\nI'm thinking there should be multiple endings like The good Ending you save all your friends from the mysterious people find out the secret of the game and dump most of the files you wanted to. Bad ending Most or all your friends die and you don't know the full secret.

When the hero tells you an action, you are then able to control how you approach said task.\n\nSay the hero wants you to attack, you can choose what direction to attack from, and how strong the attack is. (Certain attacks may provide more options.)\n\nWhen the hero is not present and/or is unconscious during battle, you then have full control of your actions. Intentionally bringing harm to the hero, in order to have more control, may be a smart strategy, although I doubt the hero would appreciate it very much.\n\nIf you die at any point, you then play as a different party member. If the the hero dies, game over. If everyone is unconscious, game over.\n\nIf all party members die aside from the hero, you'd have to watch and hope they pull through to victory. Afterward, you'd play as another party member who's about to meet the hero.\n\nThis whole concept seems a bit confusing, but hopefully I described it well enough. What do you all think?"

l8u7an,Need some ideas,"Hey everyone!  \nI'm a computer science student, in my last year, and for the final exam i chose to create a small game.  \nOriginally, i had in mind a game similar to Enter the Gungeon, but on a smaller scale. But as i spoke with my coordinating teacher we ended with changing the concept to something related to ""Virtual Shopping"", based around some kind of battle for resources (not my ideea).\n\nSo now i'm kinda stuck with this theme and i have no ideas on what to do.  \nThe game will be 2.5 D and of a small scale.  \nPlease help me with some suggestions or similar games with my theme where i can get some inspiration.  \n\*Sorry for any spelling errors"
l8sxvp,A survival horror game in Jurassic park.,"Something similar to alien isolation, but in Jurassic park. There are already so many different dinosaurs which would make excellent enemies. I also feel like the book canon would be much better for a horror game, since it is much scarier.\n\n* Raptors could behave similarly to the alien, stalking you. The book version is also completely psychotic.\n* T-rex can only see you if you move, so if you stay still, it will ignore you. The book version is also very intelligent and has a long tongue.\n* Dilophasaurus can spit at you. Maybe make it so it behaves like it does in the movie, all cute and innocent until it suddenly strikes you. The book version is also much larger.\n* Compies are weak, but they can swarm you. The book version is also venomous.\n* Carnotaurus can change colors like a chameleon."

l8ottp,Space Battle Royale,"A large space BR that can be played solo or with up to 6 people on a team. First map setting could be a large planet with lots of moons and asteroids orbiting it and a large debris field of capital ships lost in a battle. You wouldn't be able to land on the planet, but the moons, asteroids and ships are all accessible.\n\nEveryone starts off in their escape pods on a large capital ship that is heavily damaged and they deploy whenever they want before the capital ship makes it to the edge of the map. You can steer your escape pod for a finite amount of time and the quicker you land somewhere the better. Players can find weapons, armor, and equipment scattered throughout the map on outposts on the moons or in destroyed large ships. Players will have EVA suits and can use their propulsion packs to get around in space, but finding fighter ships is extremely crucial to winning the match. Fighter ships can vary from being small 1 person fliers to 6 person cruisers that need team cooperation to operate (I.E. someone piloting, 2-3 running the guns, 1 fixing various parts of the ship, 1 using the command console to navigate and use special abilities like navigation jamming/missiles/ shields/ etc. Teams have to loot for supplies/ammo/fuel/etc for their ships. If someone dies and you get to their body, you can transport them to an aid station that could be on a moon or a space station and revive them once per match.\n\nI haven't figured out what the blue or closing circle would be.. thoughts were initially like a solar storm or maybe a space fleet closing in...\n\nFeel free to add all your ideas. This is just a game idea off the top of my head. It would be cool to see any kind of Space BR that requires teamwork to fly a ship."
l8obo0,Hivemind,"The Concept for this Idea is full throttle Teamwork while under pressure... The pressure of Bullets Whizzing by, this game is a First person Action platformer you have a Team consisted of 2-6 players in which each player plays as a Humanoid Robot, Customized to their liking in the Menu, when the game starts the team of 2-6 has to get through a level chock fully of Obstacles, Puzzles and Heavily armed enemies, The catch? if one player dies the Whole team dies The Team of Machines has a Variety of Classes and Abilities, Being The Engineer, The Brute, The Specter and The Joker each individual Class plays a Role in each level though some Obstacles change depending on the player count, Some Obstacles such as a Shoddy brick wall will need a Good punch, Anyone can Break these but they need way more punches than of a Brute as the Brute can Break down walls with a single punch and push Objects faster, Though they are slower and have more health In some Areas You can Distract Enemies as a Joker by Placing down Holograms of yourself that Run in the Direction of the Enemies shooting at you, However like with the brute Anyone can Distract an Enemy in many ways such as throwing small items, whistling and Simply grabbing their attention by running out The Specter However is for purely Convenience as they can Float around the area while invisible to Mark enemy locations and the Locations of Powerups to support your team, The Engineer however is The medic of this game, Having a Needle gun to heal your teammates from afar or A palm-based Healing Device that heals far more than the Needle gun but trades off that you need to be very close.\n\nTLDR: A Puzzle game that heavily utilizes Teamwork but everyone can do anything but using Specialized characters do these things faster"
l8lahs,"A game with branching storylines but all the choices are ""hidden"".",So usually you make choices in games and while it's not always clear what the consequences are you always are aware when making a choice through dialogue options.   \n\n\nI had an idea where there is a game where all the choices are hidden inside completely mundane and subconscious things so you never know when something could be important.   \n\n\nFor example a cutscene starts and depending on what weapon you have equipped at that point the cutscene could play out completely different and have huge consequences. Or if you do a mission wearing certain clothes it leads to different outcomes or during certain weather.   \n\n\nIt would be cool to always be surprised by the consequences of your subconscious choices and would make it unpredictable yet at the same time more personal and individual.

l8gc5g,Shock trooper,"I am an avid writer but am absolutely horrible at implementing ideas and wanted to share this one with the good people of Reddit to see if anyone wants to make this a reality or just discuss it. Shock trooper is a game about a soldier sent out in the middle of nowhere in the fictional country of Cen a forest filled war-torn place he was supposed to be heading back to a camp but his helicopter crashes and is now stuck with the only weapon left being his heavy-duty tazer gun that can shoot multiple times and does a fair amount of damage but has a pretty abysmal battery life I also think it should be solar charged so it can slowly refill energy. Now that he is stuck here he thinks his only worries are enemy soldiers but soon finds that there is some sort of strange mutant creatures living in the forest that are very strong but have one fatal weakness you guessed it electricity you gain a lot of weapons throughout the game but your tazer is your workhorse that stuns regular enemies but does massive damage against the mutants slowly you gain a lot of gear and try and figure out why these mutants are here but when you are getting close to finding some clues you are attacked by a large creature dubbed The Stalker by the natives I'm thinking this is like a terminator thing with the monster coming at you, again and again, you slowly witling it down until its final form as the boss kinda like how resident evils bosses work. The final fight of the game has you in a helicopter fighting The Stalker with your Gatling guns with a big meter on top charging up your hellfire missle you have to survive it long enough to shoot it. This is kinda like predator combined with Resident Evil I know but I really like this idea and have a lot more but this is just one I think of every time I listen to specific music for some reason"

l8esuv,Multi-character RPG,"What if there was a game in which you could play as three or so different characters who all follow the same story with minor deviation. Seems pretty generic right? But what if this was done in a way that actually sustains main characters with MASSIVE personality differences which, while not majorly effecting the general plot, grants a totally different set of dialogue.\n\nFor example, let’s say we have three characters: Lewis, Mary, and Alex. The plot centers around a galactic rebellion.\n\nLewis could join the rebels because he wants to fight against evil. Mary could join because she wants to save a loved one from imprisonment. Alex joins because he has been betrayed by the empire and seeks morally-neutral justice.\n\nAt some point, these characters would crash land on a planet. The survivors of the crash are then kidnapped by bandits and it’s up to the player to get them back.\nLewis would get knocked out underneath some rubble and would therefore be missed, commenting about how he needs to save the others. Mary would hide and spend the night by the ship until she realizes that she needs the others to have a chance at survival/escape. Alex would be left behind, having been seemingly mortally wounded, but pulls though and immediately recognizes he needs the others (knowing that getting them back may involve disposing of some lawless scum).\n\nThe downside to this idea is that you have to come up with an extremely fitting story, one that consistently drives these diverse characters all in the same direction. I think it would be really cool though if someone could pull it off successfully."
l8con0,An online multiplayer stealth game,"I've had an idea for a game called SpyGuard and I'd like to hear your guys opinions on it. There are two teams: 3 Spys and 7 Guards. Both teams have different abilities and objectives. Guards must kill all the Spys before they complete all their tasks or can just wait out the time to win. Spys are assigned special tasks such as stealing or breaking something. Some will even require you to stay in a certain area for a set amount of time or maybe even knock out a guard and use their fingerprint on a scanner to open a door. Guards are given a variety of tools such as guns and explosives to eliminate the Spys. Spys are given many abilities such as going invisible, transforming into props, messing with electronics and much more to keep guards of their tracks. Messing with electronics could do things such as set off alarms in other places to trick guards or slow the power making all Guard Tech weaker or slower. Each Spy is given 3 lives and Guards are given unlimited lives. If you're a Spy you can easily take out guards if you use your sneaky abilities to get upto a guard and take them down. If you are real sneaky you can even pickpocket guards. Once all Spy tasks are completed a warning will be sent out to all Guards that the Spys are escaping. During this time the Spys must run to the exit and the Guards have to kill them before they get out. And before you ask, no this is not inspired by Among Us. I thought of this before that game even existed. Sorry for the huge word chunk."
l899a8,Sonic Riders 4 Ever,"A new Sonic Riders game where you play through the story as your custom character (Like forces except you play as your character the whole story) There would be an open over world where you can ride around practicing tricks. It would also be filled with NPC's that will give you missions and side quests. Completing side quests would reward you with rings, Avatar Parts and Gear Parts. Gear parts can be applied to your Extreme Gear to give it stat boosts and sometimes even new passive abilities. The game would only have 6 different extreme gear, one for each type (Board, Air Ride, Skate, Bike, Wheel and Yacht) I did this since the players can already change the abilities and appearance of their gear with Gear Parts. I would add the Air System from the first game because it was such a unique mechanic, it would work exactly like it did in the first game. Also Im not really a fan of the Gravity Drift from the 2nd game. I know alot of people like it but I really just prefer the classic drift so I'd add that. Lastly NO KINECT LIKE SONIC FREE RIDERS THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON THAT GAME MESSED UP."

I'd like the game to be easy to learn, hard to master. Run, jump, shoot, swing weapon/shield, alt-attack and switch equipment forward/back for each hand and that's it. There will probably be weapon and stat upgrades between levels but I don't want to interrupt the flow of levels with inventory management, levelups etc and there will only be 3 weapons and 3 shields total so all equipment is only ever 1 click away.\n\nGraphically it'll be pretty low poly to make things easier to develop, probably somewhere between PS1 and PS2. \n\nSetting, story, gameplay mechanics, types of blade, gun, shield etc haven't been decided yet. Any ideas?"

l7p8q8,"MMORPG where instead leveling stats, you change physic size","Very old idea of mine that came from my early vanilla WoW days - when gankers made me hated starting out - what if the high level players can't revisit low level areas?\n\nFrom there came the idea of an MMORPG where you grow in size as you 'level' up, where you're able to reach places you couldn't when small, but also unable to get into smaller places, and small players could even climb on you to gain access to places that you can't get into but they can't reach.\n\nThere's a natural element of larger players being 'tanks', but with different sizes come the opportunity of tanks at different sizes - I think if the size mechanic is adapted to have varieties, it could be quite cool.\n\nIn my own concept of this game, the world would be set on tectonic plates that move so that the world changes over time, but that concept can be a game concept in itself."

l6rv8x,multiplayer townbuilding survival,"I was thinking of a game where you could be a nomad in an ever expanding map of a variety of terrains (ideally it should expand base on the number of players in a server and how far you explore) where you could settle land and start you're own town. A little place just for you, or develop a society with others. With the ability to build a town hall that would unlock a form of leadership, with laws taxes or whatever policies you could enact based on your population and government type.(such as if you develop feudalism or stick with a voted upon leader. That kinda thing) possibly you could make guilds, houses, or even entire kingdoms and nations. Of course, you could add a threat to the game that would cause enough people to band together such as violence between players, but I find that perhaps struggles such as managing food, clothing, trading, gathering luxury resources, building materials, seasons changing, wild animals, bandits?, and others possibly, may cause people to actually work together. I've just grown tired of seeing games that are all about fighting each other, when i thing if people banded together they could create beautiful towns and kingdoms that would stand to show what we are capable of. please add on and criticize this because I want it to be hammered out into something someone would make."

l6m17b,A game that uses popularity as a tangible weapon.,A game that has two modes. One where you have to try and be as popular as possible online and another where the popularity can be used as a weapon and the more popular you become the bigger your weapon will be and the more powerful it will be. I think this could be both a deep and surface level game. The deep one maybe starting off with you and a couple of your friends having to try and survive with tiny daggers but a big well known celebrity comes along and makes you popular. But that leads to internal conflict and many problems arise from the fact that you are now popular.\n\nOr it could be a simple game like pewdiepie simulator except with some fighting instead of decorations.
l6iuqs,A Godzilla/Kaiju inspired action adventure RPG,"Kaiju games are something I’ve always enjoyed(Even the bad ones) however I feel that there is, and can be more to a giant monster game then an arena fighter.\n\nThere are a few games who’s individual mechanics are something I can see made into a solid experience if meshed together effectively. Games such as Prototype, War of the Monsters, Maneater, Spore, and even Evolve to an extent influenced a lot of these vague ideas I’ve got.\n\nSo imagine a Kaiju game in which there isn’t a specific region or area, but something rather global. Immense cities in different countries, numerous islands, hollow earth, etc. Character creation could be centered around picking a silhouette and adding characteristics to really customize your own kaiju. You could give them a base trait that not only dictates where you start the game, but how you traverse as well. A kaju who gets around through burrowing, one that gets around through flight, and like most Kaiju, one that gets around by swimming through the ocean.\n\nAs you survive, explore, and combat both man and other Kaiju, you not only grow in size or evolve characteristics, but you also gain more abilities. Builds wouldn’t be dictated by stat numbers and percentages, but rather evolutionary traits and powers, size, mobility, and reputation.\n\nYou’d start the game off as a smaller Kaiju. You can still be dangerous, but you can also be easily defeated in the right situation. You have a few options to evolve and grow your character: You can decide that you would want to evolve by taking energy directly from cities.(Think “Godzilla is approaching the generator”) but fully expanded upon with layers of depth. As you destroy a city and evolve by taking in their energy(Power plants, factories, radiation) you also gain a threat level. Not GTA stars that come and go, but a actual threat level that dictates how this city, or cities at large respond to you. Based on your specific Kaiju build, after enough time these areas find ways to combat you, exploiting your weaknesses, learning your patterns, developing weapons to combat your strengths, ability to track/anticipate you, etc. The more you visit a city(As each city will be more prominent in one resource over another) you not only get more of that resource, but it becomes increasingly hard, and that cities technology developes faster. You can think of this as the villain route.\n\nAnother avenue would be finding and killing other Kaiju, you could even do so in a way that protects cities or humanity at large. This could be the hero route. As you fight and kill other destructive Kaiju, you’re able to have an array of evolutionary traits and abilities at your disposal. However, this makes you a direct target to other Kaiju, and even boss-like monsters who may track you down for all the precious power you possess.\n\nYou could even manage some form of neutral stance. Killing kaiju who target humanity, and taking out cities/military that become too powerful. I like the idea that the world functions even outside of you, and other Kaiju roam and effect the world just as you can. You could for instance; come across a devastated area, or a giant corpse in which a specific Kaiju has caused. By interacting with these enough you can “Monster Hunter” style track down this Kaiju and you won’t know who they are or what they possess until you meet them.\n\nCities that have faced enough Kaiju and collateral damage(Gaining maximum defense/offense) could develop mechs more powerful then even some of the toughest Kaiju. A city at this level will have knowledge, preparations, a diverse and advanced military, traps, and a multitude of powerful mechs they can use all at will on a big enough threat.\n\nYou could also have legendary Kaiju, ultra bosses that will take both a lot of skill, knowledge, and a evolved enough build just to stand a chance against. Killing these could further your build possibilities. Advanced enough Kaiju can even call in others that have decide to join them to avoid death themselves.\n\nYou could have allies, arch enemies, and even a Souls-like mechanic where you invade someone else’s world to either kill, or help them(whether that be destroying, hunting Kaiju, or defending an area).\n\nAnyhow, that’s really where my thoughts kind of end."
l6fk1m,Need Ideas for a Coop Puzzle-Platformer game,"So, I'm planning to make a coop puzzle game about two witch sisters, but I just can't find a core mechanic for this game. Do you guys have any idea about it?"
l6e02e,"It’s not a bug, it’s a game","Just found out about this sub, may as well start posting some ideas that I'm too lazy to work on:\n\nTLDR: A game where glitches are features\n\nCore:\n\n* Player gets spawned in random places and starts falling forever ('map' is mostly blue hell)\n* NPCs are always frozen in place\n* Interaction buttons are unclickable\n* Most walls/ground is non solid\n* The game crashes unless there’s a txt file in the root folder of the game that tells it not to crash which has to be named with the exact unix timestamp when the game was installed but people who play the game should be very secretive about this and the crash should contain really vague information about what’s happening\n* Goal of the game is to be able to ""play"" for 45? minutes straight without asking for a refund\n\nBonus features:\n\n* Graphics get randomly glitched (i.e 3d meshes get their vertex position messed up)\n* Once an audio clip plays it will loop until you restart the game, it’ll probably snowball pretty quickly if there are a lot of things that make sounds\n* MISS?NG\_TEXT\_STR?N?\n* Z-fighting mandatory\n* Savegames have a 90% chance of being corrupted\n* Things start spinning for no apparent reason\n* Things start flying because why not?\n* Wrong animation plays\n* LOD models only load whenever the player is far from them\n* You need to play the game to access the main menu (personal favorite)\n* Puzzles that can only be solved with keys for previous puzzles\n* Grunion fish"

l6cxgu,A battle royale game that is candy themed,"I have an idea for a game. A battle royale game that centered around candies. I would love to hear some feedback and/or some new ideas. \n\nA link to the docs page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r3pKaa5q7KzFzTdu7uJkm00molp9lzGk-17l45AXlEk/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nI already posted this post in a few subreddits, so don't be surprised to find it again somewhere else."
l6cx9k,Stronghold WW1 clone,"There is plenty of WW2 RTS games, but battlefield-level (as opposed to grand strategies) strategy games really struggle to depict WW1 trench warfare, because trench warfare was so incredibly static and reliant on artillery.\n\nThen I thought - wait a second! Medieval sieges were also very static and reliant on artillery!\n\nSo here's the idea, WW1 reskin of the classic games Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader (with some elements from Dawn of War). Instead of building walls, you build trenches around your base. Instead of villagers, you have conscripts, who are sent to your base depending not on happiness, but on your military victories, as in amount of Strategic Points (which are key areas strewn around the map) that you control. Unlike Stronghold, you can actually select, control and move Conscripts and use them in combat, though they are the weakest units. Economy is simplifed and is based around Strategic Points giving you Requisition, like in the Dawn of War series - maybe with extra resources of Food (acquired by looting Farms that you find on the map), Fuel and Ammo.  Food would be the most detailed, with different kinds of food in rations providing a morale boost just like in Stronghold. You can use Requisition to dig trenches (with the same click-and-drag interface  from Stronghold), promote conscripts to specialists (infantry, cavalry, tank crews, engineers, field medics, stormtroopers, snipers), or build machines, cannons and tanks - and make structures, like Machine Garage, Artillery Tent, Radio Tower that lets you call in airtstrikes, or Field Hospital. Basically, Requisition replaces money.\n\nInstead of lobbing dead cows over walls that splatter into cloud of plague, your artillery lobs mustard gas shells into the trenches. Instead of Assassins climbing the walls as seen in Crusader, Stormtroopers can climb trench walls. Instead of Lord being the key unit that needs to be killed to win the game, each side has a General. Instead of villager happiness there's Morale, still based on entertainment and food rations, that decides how quick your troops will run away when overpowered (there's a similar mechanic in an old game American Conquest, where under fire your troops will lose faith, and run away not allowing you to control them for a while).\n\nSimilarly to Stronghold and Crusader, there'd be a freeform skirmish mode against AI or in multiplayer, but also a Historical Battle mode that well, recreates historical battles from WW1 (for example, Attack of the Dead Men would be played as Russians, and your side would start already covered in gas clouds, constantly damaging your units). Also a historical campaign that tells the whole story of the war, one for Entente and one for Central Powers."
l6bnaz,Any comedic dialogue heavy game like Conker,"I just want a comedic game with a ton of witty dialogue and absurd scenarios like Conker’s Bad Fur Day or Armed &amp; Dangerous. This can range from shooters, platformers, adventure games, and I guess technically point and click."
l69nx2,A game about being all the parts of the crew of an AC-130 on a mission,"Imagine a game similar to the Star Trek Bridge Crew.\n\nYou and 5 teammates play the mission crew of an AC-130 on a mission in enemy territory.\n\nSlots to play:\n\n**Pilot:**   \nJob - Flies the plane. Must alert navigator of potential issues and maintain level flight for operational efficiency. Must also follow route and maintain time-table of mission. Must also stay alert of potential firing onto the aircraft and deploy flares when necessary.\n\nToo steep of a roll angle, lose altitude due to lack of lift. Too shallow, guns are not able to go low enough to fire on the targets.  \nKeep an eye of where you are. Weather can be a factor. Clouds will block the camera views. Low cloud ceilings will require lower altitude. Meaning, you will need to make sure you are going slow enough that the target isn't immediately out of range. \n\nPilot must monitor various systems. Fuel levels, ability to operate aircraft. Switch fuel tanks as they empty, adjust speed and power as weight is diminished during the length of the mission, and other factors.\n\nCockpit has a view of the local area, WITHOUT AIRSPACE BOUNDARIES. Navigator must mark points\n\nFiring of aircraft guns shakes aircraft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overlord:**   \nIs Commander's video view. Satellite view, straight down view. NOT BLOCKED BY CLOUDS. Has information of mission objectives. Information of target buildings, No-Fire structures, and other important information of mission directive.\n\nJob - Give information to AC-130 Gunners, Camera Operator, and Navigator; specifically camera operator. Use landmarks in the area to help give information and frames of reference through voice chat.\n\nView is of Operational area boundaries on screen 1, mission directives on screen 2. Mission directives have timestamps and desired flight path for mission effectiveness. Operational Area can be zoomed in, has a day &amp; night satellite view reference images. \n\nHas a video feed of the operation, on a 5 second delay. Switching between still images &amp; satellite video feed takes 1 second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Camera Operator:**  \nIs a camera operator within the aircraft. Has a view from the aircraft. View is distorted by angle of aircraft over the area. Large buildings will block view behind it if angle is not good. Will need direction from Overlord. Camera operator takes information and frame of references from Overlord and marks it on the map. These marks are seen by Gunners ONLY.\n\nView of Camera Operators is of the entire area from the angle of the aircraft. WIDER than the fire area of the gunner. \n\nCamera Operator can place 3 way-points at a time. Can clear them all, automatically clear themselves.\[Place 1,2,3...4{1 disappears}, 5{2 disappears}, etc..\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gunner - 1:**  \nOperates 1, 25mm &amp;  the 105mm guns. Guns use have cameras from the perspective of the end of the barrel of the gun. View is zoomed in at a fixed level, cannot be adjusted. Takes directive from the Camera Operator and Overlord. The maximum range of the camera is the maximum usable area of the weapon. Switching between weapons takes 0.5 seconds.\n\nView uses cross-hair in center of the camera to show point of impact.  \nGunner has own voice line ONLY THEY HEAR giving information on when the gun is loaded. No other player hears this voice line.  \nGun can jam. 3% chance after each shot to jam. Chance of jamming is independent across guns, potential to jam does NOT compound. If gun jams, gun is not available for 20 secs.\n\nGun DOES NOT have an indicator of how far to lead the shot. Leading of shots determined by range\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gunner - 2:**\n\nOperates 1, 25mm &amp; the 45mm gun. Gun uses a camera from the perspective of the end of the barrel of the gun.

Leading of shot determined by range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Navigator:**\n\nSends information from Overlord to Pilot. If the Pilot turns too early and the gunners complain about the targets now being out of range, the Navigator relays the message to the Pilot.\n\nNavigator uses the same camera feed as the Camera Operator.   \nNavigator can hear the audio from Overlord, Camera Operator, and Gunners, **BUT CANNOT TALK TO ALL OF THEM!** Navigator can **ONLY** talk to the Pilot and Camera Operator.\n\nNavigator can see the ""cone-of-vision"" of the guns. Cone of vision is based on angle of the plane  \nNavigator can give marks on the map that **ONLY** the Camera Operator and Pilot can see.\n\nNavigator has a view of entire local geographical area (LGA). Can place way-points in front of the plane for the pilot to fly towards. ONLY 1 WAY-POINT AT A TIME.  \nLGA View is different from Camera Operator view. View looks like a radar scope for Air Traffic Control. Can see boundaries of operating area (area delegated for operation of mission directives, blocked out by Air Traffic Control. Leaving Area is VERY BAD.)  \nPilot CANNOT see the boundary of the flight area. They just see what is around them.\n\nNavigator has a timeline of the operations. Keynote points of the operation and specific timestamps of when they should be done and where the plane should be at that specific time. Overlord has specific information on the operation. (Overlord: ""The firing area needs to be facing East to west due to the contour of the mountain we are flying over. We need to follow the time-table."" Navigator: ""Understood. Pilot, decrease speed and take as wide of an angle as you can. I'll mark the edge of the Airspace."")\n\n=================\n\nCOMM CHANNELS\n\nFlight Operations- Pilot, Navigator\n\nMission Implementation- Overlord, Camera Operator, Gunner -1, Gunner -2, Navigator\[Listen Only\]\n\nCamera Direction - Camera Operator, Navigator\n\nFire Team 1- Gunner -1, Loader 1\[Automated voice line\]\n\nFire Team 2- Gunner -2, Loader 2\[Automated voice line\]  \n\--------------------------------------\n\nVIDEO CHANNELS\n\nOutside world - Pilot\[See Only, cockpit view\], Navigator\[Place Way-points, show up on Cockpit Area View of Pilot\]\n\nSatellite View - Overlord\n\nPlane Camera View - Camera Operator\[Controller\], Navigator\[Video Feed Only\]\n\n25mm #1 - Gunner -1\n\n105mm - Gunner -1\n\n25mm #2- Gunner -2\n\n45mm - Gunner -2\n\nLocal Geographical Area and Airspace - Navigator\n\n=========================\n\nFollowing a mission, a grade is given to the crew on how they did on the mission.

l68yaz,First Person Platformer,"I was thinking of a game idea recently. I've been trying to come up with an idea that's simple and possible for me to create. I am good with 3D art and programming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Basic Concept**\n\nThe game is a first-person perspective and a 3D Game. The player can run, jump, dash, crouch, slide, and teleport. \n\nThe dash and the teleport will make it unique. The teleport mechanic will act like a traditional grenade throw ( where you throw a ball in an arc). The ball will stick to the floor and the player can press a button to teleport to the location. \n\nNot sure about the environment or story yet, but I wanted to share the basic idea of it. \n\nLet me know what you think!"

l5hcxo,How can I make customer interaction with player in simulator game better,"Hello, I'm making store simulator game like you are manage your own store(supermarket/grocery) etc. Similar example is king of retail.\n There are two ways I think I can go with customer interaction something like small dialogue tree where player try to convince customer to buy product, giving them discount and ultimately making decision based on how happy customer is with your negotiations.\nOr mini game now I kinda hate it but some old games used this. Can you give me some ideas how can I improve it further"
l59ol9,Realtime deckbuilder rpg / rougelike,"so the core concept is simple, instead of having skills - have 4~ keys that each will play a card at some position.\nyou get cards from killing monsters &amp; bosses, completing quests or directly buying them.\n\ncards can be anything from casting a fireball at nearby enemy to summoning a companion and buffing it.\n\nif you want some extra cool builds also add equipment that passively improves the cards with stats (like spell damage in hearthstone) and passive effects (like every 3rd card casted is cast twice)\n\nhavent thought much about how cards are drawn but I think having a timer for next card to draw with ability to reduce it.\nand a slay the spire kind of deck reset"
l591k5,Historically accurate games,"So, an idea popped into my head that I think could be pretty good if handled well. It revolves around making a game or games that are historically accurate to their time period, where you play the events of an actual person's life, whether they served in a war, or maybe were just an interesting figure with an odd life story. Unfortunately, I can see that the one main drawback of this would be making the game fun, enjoyable, and engaging for the player, while still remaining accurate to the events. So, I think a project like this will remain a dream for now.  Also, even if I did try and make something like this, I have zero game making knowledge, so it wouldn't work out."
l58xh9,Malware simulator,"Basically, you know there's plague Inc and bio Inc, well here's another idea; it doesn't have a name yet but I've been calling it Malware Inc\n\nThe premise is simple, pick a type of malware, use your money to help it adapt and grow and complete a certain amount of tasks,\n\nI can imagine the basic types, Worms, Viruses, Spyware, Trojan and ransomware special types could be something like a rogue AI\n\nTo win the game you must complete items on a checklist, The way the game progresses would be based on the difficulty, Casual would have only 3 items required off the checklist, normal W would be 5, brutal would be 8 and mega brutal would be the entire checklist\n\nThere would be stats including spread likelihood, noise and destructive potential,\nSpread likelihood is self-explanatory, how well it can spread, noise is how likely it is for an antivirus to notice it, it would behave very much like corruption in rebel Inc, destructive potential consists of chance of destroying computers and stealing information \n\nThere might be alternatives based on the origin for instance it could be a hacktivist weapon or digital warfare or just malicious intent.\n\nI'd make this game myself but, I'm a little busy with another ambitious game project. Anyways I wanted to throw this out into the internet before I forget it."
l58vkb,You remember zombie farm?,Honestly I've been searching the internet to see if the servers for zombie farm 1/2 are still up and from what I've heard they aren't but I'm not sure cause its hard to find info about the games. \n\nWhat I think someone should do is make a zombie farm like game because I've been searching thoroughly but found nothing similar. \n\nOf course it doesn't need to be zombies or a farm it could be like robots in a factory being made or something like that. \n\nI want the attacking system to be kinda similar but maybe give your troops active abilities you can activate or maybe do a Pokemon go type of battle system where when you fight another player by tapping and to use your special attack you have to collect the type symbol to improve your attack power for the special attack\n\nI also think that a type advantages/disadvantages system kinda like pokemon could make it interesting\n\nAnother idea is that instead of having to buy brand new zombies after they have died you could revive your upgraded zombies either by waiting or some sort of in game free currency\n\nAnd although this next idea isn't much of a fan favorite. A gacha system could theoretical be implemented and give seeds for unique zombie breeds that are only slightly better then normal zombies. Or maybe it would allow you to unlock the zombie type so you can grow multiple of the zombie you got and if you get  dupes it powers up  the zombie you got a dupe of.\n\nAlso the money system from zombie farm was good so I don't think too much changes are needed but you could always have some sort of side mini games to increase the speed of growing crops or just do side minigames to give a little more money while you wait for the crops to grow.\n\nOf course I'm not a game developer nor do I know anything about making games or making a game fun. However I remember always liking zombie farm as a kid and I just want to be able to play it again in some sort of way even if its not exactly the same. I have android and no longer have a tablet like how I used to play the game.

l55ec4,Whats the smallest acceptable open world size for you?,For a skyrim type of game
l54ie6,Joint mobile game Ideas,"Might I ask that I get credit for the idea if you make this.\n\nThese ideas are kinda similar in the fact that they both involve one person killing the other in real life (not actually killing). You can track location to find the person.\n\n1: Mission Mobile (can change)\nMission mobile is where you (and everyone else) is a spy. Your goal is to accept the mission to kill the person, physically go to their location, and find them than walk up and fake kill them. They will get notifications when you are near (can cause a chase) but you can get a power up to delay the notification. You also have to watch for notifications and people trying to kill you. Most likely there will be a 48 hour waiting period to get to play again. There will also be banning if the person is to not say they were killed on the app. \n\n2: the hunt. \n\nBasically the same thing but not with spys. There can also be a thing where it is hunters become the hunted. (Where someone who chooses to kill you, you will be able to defend against them.\n\nThere will also be more points/coins the higher the level and farther away they are. It only allows people in your country."
l51rfi,A satirical adventure where you play as a Beta tester for an unfinished fantasy game.,"Similair to the Stanley Parable, you 'playtest' a game narrated by the lead developer. The game starts off with an over-the-top lore explaination video. However, as the game starts you notice that there are a lot of bugs, bad writing and mechanics so broken that they essentially became new mechanics of their own.\n\nThere are side-quests with awfull voice acting, obnoxious tasks or just the worst rewards imaginable. Items don't behave like they're suposed to. For example: you eat steal swords to gain health or throw chicken drumsticks as molotov cocktails.\n\nYou can go on and on with this idea. It's pretty much Tommy Wiseau's Dragon Age."
lcra4i,VR Story Driven Drama (you've lost your ability to speak),"VR, Life like, real life situations, telling a story of back stabbing, treachery. This is not a traditional game, where you kill or have an ultimate goal, but there would be a great story, antagonist, and navigate a different kind of game likely more geared towards adults. Keywords here are immersion. \n\nWho knows, you could rip off some daytime TV drama - and play something out, where you have to communicate without speaking (or sign language) - so that the gameplay and vr feels natural and immersive.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a good plot.. man that would be dope AF.    \n\n\nI needed to get that out of my brain, hopefully this is allowed to post, if not that was my attempt.

lcpc0y,Partial possession,"You're a newly born imp who has a dream of rising through the ranks of the demon lords to become the ruler of hell. As an imp, you have the inate ability to posses others to do your dirty work. However, because your character isnt as naturally gifted at possession , the other imps and other demons regard them as the runt of the litter and are quickly disregarded and deemed husk fodder (food for the lowliest denizens of hell).\n\n The mechanic behind game progression is to possess different parts of an enemy in order to either beat them in a fight, solve puzzles or, once you have grown strong enough, possess them fully making them become a faithful servant who would die to make sure your dream comes to fruition.\n\nI dont really know what this could turn into but heres hoping someone can get in touch with me if they like the idea and can develop it into something amazing!"
lcpbzo,a good pirate game,"seriously. a realistic, non cartoony style game set between 1690 and i guess 1725, about pirates, that takes them seriously as the group of people that actually existed and had material reasons that drove them to piracy, without any of the silly sterotypes or strange supernatural elements. my initial idea is just 'let rockstar make red dead/gta but set in the 1710s in the caribbean' but then i did some thinking and came up with a cool, more indie friendly concept that could actually get made without an 100 million dollar budget:\n\nthe elevator pitch is this - FTL meets Crusader Kings, set in the 18th century. \n\nFTL in the way that you manage your crew when telling them to repair the ship, board other ships, fight people who have boarded, have them manning different rooms and the way you control your cannons. Crusader Kings in the sense that you have to manage your crew in the way you have to manage your medieval court in that game, making sure everyones needs are met, appeasing their wants and wishes and dealing with mutineers either in secret or in open conflict. \n\nCaribbean pirate crews often acted as a kind of rough democracy (sam bellamy, captain of the widah galley, once referred to his ship as the Widah Constitutional Republic), and trying to navigate elections and retain power and crush rivals could be an interesting wrinkle to add to the game. managing your diverse crew would be interesting as well, many of them were nationalist rebels from scotland or ireland, jacobites from all across scotland, ireland and england, or just regular ex mariners/outlaws from all across europe. if you mix too many different nationalities you need to make sure that the nationalities are represented in your officers, and that they can speak the languages of your crew. also, protestants might be averse to working with catholics, french might hate english and some whites might not be keen on working with freed slaves. the slaves had very little sailing experience so might take longer to become proficient but they make up for it by being strong and also enthusiastic at the idea of being part of a crew where the shares are equal and you are fighting against the empires, they will mostly insist that any slave ships are not sunk and their people aren't treated as cargo but dropped off at maroon hideouts (maroons were escaped slaves who recreated their african style tribal lifestyle hidden in places like jamaica and haiti). this unlocks more places to fix your ship and trade because it raises your affinity with maroon tribesmen but you can take the shrewd and morally fucked up option of selling the slaves and risking a mutiny on your ship.  \n\ni imagine two game modes, one is a sandbox where you just go around and try and amass a fortune for as long as you can, there are random events, every playthrough is different ect. \n\nthe next game mode is more in line with FTL. in FTL you have to travel across the galaxy while being pursued by a fleet and at the end there is a final showdown with the enemy fleet. In this game, I would like it if you receive word that the Royal Navy is heading to restore order to the carribbean and you have x amount of months to prepare. in real life, there was a fledgling state called the Republic of New Providence. based in nassau, it was a confederation of ships crews, with each captain representing their crew in a kind of rough outlaw republic. originally it was founded as a base for a rebel jacobite fleet but when the cause was crushed in scotland in 1715 they turned to piracy. in the game, your diplomacy with other crews would be all about consolidating power, pledging to be allies to the other crews, eliminating threats and gathering allies in the region. amassing enough wealth to bribe governors to your side, creating good will with the taino and maroon tribesmen and even drilling them in how to use guns against the incoming brits, sacking forts, arming and managing logistics for militias on various islands, taking the risk to attack the spanish as in the hopes of gaining more wealth and weapons and recruits, rebuilding old forts and furnishing them with guns to protect choke points between islands. basically an alternate history scenario where the pirates managed to get their shit together, ally with the maroons and other ex slaves and create a state out of nothing. \n\na straightforward AAA pirate game would be good too im not too picky. i just had this idea of a strategy/tactics game built off my alternate history fantasy that i got from reading a couple history books about pirates during lockdown. i dont think it would even need to be graphically any more impressive than 2012's FTL. please someone just make a good pirate game"

lcll20,Idle MOBA,"Not sure what filter to put it inder so ""dream"" as in ""i can't do this, but hoefully someone can""\n\nIf you've ever played a MOBA than you know the worst thing about it is people. I love MOBA's but i hate everything about MOBAs. My idea for a game is have a set up map like DOTA2 or LOL and as a player, you design teams of custom NPCs who you'll give custom commands to have them accomplish tasks. And y'know what, i hate MOBA's so much, lets make it a partial RPG\n\nFirst, you start with making 5 characters. Each start with 2 lines; a code or a command. A command is a prompt that the user can fill to have a character do something; ""prioritize..."", ""at....go to..."". Commands also allow for more complex immediate functions during the game, such as a player input to say ""go to..."" Which could run and then be turned off whemever. A code is an ability that a character would have like in a MOBA. They're basic, dealing a type of dmg (maybe based around 5 elements and each is good/bad against another? (Kinda like that)) and having a set type of hitbox; AOE, target, line, missile. \n\nAs the game goes on, each player defeats minions, champs, jungle camps, or turret shields and earn gold and gain exp. Exp can be spent on either more lines of code or lines of commands, or better yet, making each more complex with increased dmg ratios, dmg types, dmg, hitbox upgrades, complex functions, and more detailed or easier controls.\nGold allows for the characters to buy items, giving them new set abilities that cannot be changed at all. \n\nFights are 1v1, each controling up to 5 NPCs. Fights come down to who is better at watching the global fight, making sure everyone is doing what they need to do and can apply pressure whever needed.\n\nDumb gamemode ideas:\n\nFreebattle: go at it with randos\n\nCompetitive playground: like debating if marvel could beat DC, you take your own side, but Dennis keeps saying ""that's unfair"" so you both have an equal number of characters made and then pick your side qhile banning your opponents.\n\nCompetitive chaos: Dennis says ""well, if you have superman, i get batman AND Ironamn"", ans so you pick and ban either side's characters. \n\nGenuinely, i can see this as being super fun casually but also allowing for complex and innovative type of MOBA where you have free control and can do literally anything"

lck3ca,Deckbuilder using one or more decks of regular playing cards,"This is an idea I've had for a very very long time but can never really make into anything fun, I know absolutely nothing about making games and this might be dumb but the idea is essentially a deck builder like Ascension or Slay the spire but with nothing but a deck of cards maybe 2 and maybe pen/paper. Lmk if you have ideas."
lcjz0q,Game inspired by Roadside Picnic/Stalker,"Hey folks. I'm a programmer and intend on making this game later this year but wanted to see what people think of the idea.\n\nRoadside Picnic is a sci-fi novel about The Zone, an area where strange and dangerous anomalies occur due to aliens suddenly visiting and leaving. There was a film adaption called Stalker which shares the name of a game franchise inspired by the book/film. The game has a heavy emphasis on combat whereas I'd like to make my game focus more on the anomalies and story and be combat-free.\n\nGameplay will be first person, you'll have tools that can detect and trigger anomalies but some can't be triggered meaning you have to find an alternate path, sometimes there'll be simple puzzles to find the safe path across. You'll have a map but it won't mark your location so you have to work out where you are to find the next destination. Story will be delivered through a codec similar to the early Metal Gear Solid games, and will revolve around finding a missing science team and discovering how the government has badly handled the situation leading to the events happening (still vague on what actually happens).\n\nI know there's not much to go on but does this sound like a decent idea for a game?"
lcj6m9,Battle royale with lava rising,"Someone said something about a BR where lava rises instead of a storm, but I can do that in fortnite."
lchw8z,Hitmen (a unique fighting game),"Hitmen \n\nHitmen is a game idea I thought about but never really took the time to go into details of what it would actually be. So here goes.\n\nHitmen is sort of like a cross between Gang Beasts and Fight Night.\n\nI picture this game for the Nintendo switch. The graphics are cartoonish as the ""Hitmen"" or ""Hitters"" are their own species.\n\nThe game is a fighting game focused on striking, dodging, and movement (Much like Boxing)\n\nHitmen are very basic looking. At the core they are a round head, a round body, spaghetti  arms with round hands, spaghetti legs with sneaker shaped feet. Very basic.\n\nOne really fun part of this game is the story mode which is like a career mode. You start out a nobody fighting your way through the ranks. From street fights to in ring arena fights, to eventually become Hitter world champion. As you progress you can unlock accessories/head shapes/eyes/mouth etc. Imagine creating a Mii but way cooler lol.\n\nAccessories could be anything from chest plates (for example; Green power ranger chest plate) to pants, masks, warrior face paint, and who knows maybe air Jordan gets wind of this and you can get some classic Jordans for your ""Hitter"". As far as Color customization, everything is color customizable from the body to the accessories (in a perfect world we would have a partnership with Crayola and they would provide us with they're array of colors lol)\n\nThe game play is simple, as we want this game to be as accessable as possible. However you can learn more complex combos as you get better at the game. Online play would be a must as you would be able to enter tournaments online and Hit against people all over the world. \n\nThe way to win a Hit match (fight) is to wear your opponent down with hits, but be careful not to use up your stamina as well. Find the balance between throwing, dodging and movement around the area. When you or your opponent is knocked down and can not get up at the count of 10, that person loses the match.\n\nAs you can see this is just the basic idea of the game I have in mind, if you are a developer or like this idea and have more to add please let me know! I have very basic sketches of what the Hitters look like before customization along with a picture of what my Hitter would look like when customized to my liking also, if you would like to see that let me know.\n\nAny and all feedback is appreciated."
lc9tt5,A game where you control a marionette,A game where you control a marionette is a weird mechanic but is cool. You can control the movements with the mouse wheel and turn it around with the mouse
lc9skr,A new flair,There should be a new flair named style which means adding a new style to a video game like a cartoonist game
lc9qvj,Transformation,There are many ways to explain this.1st is killing something and collecting it's essence to transform into it. 2nd is transforming into something by clicking a button.
lc9n1r,Moving the map,"This is an idea where you can play a simple game. But there's a catch, you can click some button and see an outside view of the map. You can move it around using the mouse or joystick. And even just swiping for mobile."
lc9gaf,Mixing genres,"Although this isn't a game idea it 's still an idea for a good game. First you need to search up a graph of the most popular game genres of the year. Then you can find a mix between 2 popular genres like a puzzle platformer, or a stealth shooter. The possibilities are"
