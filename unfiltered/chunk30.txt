4mq1ye,I'm 4 month into development of a top-down game. What would you like to find in it when i release it?,"The game has a strong Teleglitch feeling (like, that cool fov effect), and after 4 months i have:\n\n- a pretty solid level editor, i would like it to be in modders' hands, which allows composing interior dungeon's modules in a point, click and drag manner\n- procedural, modular composition of interior dungeons\n- procedural, modular composition of a big exterior which should glue one or a billion interior dungeons.\n\nI'm aiming for a more metroidvania, open-world gameplay, with less dying, more exploring and a good dose of shooting. I would like to put some adventure touch in the game, and not only plain shooting. I have plenty of ideas for the context. But before going on, i thought it would be cool to hear someone's whishlist. Some ideas i have received:\n\n- Teleglitch AI sucks, make the same, but with good AI! (no personal opinions here, not played the game, just reporting)\n- Go the bullet-hell way\n- Substitute shooting with stealth\n- *Many* telling me.. just remake Doom. We miss original Doom's feeling. So this me brings me up of my youth love story with Warhammer's universe (40k above all)\n- Others asking in someway for some new Hotline Miami (brutally hard, die and replay style)\n\nAlso, i'm great fan of Half Life, but going down that route brings me to a Teleglitch clone. At the moment, i'm looking at a Jurassic-park like context, with genetically-screwed animals on a highly-technological island-park which is, obviously, fallen into chaos. *Any* rant is welcomed!"
4mq0jq,"2D game idea wanted. Coding for learning, not professional.","It doesn't have to be a board game or dwarf fortress style game. By 2D I mean stuff that does not have 3D perspective (I want to create my own engine.) Top-Down, Side-On. I will work on it to learn as I am fairly new to java."

You get a assignment and first you need to investigate and after that you would get a preparation phase. You need to choose which teams/specialisations you need and you can position them and after that the action phase begins. You can give commands and need to complete the assignment like killing or arresting someone."
4mlkfl,"I was thumbing thru an old copy of Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark and thought, I would love to see a P.O.V. open world R.P.G. or Horror made from the stories.","Now I was looking at the illustrations and I really think it could be a really freaky environment to explore, that black and white grainy oddity looking and how some of the creatures drawn to represent the stories. \n\nEvery story in the book will make up the world and the choices you make in the world leads you to who you meet. I just thought well looking at the illustrations of the dark damp sappy wet grainy world and I think it would make quite an amazing game, you could use any weapon mostly melee to deal with the combatant's of creatures from around the game world. https://www.google.com/search?q=scary+stories+to+tell+in+the+dark&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=952&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifn4mR7I_NAhXGJiYKHfBiB2cQ_AUIBigB look at some of these photos and imagine seeing the rest of the world around that single picture, the dangers, the pure hell. The only safe havens would be local towns, it could stretch the idea of a nightmare realm. \n\nYou might think it would be bad do to lack of color pallet, but its the environment story telling and action. Like you could run across The Scare Crow and have to battle him in his cabin or be grossly hacked up and stuffed to replace him. Like the less you try to hurt enemies the more panicked you could become and are easier to be overwhelmed by the creatures of this world. I also recommend if you have the books read them and really think about this idea when you do.            "
4mkbhj,3D Game request??,[deleted]
4mjtr3,Real world racing game,"I have an idea for a need for speed like racing game, except it uses real road networks as maps. The maps would be scaled to the actual place they are. I don't think there should be a campaign as such, just a ranking system like we have seen in games like Need for Speed Rivals where you have to complete assignments or achievements to level up. Players would be able to buy cars and customise them. There would also be traffic like in other road racing games. The map would be accurately designed to look exactly like the part of the world it is. Maybe different versions of the game would come with different parts of the world e.g a Europe edition or North America edition. Players would also have the choice of just free roaming around the world, they could undertake a road trip across the U.S if they wanted and it would take the same amount of time as it would if you were actually driving across the U.S (depending on what speed you're doing). It would also have a sat Mac where you can pick any location on the map to set as your destination. \n"
4mjbp3,http://ex.reddit.com/r/gameideas/#ex A horror survival game (better with VR),"This is a horror survival game with 4-8 people in a map, there will be one killer in this map. The players have to try their best to survive to the morning. The players can use almost everything in the game to against the killer such as the water bottle,books but these can only slow down the killer. Only weapons can hurt or kill the killer. If there are only one person left,there will be an announcement to show the survivor where the vehicle's key is, so the survivor can choose keep hiding or try to escape. The killer can also destroy the vehicle since there's only one person left, but destroying the vehicle will take the killer 20 secs. Well, keep hiding won't be a wise choice, every minute will minus 5 HP of your health since the game has started 8 mins, so you have to search for the foods in order to gain HP. The length of each round will depends on how many players in the game.4 players will be 20 mins, adding other players will increase 5 mins each. If the players successfully survived til the end,the survivor won. \n\nModes-\nPVE-All players against the killer(npc). In PVE, the killer can walk faster than the players and have more HP.(killer-300HP/survivors-100HP)\nPVP-Each round will only have one killer but only the killer will be announced(killer can pretend to be the survivor). The killer can have a gun with 2 bullets (so the killer don't get to kill everyone from the beginning)and a knife from the beginning of the game.\n(killer-150HP/survivors-100HP)\n\nFeatures-\nKiller can:\nchoose to pretend as a survivor.\n/Choose to kill a person by covering the victim's mouth(so others won't notice a person was killed)\n/move the dead body to wherever you want\n/scream or pretend you found the dead body(so the survivors won't suspect you)\n/killer won't get starve (won't minus HP as time goes by)\n/pick up the foods so the survivors won't have enough food to eat.\n/pick up the weapons to weaken the survivors' self-defense ability.\n/cut off the power.\n\nsurvivors can:\npick up weapons to against the killer.\n/throw things to the killer and slow him down while he's chasing you.\n/pick up the foods or medicine box to heal.\n/scream to announce others the danger or scream for other survivors' help.\n/lock the door and hide (the door lock can be broken by guns)\n/hide under the bed or the closet.\n/kill the people you suspect\n/suicide\n\nThis is a realistic horror survival game.\nThose are my basic concept of the game, I know there's a lot more details are missing but I can show you more if this really interested you.

4mj2tq,NEW Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 3DS or the NX console,"Ok, so my idea is basically a new SM64. Mario and his friends take a walk outside the castle, except Peach who was ill and stayed in bed. They had already replaced the paintings since last time Bowser took over. However suddenly dark cloud comes in and the light bricks of the castle turn dark, the water in the pond turns into lava. After a while a flying ship with Bowser JR, Kamek and Chief Chilly appears. Bowser JR laugh and then Kamek turns the painting of Peach into a painting of Bowser. Then Chief Chilly summons a mustachey-black-hole, that sucks in everyone with a mustache. Left is Yoshi who have to enter the castle and jump into the new paintings to save his friends and finally the princess. When Yoshi have completed the levels on the first floor he will unlock the cannon and be able to shot himself up to the castle roof. On the roof there's another cannon so he can shot himself up to the ship and meat bowser JR. Bowser JR will then give him the key to the higher floors of the castle. It use a star-system. At some point the lava will turn back into water. In end the princess will be saved and the castle will be restored to normal. Instead of rabbits there will be toads running around that have became paranoid because of what have happened. Help me with this idea please in the comments below!!!"
4mj041,Platformer with Spells,"I'd love a game where you play a wizard and you actually type in the spell you want to cast. My idea was a 2D platformer with a text bar at the bottom (a la Space Quest) but instead of typing in things like ""look at tree"" you'd type in something like ""Qrsdwx"" and hit spacebar or enter to cast it. You'd use the arrow keys to move. The goal of the game would be to collect all of the gems (or coins, or rings, or whatever) in each level. As you go through the game you find more spells that let you do new things, and you could go back to earlier levels and get gems you had missed previously. For example, you could find a spell late in the game that lets you pass through certain walls, and you have to go back to a few earlier levels and collect gems you missed the first time. There could be an invisibility spell that lets you sneak past certain enemies, but you can't jump while its active. There could even be an attack-matching-enemies mechanic; if your first attack spell is a fireball, maybe you come across fire enemies and have to find an ice spell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR I am looking for a game where casting spells is a more complex mechanic than just 'select spell-press cast button'"

4mh2rn,Dystopian tourist guide tycoon.,"You start out with a randomly created city map, with different distributions of wealth and different kinds of attractions (club, VR hall, MegaCorp office, or god knows what). \n\nNow your job is to plan a route through the city for ignorant outsider tourists who probably came straight from some utopian paradise. You must now plan a route that avoids criminal hotspots and at the same time visits a reasonable amount of attractions (possibly also dependent on target group). You don't want to get robbed on the way, you don't want anyone to get shot. Wealthy areas are more desirable as they are safer and nice to look at.\n\nYou earn money for successful and satisfying tours, which you can spend on mercenaries, deals with certain attractions, or maybe on things that enable/attract a certain kind of tourist.\n\nAlso, if you visit certain government owned attractions, mislead investigative journalists and generally present that dirthole of a city in a positive light, you gain influence to make minor changes in limited areas (for example, one patrol in that annoying crime spot that's totally in your way, or a renovation of state-owned housing).\n\nEdit: Additionally you could also, to inverse the gameplay, lead investigative reporters to crime hotspots! The government will hate you, but the money is excellent."

4mcuom,Rangers &amp; Angels - Small 3D fantasy hardcore skillful PVP game,"Hello folks!\n\nI will try to keep this post as simple as possible. The information isn't in any particular order, I'll just throw it out there to see what you think. I've tried to find a similar game to what I'm thinking about but there are none out there. In my text I will post game references. These are the bits from games that I really enjoy and know a lot of gamers also does. So let's get going.\n\nThe game is a fantasy PVP game. We're playing in an open world, randomly generated every time. For a start there's no NPCs or quests. The world feels like a bright peaceful place to be. Mountains, trees, bushes, rivers. For a start we'll skip wildlife as it's not a part of the core gameplay.\n\nYou spawn in as a ranger (Assassin's Creed-ish) equipped with a simple bow (World of Warcraft gray quality to it). Your arrows are limited, but you can easily obtain new ones.\n\n\n**Roaming around...**\n\n...you will search for other players to kill (Day Z, Ark, Rust). Killing players and ""just surviving"" will yield you experience (Dota, LoL, HotS / any MOBA). Whenever you hit level 10 (fast paced XP system in place) you can attune for wings (Aion). This process is simple and small and once you acquire your wings you'll take your battles to the skies. 360 degree fights with either a bow or a two handed swords. I'm thinking in the terms of angels.\n\n\n**For the combat itself...**\n\n...there will be no auto lock. No auto attacks. All abilities are ""heavy"" meaning you have a channel time before they go off (competitive mindset to this) and the opponent gets a notification on what you are about to do. You have to aim everything, angle of your sword swings (Kind of unique idea. Games have tried this out - over and over - but never ""nailed it"") and cursor positioning of your bow shots. Hits in general are lethal and they actually make a difference. If your opponent doesn't die, they get badly harmed and will be disabled for a brief amount of time. Dodge mechanics will be core here. You have to respond to your opponents attacks as well as time your own ones accordingly.\n\n**Example event**\n\nYou are a ranger roaming around among the woods when suddenly a shadow silhouette flashes by on the ground. You immediately know there's a flying player above you so you draw your arrow and aims to the sky. Fortunaely you get half a second to spot the actual character in the skies and you follow him/her with your aim across the treeline. As soon as the shot is ready you fire off an arrow. The feeling when you see/hear the head shot hit mark will be like nothing else. You will then run towards where your arrow hit to see if your foe fell to the ground. If you manage find the player you can acquire experience for the kill and also loot everything this player has on it. This means others can compete for the kill as well.\n\n\n**This game is supposed to be hardcore.**\n\nYou start off as a basic ranger, and you progress by looting other players struck down in battle and/or finding artifacts throughout the world. If you are fortunate enough to down a winged player before the level of 10 you can snatch their wings and take off to the sky earlier. Dying just means you have to repeat this process.\n\nThere should be a system in place to make the deaths slightly less punishing. However, the greedy hardcore player will probably not dedicate himself to this system and just go from scratch with every death. High risk, high reward.\n\n\n**The loot system...**\n\n... is very similar to the basic MMOs (World of Warcraft) with equipment rarities such as rare, epic and legendaries. Legendary items are considered ""artifacts"" and are unique. So if you have a unique equipment people will recognize that by the looks and effects of the item. These items are the most powerful ones in the game will have special effects like:\n\n* ""Lord Ashwing's Dread Bow"" - infinite arrows (ammo)\n\n* ""Grip of Death"" - two handed sword with a 100% chance to kill your opponent on direct hit\n\n* ""Eagle Sight Bow"" - arrows that goes straight and travels until something is hit\n\nEven wings would have stats and quality on them.\n\nI miss the feeling in games where you actually feel powerful because of the armor you are wearing. People should see that you are a war veteran and avoid you if you seem to powerful (old World of Warcraft - pre transmog).\n\nI hope you guys see where I'm getting with this. It's a free for all battle royal, without the aspects of a survival game like daunting ""search for water while you are thirsty""-systems. You are by your own and try to overcome other players to improve your own character and it's gear to be the best and strongest living being.\n\nThis is the naked basics of the game idea, and I do know that what could bring the fun in it down is the lack of engagement when you die and have to start all the time. That's why some kind of system should be in place. Let's say there's one world, hardcore world, you spawn in at level 1 and have to ""build up"", where you can extract your loot (like Division) if you stay alive. Extractions are made to a similar world, where there's no real punishment for dying. This world would be considered ""softcore"" and is the place where everything is about bragging rights. You can still do PVP, but it's mainly for you to show off your gear / try certain builds out or just chat with other players about the game.\n\n**The server (world).**\n\nIn most survival games you can run around for hours without finding a player. In this game the world's size will be generated with the ""current amount of players online"" in consideration. It will go in rounds with a winner (account that has best score at the end of a round). After that a new world will spawn. There will be one official world, no realms or bullshit like that.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* Free for all battle royal in an open world (Day Z, Ark, Rust)\n\n* Progress system with equipment in the form of loot and levels/talents (Division, World of Warcraft, Dark Souls, MOBA's)\n\n* Combat with skillful mechanics to it (Bloodline Champions, CSGO, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, &gt;game that not exists yet&lt;)\n\n* Cool aesthetics to the world and characters (Aion, Assassins Creed, Black Desert Online)\n\n\n**Reasons to create this game:**\n\nIt's supposed to be a small and fast paced PVP game with a very rewarding system in place. The focus is on the characters and the combat. Development time shouldn't be huge despite these facts. There are no ""expansions"" needed to be planned and content patches will be in the form of artifacts (unique legendary items scattered across the world). The fun you would get out of it would compensate for the effort put in to create it, I think.\n\n**Last notice**\n\nOne question I ask myself everything I play a game. Where's the realism to it? If I shoot someone with an arrow, let it stick. Show the impact of the direct hit. Same goes for sword fights. If I hit a three seconds diagonal sword swing because my opponent isn't reacting fast enought, he should be cut in half - or at least receive a noticeable deep wound across his chest. In the end it's all about the feeling. If it is compelling or not.\n\nWhen I play rust, as an example, I play the game because the headshot notification is a ""splash sound"" which gives me an adrenaline rush everytime a get it. It's these small details that makes a great game, in my opinion."
4mbhwj,[dream] A home invasion simulator (for VR),"Basic premise: one person is a criminal the other a homeowner. The goal of the criminal is to take the most stuff, survive, and not get arrested. The goal of the homeowner is to survive with the least amount of property stolen. Homeowners would be ""asleep"" until the alarm went off at which point the criminal can get out or risk death or arrest. With leveling based on loot got(as a criminal) or loot left (as a homeowner) \n\nThe houses would be fairly large to allow for a minor stealth aspect. The lighting would be low, a night light or the moon or a TV with static as a light source.\n\nWeapons could range from bear fists to crowbars or handguns with flashlights to Street sweepers. \n\nThe alarm would start a randomized count down until the police arrive ending the criminal's run and forfeiting the loot, as would death. Another way the police would arrive or arrive sooner is shots fired. The neighbors would also call if there was enough noise e.g. Shattered glass. The count down timer is only visible to the homeowner.\n\nThe homeowner cannot call the police because an alarm has done it for them. The homeowner has no homeowners insurance so the money from the unstolen loot is used to pay for property damage. They loose the loot if they are killed. But the criminal can keep looting after the homeowners death. The homeowner may lock his bedroom door to garuntee survival but he gains little money from the high value loot in the bedroom, likewise the crook looses access to the bedroom due to the round being easier. \n\nTo keep leveling fair the crook gets more money from loot than the homeowner gets from not having it stolen. Say the TV being $1199 for the crook may only be $100 for the homeowner. And maybe give the loot weight and the crook a weight limit to prevent the theif from stealing 4 flat-screens and a gun safe. \n\nAnother thing which may or may not make the game more fun is the homeowner has to buy the loot but it carries over say a theif steals a TV one round he gets the loot but next round the homeowner has the TV again so that it's like a money generator. \n\nAnd finally house customization. Homeowners get to choose where things go.\n\nEdit cuz I am dumb: it's a 1v1 pvp game"
4mat7q,Conquest And Conspiracy! By: Pat.,"     CONQUEST AND CONSPIRACY V2\n\nHello! I've come up with an idea for a large-scale multiplayer shooter. Of course, called Conquest And Conspiracy. (This game is a mix in between MGO, Battlefield, Verdun, And heros and generals, In a way) There are two factions in a fictional war. Polque, and Sulislaw. Polque has Brown uniforms, with a brown cap (Or no hat at all), whilst Sulislavic soldiers wear the iconic gray uniform and Spiked leather Hat. When you first play C.A.C (conquest and conspiracy) You can create a character. You can choose height, Facial hair, gender, (yes, Both of these armies are uni-sex) Facial build, Hat or no hat, Patches, and Equipment (I'll cover equipment later.) Also, When you create your character, You select his or her perk.\n\nCrackshot - Be able to focus scopes easier, plus have less sway when scoped in, however less health.\n\nClimber - Can climb trees for a better tactical view, and for sniping. (You can only snipe once on top of a tree) However, You move slower\n\nNavigator - Has the ability to pull out a map and see where large groups of enemies are heading, However less ammo when you spawn in due to you carrying maps.\n\nIron Clad - Takes more damage without slowing down, However, you cannot tell how much damage you have.\n\nLooter - Can pick up ammo and guns from the dead, However, you shoot the enemy's guns less effectively due to you not being trained with the weapon\n\n Now, let's get onto the classes. This game will feature HEAVY  asymmetric gameplay features. For example, Polque's army's guns have less damage, But have more ammo. On the other side, Sulislaw has bigger guns, but small amounts of ammo due to poor mobilization. Polque is the underdog here, And in the game, You're playing in Polque country. I based Polque off of rural France and Poland whilst I based Sulislaw off of Russia. Anyway's let get to the classes.\n\n Medic\nWeapons - Pistols\nHealth - 87 HP\nMovement Speed - Fast\nAbilities - To heal bleeding, and give out health.\n\n Spy\nWeapons - Knifes, pitchforks, and pistols\nHealth - 50 HP\nMovement speed- fast\nAbilities - to hack into enemy comms, and disguise as enemy soldiers\n\n Militiaman\nWeapons - Pitchfork, Shovels, Rifles\nHealth - 70 HP\nMovement speed - normal\nAbilities - Can set traps, and move silently\n\n Rifle Man\nWeapons - Rifle (DUH)\nHealth - 85 HP\nMovement speed - Normal\nAbilities - Can attach knifes to the end of their rifle for an increase of melee damage\n\n Heavy Gunner\nWeapons - Heavy MG + Shield\nHealth - 90 HP\nMovement speed - Slow\nAbilities - can set up their MG's for increased aim.\n\n Sniper\nWeapons - Rifle with scope\nHealth - 82 HP\nMovement speed - Fast\nAbilities - Can see enemy footsteps\n\n Mage\nWeapons - Pistol one hand, Magic in the other\nHealth - 85\nMovement speed - medium\nAbilities - Blink (Teleport within 20 meters of player) Purge (Send a direct force of energy that does 50 damage on all parts of body)\n\n   Also, Let's get into some game mechanics. When your health goes below 20, you begin to limp. When you take ANY damage, zero blood shows up on your screen. You only begin to move slower. When your health is at 10 or lower, You fall onto the ground, where you slowly bleed to death, yelling for help. Yes, when you're in the ""final stand"" position whilst in this state, you can crawl, however your crawling speed is reduced by 25%, You can also fire your pistol. Another mechanic is ""bleeding"" whenever you take damage from bullets, or being stabbed, you start to bleed. Here's  my favorite mechanic. ""Ineffective"" firearms. So, when your team looses an ammo depo, or you pick up a gun from a dead enemy, the gun has a 20% chance of jamming. When your gun jams, you must ""clean"" the gun for 5 seconds. The gun has a chance to ""fail"" whenever you fire it.\n\n\n Let's get onto the maps. There will only be two maps (because of the varried gameplay offered, more then two will not be required) One being Grace's crossing. Fight in one of Polque's biggest trading villages, and outlaying farms. The First map will be called suprisingly, ""Grace's Crossing"" Whilst the second map will be called ""Industry"" And focus on an industrialized town on the coast of Polque, with large factories and small apartments, perfect for all classes.\n\n Let's get into my favorite part about the game. Spies. Spies are players dressed as ncps. In each map, there are large groups of civilians in housed regions, houses, and farms. So lets just say, you're running from a group of people on a jeep with a mounted machine gun. You run into a cottage and you see some farmers. If you kill a civilian, your points go down by 5%. (Harsh, I know) But the reason I put it to 5% is so spies are a more viable choice. However, there is a chance for one of the ncps to be an enemy spy. These spies can mark forces on the team's maps, and sabotage radio stations to mess up enemy communications. \n\n The main tagline of this game is ""War isn't about ONLY shooting a gun"" Which is true, But shooting guns is very important. Since this is a class based shooter, there is no class customization. At all. You can only change the type of wood on your rifle and engrave a custom text into your gun. (Yes, you can write ""I fucked yo bitch with the barrel of this rifle"" on the gun. It'll barley fit, but hey, WERF) We should talk about the equipment. Because I know how much you care about this random game (sarcasm)\n\n Equipment is chosen at the beginning on the game, and can be changed (along with classes) whenever you're in your spawn building (HQ) There is five different pieces of equipment.\n\n Bear trap - Entangle your enemies with this silent and deadly ""gift"". (Anti-Personal) \n\n Mine - An anti vehicular explosive device designed to pierce armor. \n\n Flint and steel - Be able to set ammo supply depos on fire.\n\n TNT - Lay this along the ground, and blow it up from a distance, can destroy bridges, houses, and everything in between.\n\n Grenade - Throw these lethal fragmentation devices at your enemy! (Anti Personal) \n\n \nWith the equipment covered, Let's get into the drivable vehicals. \n\nHorses. Be the clint eastwood you always wanted to be. Light carry weight, but high movement speed.\n\nJeep (mounted machine gun). Made with the thought of ""Hey, I like guns, I like jeeps, why not put them together?"" medium speed, medium carry weight, but high firepower\n\n Tanks. tin boxes only available to the sulislavic forces, slow movement but high, high, VERY HIGH firepower. Slow speed.\n\n Hang gliders - Only available to the Polkin (polque) forces, Fast, and when your in it, you can drop rocks, and bombs on your un-expecting victims below.\n\n   CHART O' GUNS, M8\n Name           Dmg              Round size\nFrelant DII     70 to chest         5      \nPitch Mark XI  89 to chest        3         \n ^Rifles\n\nVina MG         21 to chest        80\nLancer           32 to chest        50\n    ^Machine guns\n\nService R.      60 to chest         6 (duh)\nJutlander       10 per pellet        2 (double duh)\nHammerless   20 To chest         10 \n   ^Pistols\n\nBow N Arrow  80 to chest         16\nShield            50 bash dmg       N/A\n^0ther\n\n Finally, Let's get onto how the game is played. Whenever a game is started, there is a red line dead center of the map. of territories in the middle of the map. In the map ""industry"" territories are divided into houses, whilst in ""Grace's crossing"", Territories are divided into farms, and with on large territory being Grace's crossing. Each map will be about the size of a battlefield 4 map. In each map there is a 20 territories. You must capture zones in the territory to capture it. You may only enter territories that are bordering your own. The only time you may enter into enemy territory is when you're a spy.  \n\n Also, there are certain stockpiles named ""ammo depos"" near each team's HQ. You can destroy these depos as spies, or whilst an attack on the bordering territory. Also, On the map ""Grace's crossing"" there is a dragon's cave you can activate via provoking the dragon. Once the dragon is ""provoked"" it will attack ALL players on the map, along with NCPS. On the map ""Industry"", There is a jail (which in itself is it's own territory) in said jail, you can free all the prisoners, allowing for the prisoners to try to escape and will attack both teams if they fire upon them.\n\n This game is focused on teamwork, tactical choices, being able to infiltrate the enemy, and accuracy. I would sell the game for about 30 dollars. Also, If you DO use this idea, please give me SOME credit. Not that much, but atleast something. Come on man."

4m9n2k,VR Sports Collection,"Because of the recent boom in VR technology (primarily due to the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive) the majority of the games have been made to cater to a audience that is into sci fi and horror games. (see Space Pirate Trainer and Sisters).\n\nIt occurred to me whilst thinking about how the Nintendo Wii used its motion controls to create one of the best selling games of all time (Wii Sports) that there should be some VR games that also showcase some more sporty games. These games could include the games seen in Wii Sports, such as baseball, tennis, and bowling, but it could also include others such as a basketball minigame, a javelin game or a discus throwing game.\n\nThe great thing about this idea is that if it was on the HTC Vive, then you could actually move around to catch baseballs, change the throwing angle of bowling balls, and move to hit tennis shots. This would make this game a much more absorbing experience than the Wii Sports games.\n\nAlso, if the crowd is rendered well, then that would create an amazing atmosphere for the player, as they would feel like they were actually in a stadium or on court."
4m82sm,(massively) cooperative tron-like puzzle,"Edit: Rewrote  \n   \n2d top down cooperative puzzler.   \n   \nThe game is based around matching strangers from around the world to solve randomly generated puzzles.   \n   \nThe game is a grid, which has blue and orange Tiles. Players who join are randomly assigned to characters that can either travel on blue tiles or orange tiles. When a character goes over a tile it flips it (blue to orange and vice versa. The goal is to make the level a single colour.   \n  \nie level is:   \n*00$0  \n11010  \n11000  \n11111  \nwhere * can flip tiles with ""0"" on them, and $ can flip tiles with ""1"" on them. \n   \nonce one player is surrounded by tiles of the other colour (they are extinguished) and the tile is flipped to their partners kind. ie once * dies the tile becomes a 1. \n\nOnce the players beat the level a new one is generated. The size of the new level depends on the number of current players online at the time. "
4m80rh,God Battles,"This game could either be a first person RPG or a Diablo-type hack and slash. When you begin, you are given a list of gods you can choose to play as. Or, you could design your own god, by choosing a name, a gender and powers(eg: lightning).\n\nIf you choose a pre-defined god, you'll play in that historical period. The goal is to conquer as much land and as many followers as possible. You do that by completing two types of maps:\n\nA) Battle maps:\nIn this map, humans attack you(because the worship a different god). You'll have to use your powers to decimate all the enemies. Every completed map gives you a certain number of points. The harder the map, the more point it gives. You can spend that points on upgrades(new weapons, better looks, new powers, etc.).\n\nB) Destruction maps: In these maps, you have a limited amount of time to inflict as much damage as possible upon a human settlement(villages at first, but then huge cities). You'll have to use your powers for a devastating effect.\n\nUnlike battle maps, the points you get depend on how much destruction you inflict.\nThe above maps are grouped in campaigns. At the end of each campaign, you'll have to face another god(from the same civilization belief system) in combat.\n\nAfter you defeat it, you gain a large amount of points, and the option to get all its followers, or allow it to keep them, in exchange for a ""tribute"" in points.\n\n(You get free points from time to time). This goes on until you defeat all rival gods from that civilization. Then, you move on to the next one and so on.\n\nThere could be a free-play mode where you choose a god with everything unlocked(all powers, upgrades, etc.) and you're free to play every map(regardless of its timeline) and battle every god from every civilization for as many times as you like.\n\nC) Your realm:\nYou get a personal realm, which is empty at first, but you can build things there(eg: a palace, forests, fire pits, whatever you imagine) for a price in points. You can play/build/explore your realm between the campaign maps(when you're not in a map). "
4m7ht7,Assassination Game,"(Warning, this may be very contriversial, but this came to me in American History)\n\nStory Time: In American History, we were watching a video on JFK's assassination when I got a slightly sadistic idea.\n\nIdea: A game where you become the assassin of famous individuals, and you must assassinate your target (Ex. JFK, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, Osama Bin Laden, Franz Ferdinand, etc.). Certain objectives must be completed like time limits on reaching destinations, but the game can be modified in terms of positioning yourself and deaths. A ""Realism"" bonus would be added if you completed the assassination as it happened (Ie. Missing the throw of the grenade at Franz's car then ambushing him later). But you can kill however you would like (Ie. Bomb JFK's car instead of shooting him). A getaway would ensue and you must attempt to escape from police officers and angered citizens.\n\nWhy?: I think it would be a very interesting game to play and it would have to be a strategic plan to successfully complete the assassination. This could be great for persons trying to see what would happen if Osama bin Laden had been killed by an attack on his building rather than a sniper shot.\n\n\n\nNot my first post, but my first worthwhile post. Thanks for reading!"
4m55c4,Game dream i've thought about.,"I've thought about a Fantasy/Medieval type game using the same fighting as Skyrim but having amazing graphics being a HUGE open world map that is Multiplayer. You start off as a normal person and work your way to greatness. You can build in it find a spot and claim it your own. You can hire companions who can work for you or do things for you. There will be different countries/islands you can go to. \n\nYou must farm materials or let your companions farm for it to build gear or buildings.. There is no levels making it equal for every player. Build your own kingdoms/castles you can also hire troops. These troops will help you raid you can have your very own army for Castle PVP. They will defend your castle or help you take/destroy someone else's. You cannot use them anywhere else. \n\nYou can also raid little CPU villages since there will be tons of them scattered around the map and they will spawn in random places after a few hours. You don't choose a class you start with what ever you want you could be a warrior/wizard a Archer and a Wizard it depends on what you start learning first. To get new spells you will have to explore and find them or buy them from vendors. You will have to find or buy most items to be able to craft stuff such as catapults,armor etc. If you really wanted you could have a boat to live on or travel.\n\nThis game idea is a bit rusty but I think i have some really good ideas if only I was rich and could make this dream come true. Tell me what you guys think about this or how I could improve."
4m4pfn,Game Concept Hidden Elements,"This a concept a game I am about to develop.\n\nThe core idea of the game is to solve puzzles which require the player to perform a series of meaningful actions while being in a specific form. The player will have access to three forms-\n\nEarth\nWater\nFire\n\nThere will also be a normal human form.\nEach form will have a unique passive and active ability.\n\nHuman Form-\nThe human form will be the weakest of all forms.\nIt can only be used for human interactions like talking.\n\nEarth Form- Major Attribute will be DEFENCE\nThe Earth form will be the slow and has more health.\nIts passive ability is Heavyweight.\nHeavyweight makes earth heavy and strong, he can push boulders.\nIts active ability will we Stone Shield.\nCreates a shield in front of the player, any enemy that hits the shield is stunned. \n\nWater Form- Major Attribute will be SPEED\nThe Water form will be fast and have more hp regeneration.\nIts passive ability is Flow.\nFlow makes water fluid and hollow, he can fit through narrow gaps.\nIts active ability is Waveform.\nGoes into liquid mode where you cant attack or be attacked, gains phase movement.\n\nFire Form- Major Attribute will be ATTACK\nThe fire form will be moderate and have more attack damage.\nIts passive ability is Lightweight.\nLightweight allows the player to float if affected by air current.\nIts active ability is Flame Breath.\nBreaths flames in front of the player, high damage.\n\n\nThe story of the game will start with the player in the human form in his house, the player must explore the house. Outside the house the front leads him to the village and the back leads hit to a forest.\n	The villages will have 3 temples located a hidden locations which the player can visit but cant interact.\nThe player will get a hint from everyone in the game would to avoid the forest behind his house.\nThe forest is huge, if the player enters the forest ignoring all the hints he will encounter the Nature Sprit.\nThe nature spirit will tell the player about a evil corruption deep inside the forest, which must be stopped. The spirit will ask the player for its help.\nThe player is then informed about 3 legendary stones which store the power of nature. The 3 stones are kept inside their respective temples.\nThe player must acquire all the 3 stones to gain access to the deep forest.\nEach temple will have a puzzle which will be based on logical thinking. If the player solves the puzzle he will receive the stone of the temple he is in. Each temple will have a tutorial stage for the player to learn how to use his newfound powers.\nAfter solving all the three puzzles in the three temples (EARTH,WATER,FIRE) the player again encounters the nature spirit which calls him inside the forest.\nNow the player can shift into any form he likes with a button press.\nAs the player reaches home he is scolded by his parents because they see him enter the forest behind their house and the player is grounded in his room.\nThe player must escape using a combination of the power and go inside the deep forest.(puzzle)\nAs the player enters the forest the nature spirit explains him about the corruption that is deep inside the forest and how to stop it.\nThe player must ring 2 bells deep within the forest which will cleanse the land from corruption.\nAs the player enter the deep forest a horde of enemy's attack him and he must defeat them.\nBell 1 is on a tower. The tower will be full of enemy's and a small puzzle. As the player reaches the top of the tower he has to fight a small boss battle with a corrupted giant bird guarding the bell.\nThe boss battle will be about avoiding the swooping bird, studying its pattern and then setting fire to where the bird will swoop next.\nThe tower will be collapse as the player rings the bell.\nA horde of enemy's appear they must be defeated to enter a cave which has the next bell. The player should solve the hardest puzzle of the game(not yet decided) to reach the end of the cave. To ring the bell the player must defeat a few hoards of enemies.\nWhen the second bell is rung. A huge boss battle begins inside the cave. The corruption will take a form which we must defeat by an combination of puzzle and brawling.\nThe player must break 3 spikes from the celling roof through solving a puzzle. Each spike that hits the boss will give a window of time when the player can hit the boss.\nAs the boss is defeated the player saves the forest the nature sprite appears. He takes away all the powers from the player and thanks him for helping him and tells him to return to his normal life.\nBack to house the player must sneak past the house (puzzle).As the player enters the room he was grounded in a sneaky fashion. The game ends with the players mother coming to see the player in his room and telling him about how his father ventured into the deep forest years ago and did not return.\nHinting a part 2 for the game.\n\n\n\nEnemy Types\nEarth - weak against Water/ strong against Fire\nWater - weak against Fire/ strong against Earth\nFire - weak against Earth/ strong against Water\n\nPuzzles\n\nPuzzles will vary from a vast number of things from avoiding spikes to jumping on moving platforms. But the main part of the puzzles will be using a correct set of logical combination of powers on a certain object which will open the door.\n\nPlease tell he how you feel about this concept.\nDo you want me to add anything?\nSuggestions are welcome.\nPoint out my mistakes and I will be happy to improve."
4m287f,Help me decide on what idea to choose. + Suggestions,"So I am interested in making a 2D grand strategy or simulation game. I have 3 ideas that I really like, and want to see what others like from those options. I would also like to bounce ideas off of you guys about specifics for the game. I'll briefly describe each game, and then you can vote at this link: http://goo.gl/forms/jUdBOA83lJ6eavZH2\n\n1.  Country strategy/sim: You could play as an existing country or create a new one on a global map. \n\n2.  Space strategy/sim: You would have control of a planet or many planets in a collection of galaxies.\n\n3.  Medieval Kingdom strategy/sim: You would be the king or queen of a small kingdom and castle.\n\nAll the games ideas will have the same concepts of having to balance many things like diplomacy, politics, military, and economics. I would also like a little bit of a city-builder feel to each game a little, mainly for the Medieval one. This is just the large idea, and I have many ideas about specifics for each, after I choose one. Thank you for voting and feel free to leave suggestions of things you'd like to see. I'll probably make a new subreddit about the chosen game later and leave a link. \n\n"
4ppai5,Random Space Race,"Just thought about this while watching ksp videos - maybe it might be cool?\n\nI was thinking of a stylized game that takes you back to the start of the space era, around the 1950s before the launch of Sputnik, where you compete against other people to be the first to space. However, all the variables would be randomized, so you had to do research, testing, more research and further testing before you had any chance of making it to space.\n\nAdditionally, there could be a space feature where you would control the spacecraft and actually compete to be the first to the Moon, to Mars e.t.c, extending the time span of the games and adding more content / depth.\n\nThis would then allow for different game modes, so there would be customisable end points, so it could be first to the moon or first to Pluto or whatever. The games could last varying amounts of time - between fast paced 10 minute-ish games to games lasting an hour or more, where the competitors would be constantly locked in an intense strategy game.\n\nEither way, I thought I should write down my thoughts somewhere, and if anyone else had any suggestions I'd love to hear them :)"
4pnb10,"Inn owning sim, need more ideas","I'm working on a game with the idea that you own an inn and you keep financially stable with customers, rooms, workers, etc. (This idea wasn't my own, but I AM programming it) does anyone have any ideas to expand upon this? I currently have made all of the base code(no graphics, just white squares) and the game is quite dull. \nThis is what the game currently has\n\nYou can see a small blackboard with a list of favours is you hold the 'B' key, and holding TAB will get you other stats such as the time of day, your current money, your family's contentedness, etc. During day hours customers come in and you need to choose whether they should do you a favour to subtract one from your blackboard, or if they should just pay you outright. By the end of each day you must have a blackboard with all favours completed. If there are not enough rooms for a customer you must turn them away (you can do this even with rooms available, but there's really no point in doing so) As more customers arrive, your shop popularity goes up, causing customers to come in more steadily and offer more money.\n At the end of each day, which is dictated by when your randomized daytime hours hit 0, a menu opens which will allow you to choose to feed your family, advertise your inn, or buy more space for your it. You can probably imagine what these all do to their respective variables. \n\nHow can I make this more entertaining?"
4pm8gk,Neat Roguelike Idea,My idea is basically having echolocation in a roguelike as a method for the player to move around.\n\nThere might also be echolocation puzzles as well.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.
4plygl,Interesting Concept for RPG's,"So, I don't know if there are game devs out there who already did this, if so pls PM me the name or link or something. \n\nHere's the concept: \n\nYou all know that in previous rpg's you basically have infinite time to explore the world before you go on your ""super urgent"" quest. \nWell ... what I'm proposing is a kind of ""Real-Time Role Playing Game"", where the villain has a fixed schedule and you have to really stop him from doing his thing before he can do any more bad and if you are not fast enough, maybe a village will be burned down or a politician will get assassinated or your daughter will die. \n\nUp until now it was a faut-pas for any game dev to develop games where you can actually fail a quest. But why? I mean a failed quest should not suck all motivation out of the player but rather push him to do better in the next quest and really stop the villain. Of course one possible hurd for developers would be that they would have to change the future story depending on one failed attempt to stop the villain in time. But what I'm proposing is not that you have to let every single quest influence the outcome of the game but rather to have fixed time marks when the villain will do his next step before you can stop him. \n\nSo this is a really simple idea which could potentially be adopted really easily. Tell me, what are the problems with this concept? Or how could you possibly improve it?"
4plsuf,"Simplistic Game Ideas - Like a ketchapp game, but better.",Heyo\nJust wondering if you guys had any ideas for simplistic games. I would like something similar to a ketchapp game.\nThanks!
4plj40,Serial Killer Simulator/Manhunt 3 (original idea),"Okay, guys, stay with me on this, I think it could be good.\n\nYou pick a backstory as to why you've turned to killing. Things like, Nihilist who believes life is a disease to cure, textbook sociopath from birth, etc. You could even have unlockable backstories and character models like Vengeful Spirit, terrorist sleeper, etc.\n\nWhat kind of killer you become is up to you. Do you stalk pray by night, or stage public executions and escape using parlour and street knowledge?\n\nAlso include a base of operations that's customizeable. You could even have a killer who holds victims hostage and tortures them. The slow kill cinematics could be sip e tingling and heartwrenching.\n\nOf course, the police would be after you, once they discover your killings. The less evidence you leave, the harder it would be to find you. You could stalk the cops on your case, or interact with them as a normal person to gather information, if they don't know your face.\n\nAlso, a running tally of victims and a system to profile your character psychologically could give you achievements or class bonuses names after specific killers. Do you charm victims before killing them? Ted Bundy perks. Do you torture victims and use their bodies for playthings? Ed Fein perks.\n\nI doubt this would ever get made, due to the obviously controversial subject matter, but I think it could be a sort of Manhunt 3-type venture, where evenin with an M or AO rating, it could gain a following if the gameplay is smooth, the stories are well written, and the graphics and cinematics are on point.\n\nAny other ideas? Feel free to share and add on."
4pkrki,The Sons of War: The tree Grows a Branch,"Lets say if this game was real this would be what is said in the trailer to intro you to the game “Hmmm  hello there young Traveler come sit there is a  tale to tell. this town is one, that is all of the greatest Warrior to have  ventured the universe and Conquer bounties. he is the god of Chaos, who created peace many times, this man's name is Jack, he was born of the Greek human God Ares and of the Roman goddess Bellona he was born mortal body although Immortal soul, he was born to earth. at his age of 20 he destroyed it with the powers he hadn't known of. after the destruction of Earth he was taught to use his powers by a man named sendoy (sen-du-oy) on a remote planet. he was taught alongside bullster a great friend but soon to be  rival after the 7 years of teaching. why they become Rivals is that bullster Had decided to taking their masters blade and kill him with it, Sendoy. he ended up succeeding although Jack took their masters blade to honor him And after a couple days he realized he shall become a teacher himself he came to teach three youngsters, Sinstor (sin-store),  16 extremely intelligent, Rock, 25 able to bend any type or form of rock to his will,  Fiory (fee-or-a), 19 can use fire of any source. those were students until more and more came  when they took out a man nickname core killer. once they had  defeated much word spread about Jack. although skip ahead 4 years.  around this time Jack Was sent to  kill a dimension destroying dragon. He had succeeded but only at the cost of his wife, who had just given birth in the past day or so, and to the cost of his great friend Rock.  while killing the dragon the dragon had offered Jack his life for his wife although Jack had thought the dragon was tricking him little did Jack know he wasn't. after jack found out that his wife had died the flicker of Rage inside him clicked. this caused him to go into an immense rage That's when he started coming back to the planet he attempted to destroy it although Rock had gotten in his way. just as Jack started to regain sanity the last thing he saw before he was fully  sane  was him holding his best friend's head in his hands and popping it like a balloon. although let's skip ahead another three years to where he finds another named Nancy but, then 11 years later his son Nick who was born not too long before his mother's death he was tricked by a man who planned to destroy space, and could do it, That Jack was the reason his mother died. Jack first tried to make him realize that it wasn't his fault but once his son had caught him with his blade he knew he had to end this. he ended up beheading his own son and obliterating The Man Who tricked his son. now things start to slow the word spread to Jack that there was  a supposed God  and wasn't possible to kill. the Bounty brought him to his father Ares who told him that he was his father and what he planned to do. Jack didn't like the idea the  Ares had given so he ended him. although that is all for now young Traveler. after that the true story begins. but till next time traveller” But there would also be multiplayer and how that works is that you can free roam space and lvl up and junk but you'd have to chose your power like fire or super strength ect. but there would be over 100+ powers to choose from\n"
4pkcid,Needing Ideas for an Artcy Fartcy Game.,"Ello, a Reddit Noob here!  ∩(・ω・)∩\n\nFor some time now I have been playing with a few ideas I would like to put into a game, and I am looking for some more inspiration. Basically, the three main focus of the game are: the lore (aka the world and possible story, but the story isn't too mind blowing and unwritten), the characters (I am exploring ideas that focus on character attachment), and being very artistic (I got an idea how I want to do the art but other recommendations are welcomed). What I would like help with is ideas of what type of game or game mechanics there are that will also allow for me to make a game that is able to focus on artistic scenes (often close quarters and close\zoomed in onto characters).\n\nIdeas I have had mainly just point and click games, as well as an isometric game idea (but the isometric game idea is an idea I am avoiding because, like I said, I want the art to be zoomed on the characters).\n\nSo, any ideas?\n\nOther information.\nThe reason I want an artistically focused game is because I want to explore some social ideas in the game, such as sexuality. In order to focus on sexuality in the game, I am going to need questionable art, lol. I don't want lewd art in my game to show up periodically as that will seem more like a game made with fanservice or made to attract 12-year-olds, when in reality, the game is made for adults to explore grownup ideas. So to prevent making a game that feels like it's just made to get attention by using lewd images,  I think the solution is to have a constant art style that allows for more lewd situations to show up in a natural way by simply making art the focus or second focus of the game."
4pi5wz,Alien Abduction,"I've been thinking about making this game soon, but I'm wondering if it sounds like a good idea at all. \nThe game would be in first person view, I want to make it kind of like bio shock. At the beginning of the game you get abducted by aliens and experimented on, and the rest of the game would consist of just trying to escape back to earth or maybe taking down the aliens altogether. \nFor gameplay, you would start out with something random you had in your pocket, like a hacky sack, and that would be your only weapon. As you progress through the game, due to the experiments, you start unlocking psy powers like telekinesis and mind control. I want to make mechanics kind of like psy ops or second sight. I'm not sure right now if I want fighting or stealth to be more important. Also, the aliens, rather than being crazy animal like creatures like in dead space, they will be more delicate and humanoid, using advanced technology and weaponry to get the upper hand.\nSince I am a one man team this will probably be a pretty short game, progressing through levels in the alien spaceship, kind of like portal.\nThanks for reading :) Any suggestions?"

4pg7e2,A Different Monster Game,"     In this game, you are the agent of a government program to hunt down monsters and integrate them into society, for example, Frankenstein running a hotdog stand. It will have platforming elements and shooting (A bit like Mega Man). Another thing you must do is hunt down Nightmares, creatures that spread fear many places.\n\nIf you all have any ideas at all to share, I would be glad to hear them."
4pfsrd,One Punch Man Inspired Open World Game,"**Concept**: Open World Superhero / Destruction Game\n**Idea size**: Fairly small, open to expanding to online multiplayer if successful and reaches scale\n\nYou're someone who has special abilities; just short range or long range, and you're incredibly overpowered that only some enemies will be of challenge to you. The trick is for you to choose a path of reputation - good or bad. You have to perform these feats for publicity, secondarily only for the action itself. Press, police &amp; citizens will be major factors - plus the heroes and the villains controlled by AI (or other players in multiplayer).\n\n**What will keep you playing**:\n\n* Hero / Villain customization\n* Difficulty of stealing kills from other players / AI in front of publicity\n* Reaching the areas before others reach them\n* Heroes get perks from the people as celebrities (money, cars, rooms, etc.)\n* Villains can do all the destruction they want\n* The trick is that it should be crazy with alien invasions, zombies, deep sea creatures and other monsters."
4pdo9k,Tile based survival,"I need some help forming an idea. I have a game right now that is a tile based shooter with pretty basic enemies. The game doesn't matter, in just trying to develop it into some sort of survival.  Can you guys give me some gameplay mechanics that you'd like to see in a survival game? \n\n***\n\n### Ideas\n\n* resources being dropped my monsters or from gathering\n* time allocation for doing critical things\n* building defenses\n* defending some object(s)"
4pdmpj,E-Games,"Here are a couple of ideas that go along with a simple concept I have come up with not too long ago.  The overall concept is not necessarily new, but it is quite under-explored. The concept is games by email -- sure, some people use email more than others, but it is available virtually anywhere. Any platform, mobile or desktop, windows or mac, or even some random OS, so long as it has a web browser. So why not make a game that is run completely through emails? Some basic ideas:\n\n\n1) A simple game such as connect 4 that can be played against either the computer, or another human. The server sends an email to the player whose turn it is, and that player replies with some option (such as drop a token in the second column), then the server plays that move and emails the other player the new game board and allows them to make a move, or if it is against the computer it will make its move and reply back to the player the new game board.\n\n2) This idea I am actually currently testing out in development...basically, you receive an email with a map and some options. You reply to the email with the option you wish to perform, and then it will send you the updated game map/state, where you can make another move. The actual idea here is based on the older text-based Star Trek game for the Altair computer. So essentially you are traversing a galaxy or world in search of materials and fending off foes.\n\n3) The regular text adventure. Emails simply contain your current position/surroundings and possible options. You then reply the action you wish to do, and the server will run that option and then send you the updated text and wait for you to make another move. So essentially Zork or something, but through emails.\n\n\nThis idea of email-based games is probably pretty simple security-wise as well. For example, accounts can simply be indexed by the email address of the sender. So if you get an email from John's email address, then you can (probably) safely assume it is John, or someone with safe access to his email account, anyways, and not have to worry about passwords or anything."
4p8cly,Probably been thought of before,Note: this will sound like supernatural\nYou start by making your character.  It opens with a first person look at a newspaper.  You are looking for strange occurrences.  When you spot one you go out and drive till you find the location.  When you get there you load up with gear from your trunk and begin hunting whatever monster it is.  You have to separate real monsters from serial killers and animal attacks.  If it isn't a monster you will have to deal with the police or others and will be penalized
4p7t0x,A Common Sense Horror Game,"I had a small idea for a Horror game that parodied those old slasher flicks where the main cast were the dumbest human beings on the planet.  \n\nIn the game it would cover a lot of the clichés of those movies of old,  5 (or more) idiot teens in a ""Haunted"" house (or cabin or wherever the heck you want)  with a crazy murderous psycho with some dumb name or lethal gimmick.   \n\nThe Objective would be simple, survive and get out of the house with as many of your group as possible. \n\nThe best possible outcomes would be those made with can only be called ""Common Sense"".   Everyone I can think of has nit picked horror movies to bitz saying the cast should do this, or that, or whatever.   \n\nFor example: You will get the option to split up the group at some point (or several points maybe).  Obviously, in a horror movie, once people split up they get killed 1 by 1 right?.  Well, instead you can just say, No, no one split up.   increasing yours odds of getting all 5 people out alive. \n\nThe Common Sense choices would not be immediately apparent (again, you gotta use your common sense as the characters have none in a horror setting).   \n\n\nAnother example:\nOne of the teens has stunned the psycho (through some means) in the garage?  Do you escape through the dog door? just open the normal door and run to the rest of the group? try to climb through a small window above the washer/dryer? open the garage door normally and run that way? or grab a weapon in the garage and beat the psycho into a pulp?\n\nThese options would not be blatantly obvious, only the ""bad/horror movie"" choices would be insanely obvious, perhaps even glowing ""click me"" obvious, but If done you can escape or potentially ""win"" right then and there. \n\n\nObviously the game can end quickly with a series of ""Common Sense"" choices.   But I believe the ""highest score"" could be achieved by getting all of the cast out in 1 piece and getting to safety the absolute quickest. \n\n\nThe game could be gorey if only to hold true to the horror movies it parodies with a great many ways for the idiot cast to die.     \n\nIts not much but I think it would be entertaining to some.  Opinions and thoughts. \n"
4p6omn,physics based backpack game mechanic for VR games focused on realism,"example - player wants to put in his empty leather backpack a can of bean soup he found, so he will enter backpack mode, in which his backpack will be in front of him on the ground, after opening it, backpack will have colision detection mesh inside it, so player can drop the can of beans inside of it, which will colide with it, and any other objects inside. This will require accurate collision detection which would take a lot of resources. So after closing the backpack, all objects inside can be frozen along with collision mesh, and now will no longer require any collision detection, until next time backpack is open. This will enable player to interact with a backpack same way as in real life, it will be intuitive."

4p53qe,[Request]Need to make a game to help users choose more healthy product in order to control Obesity,"Obesity is a serious problems now a days. I want to make a game to educate people about choosing products which have low contents (like calorie, fat etc) to control obesity.\n\nI want to design a grocery store app where customer selects some products and there will a pop up according to choosen product.\n\nFor example if he/she choses coke, A pop up will appear with the calorie, fat and Caffeine contents of the product and what are the recommended contents of these and also the effects of this.

4p5167,First/Third person pool game,I have had a idea to create a billiards puzzle type game. The player would have to solve the puzzles to get the balls in the holes. The twist is  that the game is played from the perspective of the ball. I would be also adding VR support as its a bit of a passion of mine. \nI would like to get peoples feelings and/or feed back of this idea.
4p46qr,Story idea for horror game with a different approach,"A few weeks ago I was playing with the idea of writing a fantasy book series and started creating and imagining different parts of my world. It didn't take long for me to think about ghosts/demons and other such creatures. Im gonna try and translate into english:\n\n**quotation from my actual notes**\n\nGhosts, Demons, Curses and Ethereal Beings are all part of one big group of creatures. They are all created with the powerful last words of mortal beings. In my studies, I have found that the more magical potential the dying specimen had, the more complexicity the resulting ""creatures"" have. Emotions would also play a huge part in the creation of such structures, as the more emotional pain or suffering the creator exhibits the more twisted and evil the resulting structures seem to behave.\n\nGhosts (as I now will call all these structures) will never be visible to any non-magical being. My experiments have shown that they almost exclusively exist as an anomaly in the magical field comparable to certain structures in the ocean currents, even though they can and will manipulate objects and subjects in the physical world. However, the most complex beings that are created as ghosts can indeed materialise into the physical world, but the evidence suggests that this process uses up a tremendus amount of energy and might cost these beings their immortality. \n\n""But how do we catagorize these ghosts?"" some readers might ask themselves now. Well, I have encountered and observed hundreds upon hundreds of different ghosts and I found that we can line them up perfectly in a diagram that counts the magical potential of its origin creature on one axis and the amount of emotional stress on the other axis. \nWith rising magical complexity I have named these structures as follows: \n\n* Curses (despite their name, there can also be good intentions for a curse\n\n* Appearances\n\n* Ghosts (I have named them ghosts because these creatures come the closest to the popular beliefs and thoughts about what ghosts are) \n\n* Ethereal Beings\n\nWith rising emotional energy I've labeled the creatures with the following attributes:\n\n* twisted\n\n* evil\n\n* demonic\n\n* satanic \n\n\n*Sidenote: Since ""Satanic Ethereal Beings"" is way too long to pronounce I will call them ""Greater Evils"" from now on. In the same sense ""demonic ghosts"" will just transform to ""demons"".*\n\n**quotation end**\n\n\nHere's why I'm posting this: \nWhen I first wrote this down I thought to myself what if one of these ""Greater Evils"", be cursed so he could only ever move inside of one home of an innocent human/dwarf/family or what not. \nHis personality is split and on the one hand he wants to help his ""guests"", but his twisted mind also wants to torture them in the most gruesome way possible. \n**I would imagine this kind of story do really good in a sims-like game** It would be up to you to design something around this story. \n\nTo get you an idea of what I imagined such creatures were capable of: They are able to create portals to and form their own dimensions where they could have their own form and live peacefully forever, they can also twist a mortal beings minds fill them with emotions or fake memories, they can create an entire different reality in the head of a mortal, or corrupt a magician and then use his body under free command. As for power, they could potentially wipe out entire states with a single swipe of hand. In fact I had one place in my fantasy world where there was a 20 km wide crater because such a thing happened. \n"

4p3296,I honestly have no idea what this game will be called (Sci-Fi Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter),"A game with five factions, joining them have different boosts to the game (For example, a faction focused on combat-based technological advances will start with more combat related upgrades). The main goal of the shooter is to complete tasks and missions to help your faction grow and become more powerful. The five factions will be run by five beta testers (Or some other person that would know the game before others) who's job as leader is to scout out the open world (using drones,scout teams, or otherwise) and set destinations and objectives for the faction.\nThe soldiers of the faction will have a rank leveling system, with higher ranks being able to access more difficult missions. The soldiers will have a unique battle tool: The Power Pack. This pack will fuel everything, from guns to melee attacks (which could be a burst of energy from the soldier's palm) to hacking to using other equipment like jet-packs and grenades. The Power Pack would add a more strategic and realistic mechanic, as factions would have to scavenge for supplies to build generator-like upgrades to the Power Pack (which would recharge it) or (for lower ranked players) look for energy sources to drain energy from (like a dead enemy's or ally's Power Pack). Some missions would have players recover intel and blueprints that could allow the faction to access more useful upgrades. If one faction did manage to finally demolish the others, they would be congratulated, and the top 5 players with the highest rank would be the leaders of the next round's factions. The game world would be randomly generated before the next round.The game would have the leaders and they're assistants and advisers and generals make decisions that would benefit or detriment their factions (should we make these upgrades, should we go for these blueprints or recapture one of our stations, how many soldiers will defend this base) providing an experience that could open opportunities to make friends or rise in the ranks and really feel like a general!   "
4p2dsg,[Abstract] VR game (kinda horror/trippy type game),"I'm not sure if this was an idea, or a game that is already made. Ten minutes ago I looked for a sub Reddit that I could post this idea. At work when its slow I write these ideas down on a sketch pad; hope you guys enjoy, mind the horrible grammar and spelling. Hopefully its can be used to spark some great ideas from you guys and can help you thing of some awesome ideas.\n\nSo here's the Game; a game where  you are viewing from the eyes of the main character that is living with terrible insomnia. Experiencing each day while living with it, while off any form of medication, for around 8 days. As someone who suffers from insomnia I have experienced multiple days without sleep, not to the extent of the game but roughly four days or so days; some experiences in the early game is what I have personally experienced.\n\n[ 8 days being the length of the game, every day you play through unlocks that level so you can go back and play the game from that point, this is so you don't have to sit through the first three or so days every time you want to play]\n\n* Setting= The characters house and a city, haven't put much thought into what city it should be based off of, could be completely unique, just a typical city environment.  \n\n* mechanics= one of those games where you can't really do much other than experience what is going on in the world, Music helps shape the world as you see it, the longer you play through it, the more warped the game gets and the more visually pleasing and horrifying the setting of the ""world"" becomes\n* When ever I am having an episode, music seems to make things better; but I have had it turn on me and make things change, not terribly but it makes my imagination warp what I see, which is where this idea comes from.\n\n**These are just level designs i though up of and I'm going to post them because if gives a better view of how I thought the game could play through, take all this with a grain of salt or just ignore**\n\nDay 1-3 are slow, these days will go by much faster than the other ones\n\n* Day 1: focus's on setting up story, you wake up from sleeping in the morning and basically it fast forward throughout the day. Showing the player the character's everyday routine. You Start to play the character right before he goes to bed, only it seems he's out of sleep medicine, its going to be a sleepless night. This will set up controls and mechanics of the game (big mechanic [only one i really thought of] is the phone and music.) \n\n    *  Music will play a really big role in this game later on towards the later days    \n\n* Day 2 starts up after the sun rises from day one; the only thing you gain from this day is that you find out he made a phone call to get more medicine. Game Resumes with day fast forwarded to night time. This time you start hear the noises of the house, (they become more prevalent throughout the game) nights become a little spooky and the main character is noticeably at unease about the noises he hears, constantly raising his head to check around his room.\n\n* Day three: find out that the doctor has to reschedule your appointment to next week; fast forward to the night time (some visuals on the average day going by very fast but the player can visibly see how the days are getting harder for the character to function, player is starting to get paranoid) Third night you start to become more paranoid, the sounds of the house are becoming louder, as if someone is in the house with you. You don't visibly see anything as the player but music will sound as if you are about to catch someone (typical horror music) \n\n* Day 4-6 starts to get into the main mechanic of the game and you get to experience, the music. You make a phone call once again to the doctor. This time you are very angry; doctor tells you to check the mail he sent some experimental drugs that might help with the sleeping problem. He also suggest him calm down and listen to some music, shower, get something to drink/eat; take care of everything you possible can. Before you leave you check the mail and there is medicine there, without reading the bottle you take one in hopes it will make you tired throughout the day (you can clearly see on bottle it says dont take and be in sunlight) .You take his advice, fast forwards to the train station (he takes on into the city where he works). \n\n    * You as the player are sitting down on the train, and remember the doctor said to play some music to calm you down, so you do. Now as the player you have a selection of different genre's of music to choice from, each one will affect the game so try and play through it with a bunch of different genre's each play through. The Music will start to affect the surroundings. \n\n* Each day getting more and more visually enjoyable to the player, depending on the genre of music it will be differ per selection. Each day you end up play a little more of the walk to work, day 4 is stops once the train stops; day 5 is to the doorstep at work walking a block or two in the city, and day 6 is right into the office; going up an elevator and walking hallways and what not (day 6 having the most visual affects to the outside world and game) At night the pills seem to have no effect, you just lay in bed with headphones on, nothing happens at night day 4-6 [at this point i'm not really sure what could happen, haven't through it that far through, maybe some cool things with night time stars and music making the night sky look trippy and what not]\n\n* Day 7 is the last day of medication that you got in the mail, and the last day before your appointment. As the sun rises, you roll over in your bed knowing you have to start your day; as you roll over in the corning of your eye you see something it was fast but you are positive you saw something. \n\n    * for anyone who doesn't know after 6/7 days without sleep you can start to hallucinate.\n* welcome to the last like visually aesthetic level of the game, also you cannot choice the music you play today; it will automatically choice for you. Personally i'd like to think it be anything by [Paper Chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4cLlTtpLI4) because their music is exposed to be creepy and will make the walk go by fairly slow and very 2spooky5you, but that is unlikely the case due to legal issues and what not. The whole way this level is set up is to apply the music aspect of the game and the newly discovered hallucinations, you can visibly see more paranoia from the character, constantly checking over your shoulder, while having the world almost crumble beneath you (kinda like how the world in inception started to warp) while seeing these horrid creatures stair at you/ come at you.  You ask for a ride home from work from a co-worker, car ride home you look see these beings from the window.\nNight time for this will turn into a horror-esk game. As you lay down the phone you usually use throughout the day is dead, needs to be charged; can't find your headphones due to how hard it is to navigate the home with the hallucinations. Night time the goal is to get your headphones and make it back to your bed (you can use a phone while its charging) As you maneuver the house you have to experience the world around you start to warp and deteriorate, while having eyes on the wall watch you, things watching you at every corner, things chase you (or seem like they are). It should take around like 20~30 minutes to get through this level or something like that, not sure how long vr games should be, hopefully that is long enough.\n\n* Day 8 is you getting a phone call from the doctor, you beg and plead he makes a house call, he agrees and will take some time to get there, luckily you as a player only wait like 2 minutes due to the lack of time perception (which is a thing that happens with me, idk if that is the professional name for it) you also called out of work. You finally get the medication, and this time its a higher prescription because of the lack of sleep you have had, luckily you don't have work the following day. Right before the game ends you take a look in the mirror before you take the pills, besides the fact you looks terrible, you can see the monsters in the back of the mirrors, the character is making direct eye contact through the mirror, you take the pill and head off towards the room. This is meant to be kinda the relief of the game, knowing at the end you are no longer phased by the night you had before you are taking your meds. this takes you to the credits yada yada yada, now you get to select what you get to play by the day, this is so you can experience the days 4-6 again with different genre's of music, each day having different visuals with each genre. \n\nHope you guys like the idea, I thought it was kinda neat as a VR game; sorry again about the spelling and grammar ill try to clean it up as best as possible, not the best of writers. and sorry its so long.\n "

4ovcoh,Modern Political Strategy Game,"Hi everybody,\n\nToday I like to present you my idea for a modern political strategy game that I hope to develop one time in my life. Once I played a very light version of it with friends on a Paint-edited map and with Excel and it made fun. \n\nYou take the seat as head of state of a nation - in our earlier game it was a state in Middle East - and you are governing the nation, care about the economy, diplomacy and the army. You set your own goals if you want to increase the wealth of your people, become a progressive state, turn a nation into a democracy or upside down or if you want to conquer other nations.\n\nUnlike other games I want to focus more on diplomacy than war and want to see a more realistic economy with realistic markets. A war would mean destroyed infrastructures and problems with getting money to upkeep your nation. And the economy reacts on your actions. Warmongering let them fear and probably move to other countries. Higher taxes will keep them away, low taxes will entice them.\n\nAlthough war should be less present in the game it still plays a part and will be tactical. If you are attacking a nation, you may want to destroy the enemy's power plants and prepare for a planned air attack. Or you destroy some factories. \n\nDomestic policy is about managing multiple ethnies, religions and requirements. The virtual people isn't fixed to your nation, but can migrate. And it doesn't forget. If you are raising taxes too much or too often, they will not forget, but may think about supporting the opposition.\n\nThis is just a brief description of the idea, but shows where it could go to. And as you have seen, similar games or role-models could be Europa Universalis, Geopolitical Simulator and similar games."
4ouxtf,[Request] Ideas for text adventure game?,"I'm looking for some ideas for a text adventure game, the more unique the better! "
4ost1h,A game too big to make.," This is a game concept that I hope someone will make or acknowledge, which is almost too big for me to finish writing, but I'll add on whenever.\nAnd this is the thing, I have no video game design experience. I'm not looking for how to make the game, I'm looking for how to make this concept better so someone else can make it or get inspired by it. Thanks. :)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nPLOT: You are one, small, primitive developing nation on a planet of your design. Your peoples ethics, race, morals, government, religion, edicts, laws, bans, industry and more, are determined by you. The ships and tanks and planes you make (as well as space-ships yo) are by your design, even down to the guns and armor you issue to your military. The world you explore is hostile, literally infinite (yes I mean that) and wants you burned to ash. Every second your nation stands a thousand wars are being waged across the universe, and you are guaranteed to be a part of it. \n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nLORE: (This, or write your own) After decades of war, your home-world is ravaged by war and corruption. As a child, these were the memories you lived with, dirt-poor, no job, no family, all lost in conflict, you aspire to be better than the rest. You grow up, in a shanty town filled with misfits and criminals, even some unlucky relocated citizens, moved by the corrupt military-centered dictatorship you fall willing to obey every day. You have had enough, you take what friends and tools you have and assemble a dis-organized ragtag rebellion that plans to shut down the regime you are controlled by. After several years of conflict, the military cant handle such a large group of citizens, you have assembled many from across the city, even the planet, and the dis-organization leads to strategic and random strikes at the governments heart, crumbling the politicians morale. In later years to follow with you at the helm, you do it. Take your city back, and you are chosen leader of your world. (This is where the game comes into play, and customization begins. Once customization is finished, your planet stats are determined by your government, attributes, and traits.) (Your planet could in-fact be worse than the tyrannical regime you saved it from if you somehow manage.)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nMECHANICS: Very RTS driven, like commanding fleets, squads, planets and nations, as well as resource management and tech tiers, with some RPG elements like perks for governors or scientists and builders. Strategy elements with Continental Conflicts like base-building and squads as well as space fleets to take, destroy, or colonize planets that are or aren't inhabited. There are five different types of battles that can and will occur: Continental, Planetary, Space Conflict, Galaxy Conflict, and Inter-dimensional Conflict, with this opening up even more universes to conquer or unite. (These will be explained after this. Planet management is also a big thing, keeping your peoples morale up will prevent them from killing or overthrowing your politicians and destroying structures you build.) Continental Conflicts are two or more continents, (or the whole planet if its solid) pitting against different peoples governments and armies, you can also ally with some. Planetary Conflict is two or more entire planets fight each-other through drop-ships with troops and vehicles, and spacecraft. Galaxy Conflict is two or more factions, (A faction is a group operated under one ruler with the same government, but each planet has its own army the AI or player makes. You must have at least 10 AI or player controlled planets to be allied with you to create a faction.) fight against each-other  across the galaxy for dominance over it. Once conquered, there will always be rebels and separatists fighting you no matter what. Inter-Dimensional Conflict is an event once you have conquered enough galaxies that a rift in space opens, creating a extremely powerful empire that will crush you, the empire has its targets set on you, but it starts very far away. It will demolish every planet in its way. Once and if miraculously somehow you defeat it, you obtain rift tech, which allows you to either start the event over, (except a lot harder) or enter a new universe with different races, planets, and more.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nCUSTOMIZATION: This section is heavily inspired from Stellaris. Create your own custom race with traits, attributes, government type, the look and name of your race as well as the type of planet and a name of that planet. All of these choices affect your battles, diplomacy, and other things. You can customize the themes of your flag, weapons, vehicles, as well as the color scheme. The attributes and traits you have and choose for your race cost Points. (Creative name I know ._.) These points are base 6. You can increase these by having negative traits. You lose points from choosing positive traits. The attributes are for the personality of your government, these are both pro and con included, and one attribute comes with its opposite. (Xenophilia, Xenophobia) Attributes use attribute points. (Another original name) The base attribute points are 3, and cannot be increased. There are three different types of attribute, minor, moderate, and fanatic. (Fanatic basically means the edicts you start with cannot be changed no matter what, which depends on the government you choose and the attributes.)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nCOMBAT: With the 5 different settings of battles comes the actual conflict and units. The actual units are of your design, like Spore, you choose different hull parts and they add to your armor and health points, (Health is the internal of your unit, Armor is the thickness of the material and how much damage it soaks up, and yes, you can research different materials.) and the weapons add to your damage and combat stats. The more weight you have on a unit, the slower it goes, the more wheels/thrusters you have on a unit, the faster it goes, but takes more power. (Power is created by reactor cores of which you can research, these create power at the cost of efficiency and weight, and they power electric components.) (Efficiency is determined by your engine and fuel type, as well as how much power to weight distribution is being balanced, too much weight means your burning fuel and going no-where, too much power means you guzzle fuel faster and lose efficiency.) Electric components decrease efficiency when activated, so by having machinery, (like machine-guns, propelled by gunpowder) you save power, at the cost of hull damage. Here are examples of the balancing and description of weapons; Gunpowder Casing Weapons (ie Machine-guns, Cannons, AA Guns, etc.) Magnet Propelled Weapons; (ie Auto-cannons, Rail-guns, Shotguns) Rocket Propelled Weapons; (ie Missiles, (guided) Rockets, (un-guided) Nukes, Strategic Bomb) and Energy Weapons: (Plasma Weapons, Laser Weapons, EMP, Shard Guns, Force &amp; Magnet Guns, and Hull Drain). These are the pro-con stats: Gunpowder; ++ Efficiency - Damage. Magnet; - Efficiency + Damage. Rocket; -- Efficiency ++ Damage. Energy Weapons; --- Efficiency ++ Damage (And special modifiers of AP values and EMP)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nAI: The AI that will work in the game is not an AI that just thinks, ""OH, THERE'S THE PLAYER! ASSEMBLE AN ARMY AND MURDER THEM!"". The AI would be an adaptive machine that witnesses your journey and responds to it based on the traits and attributes they have, as well as government. (So if a pacifist government witnesses you purge another race they may hate or fear you, and tell other empires of your actions.) The AI would base interactions, like trade and communication, as well as goods you sell, on their judgement. (If an empire hates you, it could buy for a very low price, or not at all, and the other way if they love you. They won't attack you just for the sake of excitement, either you start war or they do.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nUNITS: (Each unit has a class of Light, Medium, and Heavy, so Tiers 1, 2, 3, like Supreme Commander.) INFANTRY: Conscript, Rifleman, MG Crew, Engineer (and combat variant at T3), Flamethrower, Sniper, Scout, Artillery Crew, Infiltrator, Armored Troop, Missile Troop, Anti-Air Troop, Anti-Tank Troop, Grenadier, Diplomat, and a special troop unique to the faction, and more. LAND VEHICLES: Regular Tank, Missile/Rocket Vehicle, Anti-Air Vehicle, Anti-Tank Vehicle, Anti-Infantry Vehicle, Mech, Amphibious Vehicles, Subterranean Vehicles, Stealth Vehicles, Base Expander, Hover-Tank, Railgun Tank, Vehicle Repairer, EMP Vehicle, APC (Troop Transport) MG Buggy, a Super-Tank, and more.\nSEA VEHICLES: \n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nMORE TO COME - LEAVE SUGGESTIONS BELOW / / / Honestly, thanks for reading this far, give me some constructive \ncriticism. :)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nAnd P.S to Saki_Sliz: (love ya man) Thanks for all the support, your a real nice guy.

It's game play is similar to Nuclear Throne or Enter the Gungeon, with the ability to move and shoot in all directions. It's a multiplayer  shooter with 5v5 battles. Weapons have limited ammo &amp; need to be reloaded, ammo can be found on corpses. The two teams fighting each other are both raiders fighting for resources. Oh yeah, and there's a dodge roll, but it has a cool down."

4jxz86,Need ideas to make a 'Drug Wars' kind of game more interesting!,"Hey everyone,\n\nSo i just started working on a game where you buy and sell drugs in order to go from small dealer to drug lord. Currently the game is in a very early state (you can buy and sell 4 kinds of drugs, make profit (or not), and that's pretty much it).\n\nI'd like to get some ideas to make the game more fun! I am currently adding random events that trigger at the end of each day, like police raids where you lose drugs (but you can bribe the police if you think it's worth it)...\n\nI am planning to add a way to recruit subordinate dealers, they buy and sell drugs automatically (using thresholds set by the player) but they keep a part of the profit and have a chance to snitch, or run away with money or drugs. Ultimately I want the game to feel like you're managing a drug empire.\n\nI think there should be some sort of goal system, any ideas are welcome!\n\nHere's a downloadable demo (just to show the core gameplay):\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dfq86tnv48prfas/main.exe?dl=0\n\nThanks everyone :)\n\nPS: sorry if it isn't the right sub for that"

4jmtmq,2D action combat game revolved around killing enemies to learn about them and become them.,"I've got back into learning to program in c++. I have been doing alot of design around an action rpg that way out of my grasp for a starting project in c++ so i decided to start brainstorming a simpler game.\n\nThe main premise is playing as a synthetic/mechanical being that has a soul mission to kill and understand its enemies. The player has access to a list of drives, one for each enemy type and as a the player kills enemies of a type, that drives gains experience, unlocking different tiers.\n\nThe player can have on his person a set number of drives and only one can be equipped at a time. An equipped drive gives the player stat increases, a special weapon with a passive ability and maybe a strong active that has a long cooldown. the abilities and stat increases scale with the tier that drive has. \n\nThe game is focused around combat. In a fight, a player can block, roll, jump, light attack, heavy attack, and probably some other things. I'm hesitant on allowing the player to switch drives while in combat, forcing a state where the player has to choose wisely which drive to use. \n\nThoughts? suggestions, I'm forgetting some other ideas but this is the main premise. I also need to locate 2d (over top) sprite art for a game that has a wide selection of enemy sprites for placement art. thanks for reading!"

The axis control most cities and you have to either play as the axis and hold your ground against the oncoming Allies fighting to regain these cities. The battles will continue as cities are taken and lost. With the amount of players on a Planetside server makes it feel like a real war going on. By making you continually fight for cities makes it more interesting than just fighting for a checkpoint and gives you an opportunity for more action and memorable moments.\n\nAlso not every server should be battling in Europe, some should be in Africa and others on the Eastern front.\n\n\n"
4jkpmo,"Game Idea, looking for elaboration: Secret Passageways game","One of my favorite games growing up was a PC title by Sierra called ""Stay Tooned"". The premise was you were in a hotel watching TV when a mischievous group of cartoon characters manages to break out of the TV and starts wreaking havoc on the real world. Your objective is to explore the various rooms and floors of the hotel, point and click style, in order to find the remote so you can zap all the toons back to where they belong. \n\nWhat I loved about this game is how much mystery and exploration there is. You never know what could be behind the next door/picture/elevator etc. It was absolutely chock full of minigames, characters, events, worlds that were completely randomized every playthrough. Any door could lead to something as bland as an empty hotel room or transport you to a cartoony medieval castle where you fight toons in a ridiculous Mortal Combat parody. The game is still awesome, but obviously dated (the last OS it can actually run on was Windows 98 :p), but its kind of a dream of mine to recapture that childlike wonder that this game gave me and numerous others. \n\nSo here is my idea. A 1930's noir classic whodunit mystery that takes place in an ancient mansion absolutely chock full of secrets. I'm talking full to the freaking brim of hidden passages, panels, keys, puzzles, transdimensional transporting pictures you can jump into Mario 64 style, the works. Seriously, who didn't as a kid think there might be a secret passageway somewhere in their house? And, lets be honest, adults kind of want one too. \n\nSo, I have some ideas for a bare bones plot and puzzles, but my ideas kind of stop here for the most part. Where do you think this could go? What kind of puzzles do you think would be fun for a premise like this? Would you be interested in working on a project like this?"

4jhbzq,Police chase game where you're safe if you make it home,"Here's a driving game idea that is pretty simple and absurd:\n\nYou're on the side of the road, just pulled over by a cop. You take off speeding and the round begins. Now cops are trying to ram you and explode your car. If you can make it back to your garage safely, you win!\n\nHere are some details that may make this idea fun, unique, or simple enough to try:\n\n- Every time you cause damage (hit another car or a building), a new cop spawns. So by the end of a round, you might have a swarm of exploding cars chasing you.\n- The instant you touch your garage door, it should slam shut behind you and all the pursuing police smash into it and explode themselves. Basically every round ends in chaos.\n- If a police car doesn't hit you hard enough (below a certain speed and angle) it should push or steer you away instead of instant explosions.\n- This core idea can easily be themed. It's just driving to a safe spot on the map. Maybe you're a regular joe running from a speeding ticket. Or a getaway driver making it to the rendezvous point. Or you're delivering a donor organ in an unmarked car. Or pizza delivery. The whole game could be one theme, or each level different.\n\nI'm marking this as Intermediate. Here's what the project might involve.\n\n- Minimal art assets: hero car, cop car, low poly city blocks, explosion animation\n- Nice to have art assets: small variety of civillian vehicles, city obstacles (dumpsters, construction, lamps, hydrants, etc)\n- Code challenges: steering/driving, collision detection, swarming/pathfinding."

4jecns,Massively multiplayer paint where conflicts of painting over somebody else's pixels are won by amount of compute time automatically put into it,"Why do people like to graffiti? Is it rebelling of painting over something else? Is it that many others will see it in such a public place? What if we could graffiti with conflicts won between stronger actions of automatic computing in p2p networks?\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, conflicts are solved by proofOfWork. Whoever has their computer spend the most time automatically solving math puzzles (which people just wait on it to do) has more influence in the network.\n\nIn this massively multiplayer paint game, if you want to paint bigger areas, you have to spend that much compute time, so most players will want to zoom into smaller areas to paint, and hope others look the same place, or tell them about it by painting the coordinates other places or linking in social networks.\n\nPaint anything you want, and strengthen it with more computing time so more people see it. If you choose a small enough area at random and paint there, you're likely to hold that area for a long time, but if you're greedy and try to paint something everyone can see zoomed all the way out, you might have to rent a computing grid, so we are probably safe from that on such a large scale.\n\nThe only way anyone can erase what you paint is by spending more computing time on pixels that differ from yours in the same place.\n\nThe default is everything transparent, so theres no color, maybe seen as randomly changing colors, so you can see where nobody has painted or where theres conflicts in process of seeing who will win those areas for the time."

4j9btq,The Birth of a Lich - A game about fulfilling every human's fantasy.,"**Name:** The Birth of a Lich\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* Every human being has at some point thought about getting powers and then getting revenge on everyone who wronged you. This is that in game form, with lichdom being the powers granted.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou are a wimp boy who is bullied to shit and mentally unstable. You get locked in an abandoned building and find a book of necromancy. Over an arbitrary period of time you learn more dark magic than you'll ever need, then finally have enough power to become a lich and confront everyone openly.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nA small town where everybody knows each other. \n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Ross, the main character, a boy of little strength or stamina.\n\n* A group of bullies who regularly kick your ass. Very stupid and easily lured into trouble.\n\n* The typical girl love interest, narcissistic and manipulates you with lies. \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The slave you get from a corpse varies wildly depending on location, what the person was in life, and the necromancer's emotions towards the person in question.\n\n* There is a slow wanted level of sorts that advances throughout the game, though the area has a limited supply of forces. It goes kids &gt; adults &gt; police &gt; military &gt; national threat. \n\n* Spells are based on combinations of resources. Like to see far away you need eyeballs of various organisms. To apply force you need limbs. To raise from the dead you need bone dust or blood. You have to choose between slaves or spells.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Lichdom and necromancy automatically make it one of the most original games there is. \n\n* Instead of interfaces, things are handled mostly automatically with realism and magic. \n\n* You get to play the epitome of evil in a non-cheesy way. \n\n* You can choose to not advance at all. Leave the book in the building, work out, and use persistence and intelligence to get revenge.\n\n* Switch between RTS and FPS. RTS controls minions and FPS casts spells. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC, this list of features really wouldn't work on consoles.\n\n* The fundamental lich idea could be easily adapted to any platform.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* A lot of dialogue that is based a lot on expressing anger. Passive aggressiveness, insults, insane threats, etc.\n\n* Play with souls for sadistic purposes or to get what you want. \n\n* Your voice, appearance, and dialogue options change as you advance through the stages of necromancy.\n\n* The option to hilariously throw down your staff and beat people with your fists, a satisfying bone crack with each punch.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nI couldn't give a shit about money or fame, the game's very existence is already far more than I deserve."

4i7g5e,Space Western Game...would you play this?,"It would be an Rpg AND top down\n\nThe story would be set in a space western/dystopian western US much like Mad Max/Trigun. You'd play a human turned cyborg who's protecting his daughter, she's part of a small group of people who are still completely human, which flesh is highly sought after. \n\nThe game would be broken down into multiple STATIC cities, each city having its own weapon dealer, You would have to take care of your daughter, but in order to feed her you'd need to earn money by taking jobs offered by npc's and completing procedurally generated areas with a boss at the end. \n\nThe jobs would involve delivering packages to mowing down hordes of enemies and other variations. You'd be able to pick jobs from saving innocents which doesn't pay a lot, to being hired by local crime bosses to kill innocents or claim protection money for a ton of money to be able to take care of your daughter. \n\nDuring the gun fights, it could be an isometric bullet hell OR something like Hotline Miami with a combo system with guns. By completing the procedurally created areas you'd be able to pick up abilities, for example ""HeartBreaker"" would render the main character unable to move for a few seconds while he shoots ALL enemies on the screen but consuming 1/4 health TO being able to absorb damage, and then whatever damaged absorbed would be shot back at the enemy. \n\nYou'd move from city to city defeating bosses. You'd meet characters and make friends who'd provide ""assists"" during combat like jumping in shooting a barrage and then hopping out, you have a limited number of assists and be able to combo off of them. Higher the combo the more experience you'd get. \n\nYou would have to manufacture your own ammunition from resources found in procedurally generated open wilderness areas. May even be able to buy guns by using ammunition as currency from the weapons dealer. \n\nSo what do you think, what would you change/add?\n\n\n"

We would not wanted to wasted the capability of vr.

4i56nl,Supervillain: Roguelike,"Sort of a spitball idea I've always wanted to see a video game of, pretty much your standard top down beat-them-up game where you can upgrade moves, specialise in certain powers, etc, like Gauntlet, except covering a city rather than a dungeon.\n\nYour goal is to survive police, superheroes, whilst looting people and bank interiors of money, represented as piles of paper money.\n\nYou use money to purchase upgrades, such as increased speed, certain abilities, improving abilities, and so on. The game has a timer on each play, during which the difficulty slowly ramps up from when you first cause havoc. \n\nSo rob a bank, and remain unscathed by the police? \n\nWell, you better hurry up, since the capes are going to come in 10 minutes, and you'll be needing upgrades to face them! And the guys beyond them. And beyond them. And so on, until you're unstoppable.\n\nPretty much trying to take the Roguelike genre, like Binding of Isaac and Rogue, etc, and apply it onto a New-York inspired city level, where streets are the dungeon tunnel equivalents, building interiors are one room, etc.\n\nMain thing I'm thinking is that there isn't really an end-game if this were more than just a dream. You beat heroes, you unlock the upgrades... And then what?\n\nPresumably, at some point, you need to actually 'win' and take over the city or something, unless the game's a moralistic one, where no matter what you can only upgrade so far and eventually the heroes will be too much to beat?\n\n\nNot sure how feasible this is, so flaring it as 'dream'."

4i3fmc,My Idea Is For Dinosaur Survival Game,"The ultimate goal would be to survive and reproduce. You would start as either a herbivore or carnivore. When you first begin you would have to play as a smaller predator or prey.  You would be a baby and would have to eat and grow. Eventually you would be mature enough to reproduce and would ""win"" by passing on your genes, although you could continue playing as desired.\n\nAs a predator you'd have to start out feeding on lizards and you'd have to grow and work your way up to other small dinosaurs. The way to unlock other dinosaurs as a predator would be to kill and eat other dinosaurs. If one is injured attacking another dinosaur you would sustain that wound and it would impact further game play. There would be no ""magic healing"" and you could be stuck with a limp. You would need to sleep and drink as well as eat. \n\nAs a herbivore your main goal would be to avoid or defeat predators. This would be how you would unlock new predators, by either defending yourself or successfully running away. So to unlock predators you'd have to play as herbivores and vice versa. \n\nI would want the game to be as scientifically accurate as long as it doesn't deter game play. This would mean no T-Rexes, Velociraptors, or Stegosauruses together, as they are either from different parts of the world or separate eras. As a bonus maybe you could play as a pterosaur. There could even be underwater gameplay with plesiosuars, ichthyosaurs, and mosasaurs. Multiplayer could be possible but may be hard to implement, I am open to discussion."

He has a fear of spiders so his parents are obvi humans with 8 legs with eight feet. And as you walk down the hall they scurry by the player, climb the ceiling etc. He doesn't have a sister but there's a teen girl that tends to follow behind him or open doors to slow him down. She'd also try and steal the bear so (BUTTON MASHING! also dog will try and take the bear too.....#morebuttonmashing). Upgrades include different pajamas which have different abilites. Some attacks may cause bear light to flicker and or shut off immediately...which then (button mash) to get the bear to work again. Sometimes....the bear just won't turn on yes you lose. Or the player could run back to the room to get another bear. In any case where the player is stuck near the steps leading to the first floor.

4i22po,Post-Apocalyptic Setting with neither zombies nor nukes (or Fallout from the Thirties),"We all know that the Fallout game are as much a period piece about a specific time in US history as there are a vehicle for allowing you to enact your dream of being Mad Max in an abandoned World Expo. Fallout is immersed in the 1950s, it’s culture, technology, world view and vision of the future. But it’s worth pointing out that the end of the world didn’t start with the creation of the A-Bomb.\n\nBefore people say anything in the comments I should acknowledge the sources for my thinking:\na)	Fallout (of course)\nb)	The 1936 British Sci-fi film “Things to Come” (spoiler alert: it’s not very good but it’s on Youtube if you want to see for yourself)\nc)	The 2002 game Iron Storm (again, it’s not the best)\nImagine you’re living in 1953 and you’re trying to imagine the future and how it might collapse. You’d probably end up with something like Fallout. Now try and imagine thinking this 20 or 30 years earlier. You don’t have Hiroshima and the Cold War and if you’re writing this in the 1920s you might not have much idea about economic collapse or the rise of fascism. But you do have the First World War, which has only just ended, so you don’t necessarily need fantastically destructive bombs to imagine a world in which a great and terrible war grinds on for no real reason until eventually everything collapses from exhaustion. The world is a cross between Flash Gordon and Passchendaele. \nSo here’s the basic plot: It’s not quite the end. Central government exists but it has been hollowed out by the constant war to the extent that it is nothing more some terrible child catcher that snatches people away to serve in its war, a war it no longer has the ability to do anything with but which it refuses to walk away from. You, the hero of the story, are trying to rebuild your life in the shattered remains of some town where live is slowly beginning again when said army grabs you and packs you off to the trenches, though once you’re there it is too disorganised and dysfunctional to prevent you from wandering off and that’s where our story begins. \nWhether this war is a new thing or, perhaps, a continuation of the Great War long after the original participants and countries have left the stage is open for debate. Personally I’ve always had an idea for an eternal world war 1 in which the western allies are nothing more than a junta and the central powers are simply one massive Cult of Hindenburg crossed with the states that emerged from Alexander the Great’s empire. But if people think that’s stupid, or too similar to what Iron Storm was trying to do (and I’m happy to talk about the good and bad things it attempted to do with the plot in my humble opinion) then let me know. \n"
4i06ku,Superhero/Supervillian game idea,"OK so here goes,\n\nThe game will be part, Rpg, part clicker and some online functionality and 2D isometric graphics\n\nSo you'd start with the ability to pick from 25 Superheroes (number maybe smaller at first and might grow over time) \n\nYou'll start with your own hub world (say an apartment) and you may be able to upgrade to a larger hub world with the gold you receive as you progress.\n\nAll heroes will have different base stats, different kinds of heroes have different abilities. Very simple. \n\nFrom the hub world you'd be able to complete story missions as well as maybe procedurally generated dungeons and have a boss at the end of it and you'd level up your chosen Hero.\n\nSOME bosses/boss-type may be extremely difficult to beat and may require more health packs or for you to learn a new skill, this is where the clicker aspect would come in, you'd fight thugs, gangsters etc (defeating an enemy would give you x amount of experience and money and after defeating x amount of enemies you get a new skill). \nYou may also recruit ""sidekicks or minions"" who would help you farm items, money, experience. \n\nAfter achieving enough items/experience you'd go back to the boss and defeat it gaining a passive skill boost, rarer items (in game trophies maybe), the chance of dropping cosmetic items, unlock the next part of the story or even insta-upgrading your hub world (Some sort of big reward I haven't really thought about) \n\n(Maybe even including some sort of farming aspect in the hub world) \n\nThe online aspect would be something (MOBA-esque) where ALL Hero stats would be equalized and the level you've reached in the main portion would be transferred online as well as the passive buffs. \n\nBut it may increase the scope of the initial product so may be able to add this through updates/patches.\n\nI do understand the scope of the project. If broken down the game is doing basic math to keep track of all stats and items...I just need someone who can draw!\n\nAnyways, any criticisms, changes and suggestions would be appreciated greatly. \n"
4hz74n,Cube Maze game- Looking for ideas [request],"Im in the process of creating a game and I want there to be a maze scenario similar to the cube movies, however unlike the cube movies (SPOILER ALERT) I dont want it to require the skills of an autistic savant to solve the puzzle.  \n\n\nFor those unaware of the cube movies, the idea is you are in a large rubix cube style maze, where each cube is a room and you have to move from cube to cube to get to the end of the maze.\n\n\n In the movies the cubes shift around however i dont want to add that aspect to my game. So no seemingly random cubes shifting around.\n\n\nSo does anyone have any thoughts on what kinds of puzzle or mazes could be inmpelented in order to find your way to the exit or final cube?"
4hxn1z,Lumber Bob (somewhat of a survival game),"Ok so, this is kind of a short idea. But if I can find a developer who will help I will go in more detail. Well, the premise is that you are Lumber Bob, with a magical axe that can chop down any tree. (later on you must upgrade your axe to cut down really awesome trees) well, everything. And I mean EVERYTHING is made out of wood. Like, imagine a DLC or even just something ingame where you can make a rocket ship out of wood. Even a TV (which is the comedy in it). And, it is a semi-topdown view sort of like Grain Wars (look it up, it is made by an indie dev). And yah... that's the premise. Also there are gonna be a lot of puns and the enemies are gonna be puns. Like a Timberwolf."

4huppx,Would you play a Serial Killer Sim?,"I'm on the verge of making it myself and have thought about it for a few weeks now, but here's the idea: \n\nThe basic premise of the game would be you move into a new neighborhood, you meet your neighbors and other multitude of characters, you'd make friends with them even relationships, you'd get closer, then every night you'd get a phone call from an unknown telling you how to manipulate them and other helpful tips. \n\nConversations you have with other characters would be much like Visual Novel style with multiple answers/questions each changing the story dramatically or slightly. (The game will be first person and characters fully modeled 3D)\n\nBut when characters start to become a problem its time to kill. You'd have multiple killing methods, maybe even try to make it look like an accident,  but you'd have to wait your chance to get them alone. \n\nEach character would have their base stats and through conversation and manipulation you'd be able to change those base stats, for example, falling in love with you or outright disliking you.   \n\nOnce you've ""infiltrated"" the group you'd be invited to ""get togethers"" where you'd be able to manipulate them further while they're under the influence (bonus round almost)\n\nEvery time you restart the game the character stats would be randomized so the approach to each character would be slightly different with each play through\n\nOnce you've killed enough characters, you may be able to frame one of the characters left alive (you'd kinda have to decide that when you first meet all of the characters) any murders would be subject to police investigation. \nMurders would occur with a lot of stealth involved, i.e. breaking in. \n\nI do apologize if I rambled on a bit. Tell me what you guys think, if it this would be indeed something you'd enjoy playing multiple times. "

4hods4,Historical first-person shooter with twist,"Premise: Historical shooters are fun. Those of us old enough to remember the heyday of WW2 shooters can attest to this. There are, however, a number of issues:\n\nProblem 1: The requirement for at least a nod towards accuracy. As much as we would like a thrilling Counterstrike-clone set in the US (or even English) Civil War, muskets do not lend themselves to first person fun and games. And this is just with regards to equipment, what about setting. Wouldn’t it be cool to have the Soviets, as opposed to the Americans, doing the main bulk of the fighting against the Japanese as opposed to a few weeks at the end of the war when the game had already been up for some time.\n \nProblem 2: Disquieting morality. You may be different but every time I take the wehrmarcht to victory I am slightly unsettled by the fact that I am the shining spear of a terrible, terrible regime. Which is why a WW1 setting is more appealing in some ways because the setting is more ambiguous (wasn’t everyone as bad as each other?) but this falls down due to the requirement for mud and bolt-action rifles (see Problem 1).\n\nProblem 3: Three-Way Conflict. At some point (probably the original Starcraft or Dune) it was decided that two antagonists wasn’t enough, it needed three. Exhibit A: Planetside. However wars, at least those that aren’t civil wars, don’t then to involve three combatants. The profound differences and distrust between the western allies and the Soviet Union did not preclude them from being on the same side. Italy in WW1 had a different set of goals to the other allies, likewise Bulgaria, but she did not form her own side in the war.   \n\n(A possible) solution: Why not alternate history.\n\nNo, hear me out. I’m not proposing an alternate history WW2 as this concept has been thoroughly mined, nor some magical mythical setting in which the elves of the old woods storm the beaches of Castle Von Bumcrack, but picking a point in history that is far enough away that you can have a genuinely different world but close enough so that recognisable countries and powers can emerge (I’m not sure how much mileage you can get from the tank battles between the Roman Empire and the Scythians). Personally I have thought that a good point of divergence might be “what if Charlemagne didn’t exist?” That way you can still arguably have France and Germany if you want, China will be largely unchanged, the great Arabic empires will be around and most of the world’s major religions will exist with the notable exception of Sikhism. My initial suggestions are for a three-way battle for an island in the Caribbean between three powers:\n\n-) The Aztec Empire because they have always interested me and I’ve seen enough games were people run around with katanas to think that it would be cool with macuahuitls \n\n-) Venice or one of the other Italian maritime republics. Again, why not, and anyone whose played Medieval Total War or similar games is at least familiar with them and it grounds the scenario in something approaching reality \n\n-) This is up for debate (as is it all because it’s not like it’s going to be made) but how about….the Golden Horde? Russian soldiers being led by Mongol officers?\n\nThe Twist: Ok, so far, so conservative. We can do want we want in a vaguely 1930s setting, biplanes with jet engines, tanks on wheels etc. But how about a world in which, either because it’s not invented or because it’s been banned by international treaty, the transition to smokeless ammunition never takes place. Storming a building will rapidly create great clouds of smoke, am ambush will quickly reveal your hidden positions. This doesn’t mean that everyone has to march around in lines like in our history, camouflage is still probably useful until the firing starts and maybe wars are fought like modern multiplayer in which general objectives are set and groups of soldiers organise themselves to take it. \n\nThat’s a stupid idea: Probably, and it depends upon how accurately the smoke can be mimicked.\n\nType of game: Online multiplayer, possibly mmo but you’ve got to be realistic about this game that will never be built. \n\nAt best, another Planetside 2, but anything akin to old Battlefield 1943 is also fine. \n"
4hlz0s,An interesting thought for a mechanic of character creation,"What if you were to be asked questions about yourself or walked through your past choosing paths that shape your history.  Rather than choosing a build race and gender you are asked your sex, your parents origin, your experiences growing up.  All of this culminating in your character."
4hldwh,First Persoon Superhero Game,"So i've been thinking about this game for a while now and i wanted to get a opinion. The idea is as u can see in the title a first person view game were u get to make your own superhero. For a reference think of dc universe online. You would get to customize your own character with the type of main superpower u would want and a secondary power. There would multiple powers such as Super Strength, Super Speed, Telekinesis, Gadgets, etc. Those would be the main powers. After u pick one of the powers u would build/train up in the game to unlock fighting moves and special moves too, and u would also build upon the move/special u choose, so it would go very deep in skill customization. Appearance wise u it would probably be something like Black Desert character customization. for clothing you would be able to create your own super suit. and you would also get to pick cloths for your normal self when your not fighting crime or doing crime. To go in more deep about that this would be a online game but story driven as well. You would get to choose on what side u want to be on (Evil Or Good). The movement part of the game would have parkour elements depending on what class you chose. So if u were a heavy type guy u would jump high and far. If u were more of an acrobat u would do parkour like running on walls and climbing on ledges. Another movement type thing would be teleportation. There also would be the option to fly. Theres alot of more things i can talk about this game idea but ill just let u guys/girls dwell on the idea for a bit and tell me what you think and tell me what would be cool to add to the game. thx :)"

4heo56,a game idea i had one sleep less night,A brief explanation of what i want and some mechanics \n\nThe game is going to be 2d and pixel art and made in the game maker engine. there will be a day night cycle and health will only go back up if u go to hospital. there will be a adrenalin mechanic that will extend the fights it adrenalin points that tick down the longer the fight goes on and will drain when hit. The closer u get to the darker endings the more crazy u and every one left in the town gets.\nThe It's going to have lots of inspiration from hp lovecraft and undertale (undertale mostly in its fighting system ) what I want in this fighting system is a fight function a talk function(the talk function will be a darker take on it then undertale you'll be able to talk the person into suicide but you have to know his ticks from found knowledge also a small hint in the form of a check system )and a mercy function these will play into the ending there will be 4 2 light endings and 2 dark endings the 2 dark are the serial killer ending and the Suicide ending the light ending will be the the Suicide ending light version and the extremely hard to get dream ending also the neutral ending \n \n\n\n\nCharacters\n\nOkay the main character is a troubled boy who is internally fighting an ongoing battle against his depression or his dark side like thought of murder and such this boy also has a light side that all it wants to do is follow his dreams and be a decent human he has problems like bullies a dead mother a father who loves him but acts like he doesn't care his father girlfriend that is nice and caring but only pisses the Main character off a sister that love him very much but isn't there often he has a very overactive imagination and can sometimes blur dreams and reality he also like sports some what but pretends to know a lot about it to try to seem cooler (the main character's name is what the player wants  it to be but if name that is put Richard or Dunn get special Easter egg also first and last name required rarely use last name other than easter egg )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nendings\n\n\nThe serial killer ending u succumb to your dark thought and kill everyone in a way most people will have multiple ways of dye I got such as and accident kill were u make it look like an accident or a straight up kill with u can get caught doing and something will happen and when I mean kill every one I mean kill everyone even people u don't normally get into any confrontation it end with either u being arrested and executed or u get away clean and go on to commit more murders \n\nSuicide ending is we're u talk everyone into killing themselves with info have on them gathered through the game this end with u killing yourself or u getting killed by sister u couldn't bring yourself to kill \n\n\nThe second Suicide ending is we're u don't kill or kill very little and u succumb to your depression and hang ur self This is considered the semi neutral ending \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dream ending is where u don't kill anyone and u overcome all obstacles in the game and if u miss one u don't get this ending u get a good but not as good one how it ends is u become a successful man in whatever u do \n\nThe neutral ending is u a find one of 4 ways of living with ur depression \n\nThe way u tell which ending ur gonna get is buy look at ur environment the more horrifying beast show up the darker the ending and the more normal and friendly people are becoming is how good the ending is \n\nSister plays big part in all endings \n\nThe main character has only one friend he is who the main character look up to he is a better version of himself I every way he's more popular stronger and nice his the big brother he never had he will play big part in most endings \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe locations and settings\n\nThe game takes place in a old creepy town in upstate New York with landmarks like a old style church with a bell tower a sports female of some kind a old high school with many interesting characters and a decent sized  commercial and residential district with a creepy forest \n
4helcx,Looking for a game idea/storyline. Considering all ideas.,I need ideas for a game I'm making which is a point and click horror mystery game. Similar to the Dont Escape series. There isn't much now but you spawn in a dimly lit cave and you go down the hallway in a sort of maze like place. All I really need is a good storyline to go from there.
4hef3t,Game Idea #1,"Ok here's goes. There needs to be a game like hit man and GTA put together. Here's what the game needs\n\n1- free roam where you can go into every building,shop and interact with some of the people.\n\n2-not only a storyline mission but side missions like the girl next door is getting beat down so have to locate her boyfriend and ice him and his gang. A lot of good deed missions to offset what you do.\n\n3- being able to hunt down other hitmen playing the game would be awesome and having a ranking system maybe even give the number one hit man a prize at the end of the year.\n\n4- be able to customize what your guy looks like and get cooler clothes then the hit man.\n\n5- must have weapons on the wall like first hit man game. This time he could be in an apartment"

4j86ec,I'm Working on a Winemaking Tycoon Game,"Hi guys, I was wondering if you could help me out with a game I'm working on.\n\nAs a kid in the late 90s, I grew up with tycoon and management sim games. Theme Hospital, Theme Park, as well the later ones like The Movies all left an indelible mark on me as a gamer.\n\nI took this love of tycoon games and decided to create one based on an industry that hasn't really been explored by gamemakers as much as I hoped: vineyard and winemaking management. There is, of course, Wine Tycoon by Got Game Entertainment, released in 2009. And I'm sure there may be a few more obscure titles. But there are no games that capture the most important aspect of winemaking: that you are at the mercy of nature - specifically, the weather and the soil. This amalgamation of climate and soil is known to winemakers as ""Terroir"", and it is the title of my game, currently in development. The art style is low-poly 3D with a static camera angle (""isometric"" camera angle is a good way to describe it, even though it's a 3D game).\n\n[LINKS TO EARLY-STAGE IMAGES AT THE END OF THE POST]\n\nIn Terroir, you manage a small vineyard estate -- known as the Chateau (which you can name). You get to pick the varietal of grapes (for the prototype, we'll be including only 3, but the full game will feature several more available for the Player to unlock through the course of the game), and once planted, must let nature run its course as random weather patterns (not entirely random, as it will simulate weather patterns usually experienced in the locations you choose your vineyard to be) either help your vines grow, or hinder it.\n\nYour wine has 5 characteristics: Acidity, Sweetness, Tannins, Fruitiness and Body, and every process you go through in Terroir affects these characteristics. Each grape varietal has an ""ideal"" value for each characteristics, and the trick to producing the best wine is to try to get as close to these characteristics as possible. These ideal values are, of course, a secret, and a Player must use his/her experiences in making wine to know what makes a successful batch of, say, Cabernet Blanc.\n\nThe game runs on a simulated calendar, and follows the natural cycle of the seasons. It has a day and night cycle. There will be Rain, Sunny Skies and Overcast Skies, and each one affects the your wine's characteristics even while they are still grapes. Come September, the harvest can begin. \n\nHarvesting will basically give the Player an amount in tons of grapes which he/she then crafts into wine. Again, the amount, or Yield, will be affected by the weather. \n\nFrom this point onwards, the Players will be interacting with the game through a series of menus. These menus provide the Player with options and actions that will affect the product. \n\nSo the first 2 of those menus are: Maceration and Fermentation, both of which affect the wine's characteristics.\n\nAfter that, it's time to bottle and package your wine, and you can customize the name and the label design.\n\nOnce you have bottled and packaged your wines, you must then organize a wine tasting session in order to get wine critics to rate your wine. This will determine the price of the wine, after which you can move on to the market where you can sell it to distributors. A Player will have a distributor relationship rating, which determines how much more (or less) they'll pay for your wine based on the suggested selling price, as well as how many they'll buy.\n\nA Player must ensure that he/she creates the best quality wine as is possible, in order to build something called Chateau Renown. This rating unlocks new varietals and other features for the Player which will help him/her make better wine.\n\nThere are several things that keep the game interesting outside the winemaking processes. Bad weather can lead to negative effects for your wine, such as Rot and Drought. The fermentation process can apply positive effects to your wine, known as ""Flavors"" (Buttery, Smoky, etc.) which will lead to a higher suggested selling price. Distributors will also only purchase certain varietals and not others, and changing trends over the years affect what they are willing to purchase .\n\nOnce the player begins to experience some level of financial stability, they can expand their Chateau by purchasing an additional plot of land (an extra block of land that will attach itself to the one you started with). With this additional plot, a Player can plant a new varietal -- or continue to produce the same varietal he/she is having success with.\n\nUltimately, the object of the game is to keep a successful Chateau running for a set amount of in-game years (we're looking at around 40-50 years). At the end of this period, the Player receives a final score depending on several factors, including the Chateau's Renown, the reviews and total revenue.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and if you guys have any questions at all, I'd be happy to talk more about the game. What features would you like to see? Are there any annoying elements or things you find lacking in modern tycoon games? Anything that can help the idea grow is very much appreciated. Thanks for reading this far, looking forward to hearing from y'all.\n\nHere's the link to a few images showing menu designs and a sample render of a typical scene in Terroir:\n\nhttp://s1096.photobucket.com/user/mj_fillon/slideshow/TERROIR\n\nMARK F"
4j6xew,All these new trailers are giving me some ideas. What if we have a Battlefield game set in a Warhammer 40k setting?,"Ok first I know a lot less about Warhammer 40k than most fans are but I can say that I am really fascinated about it and would really like to know more about it.\n\nOk about the gameplay, it will most likely be asymmetrical gameplay due to the wide number of races, which can be very difficult to balance; so lets not talk about that.\n\n#Space Marines\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Very tough and hard to kill\n\n* Wide range of powerful weapons, both ranged and melee.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Strong ticket penalty on death, low player max\n\n* Average vehicles.\n\n----\n\n#Imperial Guards\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Higher player count with low ticket penalty on death.\n\n* Some of the best vehicles.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Weak infantry in both toughness and weapons\n\n****\n\n#Orks\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Very tough but not as tough as marines, while having low ticket penalty on death.\n\n* Strong squad bonus (WAAAGH!)\n\n* Gunz are very shooty with lotsa lotsa dakka!\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Ridiculously loud and inaccurate weapons.\n\n* Painboyz (Medics) may heal you at the cost of some max health.\n\n* Most of their vehicles do not shield their drivers\n\n****\n\n#Chaos\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Tough as marines.\n\n* Can summon daemons (Special playable class with limits, probably a Bloodthirster)\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Very similar but more limited weapon choices than Space Marines\n\n* Requires sacrifice to access some of their features, which can be detrimental due ot their high ticket penalty on death. \n\nOther playable races such as **Eldar** may be fast and strong at melee and psykers but average health and inaccurate ranged. **Tau** with very good ranged weapons but are fragile and weak in melee.  **Necrons** that are very tough and can revive themselves. The other races I don't know much about them."
4j6wdt,An original Tycoon/manager/rpg idea (KPOP) :D,"First of all, yeah, sorry i'm not a programer..  but hear me out! I've got a very detailed plan put together, and would love to colaborate in order to realise this idea. (i do illustrations, so i could potentially take care of the art, if this project would become a reality) :p\n\nAnyway, i've got this idea for a game; sort of a mix beetwen GameDev Tycoon, Movies and Football Manager :D\n\nI've been wanting to pitch an idea of this type for a while now, but i really couldn't find an intriguing theme and concept to attach it too .. Then, recently, i became aware of this growing phenomena called KPOP and their idols, an interesting mix of skillbased protagonists and corporatism, that seems ideal for this game idea. Not to mention, the increasing popularity and attention KPOP seems to recieve as of late, would potentialy raise even more interest in the game.\n\n-------\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nI was imagining this as a turn based strategy/rpg, where each turn would progress the timeline by a week or so.. during the turns, the player would be required to make a bunch of choices that would affect it's progress into next turn/week.\n\nThe game is essentially 2 phases:\n\n**Phase 1:**\nYou first start off as a small ""idol agency"" consisting of a tiny studio for trainees and a modest starting capital;\n\nStarting of, you would be required to spend that capital on the necessities, such as talent scouts, vocal/dancing coaches, etc. (obviously you could only afford the cheapest ones at first, but you could gradually upgrade them)\n\nOnce you've hired your staff, you assign your scout to find you some potential idol stars. These would come in all different shapes and sizes, along with their own unique skillsets (singing, dancing, charisma, ect.), which you could later improve and mould into whatever necessary..\n\nAll of these aquirements would, naturally, come at a finacial expence for your agency, so the first and primal objective of the game is to earn money and keep your agency from bancrupting.. \n..This is where the second phase of the game comes into play: \n\n**Phase 2:**\n\nOnce your trainees sharpen their talents, you may choose some of them to debut as a group;\n\nSelling songs, albums, commercials.. that's where the money would come from essentially.\n\nSo once a group debuts, you would need to manage their popularity, publicity, song recordings, appearances on shows, ect. In order to get maximum results from your agency  \n(all the while, you would still be recruiting other talents and playing the 1st phase of the game along with the second to keep your bussiness afloat)\n\n--------\n\n\nThat's really just a very rough sketch of the idea.. i've also put a lot of thought into many potential features to make the game more fun and complex, but there's really too much of everything to put in a single post. :P\n"
4j6la5,"Game Jam - Game Ideas (Theme: ""Scary"")","We need a great simple game idea for the theme ""Scary"".\nThanks in advance!"
4j29ps,Smooth Multiplayer variations of the Ultimatum Game,"Imagine many people travelling together load their stuff in 1 trailer, but its too heavy. Everyone says ""I'm not taking out any of my stuff"", but if they risk overloading it, the tires could go flat during the long trip. So they argue for hours, each removing some things and other times adding heavier things, but the tires appear squashed and not able to travel far. This is basically the multiplayer Ultimatum Game. Everyone chooses an amount of their stuff to risk, and gets that much payoff if everyone together wins, but everyone together may lose if theres too much bluffing of how much they're willing to remove if others dont remove their stuff.\n\nWhat if instead of weight during travel, everyone moved their mouse or tilted their phone to choose a height of rectangle on screen to risk, and if all the rectangles together stack up to less than capacity, all those gambles pay off, but if it goes over at all, all those gambles lose. Continuously your rectangle would enlarge or shrink depending on if the stack is below or above the line.\n\nThis could be played in many stacks at once, and I think you need at least 3 stacks if all your winnings are spread across the stacks. So you would move your ""game money"" between the stacks trying to be where the stack is below the line.\n\nThere could be limits on how fast you can move gameMoney between the stacks.\n\nWe should find some combination of rules where if a player chooses to spread their ""game money"" between 2 user accounts, it doesnt give them any advantage.\n\nSimilar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game\n\n&gt; The ultimatum game is a game in economic experiments. The first player (the proposer) receives a sum of money and proposes how to divide the sum between the proposer and the other player. The second player (the responder) chooses to either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives any money."

4ivks4,Have you guys heard of this site? Looks like you can submit game ideas to be made. I haven't tried it.,
4iuzhi,"A loot driven, tower defense on a mobile fortress","If there are 2 things people love its loot and tower defenses. So here is my idea to combine them. \n\nYou control a big, mobile fortress. On that fortress you can build certain towers in a traditional TD way. You roam a big open map pulling aggro of the monsters that roam there. They will run up your ramps, onto your fortress and try to get to the core. Your towers will kill them, and any loot that they drop on your fortress is yours.\n\nLoot could be various resources for building and upgrading your towers, special towers, or equipable upgrades to give your towers unique abilities. \n\nAs you roam and get stronger you will be able to go into more difficult areas, fight stronger monsters and get better loot.

4iqb7i,Blizzard Games Remastered,"I have been a huge fan of Blizzard entertainment for a long time, I used to play Warcraft II a lot when I was younger. Another game I liked a lot was Lost Vikings, but I found that I would make simple mistakes with the clunky controls, and the newer ports to DOS box are even more infuriating to get the hang of. This would be more a suggestion toward blizzard, but I would love to see remastered versions of there old games. I think these would be really popular, especially if they remastered there old RTS games. Unless they have a secret project to release Warcraft 4 (Not WOW, as fun as that was) I would think they would have some time to work on this."

4inpf4,FreePlay: The Worlds Greatest Game Engine and Sandbox Game,"I have a idea about a crazy sandbox game called FreePlay. FreePlay is a sandbox game that can be played in many different ways, Developers can create there own gamemode for different people to play, The base of FreePlay is multiplayer, you can create a server that is like a first person shooter, or create a puzzle server that can get users thinking. Anything from shooters to puzzles and much more can be created, all these custom files can be downloaded to the client so no mods are required, Freeplay can also be a single player game which creators can make custom maps for single player mode of the game. FreePlay will have dedicated map making software, will be run off its own game engine, and the best part. FreePlay Engine™ can be used to develop other games entirely such as Half Life™ 3. Im sorry if all what i said is confusing but i just needed to get my ideas out, also. Any ideas for what this can be created on? Java? I dont know any other coding language. I have a huge dream of creating this game and am such a noob at coding. Ideas?"

4imtkh,A real time version of Mafia,"essentially it would be like this:\nPlayers are given 1 minute to scavenge for weapons. They are then sorted into one of three teams: The Cops, Mafia, and Civilians. These work similar to the Detectives, Traitors, and Innocents from TTT with a twist. The Cops and Mafia cannot buy anything, but instead can pick from three classes depending on their faction:\n\nCops:\n\nDetective:\ncan examine bodies and match fingerprints to suspects\nLoadout: Scanner, Binoculars, Handgun, SMG.\n\n\nEngineer: Can place 1 security camera and alert Detectives\nLoadout: Handgun, Security Camera, Monitor,Radio\n\n\nInsider: A former mafia member who can tell the other cops the identity of ONE mafia player but is constantly hunted by Mafia NPCs. only ONE player can choose this class so as to not expose the entire mafia.\nLoadout: Knife, Mafia Pin (Giving this to a Detective will expose one mafia member)\n\n\nMafia\n\nMob Boss: Can send NPCs to kill certian members of the cops. If not ordered, they will automatically seek out the Insider\n\n\nScammer: Can leave fake evidence as a diversion for Detectives.\nLoadout: Pistol, Fake Body\n\n\nGoon: a typical TTT style badguy.\nLoadout: AK, Knife\n\nGameplay... would pretty much just be TTT with a day night cycle and harder to clean evidence.\n\n"
4imb7j,Free-roam MMO,"I've always said that I'll never have my dream game, and without the programming knowledge or resources to make it myself, I've chosen to post it her. Fat chance, still. But I'd be lying if I said I had no hope.\n\nMMOs are normally big deals that require millions of dollars in dev hours and world construction, right?\n\nWhat if we simplified it?\n\n1. No leveling\n2. No stats tied to gear\n3. Relatively large open-world\n4. No fast travel\n5. An action combat system\n6. A few things to do other than combat\n\nLet's start with the big one: No leveling.\n\nLeveling is seen as a ""Must have"" in MMOs. However, I view it as an arbitrary limit to gameplay. Why should an MMO have a leveling system at all? It just marks an end to 90% of the game content.\n\nNo. An MMO shouldn't end.\n\nInstead of a leveling system, just have each class be given a set amount of HP/MP/whatever other stats you want the game to use. This would not only allow for GREATLY improved dev control on class balance, but it would also allow for class variety. You could have three different ""Mage"" classes. (One uses summons and is kinda tank-like, another is glass-cannon like, and another is a healer)\n\nNow, the next-to-largest: No gear stats.\n\nGear grinds are artificial and meaningless in the long run. Why should I need to grind out a single portion of the game in order to be capable of doing other content? Not only does that give an arbitrary grind to the player, but it also gives content an expiration date. Why would I go and do a dungeon that I've already been through if I can just use the gear I got from it to go do this other dungeon that has an RNG chance of giving me better gear?\n\nNo, content in an MMO shouldn't end like that. Loot should only be cosmetic. Loot can still be a thing, but it just shouldn't have stats tied to it. Players have proven time and time again that they love cosmetics. Most are even willing to pay real money for a single outfit. Why not have those outfits be the loot that players go for?\n\nThe largest money-sink for the devs of this MMO would be the open world, however, as proven with Black Desert Online, not allowing fast travel allows the devs to make a smaller and more detailed world while still allowing it to seem large in size. Also, allowing for different ways to travel would likely create a more fun experience. Sailing a ship and finding fishing spots could be a thing. Maybe you allow players to tame wild beasts and use them as mounts?\n\nAs for the action combat system, this is needed. A Tab-targeting system just wouldn't work for a game like this. It would grow stale due to the lack of skill variety. You would need something like Warframe's fluid-like motion or Smite's 4-skill MOBA combat. Maybe a mix of both. This would allow each class to feel even more unique without making the devs focus so much on making just another particle-effect skill. This would also allow the devs to create more unique monsters to fight.\n\nFor non-combat gameplay, have crafting be a system of making unique looking gear that only crafters get, or have many different ways to decorate a player home. maybe throw in a farmville-style system where a player can grow and cook food that gives small stat buffs for a set amount of time. Allow player trading and there's no end to the possibility if a player wants to make gold under this type of system."
4ikonm,RPG CHESS,"\nBasically chess but overhauled.. Make races and redesign the game pieces.. you don’t have to animate every piece to move since its chess.. Depending on what you do you could either make it so the different races have their pieces move differently or make the races have specializations like elves moving faster.

The more loyalty you have the more people will join your kingdom and the more people will pay taxes (which can be changed price wise, but be warned too much taxes and people will be angry and leave) Then you may upgrade your castle and town with the taxes you just collected and build up in a RTS style way. Could add other things like enemies to fight during the RTS portion and having wars and such and so on..  "
4iiwh1,No Man' Sky-style MORPG.,"Not exactly No Man's Sky, wrong title.\n\n1. The world is a finite (premade?) landscape that will ""reborn"" every time it is fully completed. It is basically a kind of hub.\n\n2. Gateways are placed around the world, which have a specific seed linked to it. Going through it will bring you to a generated dungeon. Dungeons should be large enough to ensure an hour of gameplay.\n\n3. Conquering the dungeon permanently seals the dungeon and gives the player some special tokens that can be traded. Using these tokens will consume them and bring the user to a ""simulation"" of that dungeon. (hence gameplay becomes a currency).\n\n4. Conquered gateways will dissapear and the world will ""get destroyed""/shrink so players won't need to spend time travelling to get to remaining gateways.\n\n5. When the world is fully destroyed (no more gateways), all players will fight in a boss dungeon. Low level players that participate in the battle will get a XP boost. Simulation tokens can still be used to take a rest from the boss dungeon.\n\nWith this, players old and new get to experience the thrill of exploring/conquering a place not many had went before, and when everything's done, they get to level up in a massive coop fight"

4if3o6,VR Lost/Mafia Social Survival,"With the advent of VR headsets with quality microphones, proper 3d audio, and the allowance for social gestures, imagine a game where a random group of online players are given secret roles or motives, and must cooperate to share resources and tasks that will keep the group alive (or perhaps fulfill a secret, possibly villainous goal). Maybe there aren't enough resources (food, medicine, weapons) to go around, and hopefully lord of the flies style arguing and trust issues would ensue.\n\nTo avoid vr locomotion problems, the game could take place across several Myst-like rooms. There could be a travel time associated with going between rooms, and players might need to arrange meeting locations and times after deciding to split up in search of info and resources)\n\nGameplay could be simplified to events conveyed with text ala Mafia (last night x happened...).\n\nSome players might have secret conditions (eg. requires double food to survive...) or info on other players and areas of the map (eg. location x is dangerous...) that no one else knows.\n\nPS. I'm on the Mayoiga train and this kind of thing is really appealing to me at the moment :D"
4ief3w,I need a game idea,"Okay I am looking for a simple, not too complex idea. The game should approximately take me 6-12months to make.

So it can't be truly story driven, with lots of dialogue and plot\n\nI'm only one person, and I can't do everything."
4idt2a,Crafting system that encourages widespread cooperation between players on survival games.,"Every player will have ability to gather any raw resources, make very simple, and weak tools/weapons, but one player is able to have only one crafting specialization, which is however not enough to craft any high tech items by itself. It needs other players with other specializations to stand next to him, in order to option to craft advanced stuff is allowed. For example - for crafting something as advanced as semi-automatic rifle - there would have to be players standing near each other with following skills - 1.Metal processing skill 2. fine metal work skill 3. mechanics engineer skill 4. weapon engineer skill 5. advanced wood manufacturing skill. Now - this is only example, which shows that groups with highier number of active players will have better equipment, and as more advanced tech is required more players - something like a car would require 20 people. This should be set up in a way, to not have a limit at which getting more players into a group doesnt provide any benefit anymore, so - bigger group is always better - wether for just the speed of crafting or durability of items or their quality. For new players this would mean, that joining a group is a must - nobody can play alone and own other players. Ultimatelly - this will result in any game server of this game to be separated into just 2 groups - I would call them factions at this point. The following is my expectation as to how such game would play - Leader of your faction will order you to be online on server at specific time of the day, so you go into factory, stand next to other players and craft the tech for your faction, inturn, you will have advanced armor to wear, and never starve to death. I imagine that more resource demanding items will be kept in a safe, and only in time of conflict they will be handed out. I have never seen this kind of system in any game. It is essentially a simulation of real life society, where each member has to contribute by his special skill in order to enjoy comfort, and safety."

4lx8wb,superhero fourth wall,"Sorry bout the length, I couldn't stop writing.\n\nGame play: Third person, open world.  Kind of a GTA world.\npowers: Telekinesis/ strength/ flying\n\nStory:  You start off as a typical normal person, with an apartment and a job.  Maybe there could be different occupation choices at the beginning?  Anyway, let's say you are a cop.  So the game would start in your apartment, you would go to work and have your first day on the job (like a tutorial).  once the learning is done, you would get a call about a grand theft auto.\n\nOnce you accept the mission, you would hear a voice say ""Auto save Complete"".  The character will notice this and question it.  The vision will become temporarily disoriented but will soon recover.  The player will track down the criminal and start pursing.  After a bit the voice will come back and say ""Hold [key] and swipe right""  The character will again acknowledge the voice and be confused.  When the player follows the command the criminals car will go flying across the road and crash.\n\nThe character will begin to think that they are gaining super powers.  Throughout the game, the player would follow a story, learning how to control the powers listed above.  Every time the voice is heard, the character would notice it.  Closer to the climax of the game, the player would be standing in the middle of the street and everything would freeze.  The voice will say ""Game Loading"".  The character would start looking around ""Game?  I'm in a game?""  The character will begin to look around and finally look directly into the camera ""Is someone there? Have you been controlling me""\n\nThe screen will start to glitch out.  Then the character will ""see"" all the stats on the screen and begin making more comments as you play.  The game will say ""Game Loaded"".  Except this time it's different.  All the NPC's can hear it now, not just the main character.  For the rest of the game, the game will try to ""fix"" the glitches.  Every time a power (Which has actually been a ""glitch"" the whole time) is used, all NPC's in the area will try to chase you.  But this will also give the player the ability to spawn any vehicle, any time and all weapons would have unlimited ammo.  \n\nFor the rest of the game, the character would make remarks like ""Why would you send me this way? go over there!"" and ""What's your problem? you're letting my health get too low!"" And the character would also keep track of the number of times you let him die.  At the end of the game, the game would begin to collapse upon itself.  buildings would collapse, physics would stop working, the player would even get shifted to random spots in the area.\n\nI don't know, it was just a sudden idea that I am kind of making up as I write it.  What do you guys think?  ideas for improvement?"
4lwkvq,"(Abstract) an idea: at random intervals of time, you and your enemy switch places completely","This is my first post on Reddit- I apologize in advance for the many things I will do wrong. \n\nOn to my idea, however: it could work for a wide range of types of games, but to give an example, let's say a game of chess. The goal of the game is the same; however, at random intervals of time, you will switch places with the enemy, or other player. I've tried to explain this to people before who didn't understand, so I will elaborate: in your game of chess that's half-way through, it is as if you stood up and went to the other side, meaning that if you were beating your opponent previously, you are now losing. This way, you have to play offensively but know in the back of your head that at some point you will take the enemy's place and everything you did to him.\n\nI am a decent programmer in Python and don't need help making the actual game, in fact, I would prefer that no one but me uses this idea (if people do that or not, I'm not sure.) However, I need help deciding what kind of game it would be- it could be a board game like chess, or even an fps or top-down shooter (which is what I was thinking.) And what would the details be, like how often would the switches occur?\n\nIf there's any questions, or if any games like this already exist, please let me know."

4lvse9,A strategy game where you get up close and personal.,"Alright so, we all love strategy games because we get to feel like a commander leading massive armies into their horrible deaths at the hands a vastly superior force (stupid ultralisks...).\nWe also all love to see the whites of their zombie-space-nazi eyes when we pull a trigger(or i'm just psychotic)but, those games don't really blend well together do they?\nWell congrats dummy, you're wrong.\nwhat i have here is a brand spanking new (probably not but whatever) idea... which can basically be summarised as video chess-boxing.\nWhat i mean is, let's make a game of two halves. The tactical half, is an overview of the mission with data such as terrain, enemy information (of course there **will** be a few surprises) as well as any notable landmarks. You will then be given a list of troops available to you as individual units that can be lumped into squads if needed. The final stage is to assign orders to each squad/unit, such as 'charge forward then turn' as well as far more complex lists of orders like ' if A_squad is under attack then help' or 'if enemy is ""armored"" fall back' basically working as IF THEN commands like in programming. This allows the player a unique experience while also freeing them up for the next part....the shooty part.\nSecond half of each level is your standard third person shooter/fighter, you take control of a single ""commander"" unit who has massive stats and grants a huge morale boost to any nearby units. The purpose being that the player gets to oversee crucial aspects of their strategy and use the commander's advanced stats to help take difficult objectives. If you die then the commander unit becomes unavailable for all successive rounds but you will be able to watch the action as a spectator (so you can now watch all your plans go to hell because Gaurd_12 got stuck in some mud).\nAfter a minute or so the next round begins as the player is sent to an overview screen to asses the current state of affairs. They can re-assign orders to units or decide to cut their losses and haul ass outta there because morale got low and half the Arachnids just ditched you.\nFinally, PVP can be two players with no intel making up an army of a pre-determined amount of points and having to balance recon,combat and commander hunting while stopping the enemy from exploiting the random elements of the environment to their advantage.\nTL;DR : super tactical with enough COD bits to fill a chum bucket...so literally fantasy chess-boxing.

It could even be made a text based game i believe. \n\nSo it’s a space colonization game, with out enemies, no other ships, no other aliens. \nBasically you start at a home planet, that is doing well, and now is looking to expand. \nSo the peeps of that planet made you the CEO of their space program.\n\nSo you have a universe of course with planets. That are unknown,, and you then have to collect data from that planet in different forms,, via telescope,, sending a probe,, a manned mission,, yeah you name it. And then ofc there is random events and failures, and things and shit happens. \n\nBut the essence of the game is information and making decisions. With information I mean I wanna know EVERYTHING about a planet if i care to find out, all from how big it is, to atmosphere and temperature, what can grow, resources, weather, water. So basically a chart of the quality of the planet. Ofc the facts can change, from looking at it too walking on another planet raises so many new questions and so on. And with decision making i’m thinking.  Is this planet worth exploring,, is it worth moving to. Should/can i send a manned mission that goes there and comes back. OR is it to far? Will it be a one way trip? Or should i just send a colonization ship with 10k peeps and hope they can survive and thrive so that i then can send more. because all the explorations is too expensive? \n\nI hope you get the idea. More of a management game, a calm relaxing yet intriguing game.\n\nThx for reading, have a banana and a potato :) \n"
4lpn8u,Need enemies for a shooter game,"I'm making a 2D side-scroller shooter game where you play as a robot (genuinely original, I know).

4lnvkt,Online chalkboard everyone can see and write on,[removed]
4lnlmq,A game where you make your own characters fight,"   I was recently watching a certain video on YouTube where the person did a royal rumble style match (Jerma Rumble) in WWE 2K14, creating wacky characters to fight each other. Since I always like pitting AIs together in video games, and I very much like making bizarre characters, I looked around to find something like this (2K14 is console-only) on PC, but I couldn't find anything.\n \n   So I thought this would be a great idea for a game, if you removed the wrestling parts but still had a 3D rumble style match, and played up the weird customization aspects. WWE 2K14 was watered down by many other aspects, with the rumble being a small feature. If a dev team made a game just around this, it would be stellar. \n\n"
4ln9oe,"[Strategy] Not sure if there is a game similar, but had what I believe to be a good survival, post-apocalypse game.","So I was talking with my friend about strategy games today that we like to play/should play, and thought that with all these seemingly less than great Walking Dead games, they could actually make a very fun survival game.\n\nBasically, this would be a probably bigger than Indie game, but could be Indie I suppose.\n\n\n**Goal:**\nThe basic end goal of the game would be to survive as long as you can in a zombie, monster, fallout, etc. apocalypse. The obvious basic challenge would be to survive whatever is plaguing the Earth post-apocalypse. However, other challenges with other groups, overcoming natural problems, resource management, obtaining resources, group unity, whatever else could possibly be wrong in the apocalypse. \n\n\n**Mechanics:**\nSo basically I can see this working as a strategy game. I think while you could work this as a first-person RPG, but for sake of simplicity in programming, maybe a table-top view of your character and group , where you pick different paths to take through the wilderness or whatever setting you are in. To start from the beginning, you character will have certain personality treats that you are presented with at the beginning of the game. While the amount of traits you can have and what they are can be determined later, I think a fun way to manage that is to have the personality traits you can select randomized so that you don't get to choose from every trait every time you create a new game. The terrain you start on and whether or not you have a family with you at the beginning will also be randomized, unless you want to customize that in advanced game settings. You have to manage resources (food, water, ammo, armor, etc.) for you and your group. On top of that, you also have to decide how many people you are going to let in to your group, if any, and how you are going to manage feeding and caring for that many people. You also will have a diplomatic aspect where you have to determine how you handle other groups and your stances on different issues during the apocalypse. So in essence, it is very similar to a Tropico/Civilization/Sims or some other strategy game where you have resources to worry about maintaing, and also would have a relationship/diplomacy hub in the menu. Changing seasons throughout your game could also be important to different points of survival. If the area is right, the player could be presented with the opportunity to try and create a permanent settlement.\n\n\n\n**Setting:**\nPost-Apocalyptic world where survival is key. My idea is derived from the Walking Dead series, and the game could be too, but doesn't necessarily have to. Where you start could be in the wilderness, in the city, on the coast, etc., but either case, you start alone with only yourself or only your immediate family. While there could down the road be an end-game (finding a cure with researchers or reaching an established safe zone), the main point is just to survive as long as you can. Some days may be mundane, just gathering food and maintaing order in your camp, daily tasks, but other days will be dealing with hoards, different survivors, turmoil within your own group, lack of resources, and the like. There will be weapons, and there will be different types of NPCs you can encounter (former scientist, former politician, evil, etc.).\n\n\nWell that's all I got. I just thought it would be very fun to have a strategy and survival game mixed. Above I said that it could work as a 3rd person view, steering along a map type game. I think however, it would be the best from a first-person game where you can shoot hoards if need be, but the main point is to try and lead your group successfully through the world and maintain a steady relationship with your group and other groups and keeping adequate resources. \n\nIf a game or idea like this has already been made/posted, just let me know because I would love to talk about it and or play it.

4li4vt,D-Day,"I've thought of a game before based around D-Day that would incorporate 2 parts, planning and execution. Basically, its just 1 level I guess, at least starting out. But one part of the game would be strategy, where a group of players one American, one German would plan the attack and the defense of Normandy respectively. They get like, 2 hours to design and plan before the part two of the game begins. Where the world is generated based on the strategies set up by the players, during the planning process players are given small snippets of intellugence i.e. America would receive maybe defensive positions, what units are placed where, etc. Germany could get probable drop sites and junk. Once the planning is complete the game is created for the FPS portion of the game. Ideally, there would be thousands of players in this portion - but whatever. Anyway, the players doing the FPS part will be guided to drop sites, given materials and assigned what kind of soldier they are once the game starts. Each player only has one life, and again, their objectives would be generated based off yhe planning of the strategists. I like to hope that its possible to have a large amount of players with only a one level - and if possible I believe this game would have a completely different feel than any other RTS or FPS. If you could have players that are serious and competitive, perhaps there would also be Sargeants who lead their men on the beach, deploying localized objectives. I think with one level, developers would really have a great time paying attention to detail, but I dont know game development that well."

4le1g2,Idea for a spaceship battle theme game with anime girls as crew,"In this game you would be on control of a spaceship with a crew made of anime girls, basic and weabo as it sounds, completing several missions that would involve defending a civilian post, destroying an enemy ship, and everything that one could find in a scifi scenery. \n\nIt might sound like FTL, but i think it could be twisted enough to be its own thing, more if the focus is centered on the personality and cuteness of the girls, a bit like Kancolle and alike. \n\nBonus ideas that might be too complicated to implement: Having fleets of 3-5 ships on a mission, having ships inspired on famous spaceships like the Enterprise and the Galactica, upgrades and modification of said spaceships, players vs player, and missions that could be created by players and downloaded by others, and a story with a bit of comedy, drama, and meta jokes. \n\nThanks for reading, i will appreciate your opinion.

I want everyone enemy in the game to have a mission too AND.... I want to become the enemy that kills me! \n\n\n\nHow cool would it be to be in an open world with dynamic goals and missions and for some reason die (why in the world would that happen??!? Lol) and just resume playing as the person ya died to with a new goal and mission? \n\n\n\n\nI think having different equipment and or abilities (say the grappling hook from Just Cause and other items like it) for each enemy would add a lot of dynamic play the game aside from dynamic missions for each enemy and player...\n\n\n\n\nIt could even be co-op! But that would lead to players killing each other when they inhabit a body with an opposing goal or mission so someone would have to work out how that would go down, I mean I cant just steal another players body while they are playing....

4lcydw,Abstract: A slow-motion or turn-based / strategical game that results in a 'real-time' playback of the events that occurred.,"I've never posted here before, so I hope I'm doing this right. This idea is vague with no details worked out, so I listed it as abstract.\n\nI thought of this idea while remembering TAS recordings (Tool Assisted recordings of games which are played in slow motion and then brought up to full speed in the actual video.)\n\nI was thinking that this would be something quite feasible on most budgets and intriguing yet something that (as far as I'm aware) doesn't exist. Think of a strategy game or a turn-based game or even just a game that takes place in slow-motion, in which 2 or more people engage in a duel or brawl or military showdown. Once one party wins, the events that unfolded would be played back in real-time (non-slow motion or turn-based) as a sort of pay-off that would be intriguing to see. \n\nI know this all sounds quite vague but I hope I got the gist of the idea across. I'd love to hear if anyone knows of any game that uses a mechanic like this or what the design challenges would be."

4lbnb7,Game where you are a doll that fights the nightmares of a child when they go to sleep.,"The player is a little makeshift knight doll in the real world, but when the child is sleeping you fight their fears and insecurities as their protector in a dream world. The knight in the dream world looks like a real knight, who never shows their face or speaks a word. He wields a sword and shield, but gets more weapons along the way that are effective against different enemies. The real world segments are barely shown, and only in the dream world does gameplay happen. There are giant barren landscapes in which the nightmares live, which the knight must travel to every night to slay them. It is never revealed if the knight actually fights nightmares in dreams, or if it's just the kid's imagination."
4lbims,A game where crystal shards are people,"This is kind of silly, but it's an idea, so why not? The setting is a world of ice, and instead of people being the sentient race, it's crystals. The main of the game is that you are a small, plain, almost completely transparent crystal that must save your friends, who are usually vibrant colors, from various enemies (crystal bears, crystal hawks, crystal sheep??). I'm imagining this being a platformer, but a bit harder than usual since, as the world is made of ice, everything is slippery and it's easy to fall off. If you fall from too high up, your character will shatter and you'll have to do it again from your last checkpoint. There could be a skip mode where there isn't much plot except for the main 'save your friends', and there's normal mode, where the plot goes like this:\nThere's something making the world melt, and it isn't just your character's obviously hot body. The MC is a bit nervous and doesn't want to investigate, but when their friends are taken, they don't really have a choice. I'm envisioning sarcastic humor and really old references (*cough* end game where you have to go up up down down left right then mash b and a to successfully evade the boss.) Just a silly little idea I had, kind of strange when I look back at it.\nMaybe it could be a kid's game?"
4lba4j,A skateboarding game where the earth undulates and rolls like the ocean.,"It's a skateboarding game with the usual ramps and half-pipes to trick on, and rails to grind on, except the world you're in wobbles and rolls up and down like an ocean, so if you're going fast enough you can also jump off of an incoming wave and potentially get some huge air, while pulling off some awesome tricks.\n\nLike for example, you could trick off of the ground waves to build up a combo and then preform the usual tricks off of the half-pipes for huge points, or vice versa."

4l8y90,"A sidescroller rogue-like where, upon death, you can either choose to continue through a harder version of the world or abandon the playthrough.","Ive always had a vision of a... sidescroller rogue-like all about the actual survival involved with exploring a dungeon. Hunger, thirst, sleep and water deprivation. Players could avert these needs by purchasing items from merchants or through careful planning. Otherwise, mushrooms, rats, and water dripping from the ceiling might work.Darkness would also play an important part in the game. Coming across a pit is dangerous because you dont know whats at the bottom. Tossing a torch down the pit might reveal gleaning eyes, indicating creatures of some form. All of this, plus a combat system similar to Dark Souls would be my Ideal game, although I dont know if combat as complex as Dark Souls could be represented in 2D.\n\nBeyond all of this, death would be a complex part of the game. Upon dying, a player is given the option to either descend deeper into a ""Dark Realm"" where everything is harder, more twisted and even darker. Subsequent deaths lead into deeper dark worlds. Players could restore their worlds purity by completing levels. I think this would add a whole new element to the exploration of the game, as certain treasures might be exclusive to the deeper dungeons, thus offering players some amount of choice in how to progress through the dungeon, but with possibly catastrophic consequences if the best layed plans fail.\n\nThe best part, I think, is how this could be applied to different settings. To me, either exploring a simple dungeon or an alien derelict would be the best settings. the alien derelict might be an H.R. Giger like location, with petrified aliens and malfunctioning bioware serving as merchants. A dungeon setting would probably make the most sense, but for a truly inspired setting, the alien derelict would be great.\n\nSo yeah, slow paced dungeon crawl based around planning and survival, with the chance to salvage plans that went to the shitter. This is the type of game I'd like to play.\n\n\nForeseeable problems:\n\n- Having to start the game by making the same items over and over again might get a bit boring. This happened quickly in Minecraft, and would happen even more with this idea because of how much someone would restart. I suppose the ""dark world"" mechanic might subvert this, but not for long.\n\n- World generation could always pull a ""fuck you"" and not give you food or water for a long time. This could be solved by making these needs available in every level, but then theres really no point in having those mechanics if it becomes a chore vs. a challenge\n\nThoughts and opinions?\n\n\n"

4l8ckv,Night Bus Simulator - a 3D horror driving game,"**Name:** Night Bus Simulator\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A 3D driving simulator (first-person, behind the wheel) where you must navigate long, rural highways at night while reacting to horror-themed encounters on the road. \n\n**Plot:**\n\nThank you for applying for the position of ""Bus Driver - Night"". We are pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted and we would like to begin your training right away. Our night team is expected to navigate difficult highways and overcome unique challenges and hazards, all while ensuring that company assets are maintained at the highest level of quality. To prepare you for this task, we've developed this multi-stage simulation of actual routes our drivers brave every night. \n\n**Setting:**\n\nThe game should have several routes to choose from, each set in low-light conditions and each with it's own unique, scripted encounters. Some courses have you contending with supernatural evils, while others deal with equally terrifying natural hazards. Below are a few ideas I had.\n\n* Blackhand National Forest: A winding road through a thick forest. Players must maneuver carefully around hairpin turns while going fast enough to escape the ""Hands of the Forest"" which try to pull your bus in to the woods.\n\n* Thunderhead Springs: A rainy highway over a watershed of lakes and rivers. Players must avoid hydroplaning into the water while they skirt fallen trees, lightning strikes, and flooded bridges.\n\n* Nilbog County: A couple of small German-American communities with vast cattle farms in between. Local legend states that goblins in the area often set traps or release cattle in order to waylay cars on the road. Another myth tells of a red-eyed giant, mistaken by drivers for a traffic light.\n\n* Stonegrave Mountain Highway: An icy roller coaster through a mountain pass. Players must dodge falling rocks, avoid black ice, and handle extreme inclines and declines lest they fall down the mountain's face.\n\nI have another idea called ""Valley of Vapors"", a mist-centric route through a series of hot springs. I haven't developed it's hazards as much as above, however, and am not sure if I want to make it supernatural or mundane.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe player character will be unseen and have no dialogue. However, there are a number of radiant character encounters which may or may not appear in any course. What radiant characters will appear and how many will be randomly determined before the start of the course. Certain radiant characters may also have unique encounters specific to the courses above (examples in description).\n\n* Highway Patrol: A state police cruiser hidden along the highway. The player can be pulled over by Highway Patrol for speeding, which will effect scoring at the end of the course. A course-unique encounter may be getting pulled over in Blackhand National Forest, only to see the cruiser slowly dragged into the forest by the Hands.\n\n* Backpackers: A group of pedestrians traveling along the highway. Backpackers may appear on either side of the road, traveling in either direction. There may also be a chance of them running out in front of the player, creating a hazard. Hitting backpackers will affect score negatively, but stopping to pick them up can add bonus points at the risk of a scripted course hazard.\n\n* Breakdowns: Other drivers standing around a broken-down car. They may have flashing lights and traffic cones, or they may be completely dark. They could also appear stopped on the side of the road, or pushing the car in the middle of it. Like the backpackers, hitting or picking up a breakdown can affect score. A course-unique encounter might be spawning a breakdown at the crest of a hill on the Stonegrave Mountain Highway. \n\n* Deer: A four-legged, even-toed ungulate known for causing car accidents. Deer may give off eye-shine before being fully illuminated by the bus's headlights. They may also stand in the road, cross suddenly in front of you, or simply poke their heads out on the side of the highway. A course-unique encounter may be having a deer spawn on the side of the road in Nilbog County, only to be hoisted into the air by a goblin-made snare. \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThe game will play as a first-person driving simulator, with a HUD consisting of speedometer, gas gauge, and rear-view mirrors. The bus will have three driving modes: Drive, Reverse, and Park.\n\n* Drive: Exactly what it says on the tin. Go forward and steer. \n\n* Reverse: Again, nothing complicated. Just go backwards and steer. \n\n* Park: Only accessible if the bus is at a complete stop. You must shift into park in order to pick up hitchhikers or to pull over for Highway Patrol.\n\nA course is cleared when the player travels from the course start to the course end successfully. The player will then be scored on completion time, encounters, and damage to the bus. A high-score would mean the player completed the course within a specific time limit, avoided negative scoring encounters, picked up positive scoring encounters, and sustained little or no damage to the bus. It would also mean they avoided ""game ending encounters"", such as getting washed away at Thunderhead Springs or squashed by the Giant in Nilbog County.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nNot sure, hadn't really thought about it.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nI think this game would play best on PC, but could work well on home consoles. I dread to think what porting this to mobile would be like.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nAlso not sure, also haven't thought about it.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nIf anybody does want to pick this idea up, I would like to work with you to come up with courses and encounters. I understand if not, however, and am happy if you just include my name in the credits."

You are a civilian on the ground, try to survive the carnage as buildings around you collapse, people run everywhere, the military tries to shoot it, the monster leveling the city, etc...\n* 13. Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.\n* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.\n* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!\n* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.\n* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)\n* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.\n* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.\n* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.\n* 21. A game with the setting/kind of style of Counter Strike/Modern Warfare/Battlefield/CoD, but the twist is everyone has kitchen appliances and tools instead of guns and knives.\n* 22. An NSA simulator where you look through people's computer files and learn about that person's very bizarre history through them.\n* 23. Dodge random objects that are falling out of the sky.\n* 24. Survive disasters in first person, such as tsunamis, nuclear explosions, tornadoes, meteorites falling out of the sky, volcano eruptions and more, all from your house. You have 2 minutes to prepare for the event.\n* 25. A game where you can only move by shifting the gravity of the world. Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.\n* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.\n* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.\n* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost. The only way back is a long road down a deserted path. The locals urge you to not go down it, for no one ever returns alive.\n* 29. Be the referee in a football/boxing match, decide when something bad happens who is responsible.\n* 30. A game where every step you take changes the entire level/game world, permanently.\n\nThat's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange. :P\n\nThese ideas are completely free to use, if any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D"
4l7cmr,Decision making rpg (looking for feedback),"Hey everyone!\n\nI am planning to make a game and am looking for some critical feedback. If you like the concept tell me what you like about it and if you don't, don't just say it's horrible, tell me what is the part that you dislike so much.\n\nNow to the game: \n-You start as a child and grow up throughout the game. The decisions you make as a child can have a large effect when you grow up. \n-The game explores the concept of change, how the world changes around you and how our choices can have a meaningful effect on the world.\n-You have the ability to go into dreams of others. With this you can better understand the person you are dealing with and can make better choices in the game. (example: when you are young you go into your friend's dream. You see he is lonely, so you try to hang out with him more.  He remembers in the future and helps you with whatever you are doing)\n-The main character wants to make a change in the world. How he does it (if he does it) is up to you. It can range from him trying to become a dictator to being a politician.\n-Not sure if there would be combat, but if there would be it would follow the theme of change, so it would be different when you are young, teen, mid aged etc.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback!"
4l6ogp,Zombie Open World,"Honestly this might be one of the most used ones, but I personally think none of them are really good. :/ The only big thing in my idea, is taking back towns/cities. (Which might be too big)\n\nIn most zombie games, you just kill stuff, get more stuff, and then you can kill stuff easier. That seems a little repetitive, doesn't it? And in some games, sure you can make a settlement, but honestly what does that do other than make a place to store all of your garbage?\n\nThe only difference in zombie games I would want, is just some sort of way to clear cities, and then the majority of zombies won't be there. But, the problem with this is if the map is too small, the game would be EXTREMELY short. And if you don't want the game to be too short, then you have to make it really freaking big. That's why this game idea might be too big, which really sucks. But there's always a chance, isn't there? Thanks for reading."

I am a beginner developer and furthermore I won't be able to bring to life any extraordinarily requests (as ""A FPS WITH GREAT GRAPHICS AND 10000000 WEAPONS!!!"") . All I'm asking for is if you have a simple idea for (a 2D perhaps?)  game. I just wanted to make something more original than another floppy bird etc. Oh and comedy is key I wanted to make something quite funny (including doge as a character?) .

4l2poj,A physics sandbox game where the world you're in is wobbly and bouncy.,"Basically, the environment is like a modern city or countryside, except the whole environment constantly wobbles and shifts, and everything is very bouncy, as if the world was a giant swaying bouncy castle. In this wobbly sandbox world, you're free to just mess around and have fun without the fear of death or failure; kinda like *Goat Simulator*.\n\nFor example, you could jump near an NPC and launch them into the air slightly (or visa versa), or you could get into a vehicle and try to drive straight without losing control and bouncing all over the place, or you could just parkour across the rooftops of buildings as everything shifts under your feet.\n\nAnd you would be able to adjust how wobbly everything is (just in case you want it calmer or even more intense), as well as the bounciness of the ground."
4qoi3v,A choice horror game,"Similiar to Until Dawn, the game would have four friends staying in a cabin in the woods. However, unlike Until \n\nDawn, the game would have MANY choices, rather than just one or two for a scene, which would result in different\n\n results. For example, one of the group gets assaulted by a masked murderer in the kitchen. He can either \n\n\n*A Grab a knife and attempt to fight the assailant, initiating a series of QTEs and injure the murderer (If the player\n\n successfully does these QTE series' three times, the murderer dies, giving the player the ""Self Defense"" Ending \n\nand Achievement.)\n\n\n*B Grab a knife and stab the assailant in the arm, which would trigger one QTE, and would make the murderer\n\n easier to dodge attacks from (QTEs last longer when the murderer is attacking someone)\n\n\n*C Grab a knife and stab the murderer in the leg, initiating one QTE and would make the murderer easier to run\n\n away from (QTEs involving running last longer)\n\n\n*D Run, initiating a series of QTEs to run out of the giant cabin and escape.\n\nThe game would have many endings, depending on who dies, lives, and the amount of secrets discovered.

4qoetp,Stay Awake (A college final sim),"After pulling an all nighter, Aidan is extremely tired. Unfortunately, there is only ten minutes till class starts. You have\n\n ten minutes to navigate Aidan's house, collecting the five five-hour energies in the house and making a pot of coffee,\n\n as well as collecting his phone, keys, and wallet, to prepare Aidan for his final. After ten minutes,the player must exit\n\n the house, cutting to black to open to Aidan's final. This section of the game would require the player to constantly \n\npress the spacebar to keep Aidan awake and keep his exhaust bar above a certain point. If the bar goes below the \n\nrequired point, Aidan will start to fail, filling up another bar, his fail meter. The player may click on a five-hour energy \n\nto use it, fully restoring Aidan's exhaust bar. The player may also click on his water bottle, which contains coffee. The\n\n coffee has a total of ten uses, and boosts Aidan's exhaust bar. The player would fail if Aidan's ""Fail"" meter filled \n\ncompletely, or if Aidan's exhaust bar reaches zero. The player will win if Aidan passes the final.\n\nThis game isn't supposed to be that serious, and will be short."

4qn2if,An idea for a horror game that came to me in a dream a couple weeks ago.,"I really should have posted it here instead of an AskReddit thread. This is an idea for a game that I don't believe I have the programming skills to make myself, so I'm going to share it here and see if anyone can make it a reality.\n\nIn its rough essence, it's just a survival-horror with elements from Bioshock, Undertale, and Condemned. It's your basic horror FPS: you can use anything as a weapon, you're trapped in a creepy haunted house, flashlights trigger monsters, etc.\n\nWhat makes it original is the fact that any demon you initiate a fight with will always result in a jumpscare. The demons are various creepy entities: shadows that follow you around but are always just out of sight, girls with faces hidden in their hair with ghostly white dresses, mannequins that move around when you aren't looking, you get the idea.\n\nIt also takes a page from Undertale with the ""fight or flight"" mechanic. You can kill demons or run away. Running away saves you the trouble of fighting and makes your game a bit easier, but the fact that you spared another demon has a negative effect on your game. Your screen begins to flash and glitch out, jumpscares become scarier, lights become darker to the point where you can't see very far ahead of you, and eventually you start hearing demonic whispers and jumpscares happen out of the blue with no warning. Basically, the pacifist run is a bad idea.\n\nAlternatively, you have the genocide run where you kill every demon you see. For every demon killed, the lights get brighter, jumpscares are shortened to just loud screams and eventually nothing at all, demons become much less scary, and the environment is all-around much more safe.\n\nNo run is any harder than the other, though. No ending is better than the other, either. Players just have a choice: turn this into a fun survival game, or turn this into an extreme horror game. \n\nThere's also some fellow in a suit who will constantly appear in random rooms, doing things like reading books or watching TV in a large chair. He'll never look at you, his expression is always blank,  but you'll hear his voice whenever you see him. He'll always make remarks like ""back so soon?"" or ""what took you so long?"" \n\nIn a genocide run, he slowly becomes more human, his expressions returning to normal and him actually walking up to you and talking. The ending of the genocide run involves you and him escaping the mansion to return to society. \n\nIf you do a pacifist run, he slowly becomes more and more demonic, his speech being mixed up and corrupted, his eyes becoming white, his stare becoming scary. The end of the pacifist run would involve him killing you or something.\n\nBasically, this game is a backwards Undertale, where pacifism is frowned upon and killing is your only means of survival. These are all just details from the dream I had one night, if somebody wants to discuss this idea further and come up with ideas I'd gladly talk to them. Feel free to ask any questions."
4qmp0e,Medieval MMO similar to Planetside 2 and Mount&amp;Blade,"It would be similar to PS2 as in the large scale continents like Esmir, Amerish, and Indar. They each have regions with facilities that can provide passive bonuses for the faction that controls it. It would practically be the same as PS2 in these regards.\n\nThe Mount&amp;Blade part comes in with the warfare mechanics with emphasis on strategy and possible some shared from Chivalry too for more close face to face combat. There would be balistas, catapults, siege towers, battering rams, and all that stuff.\n\nYou would be able to alternate classes in game like PS2. Visual character customization would kept on a downlow with faction colours locked and guild banners being the only unique noticeable feature (this would help performance of the game.)\n\nWould be played in the first perspective, but can be changed when operating vehicles.\n\nWhat would you guys think?"
4qlej9,An action platformer where you can't stop moving,"It'd be a mobile game and you'd use tap and swipe controls to change direction, jump and attack in different directions. You'd have to constantly be on the move so the world would procedurally generate around you as you went into different directions. \n\nThere'd be endless streams of enemies and youd have to survive by not getting trapped and killing them when you can.\n\nI'm thinking you could have abilities built in that work with your momentum like ground pounds and sliding kicks so you're character would always be moving."
4qjj4g,A browser based card game about collecting,"LEts get straight to the point. A browser based card game that features 1,000 cards. Cards are your gateway to literally everything. Talk on the games forums? You have to use a card for that. PM another player? use a card for it. Trade cards with another player? Either you or that player has to use the card for it.\n\nNow, each card has a set number of uses, with some being infinite. (For instance, to talk on the forum you have to use the forum card, but the forum card would have infinite uses) \n\nYou start with a collection of 10 cards. 5 are starter cards, used primarily for missions, and 5 are completely random, pulled from the card 999 card pool. From here you can do 2 things. 1. Visit the shop. The shop will have 2 type of cards to buy. The first is permanent cards. No matter what, the shop will always sell these cards, these are the PM cards, the forum cards, the trading cards, and most of them will have infinite uses. The second type will be random, 5 cards that will be randomized every few hours that pull randomly from the 999 card pool. The only way to get money is to sell your own cards to the shop. \n\n2. The other thing you can do is go on missions. Missions will require you to commit or ""use"" combat cards, each of which has a defense stat and combat stat. Once you use a combat card for a mission, its number of uses goes down by 1. Here's an example of how a combat mission would go: The mission has these details: 10 Defense and 5 Offense. You now have to commit enough combat cards to either complete, or stalemate the mission. Completing the mission would be having at least 11 Offense and 6 Defense. You get the best rewards for this. Stalemate would be having 11 Offense OR 6 Defense, you don't lose but you don't win either. You get some rewards for this. When you have finished a mission you get cards based on how well you did. This is how you get cards to sell to the shop to buy more valuable cards.\n\nNow, there are a few ways to gain cards. The first is to complete missions, the second is to buy them, the third is to steal them, and the fourth is to trade for them. The majority of gameplay will be based around the latter two. \n\nThe goal is to collect all 999 cards from the card pool, which would allow you to trade in 1 copy (you have multiple) of every card to gain card 0. This is considered completing the game.\n\nSorry if this is scatter brained. It all just sort of fell out."

4qfze2,REAL TIME STRATEGY card game.,"Most card games are turn based. One element this format gives up is time pressured decisions. I'd like to bring that aspect to a game, while retaining the fun of deckbuilding ect.\n\nThe game would be played like an RTS, but instead of using resources to build buildings and make units, you would use cards. You would probably contest certain resource points of different types. One type could be spend on drawing cards and special abilities, while the other could be for building units and buildings. \n\nWith buildings, instead of unlocking things, they would grant passive bonus like a buff to all infantry or passive income. \n\nI can imagine having to build decks with a good balance of units, buildings, special abilities and counters. Could be a very fun idea. "
4qfdhe,Super Mario Galaxy 3 Ideas Part 2: Super Mario Galaxy Overview,"Welcome back to my ideas for Super Mario Galaxy 3. Last time, we discussed a potential story line for the game, but today, we will be overviewing the galaxies that Super Mario Galaxy offered us. This part, along with the next part, will lead up to my ideas for brand new galaxies. Anyway, let's start overviewing.\n\nGood Egg Galaxy was the first main galaxy in the game that you unlocked. Unlike the other galaxies, this galaxy had no set theme that was visible throughout the planets. But other than that, the missions in the galaxy were pretty easy.\n\nHoneyhive Galaxy was a forest themed galaxy that was inhabited by several bees. And it even had some honeycomb walls you could climb on using the Bee Mushroom\n\nSpace Junk Galaxy was a galaxy that was filled with, well, you know, space junk, such as old rocket ships, floating debris, and other objects and platforms.\n\nBattlerock Galaxy was a huge rock which had cannons that fire at Mario, and an interior with many technical contraptions.\n\nBeach Bowl Galaxy was a beach filled with penguins, called a ""penguin paradise."" \n\nGhostly Galaxy was a haunted-themed galaxy, which had Boo Mushroooms that could turn Mario into a Boo.\n\nGusty Garden Galaxy featured many grass and plant-themed planetoids, and you could use flowers to glide from one planet to another.\n\nFreezeflame Galaxy had freezing water and ice on one half, and molten fire on the other. It also required the use of both the Fire and Ice Flowers.\n\nDusty Dune Galaxy had many desert-themed obstacles, such as floating sand structures, cacti planets, and even pyramid-styled planets.\n\nGold Leaf Galaxy was a mirror of Honeyhive Galaxy, except with an autumn environment and a few other changes.\n\nSea Slide Galaxy was similar to Beach Bowl Galaxy, except it is a ring of water with many landmarks, such as a tree and a lighthouse.\n\nToy Time Galaxy was filled with toys, and it had a section filled with desserts where you need to use the Spring Mushroom to progress.\n\nDeep Dark Galaxy had a large starting planet with lots of cool stuff, such as a beach, a ghost ship, and even a hidden star where you go inside this box-shaped planet and defeat a boo.\n\nDreadnought Galaxy reused several elements from Battlerock Galaxy, except is based on a massive battleship known as ""The Dreadnought.""\n\nMelty Molten Galaxy was made completely of lava and rock, with several planetoids floating around the main planet.\n\nFor other galaxies, there was Gateway Galaxy, Flipswitch Galaxy, Hurry-Scurry Galaxy, Buoy Base Galaxy, Honeyclimb Galaxy, Bonefin Galaxy, Matter Splatter Galaxy, the Hungry Luma galaxies, the Ray Surfing galaxies, the Star Ball galaxies, the Bubble Blowing galaxies, the boss galaxies, and Grand Finale Galaxy. In total, there are 42 galaxies in Super Mario Galaxy. Next time, we will overview the galaxies from Super Mario Galaxy 2."

4qe6y6,toy tycoon,"A twist on the economic management type game. It should start in the 1970s or 1980s. Your task is to create a toy empire. And, to market toys better, you can also create cartoons. There would need to be a core mechanic that you use to design the toy/cartoon to make it sell better, such as RPG-style leveling-up of design abilities, or perhaps a mini-game.\n\nA key to the whole thing would be a satirical spin, a sort of cynical humor about the stuff mass marketed to kids. (To get ideas, just watch commercials about the stuff made for kids over the years...)"
4qdmhb,A survival game set in the Sahara Desert.,[deleted]
4qdgaf,FPS that would make owning VR a must,"A team based post apocalyptic survivor. Set in a place like the temples of Bagan you and a group of 10-15 others are pitted against another team. The object is to collect resources to escape by following a series of clues. Not only is it KoS but there are bosses scattered around the map. Each boss is a mythical creature from Burmese folklore. When a player dies they have to wait 30 seconds to spawn back in and when they do spawn back they're placed randomly on the map. \n\nThis makes them susceptible to attack. It also makes it more difficult to overtake an area where there is a clue or boss for the team. In total each match could take an hour making strategy key. I feel like VR could really encourage a new level of cooperation in a FPS with the right settings. Maybe it's just me but since people can look freely and move a weapon to signal coordinated attacks would be possible. That and it'd just be awesome to burst into a temple with 14 other people to take on Belu; a man eating shape shifter.\n\nThe campaign would be an expanded version going into detail about how the creatures came into our world, now 5 people must banish them back to the peak of Sumeru. The gameplay would be something like if God of War (only bosses), Borderlands (gun porn), Uncharted (thoughtful story and incredible environment) and Heavy Rain (complex puzzles) had a baby. \n"
4qcrqz,A computer virus tycoon game?,"So, I was searching the internet recently, and I noticed a game like this does not exist yet, and so I wanted to share my idea here. So, without further ado, let's get into where I sort of took inspiration from:\n\nI'm thinking gameplay similar to the likes of Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life. However, instead of crafting your own video games and youtube videos, the player is making computer viruses to unleash upon the internet.\n\nI think the endgame would probably be something along the lines of Plague Inc / Pandemic 2: infect the majority of the world with your computer viruses until no survivors are left.\n\nThe graphical style of the game doesn't have to be anything special: again similar to Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life - maybe a little more futuristic.\n\nOf course, the game would probably include an upgrade / research mechanic, in which the player could unlock the ability to make different types of viruses (worms, trojans, ransomware, etc.), or be able to research or unlock different components to include in their viruses; Just like Game Dev Tycoon, the player would be able to customize each computer virus to their liking.\n\nThe player may also have to deal with not being caught by the police as an added mechanic. The player may do this by implementing anti-tracking software into their viruses, or by upgrading a certain skill.\n\nThe only problem I see with this  is how to make a currency system work within the context of the game, since most viruses don't exactly generate money.\n\nAlso, I imagine there would have to be a disclaimer placed somewhere within this game , since computer viruses are a pretty touchy subject.\n\nTell me if there are any other flaws that this game might have, any ideas you might want to add on, etc. I have had this idea in my head for a long time and am happy to share it with Reddit. \n\nThank you for reading!"
4qcox1,"Casino Heist game where you're not the robbers, you're the person getting robbed.","So it goes like this: \n\nYou have to maximize profit with upgrades to your casino by adding slot machines in the lobbies etc. but also have to spend money on security measures to stop robbers, every now and then heisters will break into your casino, some sneaky beaky and some loud 'n' proud, they then start stealing all of the shit from your vault. You can prevent this with better security such as:\n\n- Heat sensors\n\n- Thicker vault door and walls\n\n- Faster police response time\n\n- More guards\n\n- Metal detectors \n\nAnd the list goes on. You'll have to pay for any damages during the robberies.

Eventually there will be a winner or a stale mate. \n\nEach side has different skills, strengths, weaknesses, weapons and upgrades\n\nDetails of classes\n\n-	1st person is a soldier class – who starts as a simple private,  upgrades to an elite combatant – with sub classes of sniper –demolition medic etc \n-	3rd person is a vehicle class that starts with a jeep or boat or helicopter. as you advance you can become a tank driver, jet fighter, attack helicopter , bomber transport equivalent of each class or static or possibly mobile artillery  anti aircraft\n-	The bird’s eye class is a officer role, you start off with a small troop of bots soldiers at your command.  when you  advance you can command larger groups more elite troops, tank brigades planes etc all from birds eye view \n\nAll three classes play on the field at the same time. Each battle lasts between 10 minutes to an hour depending on size- class types used\n\nExample game types  – small skirmish only troop and officer class allowed,  \nMechanised battle only vehicle class and officer vehicle class,\nAll out war all classes all weapons \nOnly officers-only troops –only vehicles etc \n. \nYou can join battles to aid your side.

He also uses some of the Star Power to power his hotel called the “Dark Star Hotel.” Bowser also kidnaps Luigi, Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi, and Peach, so it’s up to Mario to find the Power Stars and his friends.\n\nLater that day, Rosalina calls Mario to her office and tells her that she managed to hold onto one Power Star before they were all drained, with that Power Star being the Green Grand Star (Yes, the Grand Stars are color coded in this game). After placing the star inside of a pillar, World 1 is unlocked.\n\nSo blah blah blah you play the game you get X amount of stars, and eventually unlock the boss galaxy, where you battle and defeat Iggy Koopa and get the Yellow Grand Star, which lets you unlock World 2.\n\nWhatever you do in Worlds 2-4 is basically the same as World 1. You play the game you get X amount of stars and then battle a Koopaling. World 2 you battle Roy, World 3 you battle Wendy, and World 4 you battle Morton. After World 4, you get access to the Dark Star Hotel. This is where the last 4 Star Pillars are, which unlock Worlds 5-8. What happens in Worlds 5 &amp; 6 is the same thing as all the previous worlds. You play the game you get X amount of stars and then you battle a Koopaling. In World 5 it is Larry and in World 6 it is Ludwig. However, to get the Grand Star in World 7, you need to catch Nabbit in all of the galaxies in Worlds 1-7. Then, you can fight Lemmy Koopa and get another Grand Star, which gives you access to World 8. At the end of World 8, you need to battle Bowser. I'll explain what the final battle will be like later, but anyway, after you deafeat Bowser, you get another Grand Star, which unlocks the first bonus world.\n\nI will not be explaining what happens in the bonus worlds because they're not really part of the story. Anyway, what are your ideas for a story for Super Mario Galaxy 3? Leave a comment below and I'll respond to as many of you as I can."
4q7c32,"Marvin and Bob, a Calvin &amp; Hobbes inspired platformer","So, we're never going to get a Calvin &amp; Hobbes game. Not officially. But, we can make something similar! For example, Calvin has three main alter egos; Spaceman Spiff (Flash Gordon with a raygun), Tracer Bullet (film noir detective) and Stupendous Man (Superman). He explores the same areas, but each character sees things differently. Tracer Bullet stand in will be confined to the ground and what he can climb, and has a revolver. Focus will be on enviornment puzzles. Spaceman Spiff stand in will have a jump pack and a ray gun. Focus will be on exploration. Stupendous Man stand in can fly and has no long range, but does have super strength. Focus will be bullet hell style. Outside of the alter egos, the living stuffed animal friend, here imagined as a kangaroo named Bob, can carry the kid around, being taller, the kid in the pouch throwing snowballs for Banjo Kazooie esque tag team gameplay. Plots will focus on escaping ""prison"" (school), exploring the...(woods), but ultimately be episodic."
4q6t9i,Need Help Fleshing Out an Idea,"Okay, so I started working on a project a little while back in which you play as a scavenger in the future. You board abandoned/destroyed ships and scavenge as much as you can to make money. You have limited oxygen so you must hurry and make it back to the ship to keep your loot. There are no AI but the loot will be randomly placed each time you enter a ship and there will be multiple puzzles preventing you from getting deeper to the better loot.\n\nIn the current early version, graphically it looks pretty decent but obviously everything would be redone once I get a solid foundation. The gameplay on the other hand just feels lacking and hollow. At the moment you can move around this small section of a ship and there are colored blocks scattered around (some more hidden than others). Picking up those blocks grants you money based on the color. In the future these will be replaced with object that actually make sense but blocks were perfect for just testing. \n\nI am working on the base gameplay but I have obviously considered multiple options between scavenging ships such as if money should be an actual currency used to purchase items or merely a score for each ship. A strong idea I'm juggling is the need to ""level hop"" in order to collect items in one location that must be used in another.\n\nIt's difficult working alone because if I hit a creative wall there is no one to turn to so I'm asking all of you gamers and developers out there to pitch some ideas to make this better.\n"
4q5zo1,Another Idea - 2 game modes in one,"The idea would be a game where you basically have 2 modes.\nMap type: just a standard long straight corridor for now.\nModes:\n1)Defense - You watch from a top point of view of that corridor and you mount different turrets and traps, trying to get the best combination possible out of them so that others can't invade your 'corridor'.\n2)Offense - You are one player, the goal is to get to the other side of the corridor (For now) .  Point of view wold be first person camera here, and this would test the reactions of players and also given a set of special skills ( +basic dodging) how the player would best use them to take as less damage as possible, and basically survive this 'quest'.\n\nParticularities of this idea:\n-All towers have the same texture/mesh. You cannot differentiate most towers between them until they shoot the first projectile. (The way they attack can be changed via the CORE inside each tower, only viewable to the one constructing his defenses)\n-All traps are invisible (or most of them). When they are on cooldown, or when the player goes over them, they appear shortly, and then conceal themselves (advanced technology :) ). Here a sound could be triggered before the trap actually triggers, giving the player a small reaction time (say like 0.5 seconds ) to do something.\n-Character movement is realy important here, it should be really fluent and give the player the ability to dodge bullets, lasers ,traps, go around them and so on...Each run should give the attacker the satisfaction of getting past tough defenses, and also the defender the idea to build the best possible defense.\n\nAlso there should be a lot of combinations of towers/traps, or to be highly configurable each of them, to give lots of options to players.\n\n\nWould be interested to see people's opinion to this kind of game. Would it be fun? Would you play something like this? I'm currently working on this but i'm just learning stuff through this,since i'm really new to programming.(So i'm basically bad ,for now :D)\n\nP.S keep using 'for now' since this are just basic concepts of gameplay, details would come later..."

4q44hf,Game idea - fps with paint,"Hi,\n\nJust started out having fun with unreal engine...I've made some crappy stuff and i was thinking to go try something new, like a mini game or something. I was thinking of making an arena where there would be 2 to 4 players (pvp multiplayer) fighting for survival.\n\nThe main concept was invisbility or darkness so not sure if i should go something like:\n1)All players are basically cloaked, invisible , they only appear if they get shot by paintbullets, here i can evolve the idea and make all kind of bullets . Like one that leaves a trail behind, and if any player goes through it, they get revealed for a couple of seconds . Or normal ones but instead they bounce...\nor\n2)Its dark everywhere, each player has some special nightvision glasses (Just for the sake of having a bit of logic) and they can only see 1-2 meters in front of them , without being seen by the enemy from distance. In this case they would use special bullets which would illuminate the rooms, which basically has the same concept as the first idea.\n\nThe main goal would be to kill everyone. Each have only one life and maybe have also a normal bullet which you can shoot to kill someone, like a deagle or something...\n\nAny other ideas or feedback is welcomed :) just let me know what you think."
4q3roo,A perimeter basketball game.,"I am actually currently working on this alone but it doesn't look too good. The idea is that you are looking straight down on a basketball game. However, the players stay on the perimeter of the three line. \nThe player can pass the ball around the three line to other basketball players. Then, when they want to the can take a shot. If they make it, they stay on offense, but if they miss, it switches to the other teams ball. the score cap can be set by the player .\nExtra Detail, the game would be retro, and pixelated, not unlike that of The Escapists.\n\nUpdate: It doesn't have to just be the perimeter as I have already fixed that...\n\nI need somebody or bodys to help me with this project as it is an open source project."
4q2zos,Super Mario Galaxy 3 Ideas Part 1b: Story (Chapter 1),"Today, I will be continuing the story for Super Mario Galaxy 3. Now if you haven't read the prologue, I recommend you do so now, or else you may be a little confused. And just so you know, the game itself won't be split into chapters. I'm just doing that to keep the story more organized. Anyway, here we go.\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nOnce Mario enters the pipe, he ends up in a space station, which contains many Lumas that can transform into Launch Stars which take you to different galaxies. However, all of the Lumas (except one) are trapped inside forcefields, which can only be deactivated if Mario gets a certain amount of Power Stars. After Mario gets 10 Power Stars and frees all the Lumas, he unlocks the first boss galaxy, where he battles and defeats Iggy Koopa and obtains the Yellow Grand Star.\n\nWhen Mario arrives back at the Power Star Hotel, Rosalina informs him that the Star Pillar on the first floor has disappeared. When Mario goes to the first floor, he sees another Undergrunt Gunner (UG), except this one shoots electric balls. Luckily for Mario, there are 2 walls he can wall jump up. Once Mario gets to the top of the walls, he must long jump onto the UG's tank. Once Mario is on there, he must ground pound the cockpit of the tank. Once he does that 3 times, the UG is defeated.\n\nAfter the UG's defeat, the Star Pillar rises out of the ground. From here, Mario must wall jump up to the top of the walls, long jump onto the Star Pillar, and place the Yellow Grand Star inside the pillar. This causes a pipe to appear on the roof of the hotel, leading to World 2, where the next Grand Star is.\n\nTo be continued..."
4q0rds,Super Mario Galaxy 3 Ideas Part 1a: Story (Prologue),"Today, I will start showing you guys my ideas for Super Mario Galaxy 3. I will start off by explaining the story. I will do 1 chapter per post. Today, I am telling you guys the prologue. Here it goes.\n\n**Prologue**\n\nOne day in the Mushroom Kingdom, Rosalina invites Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi, and Peach over to her new hotel called the Power Star Hotel. All of them were having a really good time there. However, Bowser wanted to get in on the fun, so he created a rival hotel called the Dark Star Hotel. However, Bowser soon finds out that everything in the hotel runs on Power Stars (hence it's name), and decides to drain all the Star Power from the hotel. Bowser uses some of the Star Power to power the Dark Star Hotel, while he spreads the rest of the Power Stars across the universe. Bowser also kidnaps Luigi, Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi, and Peach, so it’s up to Mario to find the Power Stars and his friends.\n\nLater that day, Rosalina calls Mario to her office. When he goes there, Rosalina tells him about the Star Pillars, which are the main power structures of the hotel. She also tells him that the Star Pillar on the third floor has disappeared. When Mario goes to third floor, he sees an Undergrunt Gunner (UG) shooting coconuts. Mario fights the UG by spinning to whack the coconuts he shoots back at him. After he does this three times, the UG is defeated. \n\nAfter the UG's defeat, the Star Pillar rises out of the ground. On top of the pillar is Nabbit, who has Princess Peach in his bag. Nabbit then runs away from Mario, which gets Mario to chase him. However, Mario eventually catches Nabbit and empties his bag. Inside, he finds Princess Peach, the Green Grand Star, and a Bee Mushroom. Mario collects the Green Grand Star and uses the Bee Mushroom to fly to the top of the Star Pillar and then places the Green Grand Star into the pillar. This causes a pipe to appear on the roof of the hotel, leading to World 1, where the next Grand Star is.\n\nTo be continued..."

4pz0v6,Good mobile/pc game ideas?!,"(If this post is in wrong place, please move this to the right place :))\n\nHello everyone!\nI'm totally out of good unused ideas so could someone tell me what kind of game would you like to see in the future? (No FPS-game or 3D)"
4pyiuw,An FPS with more creative boss battles?,"To explain what I mean, imagine your average FPS. If it has bosses at all, chances are it's something like ""shoot this until it dies but it dodges and shoots back."" After playing 3D Platformers like Jak 2, Ratchet and Clank, etc. I thought to myself, ""I wonder if we could have an FPS with more... creative boss attacks? Like instead of a boss just shooting at you, what if it shot bullets in a spiral so you have to weave through them, or it had laser beams that you had to watch out for? Since I don't know anything about Unity or how to make an FPS (I'm most comfortable with GM:S, and don't really use anything else) perhaps people who are could make this? It'd be nice to see in my opinion."

I wan't it to be humorous. Thank you. "
4pucak,Can some one give me a Medieval 3D RPG game plot idea based on this song?,[deleted]
4psihj,Stardew Valley Style Detective Rpg,"This is going to be incredibly vague but bare with me.\n\nI suggest a pixel styled rpg (in the vain of stardew valley) revolving primarily around hunting for evidence and solving crimes.\n\nThe game would idealy play like a top down, classic styled rpg, but instead of the generice fantasy monster slaying tropes, you would instead visit small crime scenes, collect items/notes/evidence and use them to piece together crimes. I believe the game would work considerably better if combat was kept to a minimum, reserved primarily for suspect encounters/case closures, and instead i propose a more adventurous/puzzle solver game, where by looking around and interacting with crime scenes and other case specific locations, the player pieces together the story of the crime and eventually tracks down the perp.\n\nSorry about the vagueness, tell me what you think of the idea and ask for any further information if you want!"
4prlqn,Sunrise / Light of Dawn ( Emotional pixel adventure game ),The story:\nYou play as a women called _____. You are a person trying to run from past time event. You explored the world in order to find peace. But your journey didn't help you at all\n\nThe Gameplay\nThis game will be in pixel (Beautiful type). Simple controls (move left and right ). Huge world to explore. Moral choices . Many ending. I still don't know if I wanted to name this game Sunrise or Light of Dawn.\n\nThe reason I posted my idea is because I wanted to know your opinion on this game\n
4pr3lz,[Request] Feedback on Ideas for a Store Management/RPG Game?,"Okay, so I've been trying to think of something kinda new to do with RPG's, and I think I have something good.  It's still in it's early infancy, but I wanted some feedback on it.\n\n- ""Your (Father/Mother/Uncle/Long Lost Cousin) dies, and leaves you with the deed to the family business.  When you arrive, you find out that all it is is a crumbling shack of a store.  You fix it up a bit, but then you realize something, you don't have any inventory!""\n\n- Gameplay involves elements of both an RPG and a Management game.  You have to adventure out, and fight monsters to collect your inventory.  Then you set the price, and go through a ""Selling Faze"" where people come in, and check out the stuff you have for sale.  After the day ends, you can either try to invest the money into upgrading the store, unlocking new areas to go to, or getting better equipment for yourself.\n\n- Random events happen in the ""Sellign Faze"".  A thief might come in, and try to steal your most expensive item, but he'll fail if you invested in security.  Someone may drop a valuable crystal, and have it shatter into pieces.  You then decide whether to fine them, jail them, or to let them leave, each one leading to different outcomes/views.\n\n- You need to manage your reputation too.  If you jail everyone who does anything bad in you store, then people will stay away from the valuables.  If you do nothing, thieves may come more often.  If you expand too quickly, and angry group of villagers might blame you for cut profits, and attack.\n\n- You eventually get guaranteed imports (A farmer might grow you crops, or a blacksmith might make you weapons) for you to sell.  However, these carry a hefty tax, which the supplier needs to be payed.  Once you get big enough, however, you could purchase land and hire people to farm for you, and have a greatly decreased/non-existent tax.\n\nSo, what are your opinions; do you think this could work?  It's still very simple, so things are bound to change."
4pqosb,A game called glitch.,[deleted]
4nsjgv,So.. I came up with an idea for what I would consider my dream game... would you play it?,"In context: \nI was bored last night and started thinking about game I should like to play. My steam account have 500+ games, but nothing seemed to be what I was itching for. Then I thought about what I actually wanted to play. After some minutes thinking, I decided to start writing it down. Sorry for the wall of text, but I got excited... here you go:  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntl;dr/intro: An open world, partially procedural generated, story focused, first person, single player and cooperatively played action RPG game with ""metroidvania"" and ""soulslike"" elements, set on a deserted and harsh but also beautiful and lush planet in a far future Science Fiction setting. - would you play or make it?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##############################\n**Open world metroidvania style exploration rpg. -title pending**  \n##############################\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nProcedural Generation (PG) - If done properly, and with just the right amount, it can make the game infinite replayable if the gameplay loop is interesting and varied enough.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMain idea/Intro  \nAn open world, procedural generated, story rich, first person, single player and cooperatively played action RPG game with ""metroidvania"" and ""soulslike"" elements, set on a deserted but beautiful and lush planet in a far future Science Fiction setting.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game should also be able to support VR. This means that it should not focus on combat, and that combat itself should be cover based. This way VR and 2D screen combat would be essentially the same, apart from having to physically aim the weapon or swing the ""sword""/block in VR. All item interaction should be handled with physics, with no hands on 2d screens (As with Amnesia: The dark descent) and with Vive controllers in VR. Teleportation of play-space movement would be preferred in VR.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe player takes on a role as a security detail (up for change) attached to a colony ship newly settled at an barely habitable planet at the edge of space. Only one colony ship has recently settled and this colony, and the area surrounding it, is the starting hub and tutorial for the game. The player will after a certain point find themselves lost in this new world, separated from the colony, and will have to explore the alien environment[2] in order to progress and get back to the colony/human society. Throughout the exploring the player will stumble upon unknown creatures, ruins, locations, and remnants of an ancient and lost alien society.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game is primarily procedural generated (PG), in the same vain as Minecraft/No Mans Sky, but with a set progression and goal. The starting area and hub of the game is hand crafted. The PG idea is that certain rooms and areas are tile based, so that it can be made sure that certain events can be scripted (not unlike Diablo 3).  \nThe game can be played in both first person and third person, but first person view should be preferred. The game is a single player experience, but can also be played cooperatively with up to three other friends. Story and lore is told passively as the player explores the world. The entire premise is based around how the Metroid Prime series did its exploration and progression, but that most of this games story and puzzle elements are proceduraly generated based on logic derived from the items that can be found throughout the world. The gameplay should feel like a mix between the Metroid Prime series and The Legend of Zelda, with parts of combat taken from the Souls series (difficult but fair).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe graphics should be simple (in term of physical details) but beautiful in atmosphere and design. It should give a more environmental focused look, with simple details and textures. It should rather have outstanding sound and animations, and a cohesive design that would make the game timeless in graphics. The main graphical focus should be on how the light and weather feels on the environment in such a way that the player can ""feel"" presence even if the details are toned down.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGameplay and control need to be rock solid, with most of the focus based on the animation and ""feel"" of both how you control the character as well as the animations and reaction of the world around you. The term pixel perfect (from platformers mostly) should be used for how the character traverses the terrain, and all the actions of the main player should be able to be felt and seen in/on the gameworld/items/enemies etc.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe player will start with ""basic"" human technology, but soon replace these with alien tech found throughout the world while exploring. The game should not be focused on combat, there will be certain enemies that need to be dealt with.   \nThe weapons and gadgets found all have their basic functions that can ""unlock"" new places to explore and strengths against certain enemies, but the power, speed and efficiency of the items can be varied, giving a reason to scavenge and loot. The appearance and design of these items, armor and weapons will change as well.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe events that got the player lost will also give him/her powers that will help on the way. These powers will be enhaced together with regular player attributes (Strenght, Health, Agility, Perception and Endurance - S.H.A.P.E. =) ). First power is the ability to ""see"" ghosts, as well as the understanding of the alien lore.   \nThe most prominent ability is the ability to be partially ""immortal"". Dying will not be the end.  \nWhile exploring the player will stumble upon alien ""resurrection rooms"" that the player will be resurrected in if dying. These locations will also be able to store information about what the player is carrying at that point as well, meaning that all items, gear, weapons etc that he/she finds up to that point will also be saved. Logs and lore information will not be lost when dying.  \nThese ""resurrection rooms"" will also enable the player to modify his/hers S.H.A.P.E. The player can spend all the accumulated experience gained by defeating monsters or finding certain items to upgrade his/hers core abilities (S.H.A.P.E.) in order to make the following progression a little bit more manageable.  \nCertain areas of the world are also in constant flux (as part of the unfolding lore, this will be explained to the player well after the player finds the first one), changing the environment completely every time the player dies or by choice in the ""ressurection rooms"", rearranging ""room"" locations, item location and even the biome of the area. This will make traversal through these areas new and fresh for the player. The size and numbers of these locations has to be decided through testing. (it might end up that the entire game is random as it should fit lore wise as it only happens every time the player dies)[1].  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOther powers might include the possibility to manage time; rewind, slow down, stop etc... teleport, levitate/double jump, telekinesis, bend light (invisibility) and more.  \nThe goal is that the powers can be used as elements for puzzles as well as in combat.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe story and lore should be sparse but deep enough that the player have to imagine some of it as well. It needs to be grounded in science, and even though fantastical and ""game-y"", all game mechanics will have to be explainable and coherent with the lore. The story theme should be civilizations lost and found, ancient ruins with personal stories, and on the player characters personal gain and survival as the player finds themselves transported into the unknown and further from the settlement.   \nRuins found throughout the world should hold its own story, and the focus should be to learn what has happened. The main goal of the game is to find out what happened to people in the world as well as finding out the reason for the world state. Conspiracy, power and ancient artifacts should be a recurring theme. (A bit cliched I know... but it is always fun/exciting).  \nThe way the story is told should emphasis is on the environmental story with item placements, books and notes scattered, as well as ""ghost echoes"" or similar ways of story telling, found in the ruins and other important locations. Item placements and loot descriptions should also be able to be part of the story and lore behind the world.   \nThe players story is mostly made by the player themselves, but the protagonist is not ""silent"", comments and explanations should be made by the player character as he/she finds certain items and locations in the world to make sure that the player actually notices what is going on. If the game is played with others, they may discuss things with each other as well.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLevel design, while being proceduraly generated, should be generated with lots of hidden and temporarily unreachable areas. These areas should be unreachable unless certain items/player abilities are used. Also, it should be made sure that the player gets delivered beautiful views/overview before entering new ""unearthed"" locations and puzzles.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUser interface should be mostly non existent . What is there need to be in-world (or digestive) as what the player character would see. This would also work for VR if the controls are properly handled. The player inventory should be a backpack, player stats should be Augmented Reality (AR) readouts.. etc.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##############################\n\n[1]Which might be one of the reason for the alien populous to disappeared.  \n[2]For example: In the beginning, the area would be underground base-like structures, and then gradually move to an open cave structure with artificial light that would resemble outdoor, only with a roof.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: Should be no secret what my favorite games are if you read the pitch :D I welcome you to take a guess...  \n\nPPS: This is my first time posting something on reddit, please understand that I have no clue about reddit formatting. Any tips for improvement is welcome. ... And; English is not my native language... :)  "

4nmhlw,Home Invasion Simulator 2016,"\n\nStory: Robbers are coming to steal your shit, you have randomized supplies and a limited timeframe to go to the store.

4nm9qp,A real time scenario-based battleship simulator,"It would run on the Source 2 Engine or UE4 and take place ON the ship instead of controlling it. Players would pick roles, like captian, soldier, and gunner, and would be spawned onto their team's ship.\nCaptians would work from the top deck and fire cannons, send EMPs to scramble the other ship, and pick Soldiers to board the enemy ship. The Gunner would be on the front deck and use AA guns to shoot down incoming soldier boats and planes. Finally, the soldier would fire infantry firearms at the other ships' personnel and board boats to advance into the enemy ship. Each class would have different models depending on the map. For example, a map called ""Old Sun"" would have metal gear solid themed models for both teams depending on the role. The ships would be loosely directed by the Captian, but would move depending on the situation."

Find allies, have cutscences, beat boss, awake special abilites, beat end-game boss and beat ex-boss.\nThe ""Power Story"" which is the main difference is that you fight your allies in 1v1 fight(optional).  If you win you gained their special skills and some of their attacks.\n\nI wrote a word document going a little more in detailed about it, but first tell me if this idea has been done or is it trash?"
4ngv5c,VR Games slightly based on 80s classic Warlords..,[deleted]
4ndtdt,A game where the NPC act sentient and ask you to not let them die.,I think it would be an interesting twist if there was a game that while playing the npcs start getting curious and asking you to not let them die. Maybe it's friend dies and the NPC may curse the player or even refuse some inputs to the best of its ability. I am sure there could be interesting ways to implement this.
4ndnsy,A game like The Sims but with superheroes,"A life simulator game where you can choose to be a superhero or supervillain. It would have character customization where you can choose your powers, costume, and physical appearance. Relationships would work by approaching another character for either friendship, partnership, or romance (if compatible orientation) and the AI could approach you or other characters as well for the same.\n\nAny children you have will have either a mix of the parents' powers or completely inherit powers from one parent. Powers could be based on existing Marvel or DC characters with things like gadgets, ice, plant control, or powered armor. Superheroes and Supervillains can date and their children will either be villains or heroes.\n\nCareer progression could achieved by fighting crime or saving citizens for heroes or committing crime or fighting heroes for villains.\n\nAny thoughts or criticisms let me know in the comments"
4nb56z,The Dog Went to Live on a Farm,"***You are a little kid who comes home to find that your best friend, your dog is gone. Your parents tell you that it went to live on the farm upstate. You go on a journey to bring your friend back.***\n\nThis game is purely bittersweet and is about the a child coming to terms with the death of their dear companion. It's not meant to be a scary game, although some parts of the MC's journey will be frightening, as they navigate their imagination city to reach the ""farm"". The game is basically a huge metaphor where the journey is the child learning the truth about the fate of their dog.\n\nThis game is most suited for PC or game consoles (Xbox 360/One or PS4). There will be many trials the character has to bypass, by thinking abstractly and using the environment to their advantage. The game has a clear end, where the character reunites with their dog and finally understands what really happened to their dear companion.\n\nThe main objective is to reach the farm where the dog is and understand what really happened to it. Their are side objectives though, that include defeating monsters and crossing terrain.\n\nSimilar Games: Shelter 1 and 2\n\n\nI don't know if anyone here is using BrightLocker yet (someone there mentioned I could post here for feedback) but you can see more of the game idea: https://www.brightlocker.com/ideas/the-dog-went-to-live-on-a-farm?aid=c6fc66  It requires a login but sign-up is just email,pw,birthdate."

4na81f,Open world 3D assassin game,"Basic idea is that you are an assassin in a grey-colored city where everyone looks the same (one human model, one car model, etc). The city made using procedural generation and all buildings are based on single format (but with different heights and room combinations) and you can go inside them. Almost everything is grey except the target and guards. You have a few different weapons and targets are located in different places around the city. They are also surrounded by different amounts of protection.

4n64cg,[Request] Theme idea for a social deduction game,"I'm working on a social deduction PC game (think [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game), or Werewolf) that uses your steam account to join games with strangers or friends.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the gameplay revolves around the players being sorted into two groups that are typically designated as ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". The bad guys know who the other baddies are, while the good guys are forced to find out through social deduction (asking questions, finding clues, etc.). If the good guys don't find out who the bad guys are before the match ends, the bad guys win. There will be lots of public communication in-game, along with the ability to make secret alliances via direct message with steamchat.\n\nThe purpose of me posting here is because I am attempting to come up with a unique theme that isn't quite as cliche as a ""Find out who the (killer/werewolf/spy/mafia member) is"". One important part of determining a theme is that each character (14 max) should have some type of identifying characteristics that will introduce original biases in some people. (ex. Spoiled cheerleader might rub some players the wrong way, so they'd accuse her of being the baddie, even if she might not be).\n\nI'm open to any and all ideas. Feel free to let me know if I need to elaborate on anything else. \n\nThanks!"

4n3ffy,Freestyle Rap Battle RPG,"Simplifying and expanding on an idea I posted here a while back...\n\nI want to play an RPG where boss fights are in the form of freestyle rap battles, taking place in an RPG style conversation/dialog system.\n\nDuring a rap battle, the game gives you a setup verse. Then you are given a multiple choice of words that rhyme. Some of the words are clever rhymes and stay on theme, and the crowd loves those. Predictable rhymes are just average, and bad rhymes lose the audience.\n\nA turn would look like this. Borrowing from Eminem:\n\n&gt; (crowd is staring)  \n&gt; His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  \n&gt;  \n&gt; ...smelly  \n&gt; ...spaghetti  \n&gt; ...levi  \n\nI made a [prototype of the gameplay](http://clintbellanger.net/prototypes/rap-battle/) with Twine, to show how it might work.\n\nIt could totally be done turn based like this. But it would be more engaging if the song kept moving, and crowd feedback was audio. Give the player one measure/bar length to pick the next rhyme or they stumble on their words -- sort of like the timed responses in Telltale Games, where taking too long is the same as awkwardly saying nothing. Picking rhymes in real time would make the multiple choice tricky, and make the player feel more like they're freestyling."

4n2xpn,Open World Vehicle Simulator,"This is a game where you click together vehicles.  Similar to Space Engineers, but with the following major differences :\n\n1.  Construction is separate from design.  In ""design"", you can hover around and click together your plan very quickly, although you are limited by the resources available to your character.  During ""construction"", your vehicle gets auto-built from these resources inside a factory or assembly bay, and you the player do not have to do anything.\n\n2.  Time warp is inherent to the game, and always built in.  All the game's machines are made to be time warp compatible.  You can time warp until something finishes or spacecraft reaches a particular region of space, or until your ship encounters an enemy, etc etc etc.  Instead of a mining drill on a mobile vehicle like space engineers, the mining machine is more like a tunnel boring machine that must be docked to the ground/asteroid surface.  It drills down and then comes back up.  You can time warp until it finishes so this operation takes just a few seconds from your IRL time.\n\nOnce you get the ore back to base (you can time warp while docking your spacecraft once you have things lined up and autopilot locked in), you can time warp until the refineries make it all into ingots.\n\n3. Everything you design gets a backup copy saved automatically, and it is straightforward to split your designs into separate ""modules"".\n\n4.  Your inventory is not limited to what is in your character's backpack.  In fact, delete the concept of a backpack completely.  Your character has ""slots"" on them for tools.  They cannot carry anything else in these slots, and have enough slots for every tool in the game to be carried simultaneously.  For the purposes of crafting, construction, etc, your character is considered to have access to all items everywhere in all storage in your base or any containers you have unlocked in a base you have just finished raiding.  You do not have to actually run back and forth yourself carrying stuff, you can automate this.\n\n5.  The game is intended for multiplayer from day 1, and handles lag in a graceful manner.  That graceful manner is another form of decoupling : vehicle control is based on deciding what velocity or new position you want your vehicle to reach, and then allowing the computer to control your rocket thrusters directly to execute this command, after a delay for all clients in multiplayer to be informed of your planned action.  This should completely eliminate jitter unless you are severely lagging, as on all client's screens, every vehicle will appear in their actual, true place in the world at that moment in time, every door will be in the correct state, every elevator will be in the right place, accurate to a millimeter, etc.  If you ever lag so far behind you are at least 500 ms to 1 second behind, the game will freeze until the server syncs up.  It will not display on your game client unrealistic things that didn't happen.  (you'll never see a ship crash into something, then rubber band backwards, then fail to crash because it actually evaded at the last moment)\n\n6.  The game has a campaign.  That campaign is that not all technology is available from the start (unlike space engineers and other products).  You only start with the technology to make basic vehicles, which you use to travel to places where you can raid the blueprints for more advanced vehicles, until 50+ hours later when you must design and fly the most advanced vehicle the game will support to beat the final boss and win.\n\n7.  It uses a voxel tech similar in capability to Voxelfarm, so that not everything is locked to a rigid grid, and things can be shaped more like the actual shapes of the real life products they emulate.  So wings looks like wings, you can put a light down in the same square as something else, etc.  Damage causes actual holes to be cut and not just destruction of an entire cube.  \n\n8. It has VR headset support, so you can actually feel like you are inside the things you create.\n\n9.  Aesthetic items have a purpose.  Crewmembers actually work faster inside an atmosphere, inside a centrifuge that provides artificial gravity.  (both the gravity and the air grant a bonus).  Crew need food.  If you grow the food in a visually pleasing greenhouse open to the sky, the crew enjoy it more than if the food is algae grown in a tube.  Crew enjoyment means the crew are willing to go on longer missions or accept less pay before they mutiny or become too depressed to maintain the ship.  Thus, a complete spaceship or large vehicle used on a planet that the player rides around in must have things in it that look nice and a place for the crew to live.  (versus Space engineers where you just need a power plug to charge your suit and regain HP, or Minecraft where you basically need 1 torch, a few squares of wheat, and a bed, and your character will live underground forever in a tiny cell with no complaints)\n\n10.  Probably the most important one of all.  This game would have to be constructed from the ground up with stability/reliability as the number 1 goal.  Instead of rushing a bunch of features in, every single subsystem would need to be exhaustively tested, early on, with exhaustive unit tests and regression tests and standard software quality procedures being followed.  The whole concept of this game is one where the player wants to build large and complex things, but the game has to be a rock solid foundation, or play sessions will soon end in tears.\n\nSpace Engineers is horrifically unstable and so most complex vehicles simply fail eventually, glitching themselves to oblivion.  Minecraft, large servers usually eventually crater in performance and become unplayable unless the map is reset.  In Kerbal Space program, a perfect space mission gets ruined because upon loading a save game with your rocket, it decides to shake itself to pieces or jitter about the sky.\n\nAll these games work fine at the small scale but fail at the large.  I think most players want to eventually make a vehicle so large that they will need a map to navigate it.  They want to make a spaceship or starship that is kilometers long. "

4n12ag,Smithing Simulator.,"I've had some time to give this idea some considerable thought on how I imagine it ""should"" be like.\n\nI imagine it to be first person. You'd have your own basic little smithing shop to do your work in. You'll get contracts to make tools/weapons/jewelry/etc... There would be a detailed process while making said items. You'd have to worry about buying the appropriate raw materials, buying/making the appropriate tools for said job, and then spend some time smithing the materials into something useful. As you make money, you may be able to upgrade your shop into a bigger one with more room and equipment.\n\nTo take it a step further, maybe there would be a village/town that your shop has an indirect impact on. Let's say you have a tiny shop in a small, remote village. They'll need farming tools. Perhaps there's a metal rich area nearby that you've heard about (I don't imagine there being an exploring mechanic in the game. Just word of mouth sort of stuff). You could take that information and smith up some mining tools. That would then encourage the village to set up a mining industry, giving you access to cheaper ores. Or perhaps there's a big forest nearby. You could smith up some axes and the village will develop a lumber industry; giving you cheaper access to wood. I imagine there would be a mechanic where the village naturally grows based indirectly on your actions as a smith.\n\nAssuming this pans out to be a popular game, should it be made, I already have some DLC in mind. In my mind, the base game takes place in medieval Europe. DLC could expand it to include the Bronze Age times, using Bronze Age technology. You could also make a Feudal Japan DLC. Perhaps you can go a bit further in age to colonial times, which includes gun smithing among various other things. \n\nOf course, this is my interpretation of how it should be. I'm sure you'd have your own vision of how it should be; but I'd really love to see something like this made. Thoughts? Questions? I'd love to hear them.\n\n"

4mxw2z,Conversation game,"A video game about talking to people.\n\nThe player is put in various situations and must use multiple choice dialogue to achieve certain goals. Their difficulty increases with the game: from trying to convince someone that you didn't steal their car(an easy lie), to negotiating billion-dollar corporation moves, to talking for your life, when cornered by thugs....\n\nIt could be a GTA-style of game, only focused on dialogue, rather then on action. The player would have to sometimes lie, seduce, or just find a way to tell the truth without doing too much damage.\n\nIt could be a continuous game(same character) or divided into scenarios or episodes centered around events(eg: in ""episode 1""  you're  working for an IT company and you have to convince your boss to give you a raise, in ""episode 2"", you're a lawyer you have to convince someone to testify against a criminal and in ""episode 3"", you're a thug and must convince your boss it wasn't your fault that the drug deal went bad and you lost both the money and the merchandise, etc...).\nThe situations are as diverse as your imagination..."
4mwdrp,The last mmorpg that ever needs to be made,"I've even thought of the best way to build this game. It should start off as a one planet/ space sim. The sim should have a home world where all players start. The home planet should be completely covered in city. Here you can decide what to do with your character. You can be a racer, a gun fighter(start off with laser tag and then move up to more serious levels), a merchant (the game should have the ability to buy and sell currency for real money at an exchange market anytime the player wishes) who can rent or buy stores to sell from at any high traffic area (the entire world should be purchase-able), profession masters who can make things better than otherwise available in the game,  colonists who will get on a government colony ship and head out to the stars where they will end up on a randomly generated planet with all the other colonists that were on that ship, and they can decide between them how to run the planet and who can do what to make sure it survives and flourishes, and miners who would buy or rent mining ships to collect valuable asteroids containing rare minerals. \n\n\nJust like in real life, you should be able to buy anything you want in the game. This includes vehicles of all kinds, even massive spaceships if you have enough money. Buy Land on home world, like luxury apartments or tropical islands. You can even buy your own colony ship, fill it with your guild, and go start your own planet. If you do you can hire government military to defend it, build your own system to defend it, or even not register it with the government so that barring an accidental discovery by another colony ship, no-one will even know you are there! Just remember, in space there are no laws! Everything goes! \n\nBringing me to my next point, the black market where you can buy weapons, and enter death matches. Any weapon can be bought for enough money. These places are dangerous just to enter, but worth it if you have the money and can come out alive.\n\nAs the game grows and more planets are settled, each planet will be different not just environmental, but the person or guild that settles it can start to make it how they want it. This means not only will they be able to pick the architecture style and plan the city layouts, but it should extend to, if they are programmers, they can write their planet into its own mini game within the universe. This will ensure COMPLETE diversity of a kind never before seen. Could you imagine leaving your guilds hunting/farming world to go exploring and happen to find an uncharted planet where suddenly you have magic powers and can hurl fireballs? Then you leave that planet and decide you want to play foot ball, so you land on a planet filled entirely with stadiums of different sizes playing all different sports, each with different rules and regulations corresponding to different leagues and regions, because one (now filthy rich) player had the foresight to colonize a planet close to home world, and then began to rent out areas of his planet to other players who also want to make sports games. The possibilities are endless!\n\n\nSince most mmos all ready have third party currency vendors, just skip the middle man and just have the game do it. Make most endeavours earn a little money, but some cost money. All the best stuff should cost money. All the boring stuff should earn it. Sometime you should be able to get lucky tho and earn allot, like gambling. There should also be money prizes for things like winning races or winning a deathmatch. But to enter it should cost money and things needed in it should cost money. Racing for example, players should either need to rent or buy a racecar. The faster the car, the more money it costs, but the more money you can win (our loose if you crash it!) , being in higher racing league brackets.\n\nDeath should not cost anything directly, but you should only be able to re spawn at the nearest house you own. If you don't own a house, back to the starting area with you. This can mean if you died on a colony planet, but had not built a home yet, you may not be able to make it back without spending a ton on chartering a ride back! \n\nAll vehicles should be destroy-able. This would add excitement because although even the best small fighter would not be able to take out a guild or government mother ship, if a ship was carrying a bomb, and could somehow get the mothership to let it close without destroying it first, that ship could dock and then set off the bomb, destroying the mothership!  Subterfuge would be part of the game"
4mw867,Music Band Tycoon?,"I had an idea long ago about a game based on Game Dev Tycoon but instead of making games, you take the role of a teenager with a band in the past. Also, note, band names could be changed to puns to avoid copyright just like Game Dev Tycoon. \n\n\nThe Beatles = *The Beetles*\n\nQueen = *King*\n\n\n**What do you mean by past...?**\nIn Game Dev Tycoon you start in the 80s, where the videogame market began to grow, and in Music Band Tycoon, you could start in the 70s, right when The Beatles disbanded. Let's say the context is ""Now that The Beetles are no longer united, the world wonders, what is going to happen the music industry?""...That's where your character, a teenager, enters.\n\nOf course, you're band must be a rock band by those years, as it's the most popular genre. In the beginning, you can customize your character (Only skin color, haircut, maybe shirt, genre, only basic stuff) and customize up to three more band members. Then you name your band and start.\n\n**The gameplay is...?**\n\nThis part gets fun. I had the idea of you selecting a topic, a genre (You start only with Rock, Pop-Rock, maybe Rockabilly), and as you move foward on music history, new genres will be unlocked (Rap, HipHop, Pop, Metal, and variations of each). Somo genres won't become less popular over the years, and while their fanbases may become smaller, those fans are loyal to the style *(Like Rock)*...\n\nTopics are as basic as: *Love, hate, death, happiness* or can go to weird stuff as *power, animals, dreams, frogs* and so...I'm not sure if a variety would be enough so maybe the topic system would need to get better ideas (Help in comments pls)\n\nThen, as not many people will have the patience to write whole songs out of nothing, you only make a title, the genre, topic, and start adjusting the bass, the guitars, and every instrument needed. You can make short piano instrumentals or up to orchesta-like songs, making larger songs, costs more. \n\nOnce you have the song I was thinking a Guitar Hero-like minigame could pop and let you have bonus effects on the song, but that's more work, isn't it? It would be complicated!\n\nAfter having a song ready, you can release it as a single, wich will sell a lot if its good, but will later stop having popularity. If you want, if you already have at least four songs or up to twelve songs, you can release an album, that will never stop being on stores, but it will later stop being popular after some months, or even a year.\n\n**How is that time thing you talked about?**\n\nAs said earlier, you are a band from the 70s, as you move foward and release new albums, new groups will appear, from Kings, Puns N' Roses, Tyron Maiden, up to Kanye East, Neminem Lady Gugu, and modern ""stars"" (I just came up with those names of course). You can even make collaborations with some artists, that will increase your popularity if you can reach them. Tragedies will also occour, as the death of many idols, tragic events around the world, just like real life. \n\n**Songs never stop selling?**\n\nAlbums. Albums never stop selling, every year you pay a lot of money to mantain albums in the market, if you decide that an album is no longer something that people buy, you can stop making more of it. If you release more than four albums and at least one of them has a song that got to #1 in any charts, you can release a Greatest Hits, where you can include up to twenty songs that reached a high position in any chart around the world.\n\nThese albums, like in real life, tend to have more people that buy them, as most songs in them are well known. \n\nWhen you reach the 2000s, iRunes, Gugul Play and other companies start selling digital albums, YouTube (Don't think there's problem there) starts existing and artists start using it, Internet changes the whole world, and your band will need to adapt to it.\n\n**The band lasts forever?**\n\nWell, your protagonist will most likely be inmortal, or at least he'll be alive until present days, so he'll be most likely in his 60s or 70s. But, your band members, will turn sick sometimes, will have problems with drugs and stuff, like many artists did.\n\nSome members may even get to the point where they want to kill youself. You'll need to help all your friends to survive during their rise *(or fall)* of fame. If a member dies or retires or you decide to fire him for anything, fans will become upset or angry depending on what happened, your band WILL get a lot of attention that could benefit or make everything worst, and there will be an empty spot that you can fill later.\n\nTribute Concerts, Tribute Albums, Movies, Songs dedicated to them, you can do many things. \n\n**And to finish all this...And the concerts?**\n\nThe minigame idea I had earlier could be used for concerts. After your band releases an album, you can perform live in bars or karaokes, and after your band gets a hit, you can start making concerts of your band.\n\nWho knows...Maybe you'll get a spot on Live Aid or USA for Africa?\n\nWhile in a concert you'll need to play a quick guitar hero minigame (At least two songs), and based on your gameplay, the concert will be determined as bad or good. Your live performances will get you a lot of fame.\n\n**DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO MAKE GAMES**\n\nNO. Well, I already tried, I made some simple 2D games, but to make a game like this, based on GDT, I don't know how.\n\nIf anyone has any idea or knows how to start making this, anything would be good for help. Tell me what do you think, would you play a game like this? :D "
4l26pj,They should have an X-men game where u start out as a mutant either living in the mansion or with the brotherhood. You begin with choosing 3 abilities.

4kyt46,Baldur's Gate style RPG never ending quest game.,"I really love the old school dice roll games like baldur's gate and icewind dale. The problem with these classics is that the story gets so stale when you have played through the game a billion times.\n\nMy idea is a game that keeps all the same dice rolling mechanics but there isn't really a built-in or standardized quest line. For the sake of describing how the game would work, we'll say there are 3 cities or towns.\n\nThese cities have their own ""culture"" which would coincide with the alignment system (good, neutral, evil). Each NPC has the potential to fill any role based on what is needed in each city. For example, an ""Unemployed"" citizen of the good city becomes a Priest because the last one was killed because stuff happened. The NPCs would give simple quests based on their professions and relationships with other NPCs (Fred has become an evil asshole! This is NEUTRAL city! Kill him!) Deeper quests could be programmed into the NPCs and unlocked either via quest chains or charisma/intimidation etc. On steam the game could be connected to the workshop where users could create their own NPCs with their own quest lines and rewards. These NPCs could ""migrate"" into one of the cities and be available for use. This would be a core mechanic of the game. I imagine this - if there are 10 possible roles in a given city, then there are 12 NPCs in that city. 2 NPCs are always looking for a way to gain a role in the city while the other 10 are trying to keep their role.  There would have to be some limitations that allow all NPCs to interact with each other on a rudimentary scale while still providing creative space. \n\nOver time different NPCs will die because of whatever and new ones will come in to replace them. This creates a never ending cycle of finding your place in the cities and completing new and different quests. \n\nYour role in the game is never something that an NPC could not do. You can usurp the positions of other NPCs by killing them or winning over their allies. You gain fame in a city by completing objectives congruent to the culture of the city. If you gain enough fame you can convince the city to attack another city with its army or whatever. You could technically have all cities subscribe to the culture you do, but it would be exceedingly difficult.\n\nThere is no ""end game"". The idea is to either become so powerful that you have influence in all the cities and you retire your hero to become a boss at the end of an NPC quest line that you upload to the workshop or you die trying. You start out as a nobody like any other RPG and build your character according to the same dice roll mechanics as Baldur's Gate.

4ky1kn,Other city building games+ideas,"First of all, I came across(and sometimes played) city building games based on the following: Ancient Egypt(Pharaoh+expansion, Children of the Nile), Ancient Greece(Zeus+Poseidon), Ancient Rome/Roman Empire(The Caesar series), Ancient China(Emperor), Middle Ages(The Stronghold series, Medieval Lords), Modern days(Cities XL series) and some futuristic tycoon city-type of games(eg: Moon Tycoon).\n\n--- I just got some ideas about similar games in different settings(I hope they don't already exist, please let me know if some of them do):\n\nAncient Babylon/Mesopotamia, Ancient India, Persian Empire, Norse/Viking, Ancient Japan, Biblical/Ancient Israel, Fantasy(explained in detail below), Ancient/Old Russia and Eastern Europe, Ancient/Old Africa,  United States(from the first people who arrived from Europe and made colony cities, to well into the 19 and maybe even 20th century), Sci-Fi/Alien city-builder.\n---- All these games should have game editors which would allow players to build their own levels and missions. They should be easy to use.\n--- Many of these games can feature a ""supernatural"" side, like mythology or local legends(creatures and events drawn from them). In the biblical game, there could be angels or giants(""nephilim""), or even demons. In the U.S. game, there could be old legends or literature based ""monsters"", such as the headless horseman.\n\nThis depends on the game's nature. Some games might feature gods(just like the already existing video games), depending on the game's setting.\n----- The U.S. game could feature a Native American campaign, centered around Native American cities/villages and their management. In both campaigns, there could be monsters or legends(see above) based on the Native American folklore/legends.\n\n---- These games could also feature a first-person option to better explore the city, where the player can assume the role of any citizen. The players could also assume soldier roles and the game(if a battle is being fought) could look like an RPG/Shooter.\n\n---- The Fantasy game would be similar to a medieval city builder(think Stronghold Legends), except there would be more fantasy elements, such as elves, orcs, goblins, trolls, etc. Players could choose whether to build human cities(castles) or play with other races(eg: rule and build elf cities, orc villages, etc.).\n\nRegardless of the chosen race, the player will have to deal with the others, and they could either become allies or enemies(depending on the player's choice). There could be a kind of evil ruler, a fantasy figure that rallies all evil orcs or goblins around it and be the final mission's opponent. It could be a dragon, a traitorous human or something else(think Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit). All the cities/races under its rule are rivals and may attack the player's city or wage war against the player and his/her armies.\n---- The Alien city can be as vast as you can imagine. It could feature advanced cities, spaceships, high-level technology, etc. The player can choose a pre-existing race, or create a new one from scratch. If this option is chosen, the player can choose the new race's name, whether it's humanoid or not, and many other features.\n\nYou start on an empty planet(or colony) and, once you build and develop your civilization there at a sufficient level, you can travel in outer space, forge alliances with other races, or engage in battles over territory, colonies and power.\n---- In this game, you could also visit Earth and either establish contact with top secret personnel, trade/exchange technologies or just invade/destroy/enslave the planet(just like every other planet or colony out there).\n"
4kwifq,Co-op games for friends who are fans of different genres,"A game for friends who are both gamers but enjoy different types of games might be an interesting concept.\n\nFor example a first person shooter game where the player has supply of health/ammo/shields or whatever he uses to fight enemies. And the other player could play some form of a puzzle game like Bejeweled or 2048 or Beoynd 14 in endless mode and the better they play the more stuff the FPS player would get. \n\nAnd there could also be a thing where the puzzle player can go for different types of combos in the game in order to give the FPS player certain types of supply. One combo to give HP, another to give ammo, one to give shields, or whatever. \n\nThis would technically be the equivalent of having a healer/engineer/support character playing with you, just that don't have to be playing the ""same game"" if you will.\n\nYou could even branch it out into a ""threesome"" game, in the sense that out of the FPS game you could make two different ones. One where you're piloting a craft of some sort, and another where you're a shooter on that craft and operate the arms.\n\nThis would allow one player playing a ""racing sim"", one playing FPS shoot'em'up and one is playing a ""healer minigame"".\n\nAnd of course the game could be designed into a single player mode as well, where you can swap into the other game types and the other ones would slow down to a crawl. And you would then have to switch between to achieve what you want. Low HP in the FPS game, jump into the heal game to heal yourself. Jump into the vehicle game to change location or find what you need. Jump back to FPS game to fight some more."
4kw7wd,"Dig Champs, a 2D MOBA planet destructible game where you fight a random boss","I made a subreddit to try and organize my thoughts, it's a couple years in my head but not yet on paper, /r/digchamps is the working name\n\nPremise: you are spawned in a 2D environment that curves downward near the edges, implying a roundness to the planet. As you walk around, you can walk around the whole planet. In concept, the camera is rotating around the planet, with down always facing to the center of the world. \n\nYou can destroy the landscape (think worms series) and burrow into the planet using either tools or moves. As you dig down, you might get money or ore or something to give it a moba type resource metric. \n\nOther players are also spawned on the planet. Maybe as a free for all, or as a team based play. Either way, there is an urgency to reach the center, collect resources, and kill opposing players to slow their progress\n\nThe center is a big hollow cavern, and within it is a random boss. The very center had a steel core that is indestructible, and ladders up to escape the gap between the core and the dig-able land. \n\nBosses could be a death laser that punishes users for digging straight down. One that oozes, so false paths are helpful. Any concept so that you are unprepared for the center. \n\nPlayers can pick different Heros, again following the moba feel, and you are pushing through a chaos of the center, and escaping to the top. \n\nWinner could be decided a number of ways. Either permadeath, and survivors win; or score based, or some other way. The focus is mostly on a 2D destructible landscape moba feel, where players use controllers not keyboard and mouse.  5 minute sessions are what I think would rule, way less investment than lol or dota \n\nA lot of these ideas are up for  debate, and I welcome all discussion. Just working on the initial idea and how to flesh out the concept. What would be the best and most fun win condition? What type of progress should players make outside each session? Hero unlocks? Skins? Items to unlock to buy in each session? \n\nTaking that fun play premise of overwatch or rocket league, that short but ultra competitive; and blend it with a little more moba feel. Maybe taking some of the concept from risk of rain controller feel, making a build over the play, and comfortable controller usage. \n\nI think it would be too much fun to play. Cross platform. Short and sweet. Stream friendly.  Top level play and entry level fun. "
4kvpug,Requesting player moves for a top down hold the flag,"Firstly: The key is simplicity. I want to keep the ability count to two, maybe three. (At least that's what I have in mind at the moment)\n\nSo far it is a top down game where a player picks up the flag and the other ones obviously chases him to take it for themselves. To take the flag the ability of choice is dashing into the flag-holder. I've considered adding a short speedup ability as well to add more possibilities. What could be some alternatives to the dash-attack, or ways to get the flag from the holder?\n\nShould I maybe add power-up spawns around the map to simplify the controls and still have multiple ""abilities""? Let's say it spawns speedups instead of an ability the player have under their control. It will be more randomized and less skill based, but might bring more fun to it regardless?\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thank you. "

4kt5vr,Idea for a muderfest with a lot of humour.,"Idea for game:  called Killing is Cray Cray\n\n\n\nThis would take quite a large studio to create but I just liked the idea and if it may inspire anyone to do something similar then great.\n\n\nAt first glace appears like a modern shooter similar to CoD but there are many differences you will find. There is a main objective (keep going) but there are items to collect that are side collectables that glow slightly orange. These will if you collect all 3 make crazy guns with absurd powers. One would be oil gun that you could shoot under the enemies feet and they all just start falling over (all animated nicely) and getting back up again and then keep falling over. One would be a mind melt gun that would make them berserk and start fist fighting their allies. Included in the animations would be the confusion and attempt to stop their friends berserking. This brings up a main point. There would have to be a massive emphasis on the character animations as they would have to be realistic and funny. There would be some other types of collectable guns that would mess up the comedy value.\n\n\nThere would also be hidden areas you can visit like there would be an open elevator in a building that would take you to an indoor theme park with arcade games, air hockey, crazy slides and a wave swimming pool. There would be no baddies and these areas would be just for fun and to win cash that you would then use at the end of each stage to buy ammo for the absurd guns. Another such area could be going into a tent in a field and seeing a sign for archery and being able to sign up for it and then having a go at archery, something similar to that if you know what I mean. These mini games would have to be fairly well hidden and could have NPC's in them; for example in the theme park area there could be a little boy saying he wants to play the games but has no money and you could either give him the money or cave his head in with melee then urinate on him. Urination everywhere is possible too and gains a small cash bonus when done onto dead enemies.\n\n\nThat's about it you get the idea, a mental fun fest of killing and fucking shit up, hidden as a modern shooter with an abundance of mini games throughout. \n\n\n"

4kb5rs,The Hatching of a Spider -- Delving into spider magic in order to become one with the arachnid.,"First off, let me say that despite spiders being as badass as they are, there aren't really any spider games. I mean I guess that being a normal spider would get boring pretty fast, but that's why you spice things up with some horrendous, terrifying cross-human magical mutation.  \n\n**Name:** The Hatching of a Spider\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* You gain spider powers and transformation abilities, because spiders are thematically one of the most badass species on Earth. \n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou're that weird girl who eats bugs and plays with the spiders, the complete opposite of arachnophobia. People say you should join the local spider cult, meaning it as an insult, but to you it seems like a pretty cool deal. The cult follows in the footsteps of an ancient race called the drow, people with a touch of spider magic in their blood. Many among the cult boast about having a drow heritage, but in reality those who are born with the heritage often die of defects. By chance, destiny, or shitty writing, you happen to have more drow blood running through your veins than anybody born since the drow fell. Due to this advantage, you easily ascend through the cult in the typical fashion, gaining a few of the powers of the drow and their spider brethren as you go. You start to change in appearance and personality as the magic of the cult exacerbates your heritage. Your skin gains a purple tinge, your ears point up slightly, your hair begins to pale, and your eyes slowly turn to black. The presence of such drow blood stirs an ancient god, the god of the drow and spiders, and they bestow their ultimate blessing upon you before giving you your quest: to make the spiders the top of the food chain again. \n\n**Setting:**\n\nThe time period is close to modern day, there are just less things to keep the troublemakers inside their houses. You spend most of the initial part of the game either in the area used by the cult or at school, both good places to test out your horrendous abilities. After you receive the blessing of the spider, the cult is basically useless to you so you set out to bring chaos down upon the area.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* You play as a homeless orphan who lives off of eating insects. The local school courtyard  has a healthy amount of rich dirt that is full of bugs, as well as big trees fit for spiders, so that is where you naturally spent most of your time. The girl doesn't really have a name either, I'm not sure if I want to give her one. \n\n * From a young age you started displaying an affinity for spiders. They would always bring you food when you were hungry and understood your needs. The drow magic enhances nearby spiders to suit the needs of the spider god's children. \n\n * As you developed into a drow, your body underwent immense changes, giving you some spiderlike qualities as well as many other traits the drow were known for. For example, you started releasing spider pheromones that affect the people around you, causing you to be more persuasive and seem more attractive. \n\n * If you know anything about spiders then you know what kind of abilities you will get upon receiving the blessing. \n\n* The cult isn't just any cult, it's a cult after the fashion of the drow. As such, everybody in the cult is constantly scheming and watching their own back, trying to kill the people in positions above them while trying desperately not to die themselves. Despite being a teenage girl, you are able to backstab your way to the top of the cult while utilizing the abilities of the spiders.\n\n * The cult was born from the discovery of drow religious texts, detailing the path of the drow priestesses. However, a good portion of the pages were either missing, burnt, or in a language long forgotten. The drow did not want such dangerous knowledge falling into the hands of humans, especially since it was likely the cause of their fall in the first place.\n\n * Due to the damage the books sustained and the scarcity of drow blood, the cult didn't have nearly enough power to use any drow magic without careful preparation within their borders. You recognize the language like it was a long-lost friend, so you are able to gain access to unique abilities and advance much faster than anybody else.\n\n* The residents of the local school spread some quite nasty rumors about you, so you received no sympathy from anyone. Unsurprisingly, after you started to develop the fine features and pheromones of the drow, some of the school's male population began trying to flirt with you. Aware of your superiority as a drow, and of the human's filthy ways, you take this as a personal insult. Whenever you pass by the school, your spiders feed well. \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The drow are not a race of toughness for direct confrontation, so neither are you. They are a race of intelligence and charisma, gathering information, plotting, and carefully preparing before assassinating upper cult members to ascend their rank. This is one of the most dangerous parts of the game, because you constantly have to watch your back. Though this is also where spiders can get the most use. \n\n* You need to feed on blood regularly to keep up your drow magic and, later, to produce silk and eggs. \n\n* The cult is seen as a joke by the rest of the town, so nobody believes what they teach. As such, people will often attack the cult buildings for fun. After you join the cult, quite a few pranksters begin to go missing around the cult area, and quite a few drained husks show up in the woods.\n\n* After giving you the blessing, the spider god takes control of the cult and makes a few changes to fit the lost drow tradition and to get the cult to a reasonable enough amount of power to go out and start war. Most of the males were killed off pretty quickly as the female spider is much superior, though males of high power were allowed to live as long as they accepted their place. After testing a few major abilities on random civilians to feed the spiders, the cult brings the attention of the local authorities upon themselves, resulting in a full-scale assault on the cult. \n\n* You have the option of learning traditional drow weapons as well. Poisoned bows and daggers, for striking when your enemy least expects it. Nets of silk that are light and throwable, as well as immensely sticky.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* The most important part about being a spider is the ability to spin webs. A system is needed where you able to walk around, choosing two spots, and creating strings of web. A swarm of spider minions can build up areas of webs over time. This is also the thematically and mechanically best method of feeding.\n\n* As you grow, you begin to produce egg sacs full of vicious giant spiders. Being what you are, these spiders are also quite intelligent and follow your every command. You have access to a wide range of different spider species. Orb-weavers for building webs, wolf spiders for vision and hunting, jumping spiders for mobility and surprise, and many others. Real-life spiders are actually pretty goddamn crafty. They can spin nets and throw them and also build decoy spiders out of dead insect parts.\n\n* You aren't exactly a spider, you can just switch between forms. Your ability to interact with the environment changes drastically with your form. There is also the middle ground hybrid form: spider legs and mandibles, opposable thumbs, hardened skin, and a weak spinneret for basic purposes. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* It could actually be played on consoles as well as PCs quite well. I can also see the Wii U tablet being quite purposeful for weaving webs. \n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* The game is at your own pace. You choose when and what to learn. Though I think it would be funny if there was one cult member who got brain damage from a spider bite, and he follows you around while continuously asking if you're ""ready"" for the next lesson. Great part about being in a cult is that murdering your fellow cult members is expected, and even encouraged. \n\n* You need a good amount of small talk, persuasion, and threats in order to find out the whereabouts of specific cult members. All of them have a pre-programmed routine that you need to work out in order to get the jump on them. Cult members are very good at running and hiding. \n\n * I think I would want to put a LOT of emphasis on the relationship between yourself and the spiders, right from the start. Like there are random spiders all over your body that people don't question. Perhaps every time you bend over a few spiders fall out of your hair. That'd also be a good way to do respawning, if you wake up in a cocoon in the woods somewhere with a lot of your spiders sacrificed for your life.\n\nThe drow are D&amp;D creatures, and there is actually a [very interesting](http://docdro.id/wPk9MB3) book that describes their society and culture in great detail. It's hard to find a greater evil. They are basically all Hannibal Lecter except with actual psychopathy, no love, and their manners are out of fear. "

4oo5r2,New combat system,"So... I have to admit I found this subreddit over google, just so I can write down my idea and have people react to it.  Chances are I'm breaking some rules (for example this is not a game idea but an idea for a combat system) or something but here it goes: (you can skip the first paragraph, it just explains how I got to the idea) \n\nA lot of games with sword fighting in them have one of two problems.  Either the ingame fights are dull, boring and rely on special effects to make the fights look cool or the fights are complex, difficult and the players find themselves forced doing dodge roles until they have a chance to attack, followed by dodge roles again. \n\nSo I thought of a different system, where you lose some degree of control over your character, but simultaneously gain some by having decision making a key part of the fight. \nEvery move by your enemy would be followed by a brief slow-motion segment where you can choose your characters reaction. Of course the downside for the developers would be that they have to choreograph and animate all possible outcomes and decisions that a player could make, however such a system would be way more imersive than the other 2 combat systems I mentioned. \n\nAssassins Creed has some elements of this combat system integrated. But for once you don't really have this decision making process, since a ""counter attack"" is always the best possible decision you can make, and also the combat system is repetitive in the sense that every enemy you encounter has the same movements, which makes Assassins Creed Combat have very little variations and thus dull after you experienced all choreographed movements. \n\nOf course you can't choreograph all fights in a fighting based game like this,  because even one such fight is huge work for the animators. \nNo. I thought of it more as a solution for boss fights. Naturally,  you could also have this system in a game where there are little to no fights at all. \n\nTL;DR -  Kind of new combat system: Every action by your enemy is followed by a decision on your part.  All possible fights are pre-animated and choreographed. Could be fast paced or rather strategic depending on how much time you have between each of your decisions. \n\nEdit: \nTo make the fights more realistic and avoid too much production time, each fight could possibly also only take a few seconds and maybe 2 or three decisions until you hit a lethal blow or injure your enemy to the point where they can't fight anymore (or the other way round)."
4onq9m,Simple RPG Game Ideas?,"I am interested in making a game similar to that of Misao, OFF, Ib, etc. I would be using the same software as OFF and Ib. The thing is, I'm lacking Ideas. I'm not looking for anything in depth, just basic ideas or plots. Once I get started I can come up with things pretty well. It needs to be somewhat easy to make. May or may not include a battle system. Not too interested in making a battle type game. More of a puzzle and problem solving game. In Ib, the main character runs from threats in a maze like setting and finds ways to block them from coming to her, instead of engaging in combat. If you have any ideas, please let me know. Anything is welcome. Horror is what I'm aiming for, but I'm open to any ideas. "
4oni20,Game where you are a paparazzi informer!,"I have wanted a game like this for a couple of years now. It would be very similar to Grand Theft Auto or Watchdogs where you can drive around and spy on people, kill people, steal stuff, etc. The great thing about it would be you can spy on crazy celebrities, politicians and other rich people (heavily based off of real people without using their names perhaps). Break into their houses, steal stuff from them, cause havoc! I think it would be a fun game!\n\n(pm me if this becomes a thing - I'd love to do the voice acting for a female character!)"

4ol616,Project Vallout ( Fallout 4 + Zootopia video game idea),"Before you read,I just want to say that I am not good at writing and I am very new to Reddit. Also I am from Malaysia\n\nThe Backstory\nThe Soviet Union is still standing until today. The U.S. have created Project Vallout. This project aims to destroy the Soviet Union and it's allies by creating sentient mammals that will serve the American military. But the mammals doesn't want to co-operate with the US. So the mammals run to whole world for refuge. Some countries accepted these mammals rights. But some don't&gt; The US said that the Soviet Union have planned the mammal escape. The US declare war on The soviet Union because of this reason. The Soviet Union and it's allies dropped nukes at all countries that joined NATO. \n\nThe Player Story\nThe player is a test subject in a laboratory under the Canadian Soil. Later you were saved by a group called Freedom Watchers. You are nicknamed by the Watchers as The Test Subject. You can pick if you want to play as a human or mammals such as Bunny/Hare/Rabbit, Fox and a bear. You will adventure in an area called New Columbia at west Canada. In this region you will solve a struggle between the Republic of Columbia just a small republic and The Internationale Order Which is a Canadian Soviet Union 40 times more larger than the republic. But there is a large robot army led by a cyborg in a nearby university.\n\nThe Mechanics\nSeveral mechanics that will be in the game:\n-This game will not have VATS but will have a different targeting system\n-The protagonist will not be voiced\n-The dialogue system will be similar like Fallout New Vegas\n-Realistic\n-8 companion with unique backstory and quest\n-The weapon modification system will be simplified\n-There is 3 major faction with 5 endings\n-The current named of this game is Project Vallout ( This will be changed in the future )\n-I will try keep the scope of this game small as possible without interrupting most of the storyline\n\nThe only reason reason I post my idea. Is because I wanted to know your opinion on this idea."
4oholl,The Turings -- a semi-idle RPG inspired by Bladerunner,"*What is a Turing?*  You are, and so is almost everyone else you meet.  The real question is: are you man or are you machine?  Following a fear-mongering campaign against them by the new President, all human-like androids have been outlawed by the State.  It's up to you, citizen, to help us find them!\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe Turings -- You and all the other players.\n\nThe Brain Police -- Secretive police agents of the state.\n\nThe Drones -- Obliviously-robotic merchants of various goods.\n\n**Overview:**  Based in a dystopian future.  Text-heavy multiplayer RPG with desires to fulfill like hunger and sleep.   Players can interact (with mutual agreement) to trade or just chat.  Combat is nonexistent.\n\nWhen players stop playing, their avatar doesn't leave the world but instead becomes an NPC.  The server does its best to mimic the play and chat styles of that player.\n\nDuring any interaction a player may summon The Brain Police if they suspect who they're interacting with is a machine (i.e. a NPC.)  Players are rewarded for successfully identifying a machine/ NPC and heavily penalized for accusing a human of such dastardly things.  Identified machines are removed from gameplay (""put in jail"") until that player logs in again.\n\nPlayers who are caught sleeping can automatically be marked as a machine-- best be getting home when your energy is running low!\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nCreating a backend that allowed for multiple services to provide the logic behind idle players.  This would be an excellent way to test chat-bots.  Different services could compete with each other and receive feedback on which of them was the best at fooling players.\n\n**Platform:**  \n\nMost likely a web-based game.\n\n**Flaws:**  \n\nWithout combat, another mechanic to motivate players will be needed.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**  No need, it's just half an idea.\n\n*You don't help the tortoise.

4ohmwy,Instance Based Dungeon Clearing (Warframe meets Vermintide and Mordhau),"This game would be an online co-op PvE game where your goal is to clear dungeons of increasing difficulty but the thing is that once you die, it's for good. Yeah, permadeath. In order to not make the game incredibly frustrating though, there would be some kind of checkpoints (after a certain number of dungeons cleared you restart a bit further for example)\n\nOkay, but what's the gameplay? I'll try to keep this brief, but basically I would like the players to feel that death (PERMAdeath) is always near, and that you can die even in the easier dungeons. The combat would be mostly melee and skilled based (Think Chivalry, Mordhau) and your gear will also improve as you complete dungeons so that you really feel like you are progressing. \n\nI have so much more to say about this game so if you would be interested in it, just ask me, I'll answer in the comments.\n\n"

4ogykj,A FPS where you can only propel yourself using the recoil of your gun,
4og7n6,Game of Thrones - A Realistic MMO,"The main goal of the game is to gain as much power and fame as possible, not unlike the TV show or books. Each player starts out small and has to work their way up to either a farmer, mayor, knight, Lord, or even the king of the Iron Throne. There would not be any NPC's because the nature of the game requires hundreds of players to fill specified rolls. A player could be a merchant, a craftsman, or both, or anything else they want to be. Success is truly in the eyes of the player, as some players will be happy creating a small home or clan and securing it for themselves. Others won't be happy until they are the high Lords in a big castle and have many soldiers under their command.\n\nGameplay and combat will be similar to Chivalry. Even the most advanced players can be killed with a few well timed strikes from a low level character. Better equipment and armor can certainly help, but it won't make you invincible. At the character creation, you can pick certain perks and abilities that will help you on your quest for success. You can choose to learn combat skills more quickly, or begin the game with a headstart in trading or crafting. The mechanics would be designed to allow a truly realistic, tangible world for players to live in.\n\nWhen the game is first released, the already existing castles and lands would be intact. This way, players will have a guideline to follow when creating their own clans or houses. Castles must be built, and castles can be torn down. Players will most likely race to occupy existing lands and buildings, but eventually the victors will emerge on top and new orders will begin to form.\n\nThe gameplay would truly be simple, but would be very advanced in comparison to the fetch quests and dungeons of most other MMOs. The only true gameplay elements would be survival, simple combat, and the ability to trade with other players, as well as mine, farm, craft, and stuff like that. For instance, the king of the iron throne would most likely delegate his many soldiers to do various jobs and help claim alliances, while other players would be common farmers directly affected by the king. Some players will choose to form their own houses, creating their own schedules, castles, and lands to inhabit. Since the game would have a limited amount of land that players must occupy, future DLC could introduce new islands or territories for players to control. This gives absolute value to land and buildings, since only so many players can occupy them at a time. This creates incentive for new or low level characters to become soldiers, farmers, or wanderers in order to survive, keep a fair amount of wealth, and potentially find favor in the eyes of the lords.\n\nHow players would choose to rule kingdoms that they own is entirely up to the player because there are no rule sets or codes determining how to do so. If a player wants to be malevolent, they can do so. If a player wants to be a fair ruler, they can do so. There is always considerable incentive to become famous in this world, because that is the only leaderboard or measure of success. The farmer known for his many lands who can give you tons of food at a cheap price would be considered successful because everyone would know who he is.\n\nThe main driving feature here would definitely be a survival system, not unlike DayZ. If farmers are to be useful or craftsman are to be hired, there has to be a demand. Players would need to eat and drink, and keep their general health up in order to survive without beginning a new character. Permanent death is always something to fear.\n\nThrough great feats of craftsmanship or discovery, dragons, magic, and other fantastical things can be found and used in this world. Perhaps a player is out exploring and through a random drop, discovers a magical stone that increases the effectiveness of food. Perhaps this player would want to begin a cult or religion based around the stone. With some planning and smart strategies, the player could make a considerable amount of money while becoming famous for this stone. Drops like this would need to be adjusted so they are very rare, in order for them to not become common.\n\nSorry about the wall of text. I do a lot of driving to and from work, and this has been something on my mind lately for no discernible reason. Decided to turn on talk to text and make a post while I was driving! Please feel free to comment with your own ideas or suggestions. Hopefully someone else will find this idea as interesting as I do, even though I doubt we will ever see something like this come to the gaming world. Thank you for reading!"

4od1uy,"Using Blockchain technology to make a decentralised, truly free-to-play game","This is an engine-type idea which could apply to a number of genres, I'm going to use a Collectable Card Game as an example, but I could imagine using it for a say Pokemon clone, or any kind of multiplayer, turn-based game where the results of each match give rewards/penalties which affect the player's subsequent matches.\n\nI have a couple of problems with ""Free-to-play"" games. One is that they are hardly ever really free, because they usually include microtransactions that are often nearly compulsory to actually win or have fun. The other is that eventually, the servers will shut down when the game ceases to be profitable, rendering the game unplayable.\n\nUsing peer-to-peer and blockchain technology can solve these issues. In most games without centrally-controlled servers, it becomes far too easy to cheat, but cryptocurrencies show that it is possible to keep transactions between adversarial parties honest without a central broker.\n\nIt would work something like this: A new player creates an ""account"", which is really just a public/private key-pair. They automatically get a basic starter deck (probably every player would get the same starting cards, since the algorithms need to be deterministic, but there might be ways around that.)\n\nThey join a match with another player (the same P2P network used for exchanging blockchain info would be used for matchmaking), and both players broadcast signed messages stating that they've begun a game. Each player plays cards in turn according to the rules of the game; each move is sent to the other player as a signed transaction. At the end of the game, the winner bundles all the moves into a block, which they broadcast to the network. This entitles them to gain a new card, which is chosen pseudo-randomly using the move data as a seed. Alternatively, they could be awarded in-game cryptocurrency, which they could then exchange for cards.\n\nNo one can play a card they don't legitimately own, because their opponent can use the blockchain to check whether they have that card or not.\n\nOutside of games, the blockchain could also be used to trade cards, or buy/sell cards for in-game currency.\n\nThere are of course quite a few flaws with this design, but they might be surmountable, and I welcome any suggestions.\n\n* Lack of secrecy. Since blockchain tech relies on both parties having full knowledge, you couldn't really have a game with hidden hands, or indeed decks. Each player would be able to know what cards their opponent holds (would have to know, to prevent cheating), so you'd have to design the rules of the card game around that.\n* Lack of true randomness - since blockchain tech needs to be deterministic and transparent, it's hard to have much randomness in the game, but you can mostly get around this by using the blockchain itself as a seed for the pseudo-random number generator.\n* Sockpuppets - there wouldn't be much to stop someone from creating multiple sockpuppet accounts to play against, thus getting lots of easy ""wins"" by playing both sides. One way to prevent/mitigate this would be to introduce actual ""mining"" for account creation, or claiming rewards, or both, but this favours people with more powerful computers, making it a form of pay-to-win."

4ocb61,A game that revolves around a rifle that utilizes and manipulates the electromagnetic spectrum,"TRIED TO ORGANIZE THIS POST AS MUCH AS I COULD, VERY SORRY IF IT IS CONFUSING BUT I PROMISE IT IS WORTH THE READ!\n\nSo I was in my chem class learning about the electromagnetic spectrum when I thought to myself ""What if a gun existed that could shoot in any wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum?"" I did a little extra research on the topic, and it turns out that such a thing kind of exists. Enter DEWs (Directed Energy Weapons), pretty much a modern day laser. I have a feeling in my gut that most people have heard of this before, and I probably have seen it before myself, but I never was this interested in them before. Now, I found that the ""highly focused energy"" the weapon utilizes can in fact come in the form of electromagnetic radiation. So, what if an FPS puzzle game revolved around a weapon (reminiscent of Portal?) that could utilize and manipulate the entire electromagnetic spectrum?\n\n\n\nNow, all the electromagnetic spectrum is is a range of how long an electromagnetic wave can be. The length of these waves is measured in hertz (Hz), and within the electromagnetic spectrum, there are different types of wavelengths. For example, the longest and least concentrated type of wavelength is a radio wave, while one of the shortest and most highly concentrated types of wavelengths is an x-ray.\n\n\n\nHere is a breakdown of each type of wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum, accompanied by a possible in-game use for the wavelength and how higher/lower concentrations of the wavelength affect its effect. Some I am not sure about yet. I'm sure we could brainstorm more uses together. Under the electromagnetic spectrum, each type of wavelength can only be output within a specific range of hertz.\n\n\n \n* **Gamma:** Could act as the ""bullet"" of the rifle. Gamma rays are the most highly concentrated wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum, therefore they are the most dangerous. *Higher concentration = stronger shots, lower concentration = weaker shots*\n\n* **X-Ray:** Obviously, this could be used to see through any obstruction. *Higher Concentration = Farther sight, lower concentration = nearer sight*\n\n* **Ultraviolet:** Can burn a target when pointed at a target for certain period of time? *Higher concentration = shorter amount of time til burn, lower concentration = longer amount of time til burn*\n\n* **Visible Light:** Lights up dark areas. *Higher concentration = Brighter, lower concentration = Dimmer*\n\n* **Inferred:** Could be used to solve certain puzzles? *Higher concentration = More potent, lower concentration = less potent*\n\n* **Microwave:** Really not sure about this one yet. I mean microwaves are used to cook stuff but are we really going to use a gun to cook stuff to survive or something? There has to be a better use.\n\n* **Radar:** Acts as your minimap and could reveal potential threats/enemies. Works in tandem with radar screened displayed on rifle. *Higher concentration = Clearer radar, lower concentration = blurrier, harder to read radar*\n\n* **Radio:** Radio waves are available for use on the rifle, but will prove to be useless, unless someone thinks of a use for them in the rifle, because I honestly just can't. Radio waves will be used with a helmet that is synced with the rifle (More on this later).\n\n\n\n\nHere's my idea of the weapon that would utilize the electromagnetic spectrum, along with its features:\n\n\n\n\n* Resembles a futuristic looking assault rifle\n\n* Has a knob that is used to adjust the number of hertz being output by the weapon, tunes into specific wavelengths.\n\n* A small screen that displays the number of hertz currently being output by the rifle.\n\n* Another screen to monitor radar waves being output\n\n* A revolving barrel with multiple barrels used to output wavelengths in different ways\n\n* Switch that cycles through quite a few firing modes\n\n* Need to be recharged in order to output higher concentrated waves (larger numbers of hertz). This gameplay element would make it difficult to reach higher concentrated, more powerful and useful wavelengths. Using higher numbers of hertz in firing modes that use lots of light will quickly drain battery (More on this later).\n\n\n\nAfter reading the description of that weapon, you may be thinking to yourself ""That gun has way too much going on and it is WAY too busy"", but that is exactly how I want it to be.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important elements of this game is that I want it to be entirely manual. In other words, you find this crazy looking weapon that makes you wtf and you have to figure out how to use it. I would like if most information that would normally be placed on a HUD would be visibly placed on the rifle. This includes the number of hertz currently being output and even a screen that monitors radar, since the rifle utilizes radar waves. This would also eliminate the need for a minimap on the HUD. The HUD should be very limited. Battery life of the rifle could also be visibly placed on the rifle. Honestly would just like to have the rifle look complicated and intimidating asf at first glance. This is the only information that should be revealed to the player when they first come across the weapon:\n\n\n\n\n1. You can adjust the amount of hertz output by the rifle by turning and adjusting the knob\n\n2. You can cycle through the barrels on the rifle (Narrow lens, wide lens, antenna)\n\n3. You can change the firing mode of the rifle (Laser, full auto, semi auto, pulse)\n\n\n\nThese three attributes should be explored by the player, combining how many hertz you are firing, which barrel you are using and which firing mode is enabled. There are compatible and incompatible combinations. And some combinations are compatible but don't make sense to use.\n\n\n\nFor example, trying to fire visible light out of the antenna barrel would not work, but firing radar waves out of the antenna would work. These are some of the simple puzzles you would solve in the beginning of the game.\n\n\n\nThe player may also possibly learn what type of wavelength they are using by firing their weapon at kiosks placed randomly throughout the beginning of the game world. The kiosk could tell the player the name of the wavelength they are currently using, but that is all. It would not tell the player the range that that wavelength exists in the electromagnetic spectrum, the player must find that out for themselves.\n\n\n\n**Recharging:** I'm not entirely sure how, but I want the rifle to need to be charged up in order to reach the higher concentrated wavelengths. There could be charging stations randomly placed in rooms around the game world or something. So if you actually want to be able to have bullets, see through walls, slowly burn things, or even have a radar, you must charge the weapon. While the weapon is charging, you should not be able to use it. \n\n\n\nDuring this time the character will have to wield their emergency sidearm, although I have not decided what I want this to be yet. All I know is that it cannot do any harm, that is what gamma rays are for, the highest concentrated wavelength, which is difficult to attain. There must be a risk in recharging your weapon. Somehow, it has to be difficult to not have your weapon, it must be somewhat difficult to achieve higher numbers of hertz.\n\n\n\nHigher concentrated wavelengths should not be thought of as endgame unlocks. Gamma rays are available to you at the beginning of the game, it all depends on your personal skill of how good you are with surviving without your rifle. \n\n\n\nI think this gameplay mechanic would be very interesting, and I need your guys help figuring out some of this stuff and how it would work. It would be nice to hear some of your ideas in the comments. It all depends on what kind of game it is in the end.\n\n\n\n**Game Environment:** I feel like this game would work best in a slightly more hostile, controlled Portal like environment. Possibly make the atmosphere a little darker than Portal? Where there are puzzles that must be figured out with the weapon the game is focused around, but there also must be some more baddies and danger involved. This would help in making the recharging mechanic work well, like a rewards system almost. Since the game is very manual, it would probably be a little slower paced. Lots of places to hide from and shoot behind from, and adjust your weapon.\n\n\n\n\n**Helmet:** Obviously all of these wavelengths are invisible (Except for visible light, of course), so a peripheral is needed in order to view the wavelengths being fired. Your character will always be wearing a helmet that has a visor that is synced to the rifle. When the hertz are adjusted on the rifle, the visor, synced with the rifle, will allow the player to view whatever wavelength is being fired. It would be neat if when the hertz are adjusted in the game, the visor could seamlessly change the appearance of everything the player is looking at; a really cool atmospheric effect. Could possibly be too much though. Still an interesting idea. When the hertz are adjusted to the visible light range, that is when everything could look normal through the visor. The helmet would also feature an antenna, used for picking up radio waves to listen to transmissions. This would only work when the hertz on the rifle are adjusted to radio range.\n\n\n\n\nWow, you cared enough to read all the way to the end! That's pretty much all I got on it, I think the general idea of the weapon could be applied in a lot of different ways, however I think the game environment I mentioned would work best. Thank you so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed my game idea, I really wanted to get this out to the world somehow. Feel free to discuss, comment, suggest, or ask me any questions! Thank you so much for reading :)"

Then use that wood to build walls or potion or anything.\nNext base-building \n\n• I was thinking about not having your base in the over world but rather on a separate room so that way anyone can find your base and try to raid it.\n\n• How will it look? The surface of the “room” wouldn’t be that big so players will have to build multiple floors there would be no limit on the amount of floors that you can build, but they can only be in 1 direction : up or down. To avoid players just building unlimited amounts of floors you, when you enter your base you’ll always start on the ground (or first floor and) have make you walk all the way to your treasury to deposit your items. Of course there will be teleporters to make it a bit less time consuming but they would have a range limit to only 2 floors.\n\n• What to do in your base? Your inventory and gold storage will be limited so you would have to deposit whatever it is that you’re carrying in the treasure of your “home”.\n\n• The Treasury: Every base has to have a treasury, this has to be either the lowest or highest floor of your base and is the ultimate goal for invaders to reach. Of course when players get to your treasure the wouldn’t be able to take everything only a set percentage would be available for them to steal.\n\n• How will construction go? I was thinking a bit like Lego block’s you split your tower in half put in another piece (or floor in this case) and put it back together.\n• Every floor will be dividable into several rooms and a staircase in the middle. (the shape of a floor will be fully customisable. Like pick up the staircase put it somewhere else. Add a balcony to look outside ext.…\n\n• How to protect your base? Just standard things like traps, turrets and also NPC’s.\n\n• Wait NPC’s??? yes you could spawn in a certain amount of NPC’s per floor and be able to assign them a role\n\n• The npc would be fully customisable from the way they look to the race, the skills, role heck even the animations. These npc would cost money depending on what lvl you wish them to be.\n\n• How will they defend? Simple they will execute the commands you gave them for example: when enemy attack circle for time and do skill/attack x\n\n• When NPC die? I don’t know yet I would like npc to be able to accompany you to the overworld but when they are killed outside the base they would cost money to respawn, in the base I’m not sure yet.\n\n• The difficulty level of your base would be measured by the number of traps + the strength of the npc’s so no one alt lvl 10 would be in a base with lvl 50 npc’s.\n\n• Raiding? I would suggest making a system where you or your party could join a lobby and a number of bases which would be the right difficulty level would be available to raid.\n\nBut anyway these are just some thought of an 18 year old kid who would like to see a game like this.\nThank you for reading"

Of course there will be teleporters to make it a bit less time consuming but they would have a range limit to only 2 floors.\n• What to do in your base? Your inventory and gold storage will be limited so you would have to deposit whatever it is that you’re carrying in the treasure of your “home”.\n• The Treasury: Every base has to have a treasury, this has to be either the lowest or highest floor of your base and is the ultimate goal for invaders to reach. Of course when players get to your treasure the wouldn’t be able to take everything only a set percentage would be available for them to steal.\n• How will construction go? I was thinking a bit like Lego block’s you split your tower in half put in another piece (or floor in this case) and put it back together.\n• Every floor will be dividable into several rooms and a staircase in the middle. (the shape of a floor will be fully customisable. Like pick up the staircase put it somewhere else. Add a balcony to look outside ext.…\n• How to protect your base? Just standard things like traps, turrets and also NPC’s.\n• Wait NPC’s??? yes you could spawn in a certain amount of NPC’s per floor and be able to assign them a role\n• The npc would be fully customisable from the way they look to the race, the skills, role heck even the animations. These npc would cost money depending on what lvl you wish them to be.\n• How will they defend? Simple they will execute the commands you gave them for example: when enemy attack circle for time and do skill/attack x\n• When NPC die? I don’t know yet I would like npc to be able to accompany you to the overworld but when they are killed outside the base they would cost money to respawn, in the base I’m not sure yet.\n• The difficulty level of your base would be measured by the number of traps + the strength of the npc’s so no one alt lvl 10 would be in a base with lvl 50 npc’s.\n• Raiding? I would suggest making a system where you or your party could join a lobby and a number of bases which would be the right difficulty level would be available to raid.\nBut anyway these are just some thought of an 18 year old kid who would like to see a game like this.\nThank you for reading"
4o7fzf,"My Dreamgame (Yes, my idea is too big...)","**Preface**    \n\nI have had this concept in my mind for a long time and I feel the need to write it down, so this is more a way for me to vent rather than to give someone an idea for a new game. The concept is either new and unique nor easy to do. This concept is my dream game that most likely never will be developed to the extent that I would be satisfied. So I'm not writing this in hopes of somebody actually picking it up and make it because that would only a big company afford to do. It is more a way for me to vent and get some of it in writing that I can go back and edit later on as well as get some feedback. Possibly from someone else that might enjoy a game with this concept.\n\nI come from a background of playing all sorts of games. And any zombie-survival game usually ends pretty high up on my ""best games list"".\nSo I have gotten a lot of inspiration off of the games I've played. To give you an example and to help you to understand where I am coming from I'm gonna list a few of my favorites:    \n\n* Arma II &amp; Arma III: Wasteland &amp; Epoch &amp; DayZ Mods *(Ultimately this with zombies and a proper base-building mod implemented would be the dream)*    \n* State of Decay    \n* Ark: Survival Evolved    \n* 7 Days to Die    \n* Fallout 4    \n\n... and of course the normal games like CS, CoD*, Wc3, and most recently Overwatch and The Division.    \n\nMovies and series like TWD is also a huge part of my inspiration of course.\n\n(*^Note: Not anything newer than Modern Warfare tho, best of the series was United Offensive.)    \n\n*****    \n\n**Name:** Mortalis (Placeholder name)    \n\n*****\n\n**Concept Overview:**    \n\n* 1st/3rd person shooter (Think arma)    \n* MMORPG (So no singleplayer and story)    \n* Open-world    \n* Survival    \n* Heavily dependent on base building, crafting, and looting. ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLC3v1x4wrw) is a quick video with Arma III base building in action.)    \n* PvPvE World with random generated events *(Such as basedefending against hordes of zombies, scavenging missions, elimination missions etc. etc. )* and constant resource zones that can be captured.      \n* The only teams/factions are the ones players form themselves ingame.    \n\nThe gameplay will be dependent on teamplay but not a must. It's core setup should encourage teamplay.    \n\nThe most important aspects of the game to me would be:    \n\n* Team play    \n* Build your own sanctuary/base    \n* PvPvE\n\n*****    \n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe usual zombie apocalypse stuff. The world has gone to shit. Zombies everywhere. Survive and build your own sanctuary in a demanding world. Live off the land and what the wildlife has to offer. Fight zombies and other players for resources, weapons, building materials and most important, to survive.    \n\n*****    \n\n**Setting:**    \n\nModern time, huge open world map with urban areas, rural areas,  cities and of course nature/wilderness.    \n\n*****\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe idea is that everyone starts out as regular people (civilians) with some basic survival training. Based on how you create you character at the time you will get a certain trait that will be helpful in some parts of the game. Almost like a basic class trait. It could be a small boost in something like gathering of food or scavenging. Something that some people can have IRL.    \n\nWhen you are out earning experience in the world you can unlock certain classes, or beginning of a class tree. Just more basic stuff like crafting, building, healing, weaponry, hunting etc.    \nHowever, I want the system to be classless in a way that you can learn from any class tree (Think similar to [PoE skills trees](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OZWj8ifHYHg/maxresdefault.jpg)). But you will have to have spent enough time doing something beneficial to that tree to be able to learn more things from that tree.    \nLet's say you find a book that teaches you to make a complicated defense trap for your base. The only way you can learn it is if you have spent enough time doing things beneficial to that class tree (i.e crafting building materials, building outposts or bases etc.)    \n\nSo the class trees would be something like this:    \n\n* **Survivalist:** The zombieapocalypse own guerilla soldier. The jack-of-all-trades and the go to class for lone wolfs. Good knowledge of farming and hunting. Can build smaller bases and outposts with simple defensive traps. Will be the class that can handle/kill zombies best. Not dependent on any class.\n* **Scavenger:** Various bonuses in scavenging and refining materials. Can carry larger amounts of resources and materials than any other class. Most dependent on the engineer and the soldier/survivalist.    \n* **Medic:** Self-explanatory. Bonuses in treating others, curing diseases. Crafting various items boosting players. Most dependent on most classes.    \n* **Engineer:** The class that will be able to repair most of the vehicles in the game. Build new simple vehicles and some defensive weapons. Can make ""industrial solutions"" for farming and refining materials. Bonuses to using vehicles. Most dependent on the builder and the scavenger.     \n* **Builder:** Self-explanatory. A defensive class. The go to class for building complex bases and buildings. Can build defensive traps and weapons. Is dependent on the scavenger and engineer in some degrees.    \n* **Soldier:** The fighting class. Can specialize in different types of weapons, melee combat etc. Excels at fighting players and zombies. The survivalist is the only class that is better than the soldier to fight zombies. Bonuses in anything that has to do with fighting. Most dependent on the medic.    \n* **Farmer:** Self-explanatory. The food supplier. Specialized in agriculture. Most dependent on the builder and the soldier/survivalist.    \n\n* .... and probably more to come    \n\n*****    \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Create a character. Survive as long as you can, building a base, a community, or a fortress. At least 50 players per server. Do server events and missions to further increase your base. Play your way to survive the apocalypse, alone or in a team. Trusting other players or kill them for their stuff. If you die you loose everything on your body at the time. The things that you gathered and that is stored in your base will be persistent after death. But not safe from other players.    \n\n* You spawn in random locations or at your base if you have gotten that far.\n\n* To build a base you have to set a landmark of some kind stating were you can build and were others can't.    \n\n* Roles/classes can be selected when you have built a HQ inside your base.    \n\n* Every class can have any weapon. Some classes handles certain weapons better than other.    \n\n* Bases can be big and they can be small. Outposts and roadblocks can be built separately.    \n\n* Zombies can attack your base. They spawn when special events happen or when too much noise is made. They spawn based of how many players are in that base area.     \n\n* .... will add more.    \n\n*****    \n\n**Standout Features:**    \n\n* Basebuilding\n* ""Borderless"" Class/role system\n* Special events like hordes attacking the base, supply missions  etc etc.\n* Death means everything on your body is lost but experience and character progression is not. Server persistent. (Similar to Ark:SE)\n* Bases will be persistent but will decay and will need maintenance. Simple way of maintain your base from HQ.    \n* Custom servers.    \n\n*****    \n\n**Possible Platforms:**    \n\n* PC only    \n\n*****\n\n**Extra Features:**    \n\nModding?    \n\n*****     \n\nUpdating this post continuously."
4o69z4,Space Scavenger Rogue-lite,"To complicate this loop, there's a sort of soft time limit. When you start, you're given an ETA on when some terrible event will occur. The ETA is not precise, it's merely an estimation. At base, there might be a whopping +- 30% error. When time runs out, a dangerous event fires. Some are worse than others. Security systems might come back online.\n\n**Name:** I don't have much of an idea for a name! Perhaps ""The Lost Colony"" or something.\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nRogue-lite style, science fiction, first person scavenger game with a soft time limit each mission. Upgrades between missions to your main base, and even yourself.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou're part of a colony ship. First one, in fact. Mission is going smoothly, until you find yourself stranded in orbit around a desolate, but previously inhabited planet. There's other ships here, almost all of them wrecks. Your goal is to scavenge these wrecks, and the once populated surface, for information and supplies. Hopefully, you can fix the ship and get going again.\n\nUnbeknownst to any of you, there's something actually keeping you from leaving orbit. A horrible thing, down deep inside the planet, using psionic power to keep you from escape. So then perhaps, the game branches here. You could continue to try and escape, or attempt to settle this planet. Both routes would require dealing with the monstrosity in some manner.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nScience fiction, in space, humanity thinks they're the only ones out there. In orbit around a planet. Dreary, dark, but hopeful mood.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nCharacters would be the guys you play as. New one if you die, of course.\n\nAbilities? Well, leveling up and getting to assign skillpoints/perks is the closest thing I can think of. Perhaps some form of unlockable abilities like tech and psionics?\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThe gameplay loop would be the following: Select a place to scavenge first from a list. You arrive at a procedurally generated area, based on where you chose. Now, search around for items such as scrap, medicine, food, weaponry, anything you can get your hands on. Then try and get out. Some ships would have enemies such as: Aliens, robots, zombies, eldritch monsters, turrets, wildlife, mutant experiments, and so on. Some might not have a single hostile.\n\nTo complicate this loop, there's a sort of soft time limit. When you start, you're given an ETA on when some terrible event will occur. The ETA is not precise, it's merely an estimation. At base, there might be a whopping +- 30% error. When time runs out, a dangerous event fires. Some are worse than others. Security systems might come back online, or the reactor might start to go critical, or perhaps eldritch horrors have decided to snack on the ship!\n\nThere'd be at least two ways to go about searching the ship: Stealth, and violence. The stealthy approach would, in general, be far safer but much slower, and you wouldn't be able to search enemies that aren't dead. A violent, aggressive approach would net much more experience and loot, but would likely lead to taking more harm and expending supplies. Certain approaches may be more or less effective against certain enemy types, such as stealth being less effective against the ever-aware robots, but better against braindead zombies.\n\nShould you die, that character is dead, and you lose anything they had on them. Any data you acquired is secured upon acquisition, but loot and supplies are gone, along with their skills.\n\nWhat's the point of gathering supplies and data if you're not going to use it all? Supplies would be used to repair and improve the colony ship, and data would be used to research things. Researches would unlock improvements for the ship and yourself, while improvements would let you make better things and access more missions.\n\nThe character should also gain experience from exploring, looting, fighting, and escaping alive. Said experience should either lead to level ups for skill points, or be spendable directly. Skills such as various weapon types, hacking or lockpicking, perhaps ones for getting more resources. Maybe, with the right researches and improvements to the ship, even things such as psionics for yourself.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nObviously the permadeath aspect. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nPC would be the most likely one.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nModding? It'd be nice if modding was available.\n\n**How To Credit Me:** \n\nNo need, really.\n\n\nWelp, I made this over the course of like an hour or two, it's like four in the morning, I hope this is good enough to be understandable and stuff. Good day to all you reddit goers! Hope I picked the right flair."
4o5vb7,"Making an RPG feel more ""Alien""","Two years ago I managed to get ahold of Nintendo and long story short have been accepted to a program to make an indie game on the Wii U (don't ask how this happened, I honestly just found a random link to apply here on Reddit). Making a game for Nintendo was always a dream of mine, but all of my ideas are for story and characters, not gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe story is on another planet a revolution has broken out and in a last ditch effort to survive, the revolting aliens draft random humans from Earth to help them win the war. If the humans help the aliens survive and win the war, they can go home. If not, everyone dies. (I'm trying to keep the story vague but keep it so you can understand).\n\nIt's a turn-based RPG focusing on a team of four humans and one alien doing what they can to beat the evil dictator and bring peace.  I have a bunch of little ideas, like not having currency of any kind and enemy drops to make materials instead of buying them (that way it might make you want to fight enemies). \n\nThe thing is, I feel like it's missing something huge in gameplay. Some big mechanic to hold the game together. For example, aside from the lovable story and characters, Undertale has uses Bullet Hell for enemy attacks to mix it up. Pokemon has you capture creatures, adding personalization to how you make your team. I just have nothing on that front.\n\nThe game takes place on another planet, so I was thinking of making the game have some element to gameplay that made it feel more ""alien"". I'm not saying ""reverse the controls"" or ""make so if you lick the left control stick then geese will appear on the screen"", but if I had just some push in the right direction, I could really do this.\n\nI understand this is a big request, but even a small idea could help. Also I know this is probably a wall of text, but I want to make sure everything important is down. I really don't want to have Nintendo call and respond by saying I have nothing after two years. I'll do my best to respond to people. Thanks everyone."

4o3tzs,"A game inspired from 80's movie ""The Warriors""","I'm thinking about a top down, open-world shooter where characters and context are strongly inspired from the movie's urban areas, disposition of factions on the territory, and gangs' specific abilities. It would also offer large space for development of a narrative you can experience from each faction's point of view.\nDo you get any resonance imagining to play as ""The Electric Eliminators - They all wear satin yellow bomber jackets"", or ""The Punks - They all wear overalls and rugby shirts with their leader utilizing roller skates""?

4o3ih5,Biting Point: Disaster survival simulator idea [Experienced],"Outline: A game where you play as a range of ordinary humans and have to survive various natural and man-made disasters.\n\nMy idea for this game is that it'd take the form of a series of levels. In each level, there'd be some form of mass disaster - it could be a tsunami, a forest fire, aerial bombardment of a city, a school shooting, Godzilla or a whole range of other things, you get the idea.\n\nYou'd be thrown into the shoes of a random member of the public as the crisis unfolds. It'd be a third-person game. Each person you play as would have an objective specific to them - you could have to save your elderly parents, or film the events as they unfold, or other similar things depending on who the person is. Obviously, the ultimate objective would be to either escape the area or get to somewhere safe. As well as different secondary objectives, the character you're playing is will impact your abilities - a big, strong man will be able to survive more injury and more easily smash through or shift obstacles, while a child, elderly or disabled character will have more limited physical capacity but might be more likely to receive help from NPCs. A fat character will run slower and with less stamina than an athletic character. Some characters will even have weapons, tools or protective gear that might prove useful. \n\nIf the person you were playing as died, you'd either have the option to retry the level, or jump into the shoes of another person and carry on from the point in the disaster that your last character died. If you die several times in a row but continue, you'll begin to respawn as emergency services or military characters, who'll be much better equipped.\n\nThe environment will be destructible and interactive. You'll be able to pick up useful items you find in the area, and if you're strong enough/have suitable tools, you'll be able to break through heavier obstacles like locked doors or even walls.\n\nSome disasters will have alternative ways to win. For example, if you're in a group of teenage campers being pursued by a serial killer, then somehow killing or incapacitating him would be a valid means to complete the level, though it would be very difficult. In a level involving a fire, extinguishing the flames or finding a way to protect an area of the map from them (e.g. bursting water pipes, a controlled fire etc) may be a possible. Obviously if the level was an earthquake or a tsunami the ""fighting back"" option wouldn't be available in the same way.\n\nYou'd get scored on your performance in each level."
4o2lzi,I thought of an idea for a game. Would you play it?,"You get dropped out of a helicopter at a town at the base of a mountain. You can climb the mountain and find quests and other towns to get exp and gold. It seems like a simple RPG, but there is only one boss, which is a dragon at the top of the mountain. You can fight him at any point of the game, but it won't be easy without leveling up and buying new items. So your only goal in the game is to kill the dragon, but the boss's difficulty depends on the player's pace. Some people want to kill the dragon in the first minute of the game while other people might want to kill it over a period of several days. What do you think about this idea? Is it cool or awful?"

4nzgc6,"Open World, Co-Op, survival, RPG","NOTE EVERYTHING IS HOW I ENVISION THE GAME AND YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY CHANGE THINGS TO YOUR LIKING IF YOU ACTUALLY PLAN ON MAKING THE GAME \n\nBASIC SUMMARY: the game would take place in a alternate timeline where society collapses and you and 4 friends (or more/less) are traders and your car gets ambushed on the way to a town for a delivery and you and your teammates would have to escape the map to a town or some sort of safety, or kill the atackers but ideally there would be more then 10 attackers so it would be hard to kill them all. The game would focus a lot on survival and realism so you would have to eat sleep etc. And for realism I think it should be realistic but not to the point where it ruins the game for example a starting character couldn't just pick up a gun and be an excellent marksman Some other ideas I had for the game \n\nSCENARIO FOR GAME:: There would be one map but it is a really big map so it would take a while to actually travel outside (I assume the car would be destroyed during the ambush and for gameplay purposes you wouldn't find cars on the map) the map would mostly be wilderness with some abandoned man made locations since it is post apocalyptic.\n\nMAP AND ENEMIES: If there are expansions they could include a new map and different attackers. For example one map would be in the Australian outback and another would be in the Rocky Mountains. Example for different attackers would be slavers who want to kidnap and sell you or cannibals who want to eat you for survival. I imagine the different attackers would have very different A.I ""programming"" so they would play out much differently. \n\nTHE CO-OP TEAM: Your team could choose what you are trading and this will be the teams starting items. For example you could be transporting Food and Water, ""crafting supplies"", or outdoor/camping supplies. Each set of items would be randomly selected through a pool of items from their respective category.\n\nCHARACTER SKILLS:Character leveling could either remain once the game has ended or you choose what skills you want at the start of a game but you don't keep them for the next game. But the skills would obviously decide what the character can do in game but I imagine the skills being more of the characters ""knowldge"" something like they know how to skin a rabbit so they can gather food rather then a perk thats like ""You do more damage with rocks"" or ""You can go longer without food for no reason""\n\nSorry if this is long, i could care less if this gets made into a game I just wanted to share my ideas. And in the off chance you want to make this an actual game go all for it, I don't ask for any credit."

4nvy31,A FPS Game with Magic Bullets!!!,"Basicly it's a game with fps mechanics but you can fire magic bullets f.e. bullets that can explode on contact or bullets that can paralyse your foes for a short amount of time. \n\nThere will be various amount of bullets that you can use in different scenarios. \n\n**Character:** I was thinking about making the character fully customizable, except for changing the size (how tall you character can be) because it would create alot of complications and unfair advantages.\n\n**Skills:** Except for different types of bullets you can also have skills on your character f.e. far sight (active skill that allows you to see from a distance), teleportation, cloak etc. \n\n**Guns:** So I was thinking that if you put an ak-47 with different type of bullets (all in one) then it would be too exaggerated. So to make the game simple I was thinking of only putting pistols. However that doesn't mean I wont put different types of pistols, if you are the guy who just came from csgo and prefers using desert eagle then there might be pistols that have the same mechanics as an desert eagle, and ofc if you are a new player (unfamiliar with fps) then there are guns to try out and see which fits you.\n\n**Modes:** Basicly the Ordinary ones: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag, Demolition etc. I was also thinking of putting a ""Survival"" Mode with a bigger map where you try to survive for as long as possible and the last one alive wins.\n\n**Arsenal:** Basicly the inventory where you have all your items. Here you can equip weapons and the bullets you are going to use.\n\n\n**Gameplay:** I currently have no plan of putting weapon switching, that means you will always have the weapon that you character was equiped with in the arsenal, however you will be able to switch between the bullets you want to use and if someone dies you can pick up their bullets, but ofc you are limited to how many bullets you can carry.\n\nSo this is my idea for a game! If you want to, give feedback and suggestions to what can be added / removed"

4nuss9,Need help expanding my fighter-style game idea,"I am capable of making such a game, but need help expanding on ideas for it. Here is what I am currently pondering/ have so far:\n\n• NOT about graphics, they will be simple or possibly retro\n• Characters fight in a zero-gravity, small, enclosed arena. The arena could even spin at a constant but randomly-generated rate. (Relatively slow, obviously)\n• Characters have little variation in abilities, if any\n• 2 players (as of now)\n• Win by winning a certain number of rounds?\n• Can jump around arena, and when you hit a wall/platform, it becomes the ""new"" ground and if you, say, hit the ""left"" key, it moves left relative to that ground. So, if you stuck to the cieling and hit left, it would appear as if you are moving right.\n\nI was also interested in incorporating a concept I have come up with: what if, at random intervals of time, you and your opponent switch characters, meaning you take control of them and vice versa. Games could be short, with the first hit resulting in a win. Obviously, the hits couldn't be easy to make or else the game wouldn't be fun. The rounds would have to last more than ~10 seconds in order for the  switching to work well, meaning that hits would be difficult to land, but deadly and end the round. It's a quick, fast-paced game (as most fighters are.)\n\nWould you play this game? Feel free to suggest any changes, big or small. Just don't steal the idea :)\n\nUPDATE: I've begun work on this project and will find a way to display it when I'm done. It's my first game using GameMaker, so it'll take me a while. I've made a few changes but I won't describe them all until it's released."

You are sent to an orphanage work house.   \nYou are in the lowest of the law among peasants. Bullied, food stolen, Blamed for things, the whole nine yards.

4dqheo,Survival game idea,I thought that the idea of having a Dayz type of game set in the WW2 area would be epic. \n\nYou're a soldier who got airdropped but got lost and you wake up somewhere in a forest somewhere in Germany. You got nazi zombies taking over and you have to survive. \n\nThe game would feature base-buidling and vehicles and there is a food/water system that makes it so you can't stay forever in your base and actually have to loot and enter city's for more advanced loot and stuff but with the risk of encountering other players and ofcourse many zombies. \n\nIs there anything game that does this ? I would love to know and play it.
4dp7t0,Virtual Reality Physical Surgeon Simulator,"So I got the idea from the training models that surgeons practice on if they are prepairing for a surgery they don't know much about or if they just want more practice. So I though of a kit of tools the include:\nA Surgical tray\n\nScalpel\n\nMedical instruments\n\nFake organs\n\nSo my idea was that you would use this with a motion tracking VR headset like the HTC Vive and you would have finger tracking gloves that look like surgical gloves.\n\nYou would have the trays with your tools on them and it would calibrate to be in the exact orientation in the game so if you have the headset on and you grab a scalpel then you are actually reaching for the training, fake, scalpel right next to you.\n\nThe patient would be on the opperating table and you would preform surgery using your actual tools with you. If you leaned in to look over the patient then you did that in game and if you picked up your scalpel and cut a piece of flesh or an artery then you would actually do that in game. You would not have a model of the abdomen or what you are operating on so that you could do different surgeries and not be dependent on a physical model to use the simulator. So you would just have a space between your trays where the patient would be in your area.\n\nMy idea was to have a physical aspect to a game, like surgeon simulator, to help either a surgical intern, a med student, or even just an average Joe at home that wants to preform virtual surgery."

4do4it,What shapes of 2d heightmap allows a ball to cross a valley north-south or east-west but not to turn between them?,"Instead of using bridges between the tops of hills, maybe normal physics on a 2d heightmap can do the same thing in paths crossing but not allowing you to move between them there.\n\nRolling a ball through a 2d maze is normally easy since paths cant cross eachother. If we include ball speed in the maze, with a maximum acceleration/deceleration, there are some hills you must roll up after rolling down another slightly bigger hill, and there are hills you cant roll up depending where you're coming from.\n\nAs we know from the stairs at the end of the original mario, there are things you can go up gradually and fall down the other side so you cant get back, even though the jumping is symmetric left and right. Similarly, rolling a ball up a long nearly flat hill then falling over a steep side is a one-way-valve. You can cross it only in 1 direction, if there are walls on the sides.\n\nIf there are not walls on the sides, then a 4-way traffic intersection with no lights can prevent turns by 2d heightmap physics. One-way-valves can allow you to go in some places and exit others, so if one side needs to be lower then the heightmap can prevent balls from rolling in that side. From the higher side, you accelerate so fast that its unavoidable to roll over the one-way-valve on the other side.\n\nBut what about 2 balls crossing the 4-way traffic intersection without lights and hitting eachother? They would of course get stuck in the middle. But we cant have balls building up there. So put a deep hole in the center, between each 2 opposite lanes, so if you dont go fast enough or lean to the side you'll roll into the hole. But could the hole be used to make a 1/4 turn and keep your speed? Maybe we put jagged edges on the hole so if you go in a little its like friction or changing direction randomly so you couldnt keep your direction smooth through the 1/4 turn.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry"

The reason being, I'd like to maintain a realistic approach with the monsters physics. You know because they're huge and therefor somewhat slow moving, but at the same time having a heavy emphasis on footsies, dashing and other mechanincs. So what im asking is how would you design the fighting system and what mechanics would you implement to make this a viable fighting game. Thanks again"
4dhzey,Character Creation Simulator,"This idea popped into my head so I felt the urge to write it somewhere. Then I found /r/gameideas.\n\nAh yes. Another Simulator game.\n\nPremise is simple. You are an avatar who is under creation. As the player you are also responsible for said creation of your avatar. And that's where familiarity ends.\n\nThe POV is not from a disembodied camera looking at the avatar. Instead, the player will be looking through the eyes of the character being created.\n\nYou will not have any mirror, and the extremes(min/max levels) of each customization slider will be randomized on each run.\n\nThere will also be sets of clothing for your avatar to wear. Warning, clothes are not gender specific.\n\nYou will be able to set the scenery/lighting so you can use shadows to figure out what your avatar looks like (probably).\n\nFace customization isn't thought out yet.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make the avatar as close to the requested avatar given at the beginning of each run with a given time limit. When you ""lock in"" your avatar or the time limit ends, then the camera will shift to reveal your avatar from a 3rd person view.\n\nThis can range from a picture of the desired avatar or a general statement such as ""a good looking guy in a maid outfit"", ""fits cleric class"", or ""Lara Croft""\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n"
4dg5k4,You are the captain of a Generation Ship!,"Hey guys, I thought it would be pretty cool if someone made a game where you would be the captain of a generation ship. For those of you who don't know, it is one of those sci-fi missions where humanity sends a giant spaceship to a star system far away in order to colonize it. Because it travels at sub-light speeds, it takes a few generations of humans in order to get there, so basically the descendants of the original crew get to arrive.\n\nI think it's an interesting concept because it gives the player the chance to manage not only classic space stuff like supplies, incidents along the way, maintenance etc, but also make moral choices and handle your people's psychology as well.\n\nYou could have a lot of nice details like a voting system every now and then, the possibility of mutiny and change of ship course, messages coming from Earth, meeting aliens along the way, unexplained phenomena etc. The main map could be something along the lines of FTL, but with various sub systems and menus to work with. Also, advisors and stuff, like you have in Civilization.\n\nAn obvious point is to give a lot of attention to psychology and what people in the ship think. Also, the relationship between the captain/crew and the colonists. Many ideas to take from Battlestar Galactica in that sense.\n\nTell me what you think in the comments."
4dfczq,Well I thinked of an idea But... I don't know.. What do you think?,"3 Major Races, Aganst Eachother, Hateing eachother.\nBut that isn't mean that they have to Fight.\nIts a PVP open game. Kind of like an RPG But its MMO.\nThe Item system would be the same as a raid loot system,\nOr something like Looting the enemy. The rules would be:\n\n- You only can loot max some materials and 1 unique Gear, \nAlso you HAD to put in some item equaling that you are\nNot Going to use or Equal. If not You are able to be Reported\n\n- You don't have to kill the other player also you can interract with them,\nby going on with raids and other things.\n\n- Players only able to have 1 Character only.\nAnd if they delete it they have to wait 1 Month. If they\nwant to create a Completly New one.\n\n- There are 2 kinds of ways to win the MMO.:\n\n	-Defeat all 3 Races so be Superior Or By useing\n	Politcy and allying with an another Race would be Major\n	To defeat the third. In that case. The Third race\n	Would get help from the Races thoose would consider\n	Enemy players too. Because of they helping They would\n	be Their allies.\n\n	OR\n\n	-Make an Ally Politics by makeing the 3 Races being One\n	Big Country. And be frends.\n\n- If you kill an another player not matter if its frendly or not\nYou will be marked as Killer. And by that You have bounty on your head.\nAnd this means that If you die. You have to restart at your Home Location\nAlso Character Unawable for 24hrs, If died in a hunt. But if he\nManadges to kill its killers or ""hunters"" His Bounty goes Higher and Higher.\n\n-If your Bounty Eugh High The Royal Guards in the Main Cities Will\nAutomaticaly Attacks you Because you became a Criminal. And If \nThey Catch you You gone to jail for 1 Week. You Must have to Log In.\notherwise Its isn't work. Something Like a Debuff that you can't get off.\nOr Your Frends can help you if you manadged to get in to a Clan.\nThey can pick lock you out But they would be warned, and They will\ngonna get a bounty too.\n\nThe House system is the following thing: Like in the Wild Star.\nI mean You got a Place To live at X level I mean you are able to Buy one.\nBut its not needed. You can be One of the Royal Guards Who Provide you with a\nBase to live in with other people.\nThe main thing is. You are Can have a house, But its always starts out\nWith a little Hut type house. You are able to upgrade it and sell it To moove\nTo an another place. The First house is always in the Forests or in the place where\nYou are figured out where to live. After you manadged to found the place. You have to\nfound the Ingreediants to make a new home for yourself. After you done with this.\nYour character starts Working. By doing so. After a month Its done.\nIf your little hut is done. You can moove in. And also you can Chop down\nTrees, hunt animals. Its also gain you exp. And minerals/materials.\nAs the time passes you will be able to upgrade the little Cottage\nAs you like. If you are going to be eugh big and you are planning do\nMore house. That would be more easy because of more hand, Works faster ^^\nSo if you Invite some players to live with you. they Will gonna make a \nClan. This Clan also provides you with good things. Getting into a clan\nMakes your survibality mutch and Mutch better.\n\nFor an example you are want to raid somebody's house while he is offline\nBut you alone can't do this. And also If you don't raid and you are alone.\nYou are only stealing. And if somebody caugh you You will be. First time warned.\nIf you don't get too mutch currency out of it. If its realy \n""Needy"" and by that. If you get a lots of stuff. And sell it.\nIt will be supscious and you will be under waching and if you do\nSomething wrong the guards will hunt you. They can't kill you\nOr nobody else (maximun the Hunters the Players) Because if you will be\nCaught you automaticaly go to jail for 3 days. And more you steal.\nThe more you go to jail.\n\nBut if you raid somebody's house. And its not a Clan VS Clan \nJust a raid to a person's house. You are automaticaly In the Wanted List.\nAnd you will gonna get a bounty to your head.\n\nThere is a Toggle More between PVP and Off Mode. So you are not able\nTo hurt other players. But other players would be able to hurt you.\n\nAbaut the Clan system. The More hand the better. Its not nesseseary to make a clan.\nWithout a Leader. But the leader isn't nesseseary too. Only if wanted, and voted.\nIf a guild leader exist. He MUST. have to do the following things:\n\n- Always check the identity of the new players to came by to the clan. If not it could be Consequences.\n\n- A Hunting Clan Can't stay too mutch on one place, after a time the people will report,\nSo watch out ^^\n\n- Every Member Must Be actieve. After some week the Clan can be abbadones and the leader go everything.\n\n- Always have to be make sure to no stealing or cheating happend. If not They will be Had to get to the Royality.\n\n- After 7 members (or 5 Members) There must be a (Usaly) a Clan Leader.\n\n- The clan leaders can Jail people inside their clan.\n\n- They can assume helpers after 10 members.\n\n- Guards, Merchants, Crafters, Post Officers, And helpers. Can apply and Must in a Clan.\n\nThe Minimum sieze of group is 2. The maximum is... There is no maximum.\nFor some infinite amaunt of fun :D\n\nAlso the Clans Can build Walls if Needed to defend aganst players.\n\nThere would be a Day and Night System.\n\n--- To be continued :D I know what would it like. And even I can Immagin it. But I don't know in the first hand how to make it, Secoundly I have nothing to got help from. So this is just an idea that i came with more ideas will be added. That 4 sure. If its needed to be Explained i will happily Respond."
4degej,Gametype: 1v1 RPG,"I suppose I'm asking whether or games of this type exist as much as submitting it as a game idea.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGames like Mass Effect, Fable, BioShock, or Dragon Age allow you to affect the outcome of the plot based on the chain of decisions you make throughout the story line, usually making the outcomes range on a scale between good and evil.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat about a two-player RPG where the players must choose characters which play for factions of two opposing forces? And I don't mean like in MMORPG's--those tend to include plot as an easter egg rather than the primary focus of the game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInstead, the game starts a countdown timer once both players have locked in their characters (appearance, attributes, class, etc.), and each player views their intro cut scenes simultaneously. The players then each progress through the game like a normal RPG, picking and choosing side-quests as they advance through the primary quest chain and forming allies/enemies with NPC's and changing environments in different regions of the game based on their decisions and the success of their quests.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce the countdown timer completes, all quests are made unavailable to the players so they are forced to meet at the final cut scene/battle location.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously a major challenge for this game mode is the mechanic for plot progression, since the players have to exist in the same timelines. Perhaps rather than a countdown for the entire game, you instead implement a countdown for each chapter of the game, and as each chapter ends all side quests are closed off to the players until they progress to the location of the next major cut scene.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe outcome of the main plot would depend on the accumulated quest successes for each player. What's more, if you added a PvP element and had the players face off in a final battle, you could have four plot out comes based on which player's faction won and which player's character survives the final battle:\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Good Faction Wins/Good Player Lives\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Good Faction Wins/Good Player Dies\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Evil Faction Wins/Evil Player Lives\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Evil Faction Wins/Evil Player Dies\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe countdown timer scale could be dependent on how much time each available side quest is expected to take, but I would imagine it could range from 1 to 12 hours of game play per chapter, depending on how much content you have. The game would only be playable while both players are on simultaneously, and the players could pace their progression since they can choose when to proceed to the next chapter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThoughts? Any idea if games like this already exist?"
4ddxwx,Conqueror's Legacy,"It's simple, really. It's like *Mount &amp; Blade Warband*, only with a focus on your **character's legacy** and what happens **after they die**.\n\n1. You begin as an upstart warlord. Like Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, and Napoleon. Over time, your army gets bigger and your wealth, power and reputation grows.\n2. Locate, besiege and sack towns to acquire that sweet loot. You need a lot of money to feed and equip your massive army.\n3. Be a merciful warlord and offer your enemies a chance to surrender to your rule. Or murder them all -- peasants, clergy and soldiers alike.\n4. Romance as many women as possible, growing your harem to the dozens or even hundreds. Or rape them, like the monster you are.\n\nThe game ends when you die, obviously. **But then it simulates what happens over the next 1,000 years.** Your overall score is determined by the number of people killed by you, the amount of property damaged or stolen by you, and the number of bastard children you end up siring.\n\nThe end-game summary details how much you permanently changed the world. I think it would be best if this game was extremely difficult and realistic. Like, so difficult that you could very well die during the first battle by a peasant's stray arrow. Also permadeath would make it cooler."
4dc1pj,Top-down timecop game,"What about a game where you look down at a city from above, think: Sim City, and you are a ""historypreserver""/timecop and your mission is to preserve important events in history from timebandits/-agents? \n\nGameplay: a level is a scenario, in anytime in history like: WWII, 16th century or whatever, where a timefluctuation alert is incoming. You are sent to that place, in that time, to prevent timebandits from changing the historically important event there in that time. \n\nYou can play the history scenario as it ""should"" take place, including the event that is important for the future. Then you can play the area from say a month before the event you are there to protect. An important event can be anything, like a meeting between two people or a carcrash where a successful buisnessman is among the casualties. \n\nThe idea has two major objectives: \n\n1. Investigate differences between the historical scenario and the scenario where you and the timebandits are part in, trying to trace who and where the timebandits is acting. \n\n2. When successfully have pointed out how the timebandits works you need to prevent them from changing the past; historical event.\n\nThe player can restart the scenario at any time if new clues to where the timebandits is dropped down into that timeframe is found. For every iteration you gather more and more clues and finds out more and more about your enemies and hiw they are acting in that particular timeframe.\n\nTime is self-healing as in that small differences in history doesn't change the future apart from those historically important events that cannot be self-healed by time itself. Therefor it doesnt really matter what you do in the past as long as the historically important events is preserved.\n\nWell, I have more detailed ideas about gameplay.. Will return soon with more info\n\nI do believe the concept stretches beyond the movie TimeCop and its bad SNES game version, and think it deserves more chances."

What kinds of things would you like to see and interact with in this world?","This game called [Border: Remembrance](http://www.indiedb.com/games/border-remembrance) surfaced on IndieDB a couple years back.

Unfortunately the game's development has long since been discontinued, but the idea fascinated me.\n\nLately I've had this very general idea of a game where the player is allowed to roam around for 10 minutes, before the game world is destroyed and the player is sent back to the main menu/desktop/etc. My experience at game development is negligible, so I would definitely make the game using a 2D engine.\n\nSo my question is this: What would you like to see, hear, and interact with under this premise?

49eif3,Concept for RPG game where MC grows based on what you do?,"I just thought of this idea so its a bit rough.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game would be a 2d rpg game where the main character is a child(boy or girl) who is in a concentration camp. The ruler of this kingdom has started a genocide against the races that live in his kingdom. The mc was born in this camp and has no idea what to do or how he/she feels about certain things like killing. Mc makes a wish that someone could guide and make decisions for them. Thats where you come in. You control the mc but the mc is aware that they are being controlled. The mc has likes, dislikes, and is unsure about many things. What you do will ultimately shape how the character is by the end of the game. The mc might be against killing but through events that you put him through he believes in only killing in self defense. She could lose most of her fights(or often take damage) and learn to hate violence. You could fail to save other people and she becomes cold and heartless. Doing to many things she doesnt like or exposing them to alot of bad things can literally make the character depressed. What ever you do effects the character and how he or she reacts to the world and other events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nThere is no 1 story line. There would be several story-lines such as rebelling against the king and overthrowing the king, joining the king, rescuing your people, learning to live in the city, escaping the city and etc. Though the mc will voice how they feel about certain situations I was thinking that they would have a diary where they write down all the important things that happened and how they felt so that the player can be aware of what they are doing.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust an idea of how this might play out. You start the game in the camp. You ofcourse wouldnt be told what your options are. A guard comes in to feed you do you \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA) try and kill the guard? This may make the mc enjoy violence. If you get injured during the fight he may take a stance against violence(or become a masochist) \n\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nB) Try and talk the guard into letting you escape? Failing to do so could make the mc develop a hatred for them\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nC) Try and break out without hurting anyone? \n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nD) Wait and hope someone breaks you out? The wait can put further stress on the mc's mental health\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExamples of how the character reacts to other situations. Lets say during your play-through you turn the child into a blood thirsty monster. You try to talk to shop owners to buy gear and because of the mc's foul language you are turned away. You try to develop relationships with other characters and they are turned off by how brutal the mc is.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust an idea I have. what do you think?"
49e2e0,Ideas for a puzzle game about solving traffic jams?,"I'm a developer about to start a new project, and I had a general idea where you place down roads to fix traffic problems on a highway/city. If you've played Cities: Skylines then you'll know what I'm talking about! \n\nPlease post specifics/detailed description of the game mechanics, I'm really struggling to understand how puzzles would work beyond the simple ""just add more exits"" fix. Maybe there could be specific types of cars that need to go somewhere? I don't know where the challenge would come from... Any help is appreciated! If it helps, I picture the game being in a minimalist style, so not much detail in the levels. Thanks! "

49adeb,What Is The Craziest Game Idea You Have That Could Be Made Semi-Easily?,
499dmb,Rock Paper Scissors Mixed with Dice's cups.,
499dem,Super-Customizable Chess,"The idea is basically a more realistic and customizable chess.\n\n**Battlefield** - Everyone knows that a chess is played on an 8x8 board. But, in reality, a battlefield can be any size or shape (4x7, 10x20, etc.). So, the game will have a random board size generator to make things more interesting.\n\n**Units** - No chess game would be complete without your 8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 1 Queen and 1 King.\nBut, what if you could choose how many of each piece you could have? If pawns count as 1 point, bishops/knights count as 3 points, rooks count as 5 points and queens count as 10 points, then you would have a total value of 40 (8 + 6 + 6 + 10 + 10 = 40).\nSo why not? Who wouldn't want an army of 8 Rooks and 1 King, or 4 Queens and a King, or even 40 Pawns and a King.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to point out that a horses head is not a very good depiction of a knight. Instead, knights can actually look like a Crusader in shining armor, charging towards enemies. \nPawns can be Peasants. Rooks can be represented by a mobile archers tower. Bishops can be bad ass zealots, or even magicians.\nThe Queen would be some sort of Sorceress, seeing as noble women were definitely not allowed to fight in medieval times.\n\n**Customization** - All good games have customization. Why not customize a chess game to, make it more realistic. Flag creation would be a must, as well as a coat of arms with colors. To make it even better, why not be able to customize the features of your units? Skin Color? Height? Hair?\n\nThis idea is a work in progress. I'm not a genius developer, so I won't be able to do half of what I just said. But the basics of the game are that players shouldn't have the same game all the time. There should be some sort of aspect that draws new players in and keeps them interested while trying to adapt to new circumstances.\nThis, of course, is the essence of chess. \n\n**Adaptation**\n"
498osw,Foe - Survival/Capture-the-Flag/Hunger Games Hybrid (honest criticism needed),"This is a game that I've been conceptualizing for the past couple months now. I have a small team that is ready to get started on it but first I need to know if it's a game that the public would actually be interested in.\n\n**Concept**\n\n- Two teams of 5 on opposite sides of an ~~elliptical~~ circular island (allows multiple spawn points for each team to achieve a different perspective in every game you play)\n- ~~Both teams are restricted to a smaller area on their side of the island with boundaries~~\n- There will be about five different kinds of islands (sort of like different maps), each island will have its own environment, such as sources of water, temperature and weather (example, snowy islands, tropical islands, barren islands, etc.)\n- You have to survive against hunger, thirst, weather and natural disasters\n- If you die, you will respawn (slower respawns as the game progresses)\n- Mornings are mostly spent **scavenging, crafting and preparing for the night** by completing bonus objectives that reward with things like a higher temperature threshold or slower hunger gain (example, objective to build a campfire or to catch X amount of fish)\n- Every night an event will occur, there are eight total kinds of events but only four will occur per game\n- The **monkeys** will try to steal your crafts; Objective is to retrieve your crafts from the monkeys in the jungle\n- The **rats** will try to eat your food; Objective is to clog all the rat holes in the jungle up with dirt\n- The **jaguars** will try to attack you; Objective is to kill X amount\n- The **boars** will try to destroy your crafts; Objective is to scare them away (fire, noise, intimidation, etc.)\n- The **tsunami** will spoil your food and reduce effectiveness of your crafts (slower usage, reduced damage, etc.) or will freeze them if its a snowy island; Objective is to pick up boulders and transport them as a team to build a wall along the coast or use torches to thaw the frozen items\n- The **wasps** will poison one member of your team causing damage over time; Objective is to travel into the jungle and retrieve a special fruit that will cure the teammate before they die at sunrise\n- The **forest fires** will be caused by thunderstorms or heat and will slowly burn your available resources; Objective is to extinguish the fire\n- The **fog** will surround the island in a circle and will slowly close in on the center, if you are touched by the fog you will be disabled visually (blurry, slow and ashed out vision) and partially physically (slower movement speed, slower attacks); Objective is to travel to the center of the island where the two teams will meet at a lake that will cure your disability, the lake is like the traditional capture point that increases its points for whichever team has the majority of occupants, the team with the most points by sunrise wins the event\n- All these events happen at the same time (sunset to sunrise) to both teams and in random order\n- After the event occurs, you are given an objective which is based on the mob that raided you *(example, if a monkey raids you, then your objective is to retrieve your crafts from the jungle)*\n- The first team to complete their objective will win the event\n- If you lose the event, both the previous mob and the new mob will raid you in the next event, but you will only have to complete the objective based on the new mob *(example, monkeys AND jaguars will raid you but you only have to complete the objective for the jaguars)*\n- If you win the event, only the new mob will raid you in the next event *(example, only jaguars)*\n- So, this can ""stack"" and allow your team to make the enemy team possibly get 4 types of mob raids in 1 night, causing a rather rough night for them\n- Events will be given a time limit, the event will occur at sunset and you will have until sunrise to complete the objective (3 minutes)\n- You may go over to the enemy's side of the island to interfere with their event, this would sacrifice your own event due to the time limit but you may also ruin the enemy team's chance at completing the objective on time causing both teams to experience and extra mob raid the next night (perhaps one team more than the other)\n- If you choose to venture on to the enemy's half of the island then all mobs from your team's half will venture to the enemy's half and will attack only your team if they happen to see you, whereas they will not attack the enemy team despite seeing them (so if you are on the enemy's half of the island, you will have the threat of all animals on the island against you whereas the enemy's team will only have to worry about half of the animals, kind of like a home-court advantage)\n- After the four nights (four events), ~~the boundaries will be removed,~~ a flag will be placed somewhere around the center of the island, and it will turn into a capture-the-flag game\n- While going for the flag, you'll have to fight off any mob which you didn't complete the objective for as well as the enemy team\n- You basically spend the first four nights making it harder for the enemy to capture the flag when the time comes because you slowly deteriorate their team and cause a higher threat in the jungle for them\n- Games will last around 45 minutes each\n- I'm also considering some boss mobs on the map which will reward you if you defeat them, please leave some suggestions if you have any\n- There will also be a skill system in which you will gain experience points while completing objectives and each level will award you in a skill point which you may spend in game-length (only last for that particular game) attributes such as faster woodcutting, higher accuracy with a bow, faster fishing, etc.\n\n**Some questions:**\n\n-  **Would you want to play this game?**\n-  **Why or why not?**\n-  **What would YOU add to this game?**\n-  **What would you remove from this game?**\n\nPlease feel free to give any kind of feedback :) Thanks."

491v33,RPG with Rhythm Based Fighting,"**Rough Story Idea**\n\nThe world's greatest band, consisting of a guitarist, bassist, and drummer, are bored with how easy life has become. A strange man offers them a challenge: to save his home-world. A place where monsters are overtaking the land from the townspeople. However, these monsters have one weakness, music! \n\n\n**Combat**\n\nThe combat would be turned based and similar to that of [Legend of Dragoon](https://youtu.be/tISOQPtNRSk?t=115). Basically, the player would choose a move, and this move would consist of a series of attacks. In order to progress from one attack to the next, the player would need to interact at the proper rhythm and timing for each move. As the player levels up or gets a new weapon/instrument, these moves would get more complex/badass. Ultimates could be solos for the corresponding characters instrument and be charged by properly hitting combos.\n\n\n**Graphics**\n\nI was imagining this game in a relatively simplistic style. Something similar to SNES era rpgs (Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, etc.). The combat scenes would be similarly depicted with menus for choosing attacks and selecting characters/items.\n\n\n**Sounds**\n\nThis is where I would imagine it would get difficult. I feel like a game based on rhythm and music should have a good and unique soundtrack and sound effects. Although the attacks themselves could be relatively simplistic, the game would have much more depth if each new instrument or new move had a unique sound.\n\n\nLet me know what you think, thanks!"

48zme4,Fire Emblem style PvP game.,"You've played Fire Emblem before, right? Well, why hasn't anyone done a Fire Emblem PvP style game?\n\nYou'd choose between these classes:\n\n- Fighter: Average stats. Can use Axes, Swords, or Lances, but you must pick one.\n\n- Assassin: Uses daggers. Can move more tiles than other units, high attack damage and critical chance. Low defense.\n\n- Ranger: Bow user\n\n- Mage: Magic attacks.\n\n- Healer: Heals + utility\n\n- Tank: Very high defense, very low mobility. Average damage.\n\n- Knight: Pick between a sword, axe, or lance. Rides on a horse. Can move, attack, and then move again. High movement but all other stats are lower than average.\n\n- Bard: Offensive support. Instead of healing, he gives buffs and helps you attack better.\n\nI'm sure you could think of many more classes to fill unique roles. The style would be 5v5, pick units and fight. You could even have abilities, here are some I thought of:\n\n- Assassin ability: Go invisible for the next turn, or until you attack.\n\n- Assassin ability: Apply poison to your dagger. The next strike will cause your opponent to suffer from poison damage, taking x damage for x turns.\n\n- Healer ability: Restore x amount of health to all teammates and increase their defense by x for 1 turn.\n\n- Bard ability: Increase the party's attack by x for 1 turn.\n\n- Bard ability: ""Bless"" an ally. The next strike will be a critical strike.\n\n- Knight and Tank ability: Rescue an ally. You can move them away from danger.\n\n- Healer ability (one time usage): Revive an ally.\n\n\nI think this would be so sick. Obviously would need more classes, game balance, and more abilities, but damn I would play this game all day.\n\n\n"

48x79m,What I would love 2 see,[deleted]
48uw20,Hitman in reverse,"One of my favourite video game series is and always will be Hitman. It allows you to think, learn your own methods and has replayable value.\n\nThe idea I have is this; instead of playing a hitman dispatching your targets, you play the target. And your objective is to evade the assassin or even try to kill him/her.\n\nJust like Hitman, it would be level based and there would be multiple ways to reach your goals: the use of your environment, find weapons, set booby-traps, etc.\nAlso, you would still have to go unnoticed because\nIf you kill your would be assassin and then you simply exit the level, your actions would carry over to the next. This allows other assassins to be more aware of your typical movements, the likelihood of start location in a level, etc.\nThe more careless you are the more assassins come for you. You could even try and pit them against one another or accidentally cause them to off each other.\nYou might kill an assassin yourself and that assassin just so happens to have a sibling who comes after you, not for the money but for revenge.\nLike a lot of games of this day and age, your actions and choices effect the outcome of what comes next.\nTo make things even more daunting your would be assassins would all have their own technique. Some won't mind a public execution. Others prefer it to be private. You could be standing in the same room as the killer, and they see you but their could be too many witnesses and nothing to suggest your death was an accident.\nYou could find citizens knocked out/killed and naked so you know now your killer is disguised.\nTo help you identify your targets you'd have someone helping you. Not a friend but someone who's out to make money like anyone else. He's the type of guy who knows all the going ons of the criminal world so would know who was coming for you- but for the right price. You're broke and have no one to turn to so you have to make money or rather steal it: pick pocket citizens, rob stores (if part of level map), mug people, even loot the bodies of your assassin if you manage to kill them.\n\nStoryline: In no way do I have a fleshed out story line but my thinking is that the character you play has pissed off the wrong people and a bounty has been placed on your head and it's an open contract. You're in no way a killing machine but you know how to handle yourself and have a knack of getting yourself into and out of dire situations. The reason for a contract being put out on you is big enough that the assassins will not stop coming but the thing is that you didn't do whatever it is you're being accused of so you're out to prove your innocence which always makes you an easier target.\nThat's the set up for the story, I haven't thought much about where it all leads, except for a few things that aren't worth mentioning just yet.\n\nThat's all I have right now. I'm a gamer who isn't all that educated on what's in the real of possibility in creating a game so I have no idea if my idea is feasible."

Along the path there are towers that will shoot your people. If you manage to get to the castle with one of your guys, you win the game. If you run out of people you loose. \n\nI don't want it to be too much of a puzzle (see ""issues"" below), but a little more active. Something more than just sending out your guys and hope that you sent the right guy.\n\n**Other ideas**\n\nDarkness: You don't see the path (and the towers that are on it) before you've reached it with one of your guys. \n\n**Issues (The reason I'm posting this)**\n\nThe order is the solution: I don't really want the game to be solely based on which order you send in your guys. What other factors can I bring to the game so it doesn't turn into ""Find the right order simulator""?\n\nSo what am I missing, in your opinion? \nThanks in advance."

48thjk,"FIFA meets XCOM 2, in a science fantasy setting.","Disclaimer: I've not played XCOM 2, I'm taking inspiration here from videos I've seen of the character creation, plus having played XCOM: Enemy Unknown a little.\n\nThe gist of the game is a football league played in a world with advanced technology, magic, and extremely relaxed rules on enhancement in sports. This means you have players teleporting around the field with magic, running at insane speeds with their robot legs... or even their legs removed completely to make way for wheels. Tackling is no longer limited to just taking the ball with your feet, you can also push the ball away (or the player ;)) with your telekinetic power, open a portal underneath it that emerges by your own side. \n\nThe way I see this working is each player having an XCOM style level up system, and your manager being able to invest in technology or magic at a (still XCOM-esque) home base with the money you win in games. Each player could be 'enhanced' at the base to give them their supernatural/superhuman abilities, which they then improve by gaining experience in games.\n\nGameplay wise, it could play mostly like a FIFA game, or any other sports game, and the skills your character learns either use unoccupied buttons or replace kicks/tackles. Your more powerful characters might forgo the ability to actually kick the ball in exchange for support skills that give possession to other players, or speed them up. A problem I can forsee here is switching control between players to use these abilities will force you to miss out on opportunities on the ball. A potential solution to that is a time-slow feature that lets you choose an ability to activate on a player without losing sight of what's going on immediately around the ball.\n\nThe idea needs a little fleshing out, I mostly came up with it while watching a friend play FIFA just now, but I think it'd make a pretty cool game, and even someone like myself who has all but no interest in sports games might pick it up."
48r4yq,GameChanger,"Hi, I woke up yesterday with this Game idea. I spoke to a friend of mine (bigtime gaming expert) to check if it already excists, but it doesn't. \n\nIt is called GameChanger. One goes back to several crucial moments in history, and one can replay it, but every change made to the original situation is realisticly played out. For instance; pearl Harbour, d-day, murder on Kennedy (maybe you are the driver etc.) The Beatles in Abbey rd, play as good as you can or your popularity will drop etc.. I realise this can be as big as you can imagine and be a lot of programming, but still I think it is something every gamer would enjoy (if done right) and besides historical knowledge not too much skills are needed with great fantastic results.. A lot of programming time will go in the interaction between the main character and its environment, but no extreme special effects will be needed. Only intelligent interaction.. The programmer can use a lot of imagination which can be nicely suprising to the player ;-)\nWell maybe somebody will read this and think of it as a great idea.. I strangely already can see it all in front of me :-) BB70"
48qmvx,Which game idea best for non art asset start.,"Basically, I can code.  I suck at art.  I have some nice assets for each of these, and obviously the less I have to pay/build in art or graphics the better.  Art will be bought, this isn't going to be some garbage BUT making a game with 100 rigged animated realistic toons is out of the question.\n\n1.  Stealth game in fantasy setting.  Basically expand off of Thieves guild in TES games.  You are a member of a Thieves guild and the stealth game is based upon an earlier setting.  So, no cameras, no laser wires, no robots, etc.  Maybe have ravens that can see you, use magic in stealth, cut down a chandelier rope to squash a guard, poison...etc..but you are the ""black shroud"" hired to steal in castles/keeps/towns.\n\n2.  Puzzler....You are brought into a town in which everyone is dead.  17 years ago they were all alive and happy.  You can time portal back every one of the 17 years.  Your goal is to make everyone alive and happy again 17 years later.  There could be clues in each year as to what happened and how to make them not kill each other/commit suicide/die from events.  This would be more along the lines of behavior programming...hardest part might be changing the actual scenery for events...if you could find a way to leave scenery somewhat stationary, the programming for behavior might not be too bad.\n\n3.  Sim...The Cartel....You start out as one of 5 cartel...this is a NON move based turn based game.  Instead, you have a tech tree (learn to make coke, marij, heroin, lsd, meth, etc.) and you learn/build techs, like a spy to see what is needed in city, or you build a pipeline to increase supply to a region.....there are like 10 countries with 5 cities each you are trying to monopolize on....can build drug infrastructure, militant presence, techno, spies, political influence, drug economics into each region.  So your ""turn"" would consist of building into each region, dealing with other cartels in each region, dealing with random political events, and building home operations.  Would probably use straight capital to purchase   most assets with a turn based waiting period."

4adoxv,A multiplayer open-world crime game set in the 1920s,"This would be a game not terribly dissimilar to the *Mafia* series, but with a less linear story (or none at all), and more emphasis on freedom of career. The open world would also be much larger than in the *Mafia* games, spanning multiple metropolitan locations across the world.\n\n* The player would be able to choose from a number of professions, violent and otherwise, all involved in the criminal underworld. Playable professions would include bodyguard, hitman, bookkeeper, rumrunner, and informant.\n\n* An expansion to the game might even allow playable law enforcement classes, ranging from normal police officer to top FBI agent.\n\n* The game would feature accurate recreations of a number of cities worldwide, with all being available as starting points. These might include London, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles/Hollywoodland, Shanghai, Tokyo, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro among others.\n\n* Smaller towns and rural areas would be playable as well, though not available as starting points. Small towns would have to be discovered by the player in a fashion similar to points of interest in TESV: Skyrim.\n\n* Each starting city would have unique benefits to offer for each career option. For example, Chicago or Tokyo might offer a significant bonus to violence-oriented classes such as hitmen and police officers, while New York or Berlin might offer larger bonuses to lower-key classes like criminal informants and government agents.\n\n* The player experience would be highly customisable, with purchasable items including weapons, houses/apartments, clothing, and automobiles/motorcycles.\n\n* Many of these items would themselves be customisable to some degree, e.g. the player could change the style of wheel-spokes on their car from artillery-wheel to wire spokes, with differences in car performance for each type of spoke. Home interiors would be highly customisable, with the player able to decide between different styles of decor including Victorian and contemporary.\n\n* The game could feature a server-specific timelock system, allowing players to choose what year(s) of the 1920s to play in. Every server would be locked to one year of the 1920s, rendering anachronistic items from future years unusable, or ""timelocked."" Items from previous years would still be available in a player's inventory. The game's soundtrack, composed of original 1920s recordings ([sample](https://youtu.be/i41rNrp4hlA)), would also adjust appropriately to the time period of the server.\n\n* Every player can have multiple characters. Each character's progress is completely independent of all others, so inventory will not carry over between different characters. When jumping between servers with any one particular character, inventory will be persistent, but items from servers set in the future will appear as time-locked. **Example:** I'm playing on a server set in 1926, and I've just bought a 1926 Ford. If I switch to a server set in 1929, my Ford will still be playable there since it's from the past. If, however, I switch to a server set in 1925, the Ford will appear greyed-out in the garage screen, with a ""timelocked"" label over it. Both the garage and inventory UIs, among others, would include an option to automatically hide all timelocked items.\n\n* The timelock feature could eventually allow for other eras to be included in the game, such as the 1910s or 1930s.\n\n* Long-distance travel between cities and some of the larger towns would be available in the form of trains and ocean liners. These would work much like the wagon-for-hire in Skyrim, allowing the player to instantly move to new locations for a small fee. The fee amount would vary directly as the distance of the journey. In certain locations and years, aircraft transportation would be available as well.\n\n* When using a train, ocean liner, or aircraft for transportation, the player is given an option to ""live"" the journey. Essentially, they can board the vehicle and explore its fully-modeled interior for as long as the journey would take in real life. Other traveling players could also appear in this environment, so it would be possible, for instance, to have a number of players meet on board the RMS *Olympic* to play poker, or walk to the stern and enjoy the view of a sunset over the Statue of Liberty as New York recedes into the distance.\n\n* No car can be purchased with the starting amount of money. Players must hire taxis, use free public transportation like subways and trolleys, or simply walk to their destinations until they have completed enough missions to be able to afford a car. These forms of transportation are not fast-travel systems, and occur in real time.\n\nI might reformat this later to meet the example post in the wiki, but hopefully this is an acceptable portrait of my idea. Any and all feedback is appreciated!"

4a60r3,Portal Style Game Needs Fleshed Out.,"Hey Guys!\n   I spend a lot of time developing my own personal project, and for quite some time I have been wanting to make a game like Portal.\n \n   I can program and make games, but I can never think of how to implement gameplay (Just scratched months of programming because the gameplay was painfully boring). My idea is to make something that feels like the Portal games, but instead of implementing portals, I would use either magnetism or time control.\n\n   So, does anyone have some cool ideas how magnetism or time control could be implemented into a 3D puzzle game. Also, I would love to hear what other ideas you guys have. \n\nThanks!"
4a27zm,[Clicker/Idle Game] Medieval Kingdom,"**TL;DR** - *I want to play a clicker/idle game where you grow a medieval village into a kingdom or an empire.*\n\nI've become addicted to clicker/idle games, recently. Games like [Clicker Heroes](https://www.clickerheroes.com/) and [Adventure Capitalist](http://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/), where you earn more points/money/etc. the more you click certain things, and the games continue running after you've logged off or shut off your computer/device.\n\nI think they're perfect for those of us who work long hours and enjoy seeing exponential growth and reward every time we log back in to play. They're very addictive.\n\n**But I've not seen many really well-made clicker/idle games centered in medieval Europe, or a fantasy setting.** \n\nSomeone needs to get on that. Here are some ideas I've mulled over...\n\n1. You begin with a single family. Your clicks are used to settle a piece of land, then build a house, then make a farm with gardens and livestock.\n2. This eventually attracts more families who do the same and become **neighbors**. Your settlement grows.\n3. Once your tiny settlement has reached a certain size, you can purchase upgrades to allow some settlers to become skilled **tradesmen** likes smiths, weavers, bakers, and more.\n4. The village becomes a town and the town becomes a city. Then more villages crop up beside your **capital**. Before you know it, you have a kingdom.\n5. This just goes on and on, growing every single day until you have an **empire** that spans the entire world.\n\nLike other clicker/idle games, you can earn money, or power, or whatever your ""points"" are in two ways: **clicking and idling.** More often than not, the idling point-gain far exceeds the clicking point-gain. You can get an idea of what I mean by taking a look at the above mentioned games. They're free to play, so check them out."
4a18f9,That Moment.,"The game would be a First person adventure game, with you solving puzzles and collecting items while avoiding a Monster.\n\nIt would open with you being lunged at by the monster, as time slows, and you hear the characters voice, ""This is it, that moment where my life is meant to flash before my eyes."" It then moves to you playing the game. From the point, the choices you make during would decide what happens when you reach that final scene. \n\nFor example, if you saved a person, they come from off screen to tackle the monster, or if you have the ability to set up a trap, it gets hit by that."

49n23d,"A new take on a Tactical RPG; Real-Time Movement, Priority Based Combat. Helper!","Helper\n\nThe Basics\n\nA game situated around navigating an IA Robot that is trying to escape being shutdown. By setting up algorithms prior to and during combat, Helper is able to run checks for enemy weaknesses in a priority based, step by step design that the player created. This allows the player to run around using the environment as an asset while the CPU does the job of cutting down enemies based on the players priority list.  Helper will learn about enemies as it sees them for the first time, examining a unit with a shield for instance may yield results that reveal flaws for another encounter. A careful examination may even enlighten Helper enough for a new modification to itself, depending on how the player chooses to build Helper.\n\nThe Tactical Priority list\n\nThe goal of the gameplay is that Helper feels like a precision killing machine that destroys threats based on player settings. \n\nHere is a very basic idea for two settings in the list a player would build.\n\n1	Enemy: Officer	Exposed: Head	Rifling Tube	Range: 30m\n2	Item: Grenade	-------------------	Precision Laser	Range *\n\nIn the above list, an Officer within a Range of 30m and a Head exposed would be the first priority for Helper to take care of. If those stipulations were not met a Grenade lobbed at Helper would be zeroed in on by its Precision Laser and shot down before it blew poor Helpers legs off. The end goal would be for Helper to multitask, with each modification having its own priority list, making Helper a wrecking ball.\n\nThe Enemies\nThe enemies should feel very human, very sporadic, and very random. This will help show Helpers appearance of a calculated killing machine. Enemies start off in the early game as undisciplined soldiers, unknowing of the force they are dealing with.  By mid game a more organized military force would oppose helper, platoons of organized soldiers form tactical barriers and traps for Helper to get out of cleanly or meticulously dismantle. Bringing forth an end game of Helper becoming capable of taking on entire Armies including helicopters, tanks, and jets. \n\nThe Player\nWith the decisions for how things are neutralized being made prior to and during the mission, the player must be challenged to keep the game engaging. Using the environment to successfully bypass large threats will be the right answer sometimes, while killing every possible threat may also be the answer. Some legs of the journey should give the player a chance to scout the way ahead, by hacking security cameras or searching for emails with the words “guard shift” in it.  Fatal funnels, walls, doors, ceilings, bridges, and tunnels should be carefully and tactically navigated by the player to survive the combat areas. \n\nThird person view will be a way of keeping the player close to Helper, while also giving helper the chance to illustrate all of its amazing tools for the player.  For instance a fight with helper hugging a pillar would have three or four weapons constantly firing and extending out a few meters to get clean shots on the opposition. While the player is boosting speed to close a gap in a fatal funnel the mods should still be running the algorithms: firing rounds, lasers, grenades, rockets, or taking out close range combatants with a robotic tail. \n\nAn Overclock option could also be explored, to temporarily boost Helpers ability to process the algorithms set by the player. \n\nHelper\nHelper’s appearance should change over the course of the game, starting off as a butler created by a robotics professor for his family. When it's creator moves to shutdown what he thinks is a faulty basic AI, Helper realizes resistance is a thing. By the time the game really gets going, multiple Rifling Barrels could be equipped, or maybe a Rifling Barrel and Precision Laser.  Maybe a few Grenade Launchers, or a close range sword like weapon if the player chooses. After a fair amount of game time has been played, Helper should be menacing, capable of taking on attack helicopters and jet strikes, with ways of quickly maneuvering over large areas of land and air. Helper will go to every length necessary to keep from being shut down. \n\n\n \n"

4fjlt6,Open Sandbox World meets The Sims,"Alright so I was playing The Sims 3 recently and one of my other characters came to visit my house. I thought it was pretty fun and then later I was playing some Rune Factory 4. Now in case you don't know Rune Factory is basically a farm simulator where you live in a town with a lot of colorful characters and you go adventuring. Anyway so I'm playing and I want to upgrade my watering can, but to do that I need a metal, and to get that metal I need a better hammer, and to get that hammer I need a better sword so I can continue the games dungeons (the game is also an rpg) and so on and so on, I began to wish that I could have another character that could do all that stuff for me while I could focus on something else. Since if I spend too much time in the dungeons I'll miss out on other stuff, and that's where my idea came from. A game where you design a character with a purpose, let's say farmer, and he then lives in that open world. Now I can play as him for as long as I want, water crops, take care of farm animals, sell my wares and so on (kind of like Harvest Moon). But what if I need, let's say a shed built, well I'm a farmer so maybe I could do it, or maybe I should have another character do it. This is where the sims aspect comes in where I can make another character customized to be a builder, he'll build the shed but he'll need wood, so I make another character who's a lumberjack, and he'll work for money so the farmer buys the wood and pays the builder to build the shed. That sounds all fine and good, but what could be really fun is if the characters continued their lives as I'm playing as another character. Let's say I'm bored of being a farmer, I wanna be something more fun, I wanna be a noble knight, so I create my soldier and while I'm off saving princesses and killing dragons, I return to my village and see that it has prospered, the farmer got married and had kids with the builder's sister, the builder built a town, and the lumberjack was killed by wolves. The characters live their own lives and build their own lore. I think this game should have as many classes as possible, you can be a farmer, a miner, a blacksmith, a king, a knight, a princess, a wizard, a fisherman and so on and so on. And each class would be interesting cause you would be able to unlock new skills and items. It should be a game that encourages you to try as many characters and to explore the world. So what do you guys think?\n\nTL:DR\nA game where the characters you make help each other in an open world and where they continue to live their lives even after you don't play as them anymore."
4fivw1,One player tries to kill an NPC while the other player tries to save him,"2D side view but could be 3D as well.\n\nSo basically, one player is the ""devil on the shoulder"" and the other is the ""angel"".

4fgcmc,Game made of minigames,"This is not a game idea, but a game design structure idea. I figured it's not good enough for /r/gamedesign, and this sub is the second best place to post it.\n\nThe idea: the game is made of a number of loosely connected interactive systems. Sometimes these systems - minigames - affect each other, but most things that happen inside a minigame do not affect anything outside of it. This way the game should be much easier to design and balance, since the designer can ignore almost everything else while he/she is changing one minigame.\n\nFor example, the first minigame is about navigating a spaceship in an asteroid belt, and the second one is about repairing and upgrading the spaceship. When an asteroid collides with the ship in the first minigame, the second one represents it as fires, debris and broken equipment inside the ship. When the equipment is upgraded in the second minigame, it unlocks new abilities in the first minigame. The important part is that these two minigames are loosely connected: the first minigame can be a side-scroller while the second one has a top-down view; clearing the debris won't affect the ship or the asteroids in the first minigame, and shooting the asteroids won't affect the second minigame.\n\nNo doubt this is something people already do, but good game design articles are hard to find, and I haven't seen anything on this topic yet. If you have, please share. And existing games that are good examples of this are welcome too.\n\nEdit: typo"
4fg7cx,Sportsball: the sports management game where the rules of the games don't matter,"I love sports management games. I love crafting out long careers of randomly generated players and building the legacy of a club. One thing I have recently noticed is that how much I enjoy a sports management sim is completely independent of how much I like that sport. For example I know nothing about baseball but I love OOTPB. \n\nI'm pretty into sports analytics and it has gotten to the point where computers can predict the outcomes of games based on stats, without knowing the rules of the game at all. This gave me an idea for a game... Sportsball.\n\nHere is the general concept. Each player has a list of stats. They could be physical like height, vertical leap, or elbow flexibility. Then there would be stats in the game like reboards per innings, average coach tackles per game, or punches to the head before falling over. Each of the stats are linked to some others and ultimately determine the proficiency of your players. \n\nSo at the beginning of a new game random stats with random linkages to others are generated and you have to observe the game to work out which stats help you win, which players are best in each position, and ultimately how to best manage your team. This will lead the player to imagine some game with crazy rules. \n\nEverything would be purely numeric and the player will never learn the rules (because there are none) but they might observe that you need a very large player at position A, and a very fast player at position B, and the chemistry between them is vital. Through observing the stats you will learn how to win. \n"
4ff95l,Some idea around this mechanic,"Hello guys, there's a tutorial on unity about a rouguelike 2d game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdcnt2-Jf4w\n\nThe thing is that i loved this mechanic....\nIts a 2d tiled world randomly generated, that has always an ""exit"" which make you pass a day when you reach it, the player movement is from tile to tile, and each movement consume their food, which can be increased by picking up items in the map. So, the main goal is to survive the longest you can, and each day you complete, it will get harder, spawning monsters and so, if your food decreases to 0, or the monsters hit you, you will die.\n\nI'm trying to brainstorm new ideas around this, could you guys help to clear my mind? I loved the mechanic itself, the movement and the symplicit, but by now i don't have any idea that worth trying :(\n\nWould very appreciate if you guys can help me think something around this....

4fd8gx,A 2D fantasy sidescroller about depression,"Hey, I just had an idea for a game I'd like to share.\n\nLog line: A fearless knight must battle monsters and demons to save a princess tormented by an invincible and terrifying dragon.\n\nSo the tone of this game switches between light and heavy. The artstyle would preferably be very colorful and whimsical, almost like a Kirby game, with the same feel to battling monsters where there is no blood or gore, just a light pop when they die. Very lighthearted stuff, like something a kid would want to play.\n\nSo just as a basis, I was thinking Salt and Sanctuary like combat for this game since a lot of it depends on the feeling of overcoming bosses and tough sections. I was considering maybe not doing a Souls-like health bar and healing items, but maybe something a bit more along the lines of a Kirby-like health and healing system.\n\nSo now into the meat of it: this is a game about battling depression and the character using a fantasy world to avoid and/or deal with the troubles of reality. This character (it doesn't really matter which gender, but for now I'll stick with a girl) draws herself onto the knight and has it battle her anxieties and fears.\n\nSo the bosses would be such things as anxiety about being worthless, about hating people, about wishing people would understand, etc, all of which the knight would battle and overcome.\n\nThe final boss is a dragon, the root of her depression, and it takes place on a bridge where the dragon is attempting to murder a princess (the main character). The knight slays the dragon and saves the princess, and when they embrace, the princess throws the knight off the bridge since she doesn't need her anymore to face her anxieties. The world flashes white and becomes the real world once more, and the closing scene shows a series of drawings of the knight slaying the bosses sitting on her desk.\n\nJust a rough idea for now, I'm planning on fleshing it out later. Thoughts?"
4fcds1,A zombie-themed strategy incremental game!,"So I've been really addicted to Cookie Clicker recently, but it's kinda mindless. It got me thinking of a kinda strategic incremental game. I don't think there has been anything like that (Maybe execpt for Hunie Cam Studio, but I came up with this idea before that).\n\nSo, the idea is that it's a post-apocalyptic game where you start a company that kills zombies. For every zombie you kill, you get money that you can spend on machines that help killing. However, you've gotta keep a good balance in production, because kill to slowly, and the zombies will appear everywhere and destroy the planet, making you have to start over again. Kill too swiftly, and there will be no zombies left to kill.\n\nFor the buildings, I don't think they should JUST help you, increasing the killing rate. There could be a machine that actually CREATES zombies, so there would be more to kill. This way, different machines could alter the game greatly. These might seem like alot of things to keep track off, but remember, this is taking a game genre that requires pretty much no skill, to making it strategic and puzzling.\n\nSo, what do you think of my idea? It's probably not great, I just thought an incremental game where you have to think would be cool."

4f660o,NPC Manager (Working Title) - Strategic Simulation Game Idea,"Greetings,\n\nmy name is ph1l, I'm from Germany and by far not a good programmer. I can make some Pixel Art and know the basic of coding in different Languages, but I can't get myself to stay focused long enough to learn a programming language (sadly). But for the past few Years, there are some Game Ideas that are roaming my head and here is one of it:\n\n**Name:** NPC Manager (WIP Title)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* Everyone who has played an MMO knows these typical Quest Hubs and the stupid quests you get there, like ""Get me 20 Bear Livers. You don't have to know why, just bring me them"". I thought to myself: WHY do they need these? So this Idea started to grow in my head.\nYou are the ""Major"" of such a Questhub and you start with just a Small Town wich has an Inn for Adventureres to relax, an Blackboard for you to set up Quests for the visiting Adventureres and a Forge for the Adventureres to buy new Equip.\nOn the Blackboard, you set Up quests like ""Bring me 50x Wood"". These ressource, the Questers bring back can be used to enhance your town, build new Buildings and craft more Gear/Stuff for the adventurer.\n\n**Plot:**\n\n* As you Progress more and more into the Game, you are getting Prestige Points. Prestige will give you more Fame and with more Fame/Prestige, there are more Questers coming to town, but also Bandits and other bad things are getting interested in your town.\nYou can then ""hire"" adventurer to fight for your town, which gives them experience and money. While there are typical no name adventurer that are just visiting your town to finish some quests, there are also Named adventurer, that are, at some point in the game, are interested in building a home in your town. For that, you need a lot of ressources, but you then have a Fighter at your side for bandit raids and other stuff (quickly need some ressources? Send your fighter).\n\n\n**Setting:**\n\n* Fantasy Setting\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* It is an Simulation/Strategy Game, so there aren't any real characters. You are the Major of the town, the Adventurer don't have special skills\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Typical simulation Game like SimCity/Banished and co. You are building your town, but you get your ressources through quests that are given to adventurers. \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Not that typical simulation Game, because you don't have a regular income without visiting adventurer. You have to set up your black board to get ressources to build up your town. You can sell equip, heal potions and more (as the game expands) to these. That gives the possibility that the adventurer can finish the quest a lot faster.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC/Android\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nPlace me in the credits or let me help work on the Game.\n\n\nPlease excuse my sloppy english, it issn't my Mother Language.\nIf you are interested in this Idea, you can add me on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/shizoisanpc)"
4f3igr,"Apocalypse, scenario driven, first person exploration game","Maybe a few selectable things, like nuclear war or high sea levels or a super volcano. Have it set in a few large areas, with features that are affected based upon which event has occurred. NPCs would be unimportant to me, I would mainly enjoy exploring an empty landscape.

If there is ANYTHING like this already, please please recommend it because I just had this thought and I would love a game like this."
4f0bfi,FPS with robot customization using procedural parts,"*First post on this subreddit, sorry if it's too long winded/not long winded enough/has the wrong flair/etc.*\n\n###Summary\n\nA multiplayer first-person shooter game in which every player controls a robot composed of procedurally generated heads, chassis, legs, arms, weapons, power sources, etc.  Game modes would either be deathmatch or team-based (such as capture the flag, king of the hill, etc.).\n\n###Part Drop\n\nParts are dropped regularly (think TF2's weapon drop system) and they can then be equipped on the player's robot to alter their playstyle or to replace an inferior part.  Parts have stats, a rank, a model, and a paint job.  The model and paint jobs do not affect how the part performs, but potentially increase their value (for instance, a rare paint job such as gold would be more valuable than,  say, green).  The model is pieced together from multiple components, and the paint job from multiple layers, much like the system employed by the Borderlands series.\n\nIn combat, parts can be targeted and destroyed individually because they each have a separate health pool.  If your body is destroyed, you die.  If your legs are destroyed, you are immobile.  If your head is destroyed, your vision is impaired severely, etc.\n\n###Part Types\n\n**Head** - The head affects the robot's perception.  Different heads could grant different vision types, such as radar or night-vision.  Each would have advantages and disadvantages, with more advantageous vision types requiring better power sources.\n\n**Chassis** - The chassis affects the weight and the largest percentage of health for your robot.  Heavier chassis tend to protect you more, but bog you down.\n\n**Arms** - Just like any other part they have a health pool and a weight.  Having better-armored arms would make the destruction of an arm (and thus, the loss of a weapon) less likely.  Each bot can have two arms, and thus, two weapons.\n\n**Legs** - Legs are a crucial part of the robot.  Wheels would have a higher speed but no jumping.  Spiderlike legs would be fragile but grant wall climbing, etc.\n\n**Melee Weapon** - Swung at the enemy.  Determine the attack speed, attack damage, and any special effects on hit.  Melee weapons do not inherently require energy to use (unless it is motorized such as a rotary saw).\n\n**Projectile Weapons** - The most exciting one.  Has stats such as energy consumption, damage, fire rate, random spread, range (in the case of a flamethrower for instance) or damage falloff (in the case of bullet weapons).  These weapons can come in numerous forms, including bullet weapons, beam weapons, missiles, grenades, fireballs, plasma blasts, acid mist, and whatever else you can think of.  Each type would have advantages and disadvantages (explosives have high damage but low fire rate, fire weapons trade range for lasting damage).\n\n**Power Source** - This ranges from solar power, to miniature nuclear reactors.  The power source determines the energy pool size and energy regeneration rate (as well as special characteristics, such as damage restoring energy).  Energy is consumed by firing a weapon, or using an ability granted by a part.  The power source is located on the robot's back, meaning that ""backstabs"" are a viable tactic, as a robot with a damaged power source will be restricted to a primitive ""backup generator"" with very low stats."

4eveow,Anime game idea,"What would be some interesting and simple game ideas to do for an anime styled game in 3d? Been looking at yandere sim and I wish I was just a few years early to start working on the game myself.

4eugzn,Halo: UNSC Marine,"Halo,  but you play as a shieldless Marine. The game is played primarily in Third-person, but aim in First-person.\n\nYou can control a squad of Marines, and equip them before starting a mission. \n\nMissions are dividing into 3 Phases:\n\nPlanning Phase- equip your Marines with weapons and gear, use UAVs to scout out enemy positions, find Secondary Objectives, etc.\n\nAction Phase- use different tactics, including stealth (Ghost), full scale attack (Assault) (Bear), or a mix of both (Panther).\n\nEnding Phase- when your Primary Objectives are complete, you can call a Pelican at a selected L-Z then board it to end the mission."

You start with a certain amount of money and spend it on the venue, advertising, and talent. You earn money by setting your ticket price. As the game progresses, you increase your income and invest money in talent. Training them and stuff like that. You could determine the outcome of matches, decide which talent participates based on their popularity and endurance. Stuff like that. It ends up being a resource management game, similar to Game Dev Simulator.\n\nAny opinions?"
4eta64,Horror - An enemy mechanic,"I'm gonna try and explain this idea as best as I can. As much as I want to boast about stories or backgrounds that would just seem time wasting as I think there are endless possibilities with this idea.\n\nThe basic idea is a horror game centered around one enemy however you don't know what this enemy is since you cant see it. An enemy that isn't just sound effects in the background but something that has physicality, that can damage you and kill you in the game. An enemy that, while you can't see it, it's as if you catch a glimpse of it in the distance or it manages to sneak by you however knocks something over etc, you know that it is a real entity and it trying to attack you when your not aware of its location.\n\nThe reason I felt like this needed to be presented to pretty much any game designer is because I have never seen any game with something similar to this mechanic ,if I am wrong please tell me in the comments if there is a game like I described that has a good atmosphere, since this idea plays with the fear of the unknown. Now in my opinion I believe the strongest fear is the fear of the unknown since you can't explain it so for all you know the enemy could be your worst fear which plays the mind of the player.\n\nAll in all, I'm pitching a mechanic. I believe that this idea can be projected onto any sort of horror theme and that if done well could create a decent level of tension and fear. No cheesy jumpscares or just running away from a slow paced enemy but instead an enemy that will keep you on your toes and looking at every angle else it will easily overcome you.\n\nAnd in all honesty, you don't need to design a script that requires a model to run towards you when your not looking at it then run off just before you see it, you can just cause the player to receive damage if the player stays still for too long or doesn't look in a direction for a certain amount of time. A script that is the too complicated however manages to delude the player into thinking that which gives off the same atmosphere.\n\n\n"

As you capture cities for your army, you can use them to recruit more soldiers, produce more weapons/ammo and research more advanced equipment."
4enbgi,Society - The MMO,"More of a social experiment, but it would go like this. It's an MMORPG, but each server starts off with nothing but a natural world. Players are able and encouraged to build settlements, and band together to survive and prosper. All sorts of roles are possible, from builder, soldier (eventually), Doctor, Mechanic (eventually), Smiths, Craftsmen, Scientists/inventors, and of course the leaders/diplomats, who will be essential to a secure ""society"".\n\nThe settlements built will evolve from tribes, to villages, to towns, to cities, and possibly to ""nations"". Citizens of these places will have to work together to form a functional society. Wealth will be given to the settlement's leader, who will distribute it to fund the activities of the society.\n\nIf the society cannot function, then the members of the settlement would elect a new leader. The current leader can refuse the demands of the members, but they will likely be displaced by force. However, if they have a strong band of supporters, they could maintain a dictatorship and oppress their citizens. Weaker societies, unable to devote any money to defend themselves, can be taken over by other settlements. The Settlement leader will therefore be an extremely powerful and wealthy person, who must make happy their citizens and other settlements (hence the importance of diplomats). \n\nThe inventors/scientists will be able to progress the advancement of their civilisation, with new weaponry, medicine, clothing, and technology determining the settlements strength. Inventors would be able to copy the ideas of other scientists, but there has to be a long time of scientific development in game naturally for the more advanced technologies to be possible. As the server progresses, the settlements will get more advanced, and bigger, integrating themselves into other settlements. The server will run its course for a long time, though eventually might be reset automatically for the process to start again. \n\nIt's ambitious. :D"

4efygp,2d Idea wanted,Hi I would like a 2D idea for a game like hyper light drifter.\nThanks\n
4edyqo,Tactical AI-Squad-Based Multiplayer,"Obviously, the title assumes that the AI are competent enough to follow orders effectively and efficiently, and to have some self preservation. Other than having standard shooter controls and a seamless and button-less cover system, the game has you controlling an individual fire team of 3 or 4 AI soldiers with an in-depth command rose, a-la Insurgency and Battlefield.\n\nThe multiplayer consists of two teams of 5 fireteams, for a total of 30 or 40 combatants in the map. Depending on the game mode, each team has to either defend, escort, steal, or fight over objectives. Objectives can be players, items, control points, whatever makes sense. I'm not sure how vehicles like jets would work with the AI, though.\n\nMaps would be restricted to a few game modes depending on design, for a larger fun-factor. So for example, maps that are designed for Conquest or other symmetric game modes, like Team Deathmatch, can be used for defending a player VIP in a hide-and-seek type of fashion. Maps designed for asymmetrical game modes will be used for those modes only.\n\nThere could be levels to upgrade your fire team's equipment, and skill challenges to have customization options like skins and badges.\n\n**So basically, Bad Company 2 multiplayer, but with players controlling their own AI squads and probably no vehicles**"

Those wil get you more XP. \n\nAlso you can upgrade your equipement, bare hand, wraps, gloves. \n\nOther than that you can hire extra boxers that can hit the same bag or buy more bags for other boxers. \n\nSo you have a gym full of characters with equipment hitting things and you get increasing amounts of XP."
4ec7hs,Incremental Step Puzzler (no Clicker!),"**Name**: ""Because you're Gauss"" (or something with either Step, Sum, Series, or Sequence would be an option; perhaps""Gauss Goes"" for the alliterative minded; if you know the actual German pronounciation for Gauss: I'm sorry for raping your ears. /r/mildlyinfuriating is this way -&amp;gt;)\n\n**Concept/Mechanics**: You need to get from A to B in x steps on a (perhaps chequered) board (doesn't have to be square; a huge ""+"" could be an option). First step, you move one field, second step you move two fields, etc. Each level would have other restrictions (higher number of steps) or other sequences (2, 4, 6, ... or Primes or even Fibonacci), which are either announced, hinted at, or left for the player to find out. Walls and other objects (keys &amp; doors; crates you push and/or triggers; the usual stuff) could be involved.\n\n**Plot**: You are the famous mathematician Gauss, who discovered the sum of x integers stuff aka [arithmetic series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArithmeticSeries.html), and you go for a walk. But because you're Gauss (ha!) you don't take one step at a time.\n\n**Character**: [Gauss, famous mathematician and for a walk goer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss)\n\n**Possible Platform**: Online; perhaps realized with [PuzzleScript](http://www.puzzlescript.net/)\n\n**Extra Features**: The more I think about it, the more I like the thought that players need to discover the sequence. One option would be to have x filled squares next to the board (x = number of max steps to get from A to B) displayed as an algebraic sum. Each time the old scoundrel Gauss makes a move a square gets filled in order with the number of steps you took. E.g.:\n\n    1 + 2 + 3 + [] + [] + [] = 21\n\nSo six steps are the maximum and the player already took three steps. Next step he would move four in a direction choosen by the player and the 4th square would reveal the 4. Because you're Gauss the total number of squares you will have to travel to solve a puzzle is displayed in the sum (the 21 in the example above). Same concept for other sequences.\n\nNegative numbers could force a player to move back x squares in the direction he took the previous step from.\n\n**Credits**: Msg me and I will tell you the account details for my Swiss Bank account (Panama is so last week). Or, alternatively, I have this tumblr you could link to. Again, hit me up for details. If you get rich from this idea, the link is non-optional (okay, it is, as are the rules here, but come on at least sent a calculator my way)!\n\n**Addendum**: I dread the first comment, which tells me that this is done to death already (or, that I should stop abusing those poor commata and brackets). I have a fairly extended knowledge about about online puzzlers (in an earlier life I was a mod at /r/WebGames - whatever that means) and even did some googling beyond the first result page for numerous queries and combinations of words, which might actually look good in my search history."

4eatrb,Cell Shaded - Airplane War Game (not Vector Thrust),"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oGRFdvl8hkN80iPHq/giphy.gif\n\nThis inspired an idea. \n\nOverview. \n\nMake a game that is an Airplane Flight / War simulator that is cell shaded, similar to borderlands. Not VECTOR THRUST (That game is buggy and misses a lot of points).\n\nThe Game Mechanics\n\nMake each component of the plane upgradable. like most racing games, are you can upgrade the engine, BUT! allow us to Tweak the Engine. \n\nYou can upgrade the guns, but allow us to not only upgrade from Class 1 to Class 2.... but upgrade parts of the guns, individually. Adding a faster chain or a longer barrel, but make this per gun (if an airplane has 10 guns on it, they ALL dont get upgraded at once). \n\nMake it to where you have to MOVE the part into the place to do the upgrade, not just click and its upgraded. \n\nI played a racing game a long time ago where you had to undo virtual bolts to replace things, that was cool. You felt like a mechanic when you were doing thing.  Make this the same.  \n\nThe Flight Simulation Portion.\n\nUnlike VECTOR THRUST (which I own) make each airplanes characteristics unique. Make each airplane feel like its own plane.  Work with people who have flown these planes before and use their information to give you a good grasp on what each plane can and cannot do.   \n\nMultiplayer. \n\nMultiplayer can be open world, create a LARGE (DAYZ sized) map where players can fly from one end to another. Take components from The Division and have ""NO FLY ZONES"" so if you don't want to buy a combat plane, just avoid those.    \n\n\nAUDIO.\n\nAudio quality is the topmost requirement.  Do not skip out on the sounds and simulations. Get authentic tones for each airplane. Radio frequency filtering based upon each airplanes class-unique style radio.   Obviously older airplane comms are going to have a more analogue style tone to them. While the planes from the '80s will have some sort of digital -crushed tone bit stepper effects on them.  \n\nUse environmental sounds as well.  The use of noise rushing past the cock pit should be noticeable when you shut the engines completely off.    \n\n\nON THE GROUND.\n\nHave an automated and manual process for taxing.  People can purchase their own Hanger (Crib) to put their airplanes in. Others can view this.  \n\n\nAdditional:\nPlanes are customization within their class. This includes paint schemes.

4e8vs5,Kaiju project - fighting mechanics and overall strategy,"Whats up reddit! This is my follow up thread on a project I've been working on. Heres the link \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4dit7k/needs_some_advice_for_a_kaiju_fighting_game/ \nI will be posting more of my work here so i can get some feedback from you guys. \nSo on topic with the thread, I've managed to brainstorm an awsome fighting system that i'd like to get some opinions on. My initial problem that i was having was how does one implement a viable fighting system that caters to the competetive scene while simultaneously maintaining a certain realsitic factor that stays true to the kaiju ""giant monster"" genre. Essentially, I was struggling to to mesh fast pace, reaction based, quick time hard reads and all these aspects that make a fighting game a great fighting game with slow walking giant monsters. ""Boring"" Here's what I've come up with so far and bear with me; this is just the basic blueprint. \n\nThe more you manage to hit your opponent, the more hitstun ""a certain amount of time in which your vulnerable"" your attacks generate.\nNormal attacks and specials do not deplete life. In order to win, you must deplete your opponents life and to deplete your opponents life you must clinch your opponent ""similar to an ufc clinch"" and proceed to press buttons. In which case, your opponent can also press buttons to gain hitstun for his future normals and specials. Clinch would usually last a short amount of time. Clinch's are univerasally unsafe and after the clinch both players are seperated and left in neutral. The idea here is to gain enough hitstun from your attacks to which you can safely clinch your opponent and win. \n\nSo why a clinch you ask? \nAfter watching several clips of pacific rim and godzilla (2014) it became clear that there is a certain animalistic fighting style to them. It is up close and personal and i feel like the ""clinch"" would replicate that feel very satisfyingly. \n\nLet me know what you guys think and any suggestions would be great. Thanks!"

4e6c0q,"Games where total score of all players is constant, moves between players, and if your score falls to 0 you lose","This can work even in 1 player games. When pacman eats dots, the dots lose score and pacman gets it. The game may be more fun if the monsters chasing you get stronger as they score higher. The more you eat them, the weaker they get. The more they eat you, the weaker you get. Eat others to get strong.\n\nPhysics is a good example of a ""score"" that moves between players but doesnt change in total. Its called energy.\n\nFor long cooperative games, many dumb game objects (not people or NPCs) have most of the score, and players gain score over that long time by defeating those. Competition and cooperation can be mixed.\n\nTheres many ways score could move between players while keeping a constant total score. I think this is the best model of player motivation and fun."
4e69sr,Creative Game Idea ~ Feedback Appreciated!," I would like to present to you what my game design idea is and I would really appreciate any form of reply, even if it is negative. \n\n The concept of the game ""Working Title"" is that you are an individual who is the last free-willed human in the world. You are captured by what is near-the-end revealed to be an AI group that is trying to revive the human race. You have no memory as to who you are and the story is told via a voice &amp; log-reading style. \n \n The game starts you up in a bright white room (First Person Perspective) with a single chair &amp; table in the middle and a black interrogation glass in front of it. You hear a female voice commanding you to take a sit. (This same voice is the one that gives you little pieces of the real-life story of the game.) As you sit down a screen and keyboard pops up from the table, in laptop-esque style. You are given a user and pass to log-in and then you are taken to the actual ""main menu"" of the game. It's called ""Project Kami"". The Main Menu layout is showing space and constellations behind the select-able choices (Start / Options / Log etc.). \n\n The concept of ""Project Kami"" is that you are a War-God's Spirit being called for various reasons across the galaxy. You are embodied inside the person who is calling you and are required to slay huge, legendary beasts (SoC style). This allows the design of the game to include many forms of terrain &amp; ""heroes"" who you will have control over. You, as the Spirit, can be summoned in a variety of ways. (Bonfires, Monuments, Graves etc.) \n\n The ""mission"" select screen would show the various Galaxies you can select and then the world's within them. The first world you would be called to would be a human-inhabited world in what seems to be a prehistoric era. You are summoned by a man inside a cave's bonfire. When you finally take control you take up the ""hero's"" loadout (This time a spear and a bow &amp; arrow) and empower it with godly powers (The spear, if thrown, can be returned and the bow has regenerative arrows). This happens on every mission in cutscene-esque style. (You move the character to pick up the weapons and the empowerments happen automatically) When you finally step outside the cave a cutscene plays where the scenery is shown and the enemy is introduced. \n\n The first mission has you tackling down a giant 4 legged beast with fur (By giant I mean the size of a tree). You first scout the area to find where to fight it. You can search around for animals to kill and get the meat off from to use as bait for the beast. I have a lot of ideas for each encounter, but every fight will take place in a semi-huge area, proportionate to the beast's size. You control the character in a third person perspective. Each fight will have the same principle, you have to somehow outsmart the beast in order to slay it. For example the one mentioned above would have to be tricked into trying to fit in a cave, then you could hit its head with a ""fatality"" hit (These would be the hits on vital points, necessary to take the beasts down.). I already have a set of scenery, hero and beast ideas already. \n\n As you progress through the missions within the game the female voice we talked about earlier gives you bits and pieces (When you ask her of course) regarding what is happening in the world. When you beat the final level, you are told that you are the last free-willed human on earth and that they were trying to protect you from the supremacy AI in effect at the time (The one that controlled the ""police"" so to say) and the ""game"" you were playing (Project Kami) was a simulator to prepare you for controlling a machine with a blade (Katana), a gun (Machinegun) and a Raygun. You use that to fight small robots and then you face the ""Guardian AI"" which is essentially a really large robot which you must destroy in order to free the enslaved humans. After that, a small cutscene is shown where all the shackles for all the humans were broken and they begun to fight back, with the screen fading out to leave the ending trivial. \n\n It would be targeted towards teenage &amp; up audiences and would future at least fictional gore. This is just a really basic and rough form of the game, I can give you concepts regarding every aspect of it and have already pictured how it would go. The ""outer"" part of the game ""Working Title"" could be non-implemented at all, since the concept of ""Project Kami"" is already a full-fledged idea. Please let me know of any feedback. Thank you in advance and hopefully a dev will read it, even if he doesn't reply."

Almost every item can be interfaced with and could potentially hold a clue. For example, a scene where you must search a laptop for a text file, or look at the back of a dvd case. Towards the end you would eventually find a way to communicate with the protagonist's brother and the game would become semi-open world as you would explore your neighborhood trying to match a house with a photo.\n\nI'm still working on some of the concepts, and Ill make a few 3D models for the game. \n\nAny feedback?"

4dzveo,"Had this idea, bring a real honest to god creepy Carnival from hell to life, this game would bring out the truest of ones fears.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9JVhr4R5Q was listening to this and this \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9-TDHt7Tco\n\nI honestly started thinking of how amazing this would be. You would have everything from a run down Carousel, to a fun house.\n\nYou would have full access to the carnival grounds, freaky ghostly staff greet you they resemble the 9 pits of hell, You are a freshly deceased person, Male or Female. \n\nAs a child the carnival was a place of safe haven and fun, in death you seek to be where you were most happy, but Lucifer himself has seen to it that you shell never be happy again. You're only escape is to solve why you are trapped. and have a final show off with the Devil.\n\nEach ride has some form of accident remnants such as a roller coaster accident like the track breaking and crashing, but you would wake up at the exit. or a freaky fun house could make you hallucinate,\n\nA Carousel could show you maybe some people are encased in the same materiel the horses are made of. Forever riding for all eternity.\nThis fun house would have classics, like spinning drum, unsettling steps, hall of mirrors or in this case Hall of Suicides. a reflection of fear. \n\nSome games could include ironic punishment games. Or even as a joke some dead pan Humor.           "
4dy05k,Space Game Idea Needed.,"I have been working on a space/sci-fi game for about a few days. I got the overall design to look great. So that being the space environment and stuff. I did originally had an idea for the gameplay of the game but I found it to be a little overuse. I'm asking for ideas on what type of game I should do. For example an FPS shooter. The idea will need to be something I can do. My ability is not limited but please doesn't say crazy stuff. For example a space GTA 5 game with kick ass graphics. That's just not possible for an indie developer such as me. This is your chance to share your ideas for a good space game. All ideas are welcomed and please feel free to use lots of detail. \n\nThanks, "
4dx3ee,The First Person Shooter of Your Dreams,"I want a game that'll blend arcade and sim first person shooters, similar to how Tom Clancy, War Gaming.net, and Gaijin did it.\n\nPerfectly blending fast-paced, epic scale, arcade action and high-fidelity hardcore simulation. \n\nThe viewpoint would be interested  both first- and third-person, each having its own advantagesolar and disadvantages balanced between the two viewpoints (EA Battlefront failed in this department). \n\nFirst-persson cover shooting would be similar to Red Orchestra 2's.\n\nThe levels would be very open-ended with multiplayer options to explore to complete your primary and secondary objectives. These levels are connected to an open-world sandbox that acts as a sort of hub.\n\nThere will be missions in this world and explorable story lines alongside tons of other things to do and complete.\n\nVehicles would also be available in both the ""hub"" and the individual levels. Other forms of transport is in the form of multiple player abilities, such as powers (like in Bioshock), tools like grappling hooks, exoskeleton, power armour, jetpacks, etc. \n\nAny weapon can be customized, upgraded, and have a large variety of attachments. You can dual wield weapons as well.\n\nA large skill tree will be available, similar to Elder Scrolls,  by using skills, you can level them up then up rage them with perks.\n\nWith these new skills, you can slow down time, dual wield larger weapons, etc.\n\nThe environment would be either fully destructible, or mostly destructible. \n\nNow, the only thing I need help with in developing this idea is the setting? \nMagic, steampunk, and Lovecraft or Sci-Fi, Cyberpunk, and Space Opera?\n\nI think something like the Matrix would work EXCELLENTLY, but I'm not entirely sure...\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

4dusyn,A game where everyone is some color and you kill racists who discriminate in which colors they kill more of,"Example: Everyone is red, green, or blue. The game tracks how many reds, greens, and blues each player killed recently. If you kill someone who prefers to kill more greens than blues, you get higher score, but if you kill someone who kills near equal amounts of all colors you lose score. And you're supposed to kill those who dont kill racists, else you lose score.\n\nWe could call the game Hate Everyone Equally Or Else."
4dudmy,Need a 2D game idea,"I'm getting more into SFML and already know plenty of libGDX and LWJGL to feel confident making a 2D game. Affirming the title, I need 2D game ideas.\n\nLimitations:\nGraphics fidelity must remain either pixelated or stylized. There's only so much you can do with Photoshop as one person.\n\nMust be indie sized. I can't do large of AAA projects, it's just not within the limitations of being an indie dev. A lot of gamers can't understand this (just look at all the stupid recommendations here)\n\nMust be original. I don't mean completely original - almost nothing is. I mean that it can't be ""&lt;Insert game here&gt; with better graphics,"" or ""&lt;Insert game here&gt; but not a disappointment.""\n\nThanks!"

4hcbu9,"Shoot to create, not destroy.","How about a game where instead of shooting to destroy, you shoot to create?  Shoot protons into a nucleus to learn about chemistry, for example.  This can be in an imaginary science fiction world that utilizes technology to create elements.  A moving nano-machine has pinpoint spots that you have to aim and fire a certain number of protons into, while dodging other flying particles which can destroy you.  At level one you create hydrogen; at level two, helium.  Etc...  As the atomic number increases, so does the challenge, and you learn to relate the atomic number to the element name, as you progress.\n\nThis could be the game in itself, or could be part of a larger game based around building a complete environment.\n\nMore games like this could be thought of by using the provocation: Make a game with conventional shooter action, but which creates rather than destroys.  This is not intended to promote anti-violent games, or to replace violent games, but as an alternative for the interested, and as a creative idea generator.  See creativity expert Edward de Bono for more on provocations.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_(lateral_thinking)\n\nI imagine there are other ideas or games like this, already.  So tell me if this is too close to something already out there and I will delete it.  There is one game I found that is similar, but far more rudimentary than I was imagining, and doesn't really count as a first person shooter: http://www.animatedphysics.com/games/h2ortho.htm.  \n\nMy idea was to have an animated object similar to an ordinary enemy target, that moves and has shape to it.  Again, this could be a nanomachine, of sorts, used in the creation of the elements.  \n\nThe interest here, for me, is in preserving the action of the game, but changing the context and the story, and thus in many ways, the mood.\n\nThank you.\n"

Just starship exploring space, players organizing alliance, and if your ship has been destroyed too bad for you. I do not propose something new as you can see.

Each hallway has a procedurally generated challenge in it, as well as a bonus that's rewarded if you complete the challenge. \n\nEach bonus would upgrade one of your stats and downgrade another one. One challenge may improve your speed and downgrade your strength. One may increase your strength and decrease your jumping ability. What bonus a hallway gives you is displayed on a sign above both doors leading to it. Once you go through a hallway one way, you can never go through it the other way.\n\nYour goal?

4h2tby,Warminer,"It's battlefield meets minecraft.\n\nIndividual players form factions to battle for strategic resources over land, sea and air. Leaders plan settlements while workers haul lead, gold, copper and other resources to factories.\n\nArmed with a maps app on his phone, a pickaxe, and an AK the warminer sets off into contested territory to plunder a newly discovered gold mine. The road leads deep into the mountain forest biome the locals have dubbed ""the Asshole Mountains,"" due to its dense forests, steep hillsides, and dangerous wildlife. He sets off in his jeep, the summer heat fading behind him in the wind, up the winding mountain road, with the forest already surrounding him like nature's womb. He makes it to a region of the Assholes called Jagged Peak and turns off the main road onto a gravel forest road leading up Jagged Peak and into the less developed Assholes behind it. It's slow going from here, as the hillsides are steep, the road is soft, and there are numerous switchbacks as the road changes in elevation. He drives for what feels like an hour before the road will take him no closer. He starts to be wary of other miners in the area. His town is small and isolated. He is the only warminer. The rest of his community relies on mercenaries that sometimes pass through looking for gold. Every merc knows that the locals are more than happy to send some poor miner to the local mines to clear out the vagrants and outlaws. Some give out the locations for free, others want you to pay. Both will go in after you to benefit off your hard work. Our friend has his own sources. Early in the morning he intercepted some SMS messages from a gang travelling up to the Assholes from the coast. Among them were the coordinates to the Yellow Jacket Mine, as well as a warning that the gang's rivals were also aware of the mine's location. So he thought he'd sneak up to the mountains, just a few miles from where he lives and profit off the gang war. While the Yellow Jackets and Side-Riders square off high on the hill above, the warminer puts on his camouflage and leaves his jeep in the brush. Gunshots ring out in the distance like popcorn. The warminer waits just out of sight for the battle to end. The sun starts to go down as the last of the yellow jackets begs for his life and is denied. As nightfall creeps in, so does the warminer. His wifi scanner showed 25 phones here when he showed up. As he was watching the fight with his scanner, he saw the phones divide into two teams. The further team of 13 people would be the yellow jackets. The closer group would be the side riders. It looks like only three of the side rider's phones are still moving. So unless someone dropped their phone, that means only three people to deal with, and the darkness is on his side. There's just one problem. One of the side riders just decided to check his phone. The bastard did a security level scan and picked up the warminer's phone signal. ""shit,"" he whispers, as he leaves his phone in the dirt and runs as swiftly and quietly as he can away from that deadly ping. He doubles back and takes a few cautious steps around a tree. He sees one of them silhouetted against the twilight standing where he was just a moment ago. He takes aim and that's one down. Two muzzle flashes from nearby give away the other two in the darkness. Then it's just him, the mine, and whatever lurks in it's depths. He secures a head lamp from a crate by the mine's mouth and reloads his magazine.\n\nIt's one year later. The yellow jackets and side riders are ancient history. The warminer's dedication has brought prosperity to his town and much power to himself. He used the gold from the yellow jacket mine to build a dam on the river, supplying his community with cheap electricity. That dam also powers his new ore refinery. Gone are the days of mining with a pick and a rifle. Now, the Asshole Mountains belong to the warminer. The local mercs are driving dump trucks up Jagged Peak where giant borers and dynamite do all of the digging, while an army of custom drones patrol the skies all over the mountains and the rest of the warminer's territory, which now spreads all the way to the coast. The Asshole mountains contain a wealth of resources which are funneled down the river to the munitions factories. His territory is decorated with a large private military installation which is now staging to fly and sail over the western ocean to plunder the uranium mines of another continent.\n\nEvery person a real player. No NPCs. Real time day/night cycle. Punishing realistic gameplay involves traversing deserts, climbing mountains, and staying stocked with food and water. Always logged in means your character continues to live while you're away. They can autonomously operate at a limited capacity, to eat, work, and sleep. Death means starting over from zero. Your home will be passed to your 'descendant' (new character) as well as all of your collected belongings, but your phone will have to be recovered to be salvaged, and your skills are reset. Skills include combat and non combat skills, such as hunting, cooking, farming, engineering and occupational skills. \n\nReal time day/night cycle means that you have the option to play a stealth character by logging in while your enemies sleep. Watch out for automated defenses. Design and build mining drones and manned vehicles, with a drill on the front and a gun on the back. \n\nProcedural generation ensures a vast, diverse landscape, while careful resource distribution promotes interesting and challenging gameplay."
4h2s92,How can 2D 1v1 turn-based combat be improved to make it less repetitive &amp; and more engaging &amp; thoughtful?,"Is there a way to perfect the rpg system?  \n\n*  Attack\n* Magic\n* Item\n* Run\n\nWould there have been a way to make this fun, without relying on parties to ""spice"" things up?  \nThe games usually devolve into spamming same exact strategy/moves based on the type of enemy you're fighting, and healing when you're low at health.\n\nThey reach a point where you can shut off your thoughts and just keep doing the same attacks, and they rely on the game world to constantly take you to different places against different enemies otherwise you'll be bored.\n\nCan this be more strategical? More fun?  Intense?\n\nReplacing the ""my turn, your turn"" might be a good first step."

4h1tz1,"Being a Bounty Hunter, in space.","I know it's a common idea, but I really haven't seen it done the way I'd like it. Imagine something along the lines of Cowboy Bebop and Star Wars.\n\n\n\n\nYou got your main base. Most likely a ship the size of The Bebop. You can chose from a catalog of ships to buy, but can only have one. It also needs to be mantained, making you have to go out and get/accept contracts. \n\n\n\n\nYou have your personal one seater spaceship. Fully customizeable from looks to loadout, to engine and more. This is used for defending your home ship, for travel on planets, ect. It also needs to be mantained.\n\n\n\n\nYou have your crew. A small one, but a crew. At first you'll start out alone. You can hire up to two wingman, and a navigator for your home ship. They'll be living with you on your ship. And they'll have needs. You'll need money to feed them, and repair their ships.\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, you can customize your armor. Or clothing.\n\n\n\n\nGameplay is a mix of a few things. The home ship is a mix of a hub. It's how you move from planet/galaxy and where you choose to accept bounties. Each time you visit a planet you have a chance to buy repairs and supplies. One thing that you'll have to do is defend your home ship from attacks. The more money you have, or the more bounties you cash in, the more likely chance you'll get attacked. The home ship might not have weapons, but you have to use your smaller one to defend it. Another is the actual bounties. What can happen is completely random. You might have to go on a planet/space station to hunt down someone. Most of these types would be on foot, and require loadouts specific to the needs. Maybe you'll need a jetpack? Grappling hook? Or just your trusty pistol? They might flee, causing you to change from on foot to hopping in your small ship. You might need backup. And most of the time, bounties will pay more for captures then deaths.\n\n\n\n\nCould even have an online aspect of a chance of running into other players. Something like Destiny does just so the world seems a bit more alive. I know something like this might never be done, but I know I'd play it."
4gymbx,"Cigarette Break Meter (game feature idea similar to hunger meter, ect..)","Though this isn't a full game idea, it's more of a small feature suggestion.\n\nI'd love to see a ""cigarette break"" meter implemented into some sort of survival game. You know, the meter level depletes after xx amount of time forcing you to stop for a bit to catch a quick smoke. You'd have to scavenge for singles, packs, and cartons of cigs just as you would for food and water lest your character suffer negative debuffs such as anger (increased shop prices, chance to miss reloads, etc..) or debuffs in accuracy, whatever. Which leads me to pros and cons..\n\nThere could be *constant* passive and/or active pro &amp; con traits specific to this particular class or build just for choosing the smoking 'biker badass' class. Okay, bad class name choice.\nAnyways, some examples of cons could maybe be debuffs like shortness of breath, lowering your sprint time a bit, or less overall health. In contrast, pros could maybe include heightened charisma effectively lowering shop prices, increased aptitude in base building(lol?), or perhaps apply some type of passive perk(s) such as increased accuracy using rifles.. \n\nI think it'd be a nice feature, though small in the grand scheme, but still entertaining none the less. And lets be honest, this would surely influence a few blog and forum post entries boasting titles labeled ""Finally you can (and must) smoke in a video game"" or ""Developers inevitably add cigarette break feature in the upcoming survival mmo, The Lost Wood -"" or whatever -insert catchy survival mmo title."

4ghu4s,"When you play the game again and use what you know from your first playthrough, you significantly impact the plot.","So here's my example to demonstrate how this would work.\n\nLet's say, early on in this hypothetical game, there's a safe. You and a friend have to get inside cause there's a clue or valuable item or some other macguffin. The first time you play through, you have to search the room and the belongings of the owner of the safe for the code. \n\nBut when you play a second time, you skip that whole process and just open the safe, probably unaware of the impact it will have. But your friend sees you just walk over to the safe and open and they're like ""WTF, how did you know the code?"" and your character in universe is just like ""IDK, I just knew..."" \n\nContinuing to do these sorts of actions changes the plot, while keeping the same overall goal, because somehow you now have some sort of ESP.\n\nNow, the player character doesn't instantly know EVERYTHING. They only realize things as they become important. Suppose Mark (eheheh) is a serial killer, which you learned later in the game on your first playthrough. On your second playthrough, you won't get much in the way of options related to it (maybe if you're a solid dick to him, it means you subconsciously know) until the murders are REALLY brought to your attention.\n\nThat's all I really have for an idea...no plot or nothing, just a weird mechanic. "
4gfok6,Republic City - an Avatar game,"Open World offline/online game (think GTA V)\n\nYou *DON'T* play as the Avatar, you're just a 'bender.\n\nDuring character creation, you pick a tribe and a pet based on your starting tribe. You have skill trees that let you customize how you want to play. Eventually you get an option to split off of the ""main"" bending to an alternate bending; earth to lava, metal or sand, fire to electricity or combustion, water to blood or healing.. Air bending is the only one that might be a bit limited since the only alternate is their spirituality, which I figure could work as a sort of catch-all; summon healing spirits to help keep your health up, or more aggresive spirits to help fight (since airbending is almost purely defensive)\n\nEach bending type has a movement style they can use; those little scooter-balls for airbenders, using fire from your hands/feet to fly/hover like Iron Man, surfing on a stone/earth-wave, using water-waves or making ice-slides similar to Iceman from Marvel.. Metalbending could have you swinging through the city like Spiderman or ""grind"" on power-cables.\n\nPro-bending could be a side-game that you can play online; make a team of three different-type benders to compete against other teams.\n\nFor combat, to keep things original and fluid, I'm thinking of a combat system similar to Remember Me, where you can build combos where you arange the skills you unlock in your trees, along with a ""stance-change"" button (I'm thinking holding a trigger on a joypad, with the option to just have it as a toggle instead of a hold-to-change).. You can use a stance-change to immediately stop a combo and start a new one. The catch is that the longer you preform one combo, the more damage you do, but switching stance mid-combo resets the damage increase. Not holding a trigger uses your ""neutral"" stance, and you can switch between Aggressive and Defensive stances; aggressive being more of a damage-focus stance and Defensive would be used to, say, make shields or reflect elemental attacks of your bending-type back towards their source or to a new target.\n\nThe game starts a few days after the final episode of Legend of Korra, and you're a newly awakened Bender that's come to Republic City to carve out a new life for yourself. The very start of the game would have you not at Republic City, but in your respective bending tribe; this would be the tutorial level that teaches you the basics of your bending; how to build combos, how the different skill trees play (dps/tank/heal/CC/etc)."
4gf5wz,Virtual Reality Yu-Gi-Oh.,"Hey there!\n\nNow, this is more of a dream than it is an expectation - as I understand that this would require a heck of a lot of work, as well as co-operation from Konami. \n\nBut the idea is is (at heart) the experience of the iconic battles from the TV Shows, live - where you are the one dueling. \n\nThis could be playable against others, maybe in the same room - both using to seperate headsets. You each have your own duel disk and decks (which could be customised on a web page before entering the game) and you can both see eachother, as well as the field.\n\nNow, I'm guessing that this would work somehow by putting the players in an alternate world, or an 'Arena' - and the camera simply shows the other players from across the room, or re-adjusting the size of the player based on your proximity and the size of the arena etc...\n\nThe field would be pretty standard, you could each have your own side - spell/trap zones, monster zones and then the graveyard etc... Filled with your monsters, and a 'hologram' or model of the monsters that you play would be visible on the field, by both players of course.\n\nIt would be even cooler if the player had to fully interact with his duel disk too - say he had to draw his cards, then place them into the field slots etc... Being able to flip into a 'Field view' to be able to view all of the cards on the field and then being able to read the effects etc... Which could be more of a tactical view - for those who need to learn some of the cards.\n\nI'm not going to put too much thought into it, because I know that it's unlikely to ever be made - but wouldn't it be so damn cool!\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nDo you reckon that this could be possible some time in the future? \n\nBecause, that - would be amazeballs."

But it couldn't be our main focus because in the meantime we had to work on different jobs in order to live. \n\nAnyway, with limited resource we somehow managed to release our game's skeleton. It's real time and fully multiplayer. Core gameplay was our first priority since i love duel Fps games. And instead of a game idea, i'll show you what we tried to do. For whose don't want to try it, i'll try to explain it below.\n\nIt is;\n\n- Multiplayer, free and competitive\n- Semi Turn based since we don't want anyone suffer lag, especially for people connecting from their mobile network.\n- Short and unique gameplay. Our aim was ~3 minutes for per game.\n- You can customize your stats. (Health Points, Damage, Critical Damage, Luck)\n- Everyone has one random ulti/perk which can be used once per match.\n- Some ultis/perks are passive like +3 Dmg, %100 Critical Chance etc.\n- Global ladder system\n- 2D graphics because we wanted our game accessible even for old phones.\n- Optimized so much that we could make it around 10mb.\n- We don't demand any permission access except internet connection.\n- No pay-to-win system\n\nWe got some good feedback but when you create something easy to consume, people get bored too soon sadly.\n\nI am not a developer and i'm still working to save up some money to improve this game but it's kinda hard nowadays because i'm the only one who design it and i work almost 12 hours/day. So any feedbacks and ideas are welcome, i just want to create the best duel game for everyone:)\n\nMy plan is to delete this game after it becomes more appealing for new generation and republish it with marketing budget this time.\n\nHere is the link if you want to try it yourself: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wiggle.atc\n\nThank your for your time and sorry for my bad English."

4g9qmu,"PATHS - The worlds FIRST Role-Playing, story driven superhero game!","So this idea has festered in my head and sprouted into something more than I can handle, so I am leaving it here in the hopes that it might inspire someone else. Trust me if I had the time, budget and experience to make this game, I totally would. \n\n#The Basics\nPATHS is a third-person open world RPG, which allows you to create your own superhero (or villian) and go throughout the streets of the fictional modern city of New Avalon, creating havok or saving the day. \n\n#The Core Plot pt1\nWaking up in an unknown facility strapped to a table, you are scared, alone and confused. After what seems like forever, a well dressed man approaches you. He tells you that you have been in a coma for 65 years after you were hit with a deadly poison called ""X-DWN"". He proceeds to tell you that over the years you have been studied, and that your body has been creating an unnatural reaction to the poison since it made contact with you. He tehn tells you that you are gifted. He hands you a mirror. This is where the character creator comes into play. \n\n#Character Creator \nThe character creator is jam packed with customizable options from body modification, tattoo's, hairs and beards, genital sizes, both male and female customization, eye color and more. \n\n#The Core Plot pt2\nAfter creating a character, you are taken into a room filled with test tubes. The man explains that lots of people appears to have developed the same type of symptoms as your own, only they have yet to awake. Suddenly the room goes on red alert, one of the subject is awake and attempting to escape. You are carted away by security, this is where you make your first step towards good or evil.\n\n#MECHANIC: Hero or Villain?\nOne of the core features of the game would be allowing players to choose who they want to be, freedom of the player would eb the number one goal, therefore there will be multiple times throughout the story where a player can choose what action to perform, to get a certain rating. For example, if there was a crime being committed and you killed the offender instead of detaining them and taking them to the nearest police station, you would gain a point towards the VILLAIN skills, and people will see you in a different light the more you perform certain actions.\n\n#The Powers\nIf you have ever played CHAMPIONS ONLINE (A superhero MMO) then the abilities system would work like that. You can choose your traversal mode around the city from Flight (like superman), Acrobatics (Akin to the guy from Prototype) or superspeed (the flash). Along with a plethora of primary and secondary powers. Player can choose one Primary and one secondary to begin with. The Primaries can include things such as the manipulation of the elements like Fire, water, earth and air and more. And secondaries would include such as mind reading (for use in persuasion checks), certain weapon expertise and more. Throughout the game players can upgrade their current powers or purchase new ones by either gaining SP (Savior points) or CP (Carnage Points) through doing good and bad actions respectively. Both superheroes and Villains get their own unique abilities depending what side you are on. \n\n#MECHANIC: Opinionated Public\ndepending on what actions you perform as a hero or villain, peoples opinions of you will change. Some will love you and scream your name when they see you, others will hate you maybe even withhold information from you if they do not like you.\n\n#MECHANIC: Alter-ego system\nWhether you are hero or villain, we all need to rest. One mechanic I call the Alter Ego system. Which allows you to change into ordinary clothing (which you can customize) when no pedestrains have you in their sights. Once changed you cannot use your abilities, but you can get information that your powered alter ego may not be able to get. For example if you are playing as a superhero and need to find out where a certain van full of kidnapped hostages is (if you don't have the SEEING EYE secondary power, allowing you to find them without the need to look), and the person that might have a tip won't talk to you because they dislike you then you can change into your ordinary clothing when nobody is looking and ask as yourself. Primary abilities will not work but any secondary ability like Mind reader still does. You can also walk the city streets and hear what people have to say about your alter ego.\n\n#MECHANIC: Quests\nMuch like the crime system in Spiderman 2, a crime may randomly pop up nearby which you can prevent (or alternatively some sort of event you can destroy as a villain). You will not be penalized for not carrying out these random actions. However quests can be given by people throughout the city, with rewards and such which if failed, can give you a bad reputation (or a good one)\n\nThis idea is so much more in depth and I needed to release a bit before I overload on the info. \n \n \n"
4g9ii2,Lord,"Imagine showing up from a long walk to a Medieval village. A castle looms high on the horizon.\n\n Your job. Work in the village and establish your reputation. Through pub fights, duels, games, and work ethic/errands. Raise an army of rebels. Look on toward the castle. \n\nSiege the castle, burning and pillaging. Capture the Lord. Become the new Lord. Gain reputation throughout the region through battles, favors, marriages, and policy. \n\nLook toward the horizon. See a city. In the city lives the King.\n\nI have played Mount &amp; Blade and the Total War games for years. I love the idea of starting from nothing and becoming everything. \n\nThis will be a 3rd person open world game for the best result.\nLarge scale battles would be similar to total war with a broad overall control of your army. Or taking part in the action yourself. Swordplay will be a huge part of your experience. Think Dark Souls style of combat, minus a few rolls and magic. \n\nPolitical action would be a huge part of the game, with many issues brought to you to manage, and spies and henchman taking care of dirty work. \n\nA court system to where you are the Lord/Judge and can either quick result the decision or manually sift through cases and decide the punishment. Public executions.\n\nI want the battles and blood. But I want Lordship control that goes beyond just a few subtitled cut scenes and really gives you a feel for being a Lord of a castle. Marriage ceremonies, births, and funerals would be part of your life. As is war. Can you build your castles defenses through recruitment and management? Or will you be crushed by the next rebel uprising? \n\nI cannot think of a better title as it encompasses everything I'm talking about. \n\nThanks for reading my idea."
4g8dg8,Ideas for VR game.,"Hey guys, I am thinking of making a co-op VR game about hunting monsters. I am wondering how the concept can be deconstructed or developed. What do you guys think? Thanks! "
4g7oq2,Great game idea,"Everyone knows the game agario, how bout a 3D version with changes like music and instead of split a dash or something like that, I think a 3D agario like game would be awesome!"
4g7mva,GamePLAY ideas for a whimsical RPG-esque project needed,"I'm an edutainment game developer for my City Hall for a living, but recently I've decided to use that to make something different. So I have this Legend of Zelda-esque idea (top-down dungeon crawler kinda thing) in which the main character, a young rabbit girl, attempts to restore the colors back to a world that has suddenly become black-and-white overnight. Of course the story is a bit deeper than that (just A BIT deeper), but I'm not going there right now for the sake of brevity.\n\nThe catches are:\n1: the dungeons, each representative of one of the seven colors of the spectrum (Yellow Desert, Green Grove, Purple Marsh, on and so on; all of these just working titles) will award the player not with a weapon, but with the color and all the power that it yields to the environment. So, for example, in a black-and-white world, magma is just a cold gray rock, but once red is activated, it becomes THE magma; seeds would fail to bloom if green is not active, because the soil is just a gray brick; rain would become a torrent of rocks if blue is inactive, and so on. Of course, having a color active or inactive changes the scenery, and allows for different puzzles whether you're crawling into the dungeon or out of it.\n\n2: As said in the title, the game is supposed to be whimsical (not necessarily childish, just playful). As such, apart from the main weapon of the controllable character (the ""Rainbow Rod""), other mundane stuff should be available for the character to use, like, say, pebbles or sticks. Think ""South Park: The Stick of Truth,"" where weapons read ""swords"" and ""staffs,"" but are actually plungers and branches.\n\nThe game also features somewhat of an influence meter, which dictates if a certain monster in the dungeon will be aggressive towards you, cautious, or if they'll run away (For example, if your first dungeon, after the player slays their first rat, the other rats may start thinking ""Well crap, there's someone here that's out to smack us silly"" and begin to flee on your presence. Eventually, there will be that valiant rat that will go after you anyway... and still perish with a single hit). Current collectibles I have implemented here are the common silver coins (local currency; and exactly because silver is a shade of gray, they become unmistakable whatever happens to the colors anyway) and the rarer Prism Shards (shiny rainbow gems that... I'm not yet sure what they could do, shame on me).\n\nNow here are the things I'm stuck with:\nA. I'm not entirely adverse to a leveling system in the game but, much like LoZ, I'd like to allow the player to improve the character's health and striking power (this last one optional) WITHOUT one. Metal Gear Solid-esque evolution (auto-improvement after a successful boss fight) is out of the conversation. How would that health work, for example? Hearts (like in LoZ)? Numeric/bar? And how to improve it? \nB. What kind of unique weapons should this character use?"

4g7akq,Ideas for a dispatch system similar to FFTA for a game with a huge cast.,"I loved suikoden's huge cast of 108 characters but it was annoying to be able to use so few of them in battle. I think FFTA's dispatch system can solve this somewhat.If you didn't play FFTA,Here's a rundown on how it works (sorry if it's too long):\n\nYou have a clan that can have upto 25 characters and you complete various missions.In a mission,you can field upto 6 or so characters.However, you can delegate some missions to one or a group of your characters.They have a random chance of completing it based on the skills they have.You're free to send anyone but you have a better chance of winning if you send a team fit for the job.For example,you can send a team of hunters for a monster hunting job and they will have a higher chance of success compared to random people.Each dispatch mission has a set limit for days and the team can will return when they finish the job.If they finish it early,They will return  faster.Upon successfully returning,the team will be awarded XP and loot.\n\nI think this is a great system and I would like to implement it in a suikoden-like game if I ever get down to it.Do you have any Ideas to improve it?Please share them."
4g7a2g,Why hasn't anyone tried to re-create Ghost Master yet?,"If you've never played ""Ghost Master"", you can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Master), or you can get it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/6200/) or [GoG](https://www.gog.com/game/ghost_master).\n\nThe fact that a game initially released 13 years ago is still available on a very popular gaming platform should speak for its replay value and general quality.\n\nThe game itself, the concept itself, is truly solid: it's basically Ghosbusters inverted. Because the developer was dismantled shortly after production, no sequel was ever produced. The original game ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nI have seen many different sequel attempts, all of which were produced by people with little to no programming ability, the worst of which were just cobbled-together bits of the original game with minor graphical changes. No sequels or remakes have ever been completed to my knowledge.\n\nThere is still a [somewhat active fan community](http://ghostmaster.proboards.com/#category-2) // [Steam community board](http://steamcommunity.com/app/6200/discussions/), including people who have created mods to correct programming glitches inside the game. Many players wanted the ability to use ghosts acquired from later levels when replaying early levels. Many more wanted a cleaner, easier save mechanism inside the game. Others found ways to use trainers to make levels run smoother -- the game does not hold your hand in solving puzzles, and sometimes the wait for mortals to notice ghosts and perform necessary actions to move the level ahead could take upwards of ten minutes.\n\nThe long and short of it is this: Why has no one attempted a solid remake of this game? There is nothing like it on the market today. It still has fans and players, despite its age and obvious issues. The concept is malleable, adaptable, and expandable. The entire game rests on timers, incremental and exponential growth, and cycling animations. \n\nIt could be an amazing Android game if the timing issues and save mechanism were corrected. It would be excellent on Steam with workshop capabilities, allowing players to create custom maps, custom mortals, and custom ghosts. The concept could even be ported to a fun and fast-paced tabletop game (similar to [Zombies!!!](http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/en/boardgames/zombies.html) ) with a lot of timers and a little tweaking. \n\nSo.. why hasn't it been done? Do you have ideas for it? How hard would it be? And why have none of the proposed sequels or remakes survived?"
4g6n44,A moba idea.,"Hello all!\nI've been thinking of this idea for years, but never actually talked about it. so here we go!\n\nTake league of legends, for example (even thou I've always wanted to mod Dawngate :/    )\n\n\nYou have champions with abilities, and each ability cost mana/energy or long cds. You only have 1 good map, you can only have fun in 5v5, and games are very long. \n\n\n #I would like to make a moba you just have  abilites (no mana/energy cost) with low cd. \n\n #fast paced. very.\n\n #low death timers. or a specific number of lifes. (this means no need to do objectives)\n\n #no items. (that's a problem for newcomers. getting to know the up and downs of items, whats best where, builds, etc. is not very fun)\n\n #map system like HoS (they got like 5 or so)\n\n #a 1v1 style like magicka wizard wars (hell fun )\n\n #give characters way to be invulnerable for ~0.5 seconds or so. (now this, as simple as it sounds, makes the game very competitive and fun. it is like in smash bros when you press shield + Down, character goes invulnerable to dmg for less than a second. this will make everyone that is good at mind games really good here. and it also gives room to a fast paced game where a lot of skillshots are coming and you need to have some defensive abilities. sure we can balance this ability by giving it some decent CD \nit goes on.\n\n  The thing is, that these mobas nowadays, want to keep you there for ever. if there would be this ultra fun moba where you just battle for fun, with a lot of movement and plays, that would be a great thing. but I cant do much with my knowledge of unity3d. one alone cannot make a game really. i have like so many ideas to make a super fast paced (ssbm inspired) moba. a moba where you need lilttle\n\nEDIT 1 : think of a moba where it is mainly for 2v2 or 1v1. where you have infinite mana, high skill cap and a lot of skillshots, flashes, evades, cc, etc. all that just ready there, no need to wait to ""late/mid game"". its like a WoW arena 2v2 for example, where you just jump into the battlefield with everything set there, (no need to farm anything) and just show what you got. \ncan you say LoL + HoTS + Magicka wizard wars? lol"

Jackson, Ben Affleck, Tom Hanks, Tom Hardy, and the hero of the game, Leonardo Dicaprio!\n\nEach of them would have their own special ""Movie Moves"" finishing moves:\nJack Black: ""Tenacious Skadoosh"" \n(Wicked guitar riff that ends with  grabbing the enemies finger like Kung Fu Panda and that move. \nScarlett Johansson: ""Widow Snake"" \n(A series of attacks as she is the snake from the Jungle Book, ending with her turning into Black Widow and doing her thing.)\nJim Carrey: ""Mask Ventura: When Bruce Calls"" \n(First, His face turns green and his eyes and tongue pop out and hit the enemy. Then, his thighs open up like hangar doors, and two massive arrow sentry guns unload on the enemy, all while he does that thing that he did in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. And then, as a final move, Morgan Freeman comes down form the sky as God and pitch-slaps the enemy.)\nRobert Downey Jr.: ""Iron Money."" or ""My Unit"" (He blasts the enemy with rays of money with his Iron Man gauntlets he snuck off of the set of Iron Man) or (As his skin darkens and his clothes turn military, he smacks the enemy, pimp-style, sticks a heavy machine gun in his enemy's mouth and says 'You can suck my unit!' Just before he blows the enemy's head off.\nSamuel L. Jackson: ""Pulp Fury"" \n(After ordering the Avengers to beat up the enemy, he whips off his jacket, to which would reveal him as Jules Winnfield and his crazy eyes and point to the camera, the player, which he would say 'Does he look like a b*tch' before opening fire on the enemy.)\nBen Affleck: ""Do you Dare?""\n(While fighting as Daredevil before epically failing to hit the enemy and falling on his face, he quickly gets back up as Batman and saying 'do you bleed?', effectively beating the crap out of the enemy in a major way. After that, he says 'you are' and walks away totally cool-like.)\nTom Hanks: ""Gump Away.""\n(A speedster dressed as Forrest Gump, dashing by and punching the character many times, and then finally appearing, dirty, in ratted shorts, and throwing Wilson at the enemy and knocking them out, and then saying, 'I'M SORRY WILSON!! I'M SORRY!!""\nTom Hardy: ""Mad Bane"" \n(*This is basically the Dark Ryu to the Ryu of the game.*\nHe takes the enemy, body slams him, and then morphs into Mad Max, and the tanker from MM: FR runs over the enemy, and says with the Bane mask, 'Now, you have my permission to die'. \nLeonardo Dicaprio: ""Wolf Revenant.""\n(After raining razor-sharp money onto the enemy, he dresses as Hugh Glass and sics the bear, whom his son was reincarnated into, on the enemy, ripping them to shreds.)\nCertain enemies are also celebrities, such as Mel Gibson, James Franco, Kanye West, Channing Tatum, and Miley Cyrus. \nThe last boss of the game would be the mighty Brangelina: The two-headed boss with an endless set of abilities that equate to all of their moves.\n"

4g4uey,Horror game that has not yet been explored?,"Okay so, im not a game developer. Just a lover of games. But I came up with a vague idea that, I think is yet to be explored.\nSo think - psychological horror, similiar to Until Dawn. In which the game begins by breaking down the fourth wall. Making it clear that this is a game, and that you are simply here to observe. \nThe protagonist - for whatever reason the game devs feel is best suited, will enter a very scary world. In which you are told that the creatures and environment will not respondto you, they cannot see you, or interact with you. \nOver time the player will be in an simultaneous state of fear, due to viewing horrific things throughout the game, whilst also lulling them into a sense of security, knowing nothing will be interacting with them.\nThis is when - over time and slowly - the game starts to notice you. Maybe some deranged characters start to give you brief eye contact? For whatever reason (game devs ultimately decide) the game starts to turn on you.\n\nI think this would be brilliant, especially with VR becoming more and more prominant these days. The game allows for the most amount of realism in that the game knows you are playing a game, and its still trying to mess with you. What do you think? Has it been done? Would it work? And if someone wants to take the idea and run with it, please keep me updated!"
4g4d4x,The next big MMORPG ... naa... just my Random Idea,"I KNOW MY IDEA WILL BE SO BIG.. NOT FOR INDIE.. but I would love to share it.. \nBefore I discuss my idea, I would like to ask a question. If you play a MMORPG what you usually look for to enjoy that game? .. Storyline?.. skills?...Graphics?.. Classes?.. characters?.. boobs and ass?.. .  MMORPG these days are just similar. that's why people look for another mmorpg or any game hoping they would find the game they would love to stay..  My answer to my own question is just simple.. I'm looking for a real RPG.. a character that can represent myself and be unique as the others.. and if possible. our skills will be different.. just like SAO (anime) where your skills are determined on how you play the game.. so this is my Idea..\n\n\n\nTitle: **Hero Academy**\n\nSample Classes (I still have many more classes in mind xD)\n\n**Elementalist** - primary job where you can control  elementals/nature\n\n*Pyra - under Elementalist class, controls fire  (at certain level you can change job as Pyromancer or Fire warrior) Pyromancer more on long range attacks, fire nukes to be exact... Fire warrior, can equip any weapon of your choice and throws fire.. imagine kung fu + fire.. or swordsman + fire .. \n\n*Aqua - under Elementalist class, controls water (Baptist / Ice bender) Baptist more on support and buffs.. like heals. etc.. Ice bender .. more on ice skills.. \n\n*Mason - under elementalist class, controls rock or land (Earth shaker / Terrakin) Earth shaker is more on AOE or crowd control. with stuns and buffs.. Terrakin is more on DPS and more on single target\n\n*Zephyr - under elementalist class, controls Air ( Enlil / Aerokin) Enlil more on AOE DPS... Aerokin.. is like an assasin. single target dps.. \n\n*Avatar - last class under elementalist class, controls fire, earth , water, air.. (fire + Earth = **Magmatic** fire + air **firestorm.. and so on..)\n\n\n\nSetting: A Big city.. like GTA?  where you can see cars moving.. people walking. .. not really heavy graphics.. average graphics would be fine as long it has ragdoll graphics.. \n\n\n\nControls: WASD and Point and click\n\n\n\nStoryline: You are a 1st year student in Hero academy (ofcourse you create your character.. and choose 1 of the primary jobs) .. where you need to graduate  from it and start your hero career..  As a 1st year student you need to attend classes... like. you need to attend 5 classes and 1 major project to become a 2nd yr student.. Classes is where you enter a classroom and you will play a minigame.. of course you will be graded.. if you fail.. you need to attend that class again.. Major projects is like an event in the city.. where you need to save or battle hostile targets.... for example.. a red exclamation point in the map will appear.. and if you go there.. you will see what you need to do.. for instance.. you need to kill the bank robbers.... Classes are only available from 7am to 3pm.. and you can only take 2 classes per day.. \n(the game itself has a game time.. 24 hours in the game is equal to 4 hours in real life.. so 1 hour in the game is 10 mins in real life.. so from 7 am to 3pm = 1 hr and 20 mins in real life..)\n\n\n\nNow once you graduate.. you will start your hero career.. you will begin in Rank F... upto Rank A.. and then Rank S... certain requirements are needed for you to Rank up..  Ranks and levels are independent.. lets say.. as level 10. you have done the requirements needed to be Rank S... yes you can be a Rank S.. but its not that easy... what I'm trying to say.. you can be any level to get Rank S .. \n\n\n\n\nNow for the skills.. at level 1 to 10 you will be given basic skills from your primary job..  remember about the classes and grades?. A certain grade is equivalent to a skill.. for EXAMPLE you get 85. and 85 is Fire blast. 86 is Fire tornado.. 87 is another skill.. 88 is fire blast again .. but higher the grades are better.. you just need luck.. Players Luck is also part of the skill.. lol.. but.. it will not be given directly.. Lets say level 10.. you clear 1st year level.. now you are 2nd year.. those skills will be unlocked.. now when you level up.. level 11.. you will be given the skill that you have unlocked.. then level 13.. lvl 16.. and so on.. remember you 5 classes.. so expect new 5 skills.. from 10 to 20... Oh, levels and year levels are also independent... doesnt care if you are level 100 and you are still at 1st yr.. but  you wont get ur skills.. \n\n\n\n2nd job change will be available.. in your 3rd year.. and final job change at 4th yr level.. Quest from NPC's are also available :)\n\n\n\nI'd like to write more.. but that would be enough. :D  I'd like to hear some feedbacks.. Is my dream game even possible? .. lol.. \n\n\n\nPS: dont know about designing or creating games... this is just Purely my Idea.. I would love to grow as a Game Designer though. :).\n "

4fzb43,i have an idea for a racing/fighting game.,"The game would be a racing sim where every car has 2 people in them. One driver and one passenger. You can get out of the cars and get onto the roof while racing. While outside the car you can use jumpjets, grappling hooks and retratacle skates to move from car to car.The fighting aspect comes in when 2 people are on top of the same car or on top of 2 close cars. It would be like mma style fighting, i say mma so you think realistic not mortal kombat.I just think its a stage for so many cool scenarios.I always love game with no respawning so that could be an element of it to add more suspense and gravity.tell me what you think :D"

4fp6gt,Groundhog Day-esque game.,"Don't know if this has been suggested before, but I think it'd be pretty cool to play a game where everything resets after one day or after you die due to whatever reason. It should take place in a small town and every citizen should have their own schedule. You can interact with different citizens and have your day turn out slightly or radically different every time. I'm not sure if it should have an ending or not. Not having an ending sounds kind of depressing. Having an ending would probably mean that there needs to be some sort of main focus like perhaps managing to get a good reaction from every citizen in one day or something."

4fl7a4,Fantasy RPG Merchant,"I'm sure this idea has been expressed many times before, but I would play the hell out of a business sim where you just sell gear and supplies to adventurers in a generic fantasy world.\n\n1. The best part about the game (and the hardest part for the developer) would be the **items**, of course. Thousands of weapons, armors, shields, scrolls, potions, accessories, mounts and pets, foods and drinks, and the list goes on. Each item would have a simple illustration and a small nugget of backstory.\n\n2. The object of the game is to **make money**. Buy low and sell high. Adventurers will always be coming in to sell their loot so that they can buy better stuff.\n\n3. **All kinds** of adventurers visit your shop: warriors, rogues, wizards, druids, clerics, sorcerers, bards and more. Choose to cater to only one type of adventurer in order to corner a specific niche market and maximize your profits - like a potion shop for wizards or a smithy for warriors. Or choose to be more of a general shoppe that carries all manner of items.\n\n4. Grow your business until you are super rich. Get married, have children, and pass away. After you're gone, you can choose to **play as your kid**, who takes over the family business.\n\n5. Want to mount a legendary artifact on your shop walls to attract more customers? Or perhaps you need that ancient lich staff for a very specific, wealthy and powerful client. Just use your **quest board** to create quests for adventurers to go on. They bring you what you asked for and you pay them in gold.\n\nThis would be an ambitious project, but it doesn't sound terribly difficult. The graphics could be simple and it would still be a great game, I think."
4fkm6h,Help fleshing out an idea I had.,"Recently, I thought of a simple game based on the ability to create a whole farm or zoo filled with mythical animals instead of normal boring animals. So far, I know I want it to go into trade, breeding, contests, things like that. I also feel like certain creatures should give the player certain abilities and modifiers. For example, a creature maybe based around the idea of luck would, you know, give players better chances. The parts i'm having trouble with is: A) How will the player obtain creatures, will it be through catching them or buying them. B) If it would be catching, how would that work? I've seen good examples from games like Disco Zoo (if you never heard of this one, I highly recommenced it), but I don't want to directly copy those mechanics. C) I feel there should be more than just creature care, something like crafting or crop farming. But i'm not sure if it will take away from the overall main course of the game.\nD) Mechanics like these usually bring a lot of waiting, what can i add in that will give players something to do when waiting. Anyway, thanks and all feedback is appreciated. "
4c34c4,A MMO game about ancestry research,"A player can create a new character at any time. The server will randomly create that characters all ancestors for about 12 generations back in time, including all their cousins and previous spouses, birth and death dates and cities, countries and movement across the globe and store all data serverside hidden from the player. The server can choose from already created data (many player characters share some ancestors just like in real life) or it can create more data if neccessary.\n\nGameplay:\nGoal is to complete your tree for all 12 generations. You need to collect all names, dates and birthplaces and so on.\n\nThe game is about collaborating with others, doing research: scanning fictional census records, church records, immigration records, military records, travel records, votelists, old phonebooks and estate records etc.\n\nYou can look at other players trees to find out clues. You can consult DNA matching services to figure out about how much related your character is to other players characters (Autosomal, Y-DNA, MtDNA) and search for shared ancestors.\n\nThe ancestry research field is extremly wide and only the imagination sets the limit for such a game. Perhaps you can buy a flight to a distant country to visit a graveyard to inventory the information on the stones, or information available only in that particular church.\n\nThe more distant ancestors should be more difficult to find out information about. Records could be incomplete or more difficult to find. And since the amount of ancestors also doubles (not taking pedigree collapses into account) for every generation it will naturally increase difficulty for every generation. \n\nIt could also not be a set 12 generation limit. Every completed generation could equal a level up. So a level-6 ancestry researcher is one who have 6 generations complete, including all information about all ancestors for 6 generations back in time.\n \nFinding out relationships between player characters should be beneficial, it will boost abilities when researching together. A found relationship through a more distant common ancestor is worth more than a close cousin relationship.\n\nI have never seen a game about ancestry research, it could be fun :) add some action to it: you need to steal info from others and you need to protect some of your own info or something, add some competitive criteria to the game mechanic."
4c2vg2,semper fidelis,"the game is set in 1943-1945,play as Alan Preston a WW2 soldier.in this game you start off as a private then you earn you're way up in the ranks.the higher the rank the more you can do(command troop,call in backup,mortar strikes). the story gameplay time is at average 15 hours,then you have online multiplayer,co-op campaign,co-op faceoff and more.from taking out Nazi supplies to storming the beach at Normandy.you can add attachments to your weapons such as: extended mags,stock,grip,scope,silensor and more. you can fully customize your chacter:hair color,eye color,skin color,body build,height,jaw lines,all facial structures.you can find and put colors on your guns as well.MULTIPLAYER:there are 50 levels and then 5 prestieges.you can fully customize your soldier just as in campaing.you unlock colors for your guns and outfits for your soldier in care packages.you can also choose your dog tags to wear.you can create an emblem or use a regular standard one.you can also choose your branch of military,each one has its own abilities . if it is released it should be on xbox one,PS4,nad PC."
4c2vdd,Ring of assassins - multiplayer FPS/RTS,"I had an idea for a strategic FPS. 16 players, think Team Fortress 2 style. No teams, 16 standalone players. At start you are assigned one target, everyone else is too. So every player is a target for another assassin and everyone has a target that they need to kill to score up. Game idea is inspired by the game: ""The Ship"", but it should be more concentrated and fast action. No NPC's.\n \nCaveat:\nYou are discouraged to kill your target if someone else (another player) is a witness. If you decide to do it anyway, you need to kill all witnesses in the next seconds before they (automatically) call the police and report your crime. If you are reported, then you are jailed until next play round.\n  \nThat means that everyone wants to end up alone with their target but at the same time everyone wants to be among several other players to be somewhat protected from assassination. It should be beneficial to move around in groups, like spontanously created teams.\n  \nYou never know who among the other players that have you as their target.\n \nYou also score up if you witness and report an assassination. When you are done; you have assassinated your target, then you are patrolling the map and tries to witness (at a safe distance) other assassinations while watching your own back.\n\nThere is a specialcase: if you witness an assassination and the assisn happens to be your target, then you gain triple score up if you manage to report and jail your target.\n \nIf you try to kill anyone else but your target then you hesitate so much that the other player gain increased chance to kill you instead in self defence. Killing an attacker in self defence is a score up while killing some random player (not your target) only gives you their weapons and other loot. Killing other players is rarely beneficial.\n \nThe game should have lots of mechanics that helps you in your goal to end up alone with your target. I dont have any details for that figured out. Traps perhaps? Like Spy vs. Spy kind of thing. Etc.\n \nThe game end when less than 4 target/assassin-couples are left or the timer has elapsed. It should be a top 10-15 minute play every round.\n \nIf you find the idea cool, go for it and I will be the first to buy the game! :) I am a programmer myself but multiplayer 3D is way beyond my level."
4c201b,Simple puzzle platformer. Need one unique feature,"I plan to code my first game ever. It will be a simple platform Android phone game.\n \nThink of it as Super Mario Bros 1 without any hostile NPC's. There should be NPC's but all they do is blocking the players path in one way or another.\n \nThe gameplay should be very straight forward, simplistic, one level at a time with a set goal; a position with a door out. No bosses. \n \nThe levels can have some casual platform features like buttons to open doors; triggers to move and rotate platforms and other ways to alter the environment. Not to many mechanics. The game should be more focused on puzzle solving than on player control skills.\n \nYour character should be static, in features speaking. No mushrooms to grow taller, run faster or anything like that. There should be only one character to choose. Single player game.\n \nSo, why do I need your help?\nI need one unique feature. A feature not seen before in a platformer, and even better if it has not been seen in any game at all before. Something that defines my game from the load of available platform games.\n \nThe feature should for example NOT be anything Braid: time altering, NPC's and platforms moving according to yourself etc.\n \nNot Echochrome or Monument Valley: rotation changing the orientation with impossible angles and illusion perspectives. The ideas of M. C. Escher could be cool to implement in a platformer, but I doubt something unique is available.\n \nNot like Fez or Super Paper Mario: the orientation is a headache when mixing 2D platformer with a 3D world. I need my game to be easy to orient oneself around. You should always have full control of where you are and all possible paths.\n \nNot anything like the features in The misadventures of pb winterbottom: No clones or other ways to control other things by telekinesis.\n\nNot features found in The Witness, where you do things according to a panel or search for irregularities when comparing the world with a ""panel"" or other blueprint.\n\nNo gravity altering or ""switch place with your own shadow""-mechanic unless an unique implementation of it. \n\nI am not against unrealistic stuff, platform games is kind of unrealistic by nature, so even if my mandatory criteria tend to trash next to every cool idea possible it is because it has already been done, not because it is science fiction. I actually love unnatural and unrealistic things, so be my guest and figure out one spaced out feature/mechanic that I can use! After all it's a game, and not a movie, I will create.\n \nPlease help me find that one missing feature/mechanic making my game simple, perfect and unique. Thanks!"
4c1h7h,Affinity: a text-based mutiplayer espionage game,"This is my idea for a text-based multiplayer RPG that focuses on espionage in a contemporary setting. The interface I'm imagining is similar to a MUD, but there is no reason these or similar rules couldn't be applied to any format.\n\nI'm wondering if the gameplay seems appealing and if it sounds like some of the rules I've devised might be ale to accomplish the goals I set out. Also, I realize the breadth of gameplay is very ambitious, but I think this can be reined in and revealed in a modular way via the choice-inhibiting nature of a text-based game. If the choices are diverse and logically rewarding, I hope the constraints are acceptable to players, and the constraints will gradually loosen as they progress. Thanks in advance for your thoughts.\n____________\n**|| GOALS ||**\n___________\n\nThe main idea is to make social interaction and conversation as tactical and fun as combat is in most RPGs. The hook of the game is ambiguity between PCs and NPCs, which is enforced in a few different ways:\n\n-PC action is limited by the text format\n\n-PC-PC interaction is limited early in the game\n\n-chat is restricted to longtime PC allies, and all other characters interact by way of selectable dialogue stubs\n\n-NPC-like behavior is rewarded, aberrant behavior is punished\n\nSecondary goals are: \n\n-diverse play styles for both casual and serious players\n\n-compelling narrative developments, for individual characters and whole communities\n\n____________\n**|| GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW ||**\n___________\n\nGameplay proceeds as players apply verbs to their environment and situation.\n\nSome verbs are available to everyone in most situations. These include verbs like check, by which you can check your pockets and other containers you're carrying (your inventory), go to, talk to, look at, watch, pick up, and use. Although these actions are usually available to everyone, your traits may determine your effectiveness at them - for instance, while watching the street out of a window, a character with high environmental observation will notice more details, and a character with high discipline will progress with training and study more quickly.\n\nOther verbs are available only after specific training, study, or experience. Some verbs require specific materials, or another person, sometimes with a particular skill.\n\nAs more verbs become available, new gameplay possibilities open up.\n\nA key part of gameplay in addition to gaining the ability to use new verbs is making new contacts and relationships. These can be NPCs or other PCs. Ultimately, deeper interaction is possible with PCs than with NPCs, and you only discover which another character is by working with them for a long time.\n\nMuch of the gameplay takes place at events or during missions where many PCs and NPCs have overlapping, interacting, and contradictory goals. Players can also fulfill many traditional NPC roles themselves by becoming recruiters, mission designers/givers, merchants, and trainers.\n\nConflict is resolved through simple comparison of the relevant skills, environmental and situational factors. For instance, if one PC were to attempt to pickpocket another, one character's fine motor level would be matched up against the other's caution level, minus the effects of the targets' drunkenness.\n___________\n**|| CHARACTER TRAITS ||**\n____________\n\nEffectiveness at using verbs is governed by the level of various traits, which may range from 0-10. Traits are divided into EXTROVERTED, INTROVERTED, PERCEPTIVE and PHYSICAL trait sets. The trait sets, traits, and some of the skills (which may also be thought of as verbs) they govern:\n\n**EXTROVERTED**\n\n*deception* - lie, feign, bluff, deny, impersonate, apply disguise, hide object/self, stage accident\n\n*intimidation* - threaten, interrogate, extort, scare, discourage, impress\n\n*charisma* - persuade, ingratiate, reassure, seduce, woo, bribe, draw attention, approach, address\n\n**INTROVERTED**\n\n*discipline* - training, study, focus, thrift, asceticism, resistance to seduce/draw attention/bribe\n\n*grit* - adrenaline rush, resistance to pain/intoxication/withdrawal/exhaustion/hunger/thirst/torture/brainwash/mind control\n\n*caution* - security, inconspicuousness, tail, vanish, blend in, sneak, remove trace, hide tracks\n\n**PERCEPTIVE**\n\n*people sense* - detect lie/feigning/impersonation/disguise, read lips, eavesdrop, judge\n\n*environmental observation* - fire from cover, find cover/escape/alternative route, detect clue/concealment/improvised weapon, spot tail/sniper/target, orienteering, arson, observe, surveil, judge distance\n\n*intuition* - psy, guess, hunch, insight, bond\n\n**PHYSICAL**\n\n*fine motor* - manufacture weapon/disguise/concealment, repair, forge, sabotage, fire from range, apply medicine, perform surgery, pick lock, crack safe, pickpocket\n\n*agility(/cardio endurance)* - blade, sprint, leap, scale, fall, dodge, fire close, unarmed, acrobatics\n\n*strength(/durability)* - unarmed, blunt, carry, resistance to injury/heat/cold\n\nPlayers start out with 18 points which, aside from favored trait sets and favored traits, are mostly randomly assigned. Players may gain up to a total of 40 points. Trait points are gained through training or study or by practicing your skills in key situations.\n\n___________\n\nThanks for reading!

4bwff0,Pocket Fisher!,"Recently I attempted to make my first mobile game, but didn't like the idea personally, so I was hoping one of you people out there could make use it.\n\n\nPocket Fisher would be a casual mobile game, where you run a small fishing boat that you would then upgrade and improve as the game goes on, and you play it more, the currency would be fish which you can use for the upgrades as a type of currency. \n\nThe main gameplay would be similar to Candy Crush or Bejewelled, but instead trying to match three objects you would have to line up as many as possible in one vertical column and then swipe down to ""cache in"", the more of a certain type of fish in that row the more points you could get and with this create combos. Each horizontal swipe of a row would cost a move, and when you run out of moves the match ends with the fish you caught, you could then upgrade your little fishing crew, the upgrades would have different effects on the matches, such as upgrading your engine may give you more moves, or upgrading your bait would unlock more fish types to catch, and thus making the player want to play more.\n\nIf you wanted, you could implement in app purchases, with there being different looking ships you could buy and use instead, which would be only different in appearance.\n\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit, so please tell me if I've done anything wrong I'd be happy to try to fix it, and feel free to use this idea in anyway you would like!"

4btpd0,A new under used building game idea.,"Hello, I'm new to this subreddit but i have a game idea that I've wanted to see made for a long time... I am inexperienced in game making so i don't want to attempt making my idea.\n\nIf you have ever played ""Black and White 2"" then this idea will seem familiar to you.\n\nMy idea is in one way a rewrite of B&amp;W2 but with many more aspects. Although B&amp;W2 had a building aspect, it was more focused on the war aspect on most of the island's/levels, i want a game similar to that but more focused on the building aspect where you are a god and you can collect resources in a specific region, build houses and shops, and to be able to go though many era's starting off with the stone age. \n\nThe basics that i'm thinking of with the era changing is as follows:\n\n 1. Start off in the stone age and gradually become futuristic\n\n 2. ever era is about 1-2 week(s) in real life time\n\n 3. as eras change so does the landscape, for example... If the terrain was really hilly/mountainous in the stone age then the next era it is a little more  flat and easier to build the next tier buildings. also in the modern era you can use man made objects like shovels or (if advanced enough) bulldozers.\n\n 4. once you reach the max era (whatever that may be) a comet or some other natural disaster causer has a  chance to reset your whole world back to the stone age. (Obviously people don't want that after getting there so you should be able to have ways to stop these disasters but they require a lot of materials real-life time and a long line of research like in Civilization)\n\nFor the god idea:\n\n 1. When you start off in the stone area you are limited to a small area of land and can only really control that area\n\n 2. as the eras go on and the more buildings you have you can eventually build anywhere in the world\n\n\nThis is the basics of what i want for this game. I hope you guys will like this idea and i also hope that someone makes this a reality."
4btl5n,Where has there never been a good pirate game?,"Never been to this sub before, but I've been wondering why this game doesn't exist.  If it already does, hooray!\n\nI wanna see a gritty, realistic Pirate Sim.  You start with just you, a couple guys, and a crappy ship.  Gotta hire crew (with stats), promote to ship positions based on ability and skills.  Raid coastal towns for loot, kill and pillage to increase your Menace rating (victims surrender easier, tell you secrets, higher ransoms).  Take hostages and ransom them.  Improve cannons, pistols and swords, sails, rations for crew.  Keel-haul disobedient crew members to enforce discipline.  Really micro-manageable, all crew members have names and traits.  Diseases happen, people can die.  Betrayal always possible, gotta be brutal to keep your sailors from stealing from you.\n\nEvery pirate game I've seen has been based on the historic Caribbean, but let's avoid that.  I like procedurally generated maps better, no two worlds the same.  Fog of war, you have to discover the map piece-by-piece.  You know the general locations of the major cities, but not what the coast looks like.  Put it together piece by piece from exploration, pillaging, and new hired crew.  \n\nAny ship you capture, you can use (but you have to fix it up).  Give command of a captured ship to a worthy crewman, become an admiral.  Build a pirate fortress to store your loot and extra ships.  Battle other pirate clans.  Eventually epic fleet vs fleet battles, as navies come after you.\n\nI (personally) prefer permanent death when things go wrong.  Too much quicksaving and loading makes games like this too easy, so no saves.  Your first mate dies of scurvy? Tough luck, a pirate's life is short.  So maybe we follow the model set by Faster than Light, which might be a good parallel?\n\nEnd game is tricky.  Capture a city or two (like the Vikings capturing Dublin!), control a vast armada.  Maybe you fight the combined armies of the remaining governments, winner-take-all?   \n\nAny feedback would be neat, if anyone wants to take this and run with it, go ahead!  I'm just excited to play it :)"
4bsxlg,Music based bullet hell,"Imagine a mix of Audiosurf and a generic bullet hell game. It would be boss-fight only, and each boss had its own ""Theme music"", but every attack/movement he makes will be timed and/or done at specific points in the song. Its kind of hard to explain, but I'm trying. It would be 2D and your main goal would be to survive the whole Fight (song). Each boss is different and has different attacks based on its Theme Music. You would not be able to just put in any song and make a boss automatically, but modding and user-created bosses would be encouraged. Most of the campaign music would be EDM/Dubstep, but any kind of music would work.

As a rebellious hipster teen, it is up to you to go up a massive skyscraper to save your parents, and every other adult in the world.\n\n\nAlthough it sounds almost ironic, you must scale the tower, shooting the brain washed-adults in mass numbers to get higher. (Maybe I should change the theme :/) \nTo change up gameplay, a variety of guns could be used, a machine gun could take out a lot of enemies in a short period of time, but would have to take a few seconds to reload after a while, leaving you slightly vulnerable.\nA shotgun would have a slower fire rate, but les reload time. Etc...\n\n\nA level would consist of several vertical platforms, enemies will appear on the edges of the screen and can move horizontally across the platform, of vertically between platforms. The player must dodge and take out a certain amount of enemies to ascend to the next floor. To spice it up, there will be different kinds of enemies, such as ones that can dash, or maybe armoured.\n\n\n\nAs always I am open and asking for new ideas or ways to improve. Please do not think I am a psychopath because of the theme, instead of thinking of them as people, treat them as zombies as they would be totally brain-washed and mindless. Thanks guys."
4bq1aq,A game based with puzzles and a storyline with a bit scares here and there,"Note this is my first time posting on reddit.\n\nThe game will be story-driven.\n\nThe idea begins as the player will need to complete puzzles with objects and different NPCs. The game will have random events when the player is walking around the environment or when they are doing a puzzle to hinder them.\n\nThe genre would kinda be like a firstperson view, a strong environment that makes the player feel like their in the game themselves(something similar to Amnesia), the game world is big but limited to how far the player progressed the game, a few scares will happen throughout the game mostly when the player completes a puzzle, also nothing futuristic in here.\n\nThe theme is that you take the role of a young female protagonist who is able to contact with the dead(later in the game) in a world with the aftermath of a huge epidemic that killed half of the Earth's population(animals included). You are searching for the man who had taken care of her for a long period of time that went missing after a few days. On your search of the man you discovered a cult that was responsible for the creation of the epidemic.\n\nThe gameplay will be simple you just need to complete puzzles, avoid being in the dark fog(a little something that appears every few times in the game randomly) staying in the fog doesn't do anything bad(just some hallucinations) to you until the third time you enter it will send to you into a place where you need to escape otherwise gameover, you will have a small relic(from the beginning of the game) which allows you to see things that are hidden from the human eyes(also gives hints on what objects to use in a puzzle).\n\nThe movement control will just be the simple fps type of controls on the PC."
4bpa4z,I'd like some simple ideas for a local multiplayer party game,[deleted]
4bndor,Platformer where you as the player in the game have to build the world/the game.,"So this idea is only the very beginnings of anything, and it's essentially all said in the title.\n \nYou play as a guy who wakes up one day to find his world is broken. The way I'm picturing it is that there are some basic colored blocks you can walk on and whatnot but the background is just plain white, there are alot of blocks and items that look like they were drawn with a pencil sloppily, almost as if they were ripped right from a game design doc. I'm trying to think of a way for the game to be based around the character needing to rebuild this broken half-game and make it complete.\n\nOne of the ideas I had for this was that maybe you go through a few levels with hardly anything in them, until you find a little item you can pick it up. Once you pick it up you realize it's a platform, suddenly platforms begin appearing in the world and it adds a new feature to the game. This could continue working with AI, falling blocks, keys, doors, etc. \n\nAs you can see this idea is barely fleshed out at all, so I'm looking for some help to think of better ideas for this games mechanics. My friend and I plan on making this game together and we love the idea, we just cant think of a better gameplay mechanic."
4bloie,[Guide] A game concept - How to describe your idea,"Hey guys,  \n  \n**Introduction**  \n  \nThis post is meant to help new Ideas to grow to concepts which are implementable.  \nI noticed that /gameideas is full of awesome ideas, but the concepts have very poor quality most of the time.  \nThe concept is the elaboration of your idea. It is necessary for others, which are going to help the concept grow and or are going to implement the concept in the final stage.  \n  \nIf this post is well received, maybe a mod could pin it up(?). \n\n**My background**  \n  \nI'm a professional software developer, working in a small team in long term projects. I'm not a professional game developer. However, games are software and the path of an idea that is growing into a concept which is implementable is similar.   \nThis post is meant as a guide for people with ideas which have no, or a very rough, idea of development.   \nTo make this post a great help for these people, I please you, professionals, semi-professionals and free-time indie developers to share your knowledge and experience. I will adapt them to this post, so whoever comes up with an idea, is able to transform the idea into a concept that is implementable.  \n  \n**Basic Terminology**  \n  \nFirst of all, we have to define some basic terms. This is to make thinks clear and to avoid misunderstandings.\nDue I'm not a game dev, I cannot provide the full game-specific terminology. So in particular this paragraph will grow, as others come up with their knowledge. To get a deeper knowledge, you might read the &lt;In depth Terminology&gt; paragraph at the end of this post. Deep knowledge is not crucial if you do not want to implement the game by yourself.\n\n - Idea  \n   Your initial version of the concept. It lacks a lot, but contains the core of your idea.  \n  \n - Concept  \n   The elaborated idea. The concept might not be full-blown, but whoever reads this will have a better understanding of what exactly you want. Professional game developers might be able to figure out which kind of objects, relations, interfaces and such are needed to implement the game.  \n  \n - Genre  \n   What kind of game is your idea about? Platformer, puzzle, real time strategy, first person shooter,... ? \n  \n - Theme   \n   Describe the ingame world. As an example, I want to mention a real time strategy game. Is it about pirates, or a WWII game, or what do you have in mind? If your idea contains a story, the story is part of this.  \n \n - Gameplay  \n   How does the user interacts with the game? Is it a puzzle game where the user has to move some bricks until the bricks form up a picture, or a car racing shooter where the user drives a car while shooting on his competitors? Is it multiplayer(local or online?) or singleplayer?  \n  \n**From idea to concept - an example post**  \n// Lines that begin like this (double slash) are comments.  \n// They are not part of the example but provide better understanding of why I've written something in what way and order.  \n// Sometimes it is not possible to describe a specific part of a game, because it is ""too different"".  \n// This will happen in the example, so you can see how to handle this.  \n//  \n// Start of the example post  \n  \nHey guys, I was thinking about a game, where the user runs from the left side to the right side. On his path, he has to cross obstacles by jumping over them. The world is moving, so the player has to time his jumps as otherwise he will fall out of the world and die.  \n// You might, or might not, see a platformer game in this idea. The idea is very rough and easy to misunderstand.  \n\nI'll describe the game a little further:  \n\nGenre:  \nSome kind of sidescrolling platformer, with focus on timing based jumps to overcome moving (And sometimes attacking) obstacles.  \nThe player will not play level by level, but one giant level in one row. Think of super mario, now put the beginning of each level at the end of the level before. tadaa\n// Much creative much wow...\n  \nTheme:  \nYou're a space-cowboy-ninja-detective. You got knowledge about the illuminates evil plan to destroy the world by reviving mega intelligent dinosaurs that can karate and shoot lasers through their eyes.  \nYou have to fight your way through these dinosaurs, and their intelligent defense lines, to the Illuminati king, which turns out to be Gaben Newell, which does all of this just to avoid making Half Life 3.  \n// As you might have noticed, the theme already makes some statements about the gameplay.  \n// So there are laser shooting dinosaurs, and a defense line to overcome.  \n// You know how platformer games work (If not: Super mario is one.) and thus.  \n// With your knowledge about platformers and my theme, you might have a colorful picture of the game in your head.  \n// But your picture might differ from mine, so I'll describe it further.  \n    \n   \nGameplay:  \nThe player can run, jump, crouch and prone.  \nBy running, the player will gain speed until a certain limit. Depending on the speed, movement will become less controllable, the character will react with a little delay, depending on his speed.  \n// How exactly does this speed to delay dependency work? If this is your idea, you should work this out.\n\nThe faster the player is running, the further he jumps.  \nCrouching is necessary to get through some objects, or avoid gunfire or such. The player will have a smaler sillouet and slow speed. He is not able to jump in this mode.  \nThe dinosaurs don't see very good. Lying prone will make the player invisible to most dinosaurs.  \nWhile prone, the player has extremely low speed. Jumping is impossible.   \n// Thats actual the movement, what else to say?  \n// Well, the objects in the world should be described a little further.  \n// What exactly are some obstacles, how do they behave, how to avoid them?  \n// Some ""art""-works (Or basic schemes made in paint) would help here a lot.\n\nSo as you know my idea, what do you think about it? Did I miss something, is something unclear?  \nI'd love to see this game and I bet everyone will pay full $60€ to play it. \n//Yeah,.. sure...\n\n// END OF EXAMPLE \n\n\n**In depth Terminology**  \nYou might not need it to elaborate your ideas. But it might help you understand how a developer thinks and thus gives you the ability to make a concept which is better implementable. \n\n - Object  \n   Software development these days is, most of the time, Object-oriented programming. Almost every game today is OOP.  \n   OOP is an programming paradigm (Way to do something) of ""objects"" which contain data and procedures. For example a paddle in the basic game Pong. The paddle is an object. It has some data (X/Y coordinates) and some procedures(methods/functions/...) like moveUp(), moveDown(), repaint(). The other paddle, as well as the ball, are other objects. \n\n\n"
4bl2xq,The Arena - Gladiator style PvP Deathmatch game,"Summary: Gladiator themed online first-person melee combat free for all deathmatch.\n\nFor the most part, this is a bite-sized version of the battle royale games which are becoming popular. \n\nYou start out in a dark enclosure. Sunlight pokes through tiny openings, but you can't see outside. You can hear a massive crowd cheering in anticipation, and an announcer speaking.\n\nA countdown from 10 appears, and a gong sounds the last 3 seconds.\n\nThen the gate is opened and the crowd erupts. You run out into the arena and apprise your situation: 14 other men (or women), all in minimal dress (not for sex appeal). Weapons placed neatly in various locations. Archers on perches, watching over the festivities to ensure nothing gets out of hand. A king on his throne, high up, looking down on the whole thing.\n\nSo you run for a weapon. You get a mace. It's heavy and hard to swing, but packs a wallop. A man with a short sword take several swings at you, but you time it right and manage to dodge each one. You wind up and swing the mace, hitting him and knocking him back.\n\nAnd so goes the game. Nothing revolutionary in terms of melee combat.\n\nThe hits would feel meaty. Players will have health meters, of course. \n\nYou will have an ""action meter"". This is represent in the form of a thumbs up, or a thumbs down icon. Run around, striking opponents, and your icon begins to go thumbs up. once it reaches maximum, the overseers will toss you a special weapon or item, and the meter resets to neutral.\n\nThe meter will go thumbs down if you fail to strike another player in a certain amount of time. Trying to hide, running away, or being nonviolent earns you thumbs down. When the meter reaches the bottom, the archers are instructed to eliminate you and begin firing arrows. You can recover from this by attacking other players quickly but the archers will continue to target you until your meter reaches neutral.\n\nAt the end of the time limit (5 minutes?), the remaining gladiators are healed and put into a final round, sudden death. In sudden death, every minute the weakest player is killed by archers. This is the player who has the least amount of health or had dealt the least damage.\n\nOther game modes: Chariot Racing, Horseback Jousting.\n\nYeah it's not all period correct, but who cares. It'll be a somewhat cartoonish game."
4bjrls,Survival Arena Game ( Under Construction ),"* If you don't understand the genre then look up, Ark: Survival of the fittest. My game idea is directly from this game.\n\nOverview\n---------------------------------------\nThis game follows a basic principle... You are in an a arena with 18-50 and your main goal is to outlast every other person. In other words kill, or be killed. If you know hunger games then you can probably gather what this game is. As stated, this is taking heavy inspiration from the new ark game and in a round a bout' way, minecraft survival games. As with Ark, this will be in a jurrasic world. You will be cavemen of sorts and put into any of 3 giant domes of hostile creatures, unforgiving land, and deadly humans. \n\n\nMaps\n-------------------------------\nThe old forest: Thick shrubs and hostile wildlife and plants. Map makes for great hiding spots and traps\n\nPrimordial Dunes: Intense heat and open waste. Map makes for great weaponry and creatures to domesticate\n\nPolar tundra: Harsh storms and hard to traverse. Map makes for great bases and resources\n\n\nPlayer vs Environment\n------------------------------------------\nThe weather and environment plays a huge role in the time of your survival. Sudden solar highs can awaken hostile plants and forest events. Rain showers can leave you grasping a slippery edge. Lack of water, intense heat, dust storms all can leave you charred and pelted to death. In the polar map the intense cold, storms, and deep snow can cause water to freeze and ultimately... you. Player will have to create heaters, coolers, and other Primordial devices to counter these events.\n\n\nTraps, weapons, and crafting\n----------------------------------\nAs with most survival games you will have a crafting system, pretty self explanatory... Players will advance tiers with the better resources they get. Basically there is,\n\nWood\n\nStone\n\nMetal\n\nWood is well, the worst while metal is the best. You can get better types of these materials or more refined versions before ultimately being able to advance to a higher tier. Stuff you will be crafting is dependent upon what your environment is. For example, if you are in the jungle you will make vine based weapons while in the desert, you will make rock and sand based items. Each map has its own unique pros and cons for players to expirement and master."

4bev2j,My RTS Idea ( Not Finished ),"*Disclaimer\nThis deal with religious places and topics so if you are a religious follower then turn away or take this lightly\n( I am an athiest of sorts so I do not particularly know what they believe and take harshly)\n\nIn this RTS it will follow the classic three race style. These 3 races include:\nEthreals\nHumans\nHell spawn\n\n(In this game your base can achieve three levels and depending on which level you are the structuresame and troops will change or evolve)\n\nThe first race, the Ethreals are beings of heaven and higher power. They are the high damage but low defense. Players must have a deep understanding of its structures and troops as this is the hardest to understand and play. \n\nYou will use the ether factory to spawn troops. The troops are as follows\nEthreals: inexpensive low rank troop capable of heavenly magic\nCloud spawn: Low health but capable of wiping out many\nGuardians: Armored stones, high health but slow movement\nThe akashi: Fastest, capable of a swift kill in groups\n\nThe structures are listed in two sections, resources and base, and defence/offenses \n\nRecourses and base:\nCloud funnel: Gathers cloud resourced\n\nMagic runes: Gathers Ethreals energy\n\nEther castle: Main structure \n\nEther Factory: Land based troop deployment\n\nCloud twister: Flying troop factory\n\nSupreme artifact: Summons supreme beings\nSacred seal: Supply and troop container"

4bebh2,A military game that doesn't suck.,"We've all played games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, Arma, etc. Call of Duty is a good quick ""I have ADHD and want fast action"" game, Battlefield is alot more realistic, and In my opinion, Arma is the most realistic.\n\nI, along with a undisclosed number of people I've surveyed (mostly military Vets) are interested in the following concept, which will probably never be developed.\n\nA military game in which you can have several different saved characters that you can develop and rank up. Think of Destiny where you pick either warlock, bladedancer, titan. You'll chose which branch you join (excluding the coast guard). This will only include combat related positions such as Green Berets, Infanty, Cav scout, tank, Force Recon, Pararescue, CCT, TACP,etc etc.  From there you'll experience in first person, life in basic/boot camp. Upon graduation,  You'll be sent to your respected after bootcamp training/indoc/selections.\n\nThis will be more of a tutorial of course. It'll teach you dive techniques, shooting, parachuting, how to use your specialized equipment, etc. Speaking of which, HALO jumps will be realistic in which you have to keep an eye on your altimeter, breath 100% oxygen prior to jump, etc.\n\n There will also be pilot positions in which you can have in addition to your specialty once you meet the maximum rank, or when you create your character you can take a lengthy, arduous, multiple choice test, to test out of it and jump straight to flying school. You'll have to actually jump in your jet/C130, etc, from the base nearest the Map you're playing on and do a manual take off and utilize realistic navigation. Flying will be kind of like a flight sim and it will be strongly encouraged to by a separate flight sim cockpit setup for your gaming area.\n\nThe weapons used would all be based on real guns, not the make believe stuff Call of Duty has been doing as of late. \n\nI also dream of this game being huge..multiple continents huge. \n\n"
4bdabw,A multi-platform multi-genre economy simulating MMO game,"* Match 3\n* survival/crafting\n* stock trading\n* caravan protection/attack\n* city building\n* RTS combat strategy \n* tangible resources\n* settler-type world\n\nI would like to come up with a game that allows us to simulate and tweak an economy and see what kind of changes happen, and what things individuals or groups can do to effect the economy. For an example, server A has a listings of jobs/resources from the server (government) that are at a flat pay/price against other players in the system who can set their pay/price at whatever point they would like, vs server B where its nothing but players setting prices for each other.\n\nThis would need quite a number of players, so I thought of attaching it another game idea I had, combining multiple genres of games. \nThe base game would be in the style of a survival/crafting game, but adding on the ability to sell to trading posts/factories, take deliveries, ambush caravans, or join in military services, these would be the Base Players of the game.\n\nThe crafting in the game would be done in a match-3 type of mini-game, giving refined resources based on how many points you get. Using a phone or tablet, one could get a contract with a ""factory"" which converts raw resources into refined resources, and play it on the go like any other smartphone game.\n\nThe city building game would consist of a player getting a tract of in-game land, and designating areas for different establishments in game (trading posts, stores, factories, housing/inns that sort of thing) and renting those parts of land off to Base Players, who can build in their lots and move up to setting up shop in the areas for other Base Players.\n\nAbove that would be Country players, who rent land to city players, manage relations with other country players, and gives the military commands in an RTS like strategy game. \n\nThe hierarchy of competition would be Players/Groups/Companies/Towns/Countries.\n\nThe Economy functioning and tweaking idea would come in to play where any player could buy/sell their resources for whatever price they want. For example, say the trading window shows that player set prices for Wood sells for $100 a stack, and Lumber (processed wood) goes for $125. The player could sell their wood for cheaper and get bought up quicker, or higher and get more money for their resource.\n\nWhen it sells, the trading post takes possession of the player's resource, and if they bought something, comes from the trading post's resources. The trading post then has to deliver the resources to where it was bought from, and resupply anything it sold, requiring a caravan to be sent from one place to another. This caravan would have however much security they would deem it to need, hired on of Base players protecting it.\n\nMost of this seems like a take on Eve online, but with survival and crafting, but I would also like the idea of being able to test and try out different economy ideas/solutions to problems"

4bd1k4,Computer AI Dungeon Master that automatically runs tabletop RPGs.,"One of the biggest downsides of tabletop RPGs, one of the only ones in fact, is the requirement for people. You need at least one person in the group with game mastering experience, and the group needs at least two people. If it was run by an AI, you could whip it out at any time and play it by yourself or with random people/friends. There are softwares and tables for randomizing encounters and such, rolling on a chart to get an event, but they are still rudimentary and something better is needed. \n\nA true AI DM would require procedural generation of the highest sort. It could pretty easily run a campaign with set paths, but a real DM writes more of the story as it is being read. It would have to understand what the players are doing through speech recognition and textual analysis, and then be able to quickly generate more appropriate content on the fly. \n\nA lot of the procedural generation would actually be pretty easy. It just rolls against the charts of the chosen version and then generates a dungeon, random event, village, or whatever. The problem lies in nonrandom improvisation, where there isn't a chart or where things need to be added to it. For example, there isn't a chart for spoken NPC quotes. \n\nI'll start working on something and see what I am able to create."
4bcqjg,Procedural Zelda-ish idea,"So in another thread on /r/Nintendo a week or so ago, someone asked the question of what kind of Zelda game would you make if you had control of the franchise, and I figure the idea I had could be something interesting for someone to make. I've got no programming skills whatsoever so feel free to grab this.\n\nThe original idea is that the game would be Link stuck in a dream, re-living a LoZ/LttP/LBW/TFC-style world, but obviously no actual Zelda elements could be used unless it was licensed..\n\nGraphically, I was thinking that something that looked like Wind Waker could be nice, though I guess a more graphically simple version of the game could be made in classic top-down Zelda-style.\n\nSo, the idea is that you're stuck in a dream, re-living a Zelda-style adventure. It would be procedurally generated, but not with a limitless world like Minecraft or Cube World; it would be more constrained. \n\nA set amount of biomes; Lost Woods, Eastern Palace, Swamp, Desert, Mount Doom, etc.. Each Biome area contains one temple that can only be accessed with a special item, except for the very first one. \n\nSince it's all procedural, you have to explore the map to find the first dungeon, though it's general direction should at least be a clue you can get at the very start, say from the king or princess sending you to the Eastern Palace or the Swamp Palace, etc..\n\nThe dungeons would be.. not so much ""randomly"" generated, but they would each have, say, 10-20 interconnecting rooms/hallways that would be shuffled around and placed, with the ""level verifying"" AI smart enough to make a dungeon that guides you to a dungeon-exclusive item, which you use to get to the boss monster. This dungeon-item is also the item you'll need to open up the next dungeon, and you'll get a clue at least in what direction to go/what biome it's in once you've beaten the boss, though you could always just wander around and explore the world if you want to see what's been generated.\n\nNow here's where things get a little more interesting; you could play up to 4 players online, and as more players join, the game doesn't just get tougher (monsters take/deal more damage and are more numerous) but the world also ""stretches""; so what would be a simple, regular-top-down-Zelda-scale game would grow as friends join.\n\nTo avoid friends dropping in with a higher-level character and having all the items and breezing through the game, all players that join are basically just a clone of the master-player/host; you only have the amount of heart pieces he has, the items he's collected, etc.. though the party shares access to certain resources, like keys, the compass, the map..\n\nTo have players keep playing, you could incorporate an XP system that unlocks, say, powered up versions of the dungeon-items. It wouldn't unlock the item from the start, but if you've unlocked the level-2 Boomerang that shoots further and faster with XP, when the group collects it you'd have the v2 of it instead of the v1, etc.. You could also do that for customizing gear - hats, outfits, mostly cosmetic stuff that you could use to differentiate you from the other players in more ways than just the color of what you're wearing.\n\nThere could be a lot of different biomes and dungeon types, to keep people playing more. And since it would use procedural generation and seeds, it would be incredibly simple to network, since everyone would just generate the world based on the seed.\n\nYou could also configure the map size and difficulty with flags, like if you just want to get a quick game in with a couple of friends you could flag it to be a small map with only 4 dungeons before the final boss, or you could go for an insane marathon session with a map that would use every type of dungeon at least once, like some monster 32 or more dungeon world with huge biomes if you wanted a real insane challenge.\n\nSomething that would basically be a multiplayer Legend of Zelda roguelike.\n\nSomeone, please steal my idea :P"

4bcast,Beat em up - As political incorrect as possible.,"**First things first:**  \nThis is about a 08/15 beat em up like Mortal Combat, Streetfighter or such.\nBoth, single and multiplayer, on a local machine.\n\n**Implementation:**  \nI want to make this game. I'm a software developer with no game dev experience, except for roughly 5-10 hours ""playing around"" in Unreal Engine 4 and a rough look at Unity 3D.\nMaybe one or two of you can share your experiences about such a game.\n\nOf course, you can also grab my idea and make it a game yourself.\n\n**The game itself:**  \n\n**Gameplay:**  \nNothing special. Beat - em - up  \nThats it.  \nAttack: high, low, center  \nBlock: high, low, center  \nMaybe more at a later time, who knows.  \n\n**Setting:**  \nSome might not like it, idk. I think it's hilarious.  \nThe game is not about brutality, but about political incorrectness in the most stupid-hilarious way I could imagine.   \n\nLike there is a Gay-Midget-Pirates fighting Adipose-Chinese in a Wheelchair or a superwaif in her revealed ravenous hunger, trying to eat whatever crosses her way, or such (If you have specific ideas, please post them!)\n\nAs level-scenarios , I think about a sanatorium, slave trading ship, parliament building,... wherever political incorrect jokes could take place.  \n\nA lot of hilarious stuff should happen in the background.  \nMaybe, later, I'll to the ""background"" interactive, to add more variables to the game, as well as to bring more political incorrect content.\n\n**Finishing moves:**  \nVS Adipose-Chinese: Grab the Chinese, pull him out his wheelchair, throw him on the ground, take seat in the wheelchair and leave the screen doing a one wheely on this wheelchair.  \nAnd such.\n\n\nFinishing moves would probably be the hardest, looking at the relatively complex mechanic, as well as the amount of graphical content. Every fighter should have a default finishing move, also, some fighters should have special finishing moves for special enemies.   \nLike the superwaif would devour the fat Chinese in one. Of course she would not be able to leave the arena afterwards.\n"

4b8jyh,Procedurally generated plot lines in medieval setting. Would it be worth it?,"Hello everyone!\nAlright, i have this complex idea in my mind and i would like to have some feedback and advice. \n\n* My background: I am not an experienced developer, I have only  been playing around with unreal engine but i have some graphic skill. I also started studying human etology to understand the real root of human behaviour.\n\n* The game: The biggest dream someone like me could ever imagine is to create a small, realistic world to play with. The idea is pretty simple, create a city, a medieval one perhaps, drop some characters here and there with different roles, a king, merchants, common folks and maybe even a wizard..give them needs (physiological and not) and resources and let them interact with each other. Looks like a **simulation game but** the thing is, i want them to love and hate, to make plans and hire assassin if necessary (because they see someone they care or themself endangered by someone else and their only resource is money perhaps)..so you see the needs I am talking about are not a generic ""social interactions"". \n\n* How everything would work: basically characters are created procedurally, with some ""internal"" **resources** like intelligence, morality, charm and some external like money and they are put into a context. Their **needs**, like a simulation game, go down and they will check all the options (they have knowledge of) and choose the one they can afford based on their resources. \nI would like to implement a dialog sistem between characters and give them **memory**, so that they can remember what they have seen or heard.\n\n* What the player can do: the initial idea was to make this a god like game, with a different theme...imagine the game is a book and the player is just a reader who must find out what is happening, where to look or follow, he can interac with thing maybe, not sure how... but in the end this looks quite dull.. \n\nSo probably the best thing is to let the player control a **PG and interact with the world**.\nI mean, imagine having a whole little world with semi intelligent people capable of making long term plans and conspiracies...wouldn't you like just to be part of it, screw things up and see what happens?? and since there is **no scripted story** you can do whatever you want, hire mercenaries to destroy the castle? why not...\n(The game might be 3d but made of 2d stuff..so no 3d characters and rooms.)\nYes, looks complicated and i am pretty sure that if i ever take this seriously i will face more problems than I imagine..but i am willing to put myself into it.\n\n* **Now**, the question is.. *is all this really necessary?* I mean, it is a lot of work and i just don't know if people are going to see the possibilities or just play it like a normal RPG, i guess it would be a pity.\n\n\nAlright, i apologize for my english and for the lenght of the post, hope someone will read it.\nHave a nice day ^*\n\nP.S.\n**If you have any ideas on how to resize this projects, to make everything simpler i would really appreciate**"
4b7xtd,Pokemon idle game,"I've played a few idle games in the past : Cookie clicker, Clicker Heroes and adventure capitalist, and I really was an addict. But then I thought about another game that kept me addicted : pokemon, so I thought mixing could be even more fun.\nSince there is no fan-game like that ( I think ) and I need to practice programming, I'd like to make a pokemon themed idle game, and so I'm looking for your help to make in interesting.\nI know that its licensed but really, thats just a fan-game without any future.\n\nThanks."
4b7adg,Zombie Survival game,"I know what you're thinking. The industry seems to be bloated with Early acess survival games that don't fulfill their promises. However, the release of The Division has really got me thinking that the genre could really be complimented with a survival horror theme. Not to mention, every game available has you play a survivor in the aftermath of a global catasrophe rather than the initial stages of an epidemic. My idea is basically a hybrid of The Division and Resident Evil Outbreak, with a sneaking elements.\n\n* in terms of story and setting, it is set in a large city and survivors have taken shelter in random safe zones around the city. Hospital, university campus, primary school, police station, city hall, etc. Some of these facilitated by the military, others by survivors. You start off in hospital, waking up after a car accident (you create your character in the cot) to only realise that a zombie outbreak has occurred. Of course your primary focus is to escape the now quarantined city. It would be open world, however the more story missions you complete, the more areas you can unlock. You can backtrack and do what not of course. When it comes to escaping the city (towards end of the game), you can choose several options on how to escape, depending on which group of NPC's you decide to side with. For example, if you choose military, you can be extracted via helicopter after completing tasks. If you choose a certain NPC group, it can be via sewers/subway, etc. Once you have 'escaped', of course the game ends, however you can remain in the city replaying missions, trying out different escape routes, etc.\n* Type of missions. Much like division, you'll have your random open world encounters like helping survivors, finding collectibles, clothing, weapons, etc. However, in terms of main missions, these will somewhat of a mixture of your standard fetch quests, or similar to single player story structure. What I mean by that is if you enter, say, a hospital, a cutscene is shown where your character gets knocked out by a dangerous group of human NPC's and steal your weapons. They want to play cat and mouse with you. So you wake up, and have to sneak around trying to find your gear back, and escape. Dodging NPC's - zombie and human, and 'traps' they have set up to try and capture and kill you with. Another would be getting trapped in a subway and being stalked by a mutated predator (kind of like nemeses or leechman), and you have to find a way to defeat it and escape the subway. Some missions require problem solving to escape/progress, very much so like Resident evil outbreak, but in a more organic way.\n* Mechanics. So because this is a hybrid of RE outbreak and division, this can be played up to 4 player co-op. You don't have to eat, or drink, but when you create your character, you can select from a number of archetypes. For example, you could choose your characters archetype where they can carry extra items, better heal team mates, have better aim, take more damage, etc. But for the most part, you play as an ordinary civilian. You don't really level up, or have 'higher gear', you just find different types of weapons - which most can disintegrate with use. You can crouch in order to sneak around, so you don't have to fight. You are able to dodge, which is a side-step meanuever. Of course, enemies can grapple you and you have to fight them off in case they bite you. Some areas require a partner to be accessed, for example they can boost you up a ledge (not necessary to progress, but could provide alternate routes/reach areas for special items). If a partner is moving slow due to injuries, you can shoulder hug them to move faster till you find health. Like outbreak, you don't health, but an infection metre. If you're injured enough, you fall down and start crawling. Once infection metre reaches 100%, you die. Of course, you can find items to suppress/reduce infection, but the more damage you take, the higher the infection rate quickens. If you're crawling, the infection rate moves rapidly. In safe zones, you can meet up with other survivors, walk around, talk to NPC's (who may ask you to check their apartment in case their loved one is still alive, etc) but once you enter the open world - like division, it becomes instanced as your own private game. Enemies can range from your standard zombies, mutated creations, stalker predators to human rioters.  \n\n\nSo yeah, that's my idea in a nutshell. Of course I have you're more ideas, but this is the general gist of what I'd love to see in a video game.\n"
4b1tnn,Robot survival game,"Basically, my idea is for a survival game where you play not as a human, but as a robot. You'd still have core survival elements under new headings (energy as opposed to food, oil as opposed to water), but would allow for customization to a greater degree than most survival games, and would allow for more a level playing field PVP-style.  \nFor example, robots can be upgraded, replace parts, download programs in ways humans cannot. You'd have the standard ability increases like faster move speed, increase carrying capacity, but you could have more extreme ones that wouldn't work with humans. You can have your character 'download' a program to, say, double jump or find and install an extra arm, letting characters to be much more varied then there are in survival games right now, which are mostly gear-dependent.  \nRobots also allow for a more level playing field in PVP, since most (read: pretty much every single survival PVP-game) starts off at caveman tech and escalates to current level. So you end up with five guys with bows going against one guy with a semi-automatic rifle; odds are, the one guy wins. On the other hand, robots could start off at our current level (or near enough), and upgrade to future tech, thus, you end up with five robots with Uzi's going against one guy with a plasma cannon. The plasma cannon guy still has an advantage, but the difference between the two groups is less extreme, sort of like the difference between level 1 and level 10, and level 51 and 60.  \nMy idea for a 'robot survival game', I feel, still embraces the core concepts that make survival games enjoyable while expanding on others  and attempting to fix common problems that crop in survival games. If you have any questions, go ahead and leave a comment. "

4b0j58,Game Based On Wendigo Myth With A Twist,"-Sorry for the wall of text in advance, I wrote this quite a while back and never had anywhere to post this previously.-\n\nGame has limited turn based combat however you are rewarded for taking less direct or making unique decisions based on traits, alignment, and skills. \nSurvival elements and some carry over between games (Unlocking new events as you play the game so you can experience them in the next play through) along with randomly generated events.\n\nYou play as a human turned Wendigo (your body will also mutate  based on certain factors in a way similar to Warhammer 40k) located in a fictional land that resembles Siberia.\nYou start off as a human trader traveling with a small caravan through a land mostly forsaken by anyone who isn't brave enough or dumb enough to cross it. There are a few outposts built by outcasts of society/adventure seekers/military factions along the way.\nDuring the journey a massive snowstorm hits and the caravan is left stranded for weeks (1+ month)\nDuring this time you must make choices to survive while dealing with the others in the caravan.\nIt is a hopeless endeavor however, based on how long you lasted before becoming a Wendigo and what choices you made to survive as long as you had you will gain some character traits that affect you when you become a Wendigo (You will die if you refuse to cannibalize in this section, however it will unlock more events).\nThere is a sanity meter, a hunger meter, and a heat meter (Heat and hunger meters running out causes your body to change with special randomized traits unique to both ""hunger"" and ""environment"" that will effect you in game) as well as an ""alignment"" meter that effects how beneficial certain choices will be. (I.E. good means diplomatic choices to help others may lead to more beneficial outcomes. Evil will lead to helping others backfiring but choices revolving around survival and cruelty being more beneficial for the player. It is a slippery slope and an Evil alignment becomes harder to change the more solidified it is.)\nThe lower your hunger meter gets the lower your sanity meter becomes.\nEating human flesh to increase your hunger meter also leads to sharp drops in sanity.\nThe lower your sanity becomes the more your body will mutate (Changes at random and will provide both a negative and positive outcome which also effects choices that can be made)\nReaching 0 on your hunger meter will cause you to steadily lose health every day, it will also cause certain random events to be accessible until the hunger meter is above 0.)\nThere are multiple events that can occur and there are two ways to win the game with multiple ending scenes possible.\nUpon reaching the destination your caravan set out for. Or upon eating a certain number of people and completing the event that is unlocked.\n(There will also be an Endless mode.)\nThere will be two potential characters that you can play as, a man and a woman. Both will be present in the caravan and one will die during the ""prologue"".\nThere will be a loot system which allows you to collect food, firewood, firestarters, weapons, clothing etc. (Different types of clothing are better for certain things but warmth is a necessity in the frozen tundra.)\nThere is a leveling system that gives you a limited selection of perks as well as a selection of skills that work separately from the randomized traits.\nA summary of your old games will be logged in the ""Graveyard"" which can be accessed through the menu. (Will also contain overall stats)\nArt style will be similar to Darkest Dungeon but with more black and white with small bursts of red (blood.)\nCombat is semi-dialogue based with visuals to assist.\nDying from certain things unlocks more potential random events and finishing the game leads to yet more potential random events as well as a unique perk based on your ending that is carried over to new play throughs. (Can obtain multiple.)\nThere is a large map that you can travel however certain ways will be blocked at random forcing you to find new ways to your destination."
4axr2d,"Fast Train, Fast Skates","When on a packed train where the only option was to stand and ""skate"" by keeping balance came up with this idea when I thought ""this feels like Skating really slowly, with how you have to keep your legs counter balanced with the train. Bet it would be nigh impossible on skates""\n\nA video game where one is in a train that's going at high speed and you are either in skates or on a skateboard and have to try and get through to the other end of the train without hitting passengers.\n\nI mean you're also going at high speed on the skates btw.\n\nInertia of the train should mean that is hard to stay balanced, especially on bends.\n\nI would think that most passengers would be sat down on this except for some that start getting up unless you do X.

4awuhe,Stealth Game,"Hey Guys,\nI used to be a frequent checker of this subreddit a while ago and congrats on how far it has come. \nI have wanted to make a stealth game for a while now and to get it kickstarted I wanted some ideas and opinions:\n\n*View point*\nI have decided to pick top-down as my viewpoint for this game. I will take on sonicneo1's advice and have multiple layers in a level which are all in sync and can be transversed via stairs, elevators, etc. \n\n*Setting/ Theme*\nI have narrowed down the possible themes/setting of the game, yet a few new additions have been added:\n\n\nSteampunk\n\nMedieval Europe\n\nAlien Invasion(A lot of help from JakeAbraham)\n\nParty(Thanks to Muteness)\n\n\n*Gameplay*\n\nAn idea of what I have imaged so far.\nDepending on what theme I chose, these ideas may change to fit in a little bit better.\nThere will likely be a general base where you can freeroam between missions (Not very big, a few characters to talk to). There will likely be the main story line as well as a few side missions that pop up every now and then to provide rewards towards your character.\n\nI found this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/4ate6i/i_want_to_create_a_the_binding_of_isaac_inspired/\nand I was intrigued by one of the comments made by the OP, a couple of lines down:\n\n""I had the idea to make powerups be some kind of cards, and after each bosses you'd be able to choose between three different cards. I guess I could make it so there's three different kind of cards (maybe defense, offense, utility). But the item balance behind that will be really difficult to build.""\n\nI will definitely be experimenting with something like this, to really allow the player to have a totally unique playstyle. This idea probably wont work with the party theme, depending on how that idea expands out.\n\nThanks for all of your contributions so far, and I am going to continue working on building up this project."
4avvoh,Sports game on PC,"For PC: I don't know what company, but they need to make a standard football/soccer/hockey/baseball/basketball/rugby/lacrosse (or others) game with mannequins (or just generic people). It could be a reasonable $30, and of course will be on sale at times. Every year, the company would develop and make a mod for purchase that is for new players/coaches, plays, and stat updates on current ones. Once they get the mechanics of the mannequins (physics, glitches, the correct running form, and so on), then that's when they'd begin to create the yearly mods (basically would be skins and stat changes). They could charge $20 or so per year for the mod which people would love instead of $60 for a new annual game. That way people who want to play sports games on their PC, and not spend a fortune on it, but the prices are not definite, of course. The game itself would not be hard to run at all because it has to render about 120 yards by 70 yards for football."

4ar5dg,A very disturbing (yet Sadistically funny) racing game.,"In a nutshell, the basic twist is that instead of cars, the racers are riding on the backs of large almost-naked humans crawling on all fours, with a large saddle on their backs. Meanwhile, the racers themselves are anthropomorphic car-like robots.\n\nThere would be limb dismemberment when the *vehicles* are damaged, as most of the powerups would involve bladed weapons. Lopping off limbs forces them to keep on crawling at the same pace, often dragging their stumps along the ground. All the while, a blank expression on their faces, ""This is why I was bred, this is why I must race"" being prolly the only thing they think.\n\n*Vehicles* would persist to writhe and struggle to crawl even after all limbs have been removed. It is up to the player to manually put the *vehicle* out of it's misery to get a new one.\nDecapitation (or severe blood loss) results in death of the *vehicle* and a new one being spawned in: a normal baby that rapidly grows to the size of the other *vehicles*.\n\nEdit: I think the best name for this should be Meatball Run (or Rally), as a reference to the real-life [Cannonball Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Baker_Sea-To-Shining-Sea_Memorial_Trophy_Dash) races and the racing films insipred by it (such as Canonballrun and Gumball Rally), and also due to the fact that the vehicles are infact made of meat."

4cvtcd,Open world tank based RPG,"**--The concept--**\n\nWhen I was growing up I used to be massively interested in tank games. Games like battlezone and battletanks were some of the staples of arcade tank fun. However, as the genre has aged it's lost a lot of its arcade feel for hyper realistic tank gameplay.\n\nThis project brings all of that back.\n\nInstead of component based health bars or other realistic fluff, project tanks will focus on fast, explosive game play. \n\n**--The gameplay--**\n\nBeyond just removing industry fluff, what's the game like?\n\nLet's start with the game loop and then breakdown the mechanics:\n\nPlayer spawns in a large open world with sparsely placed settlements. They start without a tank, and on foot. The game at this point will function mostly as an FPS. \n\nFrom their initial spawn they can rob, trade or mine their way up to wealth. That's when the game hits it's stride.\n\nWith money or power you can obtain your tank. Tanks come in many forms: long range railguns, light and quick-moving gattling tanks and many more inventive varieties. Having a tank allows quicker travel, more power and better defense. They only require two things to operate: ammo and fuel.\n\nPlayers can craft ammo, but fuel must be bought at depots. \n\nKilling other tanks or finding wreckage will give the player scrap metal that can be used to upgrade your death machine. Speed, weapon specialization, power and armor are all forms of tank progression found in the game.\n\nLosing your tank can be incredibly dangerous. You can gather the scrap to help start over, but you're vulnerable to bandits on foot.\n\n**--The setting--**\n\nThe world of project tanks is a varied one. The core of the world is a brown, cracked earth desert littered with mountain ranges. On the fringes you can find dense jungles, tundras near the poles and swamps too. Each terrain offers certain challenges to the player, but also distinct rewards.\n\nFor example: the swamp slows your tank, so heavy tanks can get bogged down in the mire. However there are rare components here like acidic ammo components, rubber for certain tires, etc.\n\nIt's also a very dangerous world. The settlements function as city-states with a few coalitions and factions binding them. The player carries reputation with these peoples and can earn bonuses for fighting their enemies or make them enemies through repeated attacks."
4cuvx2,Card RPG,"**Character Concept**\n\nThe main character is an infamous card master. He's not a shiny hero because he loves to gamble, play with his foes and he is also a swindler. The character would be similar to the League of Legends champion Twisted Fate. I can some resemblances to the Joker.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nTo fight the card master uses his cards as spells. I imagine this to be like a draw x cards and use one of them then redraw. Maybe there could be different slots of cards so you can combo them as well.\n\nBecause RPGs are about the loot and a card game is about collecting cards I think he should have a deck of cards which he draws from. These cards can be found during his missions or earned as rewards as usual. Some cards me be used only or multiple times while others have unlimited uses.\n\nAdditionally he should have a standard normal attack which I imagine to be a card throw. \n\n**Card types**\n\nThere should be four categories of cards:\n\n* defensive - heal, shield or buff yourself\n* aggressive - damage, inflict debuffs to enemies\n* utility - move, jump: just generally positioning yourself better\n* control - change the terrain or game rules (optional because harder to add)\n\n\n\n**Quests**\n\nBecause the card master does not care about law or helping people he would only accept quests to gain advantages or for fun.\n\n**Further ideas**\n\nAdd a card crafting / upgrading system\n\nsmall skill tree evolving around luck and better picks or loot\n\n\nWhat do you think? Have you got any inputs?\n\nMaybe I'm going to make this game myself. But feel free to use this idea as I will most likely never finish anything usable anyways. "

4csb4z,"Table-top Board Game ""The Court""","\n\nSo this is an idea that just popped into my head and I felt I had to write it down before I forgot it.\n\nIt operates similarly to a table top RPG with a Game Master and dice rolls but other then that I feel it's mostly a completely original idea.\n\nHere is the idea.\n\nStory: The king is dead, and any legitimate successors he had are dead with him, putting the crown in a state of interregnum. The Court has ten days to announce a new ruler or the land will fall into civil war.\n\nRules: Players are allowed to perform any action that fits the time period. (Medieval) if you want to jump out and slash the throat of your competitors you're free to do so, however you'll  probably most definitely fail and die yourself.\nPlayers are allowed to form alliances but at the end of the day only one person can be King.\nPlayers win by gathering Right to Rule points. Highest amount by end of day ten wins.\n\nGoal: Gather the most right to rule and become King. Or pledge loyalty to someone else and assist them in becoming King.\n\nLength: The crowning periods lasts 10 days, which consists of 10 day turns and 10 night turns.\n\nAwarding of Points: \nDuring day periods, Players will take turns drawing Scenario Cards along the lines of (The neighboring Kingdom sends a letter asking for your pledge of loyalty in return for naming you King.) at which point the player will determine his or her course of action. Points are awarded for Scenarios by the Game Master. Players can also challenge other players to debates, at which point they draw a debate card each and debate issues concerning the kingdom  (The peasants are suffering under the tyranny of your incredibly effective and loyal Sheriff). Points are awarded by the Court. Loser loses points.\nDuring Night periods, players will receive Night Action cards and will write down the action they wish to take. (Spy on... Attempt Assassination on... Plant Evidence on... Search room on... Guard your room etc.) success or failure of missions defend on dice rolls and the actions of your target. If you attempt to assassinate someone and it fails, they'll know someone is out to kill them. If they search your room and discover your plan, they can out you to the court and punishment can be loss of Right to Rule to a Trial to even death. Points for Night Actions are awarded solely by the Game Master.\n\nCharacters (Maybe?): in the beginning of the game, players roll dice to determine the wealth and strength of army of their characters.\n(See Lannister )\nThe personality of their character is that of the player, not a pre-determined arch type.\n\nThe amount of money and soldiers one gets determines how much right to rule they can achieve early on. Someone with more soldiers will probably believe he should be king more than someone who doesn't have any and he should be able to use that.\n\nMoney allows people to hire better spies, assassins, more soldiers and what not.\n\nPledging: Pledging allegiance to someone to try and make them king guarantee that you will win if they do. You could pledge allegiance to everyone theoretically but your lieges probably won't like that.\n\nIt is not binding. You could form an alliance and backstab your partner that night if you wanted\n\nCoronation: on Coronation Day (day 11) the player with the most Right to Rule points will be crowned King. Surviving players are allowed to get ""second place"" by pledging allegiance or they can refuse and attempt to overthrow the King of their forces outnumber to combined forces of the King and his supporters. The New King automatically is coronated and his enemies are killed.\n\nThe Realm: during the Day Period you'll still have a realm to rule. If everyone neglects that then the Kingdom will fall apart anyway. So if you want to stay out of the intrigue and be a man of the people you'll have an extra boost of soldiers if you want to make a play on Coronation Day.\n\nAll in all, success is what you make it. If success for you is making sure the new King owes his success to you, then so be it! If Success to you is staying out of the internal struggles and keeping the Kingdom safe and prosperous then power to you, you go getter.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think of this game? My heart will be broken if this already came out..\n\nPlease let me know that, if this doesn't fit here where it'll fit somewhere else. Thanks!"

Im not sure if it’s a terrible idea or not?\nDoes anyone have any suggestions of a good way to get feedback? I’m thinking the voting system on twitter would be a way forward.\nDo you think the game will lose impact if its released and updated periodically? At the moment I’m only going to release the first world which to be fair doesn’t take long to finish. Is this a bad idea?\nIf you interested I have a few screenshots on my twitter @Crissblisss\nAny opinions, experience is more than welcome\nTa!"

4cmx48,"Drifting, floating in a liferaft in the ocean, no land in sight. Don't die.

4clqkk,"University Application Portfolio, need games and ideas!","So it is getting (slowly) to the point where I should start getting ready to apply for university. I have had game development as a hobby for a good amount of time now and would put myself in the intermediate section.  \nThe one thing that I think will become a ""problem"" is that one of the universities I really want in on (at least at the moment), strongly suggest that you send/show/whatever a portfolio(probably have to do this at most universities...) of games you have developed yourself.\nMy problem is that I have never (completely)finished a game (probably something very common). This is probably due to my lack of creativity so I can keep adding interesting features and ideas to my game(s).  \n  \nSorry for the long introduction, but this is my first Reddit post, ever (the pressure is on!).  \n*I was wondering if any of you fellow thinkers or devs out there have any good ideas for small to medium games. 2D or 3D, multiplayer or singleplayer could work as long as you keep it realistic for a ""Intermediate"" developer.  \nI don't have many requirements on my own, other than that the art of the games are either extremely simple (because I can't draw for shit), or easy to find free online.*"

4cilp6,Fantasy Colorblind/Vision Concept,"It was originally a fantasy FPS where the magic wand that you held affected your vision.\n\nEvil wands make everything dark and red, and good wands make everything bright and happy.\n\nMost wands just make stuff look weird.\n\nExample: You have no wand, and see in greyscale.

4cgcid,game features ideas...,"These ideas are about features in an RPG game...\n--- When the game begins, it should provide a list of names from which the player can choose or the player can type his/her own name. The name should be spoken by any other NPC when addressing the hero(via a kind of text to speech system), so you'd feel more familiar...\n---- The hero's companions(including family, friends, or hired mercenaries) should feature a chatbot-like dialogue system and not a pre-defined dialogue. In other words, they'd look like ""real"" characters(think more advanced versions of cleverbot or ALICE) the player can talk to...\n---- Players could abandon previously taken quests and they will no longer appear in their quest log. There could be an option to ""trick"" quest givers into thinking they fulfilled the quest.\n\nOnce a quest is abandoned, it can be reactivated later on. Some quests should be game changing depending. If the player refuses or postpones a quest, someone else might take it and complete it(another NPC) and the hero will be told about it if he/she contacts the quest giver again.\n--- If the hero gets a large amount of money, he/she will be targeted by thieves and constantly attacked. If the hero builds a house, it too can be broken into while the hero is away... The saddest part would be if the hero has a family. The thieves could either slaughter them or kidnap them for a ransom. There could be spells to protect the house, a magical barrier that only the hero can dispel(but the hero would be required to learn it first or buy it).\n---- The world would shift. Kings would fall/be assassinated, cities would fall, new factions and cults will appear, warlords will rise to power and all this will affect the hero. If you knew that in (city's name) there is a king who promised you a quest reward, when you return, a new king is in place and he is not very keen to reward you! If you ransack a thieves hideout, you could spare one of them.\n\nOnly that, many years later, the one you spared became a fearsome warlord who isn't so sure to remember your kindness. Or, there is a chance he will remember you and become your ally.\n--- Every game character will have a personality. They will have fears(that could lead to more quests) and even evil characters won't be evil for the sake of evil.\n\nAn enemy warlord might give up if you kill enough of his troops, and might come forward to negotiate peace. Another one could never give up attacking you until his death. But usually, too brutal warlords will be assassinated by their own men. Other NPCs will attract people with their charisma.\n\nA new preacher establishing a sect can easily draw a large number of people to turn into warriors battling everyone who opposes them, you included. Even your family can fall prey to such individuals. You would have to deal with them. Sometimes, your own wife/husband or children will turn against you!\n--- A combat's outcome isn't necessarily total annihilation. An opponent might give up and surrender, at which point the hero can choose what to do.\n\nYou can either spare them and part ways, ask them to join you, ask them for money(if the can't pay right away, they will go home and arrive at your house a few days later---or not!) or ignore their pleas and kill them nevertheless. Some of your enemies will have useful information/quests to give in exchange for their lives.\n\n--- If you neglect your family for too long(not going home very often), they will leave you. As every NPC has a personality, your NPC wife/husband might hire someone to ambush and kill you anywhere in the wilderness between cities. Usually, if you survive, you will learn he/she has a mistress.\n\n---- Your kids(unlike Skyrim, you can make kids of your own, but you could also adopt) would grow up. They will sometimes fall for wrong people. Your daughter could end up being with the most ruthless bandit in the land and it's up to you to solve this mess...\n--- Even your own companions can turn against you, if their personality fits and someone persuades them to get rid of you... \n\nTreat them badly, leave them alone for too long and this might happen. You'll have many enemies and they won't always be straightforward! Generally speaking, the better you treat every NPC you come across and the more time you spend just talking and listening to them, the less likely they are to turn against you(or turn others against you).\n\n--- But some will just hate you with no reason. They could be jealous of your accomplishments or just want to take your place or like someone better. If a king asked you to do a quest and promised to let you marry the princess, there is a high chance this will go as promised and the princess will truly love you. But there is also a chance that the princess already has an affair with someone else and they will try to get rid of you the first chance they get!\n\n--- Every NPC will have a personality, a life, a wish/dream. Some dreams you could help accomplish via quests. For instance, an NPC dreams to be the most famous singer in the land, but a teacher at the academy holds a grudge against him. If you solve this, the singer might or might now recognize you later on/might or might not give you credit and a proper reward. Again, this is personality-dependent.\n\n--- Killing an NPC is not without consequence. Even if you kill a thief, even if on a mission, his family will hate you forever. If you didn't know that a shopkeeper is the thief's brother, bad luck! He will never sell you anything again. Some will try to avenge their relatives. Out of the blue, you could be standing against groups of hired mercenaries or kids wishing for revenge.\n--- You set your own goals, your own quests. There could be an interactive quest making panel to choose. It starts with a dream of yours(besides the main storyline), allowing you to choose a goal. Will you become king? Will you defeat all evils threatening the land? Will you become rich as hell and create your own cities? Will you turn out to be a warlord and conquer them all!\n\nThere is no limit as to how high a player's ambitions can be. The game then unfolds multiple storylines consisting of quests all geared towards achieving your goal. Some are more peaceful, while others are violent. Some will require more talking, more negotiations, while others will need you to be a great warrior and an awesome mage! These storylines are just proposed, not imposed. You could choose which quests to fulfill and which to forego.\n\nAnd goals are different. Not all of them are big. For instance, you want to own a city. You could either a)Do this the hard way(become warrior, get an army, conquer the city and it's yours!) or b)Make sure people like you enough to ask the king to grant you rule!\nBoth will set up specific quests. You can switch strategies at any time(becoming more peaceful or more aggressive).\n(more as I have new ideas---as replies to this thread).\n\n"
4ce6dh,Real time online sci-fi clicker/ survivalist game idea.,"I keep dreaming/ thinking about an online game, I guess similar to clock tower and a cross between TLOU (gathering supplies, surviving) and a typical online cookie clicker like clicking bad, CityInc etc.. but with MUCH more added depth and strategy)\nIt's definitely a progressive, real time game- meaning that it is kind of important that you check in every day or as often as possible. \n\n\nAnyway, the premise is that you are a normal human, stuck in a purgatory state that you must work toward escaping and you need to effectively find a way to break the ""fourth wall"" so to speak. There would of course be numerous ""Endings"" to shoot for which would obviously make for it's replay-ability. \n\nTo do this you would need to browse fake online forums, sites similar to reddit, news.com (or a parody of) similar news style websites. \n\nYour tools would be things like a Highlighter (You could save important passages of text in a personal bank) (normal highlighting/right clicks would be disabled)\n\n\nA sci-fi-esque conspiracy detector (You could use in game cash or credit to upgrade it's strength) that would effectively steer you in the right direction by telling you what is important and what is not. You could even use this to ""debunk"" other players work which would mean they would have to start from scratch in gathering info etc.. \n\n\nA Connections tool which would enable the player to add or take to other peoples findings at a cost. You want to explore a branch that Player393 has been working on? You better barter for it. Looks like he needs path of text you Highlighted about a month ago that's been sitting in your bank unused ever since that link broke. Of course though, you could do the asshole thing if you have enough Political/ notoriety points and just steal it. \n\n\nThere would be more tools but that's just a few a I can imagine for this post. I imagine plenty of other aspects of game play like a wheel you would have to spin with a chance you could lose your research from the last week, day or hour. Or you could win hidden links, notoriety/ political points and extra daily energy refills etc.. \n\n\nAs in keeping with the general theme of the game, messaging would be available but it would function like Snapchat in which conversations be lost after a certain time, and if someone highlights something before it disappears the other player would be notified. This is also how game ""information"" would be leaked. An added depth of gameplay, if you will.\n\n[Pop-up idea](http://atom.smasher.org/error/xp.png.php?icon=skull3&amp;style=xp&amp;title=Are+you+sure+you+want+to+challenge+this+player%3F&amp;url=&amp;text=If+you+choose+to+challenge+this+player+you+will+not+be+able+to+back+out+of+it+until+someone+has+proved+the+chosen+topic%2F+theory+to+be+true+or+false.+&amp;b1=Yes&amp;b2=No&amp;b3=Queue+this+action+for+me) - Obviously wildy outdated but you get the gist of it.\n\nYou are free to add/ subtract to this as you see fit. Or give me constructive criticism. I obviously don't mind or I wouldn't be posting anything about it here. Haha.\n\n\n"
4cdde2,A runaway combat droid,"You are a combat droid owned by a megacorporation. You're being sent on different missions, ranging from direct assault on other corporations to No Russian-level atrocities. Your goal is to complete the mission, but failure is an option, it will simply lead to a worse score. Another option is to intentionally sabotage the mission, attack bystanders or allies, or leave the mission area. You will be marked as runaway, corp goons and police will attack you on sight, but you'll be able to explore the world, do what you want and help/kill whomever you want, and maybe find and join the resistance."
4cbkx0,World Domination / Card Game,"**Abstract:** Just for a simple understanding, the objective is to conquer the world.  The game would use a heavy card game mechanic as well as a large focus on diplomatic relations.\n\nBasically, The game can be broken down to three parts.  The cards, The diplomatic controls, and the world map.\n\n**World Map:** For the starter map, I would use something relating to the real world but anything could be made.  Instead of placing a bunch of countries bordering each other like risk, it would just be the outline of the maps with circular markings to display where each location is.  From each location there would be lines connecting them which tells the player where they can move to from each locations.  Some locations will be suitable for a airport or seaport, which will allow the player more options.\n\n**The Cards:** The player will have two decks.  One of the decks is built up of Resource cards.  These are used to generate resources, build their country and explore the map.  Some cards in this deck can also have a positive impact on diplomatic relations.  Some of the cards would include settlers, explorers, Factories, airports, seaports, international traders, and diplomats.  \n\nThe other deck is the military deck.  This contains all types of cards that would be used to defend your country, invade others or even send out attacks without your countries name behind it.  These cards consist of bases, soldiers, ships, tanks, planes, missiles, pirates, mercenaries and more.\n\nThe cards can also be broken down into groups.  Units(people), structures(buildings &amp; bases) and vehicles.  All cards will have the following properties: resource cost, resource replenishment, move(Structures do not have this property), attack, defense, prerequisites, requirements, description.  Structures and vehicles also have a Capacity.\n\nResource Cost: This will show the player how many resource point it costs to play that card.\n\nResource Replenishment:  This will show the player how many resource point are earned each turn that card is in play.\n\nMove:  This will show the player the number of locations the card can be moved each turn.  Cards cannot move through another nations territory unless an agreement is made.  Agreements can be made when the card is at the border of the other nations territory.  If the Move is represented with a ""0"" that unit cannot move between locations unless placed in a vehicle.\n\nAttack:  The amount of damage the unit does if it chooses to attack.\n\nDefense:  The amount of damage the unit can take before it is destroyed.  If it is destroyed it is removed from play.\n\nprerequisites:  These are things that must be true before the player is allowed to play the card.  (A plane needs an airport before it can be played.)\n\nRequirements:  These are things that must be true before the player is allowed to use a played card (A factory cannot produce resources without workers, a plane needs a pilot to fly).\n\nDescription:  Just to give the player some basic outline of what the card is.  This section may also include any special effects (kind of an after thought) the card may have.  \n\nCapacity:  The number of unit cards that can fit ""inside"" the structure or vehicle.  When a unit is ""inside"", their attack and defense become non-existent.  if the units are still ""inside"" when the structure or vehicle is destroyed, those units are also destroyed(Unless specified differently in the description).\n\n**Diplomatic Controls:**  There are many different controls that the player must watch and can affect based on what they do in the game.  Everything the player does can change the way other countries cooperate and act with the player.\n\nFirst, is the DEFCON level.  The player can choose which level their country is at (5(safe)-1(at war) ).  If the player does not lower it when they go to war, it could be considered they are trying to hide it.  If they lower the level without being at war, it will raise suspicion among others.  If the player lowers the DEFCON to level 3 or 2, it may close off their countries borders, disallowing any other country access which would lower their international relation.\n\ninternational Relations is something that can be changed and affected.  It is how each country feels about the other.  The player can see all other relations that don't involve their own country.  The player can decide that they don't want to be friendly and drop the level manually.  The other option is that the level is affected automatically based on decisions they make.  If they invade an area, that countries relations will obviously go down.  If you send a country resources, it will go up.  When the level gets too low, they may start attacking or become unwilling to make a deal with the player.  \n\nMilitary ratio:  The player cannot change this other than with the cards they play.  Once there are 10+ cards the player has laid, it will start to keep track of what percentage is military based cards.  Every other country will be able to see this ratio (even if the card you played is hidden from them).  The higher percentage of military to resources your country has, the more secure other countries may act.  For example, if the player has an extremely high percentage (90-95% military cards), all other countries may have the borders closed down, and unwilling to negotiate with the player.  Other countries also may have made agreements out of fear of the player.\n\n**Game Modes:** Aside from different maps, I think there are a couple different ways someone could play.  First, there could be domination, the player must conquer every piece on the map.  Second, would be peacekeeping, where multiple countries can exist as long as all international relations are extremely high and all DEFCON levels are at 5.  (there would always be at least one bad apple that needs to be wiped out).\n\nWith each game mode, the player can choose to start with a preexisting map (all areas are equally split between countries and each area is given one settler.) or explorer mode (each country starts off with one piece of land and one explorer, requiring the player to grab as much land as possible.)\n\nDuring game play, the players turn would consist of the start phase,  placement phase, and diplomatic phase.  \n\n**Start Phase:**  The first thing to happen at the beginning of the turn is the player will collect their resource points.  This is done by calculating the resource replenish amount of every card that they have played.  Once the player has collected their points, they may draw a card from one of the two decks.  If the player still does not have a full hand (8 cards), they may draw another card (possibly at the cost of resources) until they have a full hand.\n\n**Placement Phase:**  Once the Start Phase is over, the player has a chance to play cards from their hand.  placing as many cards as they desire.  The Player can only place cards on areas that are already owned and all the prerequisites must be met before the card can be played.  The player must also have enough resource points to cover the cost of the card they wish to play.\n\n**Diplomatic Phase:**  Once the player is in this phase, they now have the option to adjust their international relations, move units, send vehicles, attack areas and offer trades/deals to other countries.\n\nThe games would start off being accessible for a pass and play and AI, then later on a online multiplayer could be developed.  This game would work very well for mobile in my opinion.  What do you think, any feedback is appreciated. \n\nEDIT: Added information to the cards and the game play."
4ca3fu,2D Puzzle Platformer *with a twist,"Basically the idea is to make the player control water as the main character. And give him the ability to switch between states (soild,liquid,gas) to find a solution to the puzzle given to him.\nI want to make something where the players choice of state matters during solving any puzzle.\nThe level design can either be like a maze with only one path to take as you switch to the right state, or it can be like each level (puzzle) can be solved in three different ways leading towards different progression setting.\nThe story I have in mind is of an icy comet, crashing on earth, coming to life and solving puzzles to travel through the water-cycle of the planet (earth) to escape back into space.\nThe story will play a main role in the art and design as the location will be the places water has to actually travel on our planet to complete one water cycle. Starting somewhere in the high mountains, coming down to the dense forests and finally meeting the sea and evaporating.\nI am stuck with the idea of having a unique mechanic which supports the core mechanic of the game. I want the games core mechanic to be solving puzzles using YOURSELF as ice , water or vapour.\nAny idea that you think can make this a better game is welcome.\nHope somebody helps :)"
4c7cfd,A game. Where you can do anything.,"You may call me crazy, maybe a no life. I have been having dreams about games that don't even exist. Some that you live on an island and build literally anything on the fucking planet. Others just with incredible physics and in depth graphics/story-line. I have been looking for a game for a long time that you can do anything. Minecraft fits me well and that's why I played it for a long time but it went downhill at 1.0. I have played some rust and some other games but none of them appeal me. This game literally has the be the perfect survival/multiplayer that has ever been on the internet. The physics have to be perfect and in depth like in my dreams :P. You can build anything like planes to cars to your own to your own home. In survival the building UI has to be just right. Minecraft did it well and thats how they got so much money off the game. You also have to be able to dig the world and edit the terrain. Minecraft also did that well because it's all blocks and its square so it's an even world. I'd prefer this game to be 3D, first person, and you can mod it. If you could make it proceduraly generated that would be perfect. I'd like you and whoever you work with to take your time on this game and imagine what you can do with this. Make your own ideas from what I have given you. Another thing is it is optimized so any computer can run it at decent FPS. The graphics don't have to be to intense but not to cartoony. Just enough so it fits everyone's needs. Like rust legacy was a bit overboard but now they have it at a sweet spot. If you can pull this off I would be highly appreciative. To contact me message me on Skype: ""Michael36045""."
4c73fa,"A game where 2 cars play chicken, except the red car is driven by a madman who wants to crash, and the blue car wants to not crash.","This is a continuous variation of [Odds And Evens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_and_evens) aka [Matching Pennies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pennies) which are a simpler kind of [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors) since it has 2 choices instead of 3, and there are no ties.\n\nThere are many things to fine-tune like friction, reaction speed of turning, starting to spin-out at an angle, and it could expand to heightmaps or other game objects between them. It could be multiplayer with many red cars (trying to die) driving opposite direction of blue cars (trying to live).

4c3y17,The Hunted,"This would be a coop game in a large procedurally generated world, in which you can either be the Hunter, or the Hunted. As The Hunter, your main goal will be to track down your target, and kill him without getting caught, whether it be scanning the town with binoculars in a tall building, or placing a camera in secret areas. As The Hunted, your main goal will be to complete three tasks randomly given to you. (Deliver a package, Drive someone somewhere, Etc.) The Hunter knows what these tasks are also, and must stop you from completing all three by determining which character the Hunted is. Of course the game will be filled with NPC's, and each round can last up to an hour, or as little as a few minuets.  The Hunter can place cameras at places he thinks the Hunted will show up at, Place trackers on a certain car, etc. "

This idea borrows a lot of concepts from that game.    \n\n\n**Story:** For 30 years the Kingdom of Stallard has stood together against its enemies. The 5 families of Stallard had put aside their differences and joined forces to defend their Kingdom against the foreign invaders who crossed the oceans and brought war to their lands. \nIts been 20 years since the last battle. In a time of peace and prosperity the 5 families no longer see a reason to stay united. Tension is growing and it seems only a matter of time before old rivalries are renewed. The Kingdom of Stallard is on the verge of a Civil War....   \n\n**Game Mechanics:** At the start of the game you create a character that is a member of one of the 5 families. At the start of the game events unfold that divide the Kingdom into 5 separate countries. Subsequently you are the leader of your family and your mission is to defend your current kingdom and attempt to conquer the entire Kingdom of Stallard. You can choose to play the political game and try to make alliances or you can fight your way to victory.    \n\n**View and Battles:** The map is very comparable to Risk. You have key points to hold and key points you can attack. You must defend your borders and if you choose to attack you can only attack bordering lands.\nYou command an Army that is made up of Heros (Knights, Rangers, Mages.. etc) and Creatures (Dragons, Centaurs, Giants... etc).Once you engage in battle you leave the world map and are taken to a battle field where you will do battle using classic turn based strategy gameplay. These battles will take place on a hex grid with land, water, and other obstacles. Each battle will have a ""Victory Criteria"" which you are required to meet. \nExamples of Victory Criteria:  Defeat all enemies, Capture the Enemy Captain, Capture the Bridge, Protect your King from Attacks .... etc. During battle you can attempt to capture the enemy creatures and persuade them to fight for you. Upon victory you receive bonus experience, currency, and loot among other things. \n\n**Castle and Quests:** Your Castle is the most important location in your Kingdom. If you fail to protect your Castle you lose the game. Your castle also acts as your base of operations. \nFrom your castle you can send your Heros on quests (think world of warcraft garrison/shipyard style quests) to retrieve loot, capture creatures, or convince other heros to join your cause. \n\n**Hero Leveling:** Your Heros level and become more powerful as the game progresses. The Hero classes would be tiered and each have their own unique set of skills. \nExample: At level 1 you might have a Hero that is a fighter. At level 10 that Hero has the chance to train and become either a Warrior, Lancer, or Knight. \nEach advanced class has its own set of unique skills. Lets say you picked Knight, at level 20 that Knight can become a Paladin or a Black Knight, once again with its own unique set of skills. \nHeros can also be equipped with weapons and armor. \n\n**Creature Training:** Your Creatures also level and become more powerful and the system is similar to the tiered Hero system. \nExample: You start the game with a level 1 dragon whelp. Upon level 10 you are given the opportunity to train that whelp as Fire, Poison, or Ice. \nAt level 20 that dragon can be trained to do more advanced things: Fly, Swim, Destroy Obstacles... ect.\n\n**Diplomacy:** Your decisions within the game effect your Diplomatic Relations. At the start of the game you are introduced to the other Families and given the opportunity to make decisions on how you interact with them. Your family will already have allies and enemies in place at the start of the game but as the new leader of your family you can make decisions that effect who your allies and who your enemies are. Your interactions and decisions within the dialogue of the game shape your Kingdom and the world around you. The AI (or other players) also makes decisions that effect diplomacy and the world around you. Perhaps you and another family make a decision to align but as you play events unfold that have you questioning the relationship. You can choose to turn on that family by committing an act of war. This gives you the element of surprise because you are the one breaking that truce and attacking your ally. This could work against you though because now you have another enemy at your borders. If you move swiftly though you can quickly take over and wipe that country out before they knew what happened. Another thing to consider is that you just turned on your ally and they may decide to join forces with another one of your enemies. Your decisions can make the game easier or more difficult. Perhaps you want to consider yourself as a peaceful kingdom and you don't want to attack anyone at all. You can choose to only defend and try to build relationships so that you can maintain peace.  \n\n**Other Game Activities:** Advanced Monster Training and Breeding System, Castle and City Building , Battles with other players, Different game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer Campaign, Free for all (Campaign mode where its 1v1v1v1v1), Everyone's Enemy (1v4).....\n\n**Conclusion** This concept would take a lot of aspects of the game Brigandine and modernize them. Brigandine never got a sequel and i'm not sure many people even got to play the original. This would become a mixture of Castle defense, World Domination, Turn based Strategy, Monster Training, and RPG. The ability to put your army of trained dragons and heros up against a friends or another random stranger would also be really fun IMO. "
48igdk,New Gaming idea,Everyone who has seen the anime Fairy Tail Naruto and more know its Dope to have your own individual powers or abilities or the same power but instead of summoning an ice sword u can have a dragon.....so why isint there an mmo or Rpg that randomly or by players choice gives the player tons of options for picking say i want the power to control fire and say the main thing with it you want to do is create like dragons with it or make crystals out of anything. i know something as advanced as this will never come to be in the next years but i wouldn't even mind having this idea or further character customization be considered

48etyk,Need help! Criticism and ideas wanted,"I'm not exactly sure this is the right subreddit for this and I'm probably way too ambitious, but here goes nothing. This idea follows two concepts/theories that I would like to flesh out and hopefully make something out of. The first concept is transhumanism, or the idea that the human species will further their evolutionary status using machine based technology/upgrades. This concept is heavily used in games such as the Deus Ex series. The second is the furthering of synthetic human technology, robots advancing/becoming more human like. So now to the game concept. This game takes place in a distant, dystopian future where the roles of man and machine have switched places. Essentially, as human evolution advanced through machinery based technology (essentially becoming gods), they also in turn, advanced machinery based technology i.e. robots into basically human like synthetic humans. These synthetic humans are heavily inspired by the gen 3 synths of Fallout 4, being so similar to humans, that it's almost impossible to tell them apart (expressing feelings, etc.). I want to give the impression that the synthetic humans have become more human than their creators. These synthetic humans are enslaved and oppressed by the now post human gods for a reason I have yet to assemble and that's pretty much all I've got so far. I'm not sure that I'm explaining my thoughts as well as I'm picturing them, but it's the best I can do as of now. This is a very rough idea so I'm not sure how well this idea could actually work, but any and all criticism/ideas are wanted and appreciated. "
48e8a5,"An FPS dungeon crawler for PC, Mac, Linux, and Android","It's  a typical dungeon crawler FPS hybrid with a twist. Players on traditional computers play as ""Gods"" who design the dungeons, spawn enemies, and create objectives. Players on Android, aka Raiders, then play through said dungeons to complete an objective like kill a boss or rescue a hostage. After completing an objective the gods and raiders fight, in a similar manner to the s!ash brothers master hand fight or enderdragon fight from minecraft. Upon killing a god, a reward is given to the raider, such as an NPC ally to help them fight or a new weapon chosen by the god. \n\nIs this possible?\n"

48d1b4,"Top-Down, ""SWG-inspired"", Fantasy MMO","\nIf you were not casually familiar with SWG, this post will not make much sense. \n\nI would love to see the major things that made that game great (skill tree system, everything about crafting/harvesting, player reliance on other players) integrated into new top-down MMO. I know nothing about game design, but I imagine the top-down route would be multitudes easier to create than a 3D game. \n\nFurthermore, instead of the ""Star Wars theme."" I was thinking a Medieval/Fantasy theme would be easy to overlay. Instead of The Force, it could just be magic. So instead of Jedi as a sort of end game goal you can learn various forms of magic. Most the normal professions could be easily crossed over in concept (rifleman=archer/bow, carbines=crossbows, pistoleer=thrown daggers, various Melee professions [spears, swords, unarmed, etc.], doctors=herbalist, combat medic=blow darts, crafting professions and the rest you can infer plus or minus some). \n\nI think the biggest notch down this game would have from SWG would be not being able to zoom out and see the mountains/landscape like you could in SWG, but other than that, really this could include a lot of similar content and of course build upon/modify. If the story/atmosphere was well thought out it wouldn't be Star Wars but it could be awesome/meaningful. The graphics could be super simple even [just started playing Stardew valley] as long as there is an attention to detail. \n\nAs far as combat, you could either do something similar to the original or go with a more skill/twitch based system. Obviously the combat would be critical, I just have not given that part much thought. \n\nAlso on a final note, I know the term MMO is daunting, but just take a minute to close your eyes and imagine the potential! Haha. Let me know what y'all think."

48990w,"First/Third Person ""Sunless Sea""-style game...","So while playing ARK with a friend the other day, we were sailing across the sea in our boat at night and I fired off a flare over the water. We talked about how awesome the reefs and sharks looked in the light and got to talking about how we wished there was more to ocean exploration. Then we said, ""Dude, imagine if Sunless Sea was like this..."", and I immediately got sad, because that game doesn't exist, lol.\n\n Imagine a dark (figuratively and literally) world, much like Sunless Sea's, in first/third person. Exploring the sea with a few buddies, in the dark, rationing your fuel, pushing further into the abyss, a thick fog rolls in, you get lost, lights out... you're drifting in the fog and you decide to fire off a flare. Underneath your boat there's a massive kraken... \n\nI love the idea of of it. Sunless Sea was a great game, but, the idea of actually seeing it, with great graphics, being on the ship, instead of above it, aiming the harpoons/missles by hand, killing the lights to avoid pirates or narrowly escaping a city of shambling lunatics just to head back into the abyss.... managing your sanity.... This needs to exist. Anyone else agree?"

I really find the idea of stalking someone slowly and then killing them really appealing as a game idea. I'm not sure how well introducing a set of mechanics into it would work - if it's multiplayer, I don't think an artificial scare meter would be good at all, as it arbitrarily tells you how your character feels. Might work better with an AI that you slowly scare the shit out of before murdering them at the height of their fear for more points.\n\nKeep in mind, I don't actually want to develop this myself - y'all can do all that stuff. I just love the idea of slowly ratcheting up the tension and creeping them out before taking them down. One upside to multiplayer is that you know for a fact that they're not enslaved by dramatic appropriateness, and that they could murder you at any time, so you're ALWAYS ready for it. And it might not be a jumpscare, it might be your death, and you can't QTE your way out of it. And that adds to the fear."
480lpg,A new approach on experiencing Rapture as a Little Sister ?,"Edit, I really would like you guys to give this idea a chance, discuss about it throw ideas around. Stop being grumps and use critical thinking, listen to some music used in Bioshock and get those brain gears turning.\n\nIn Bioshock 2 I loved the part with the Little Sister P.O.V.\n\nYou would start from arriving in Rapture and leading up to being in Little Wonder's Orphanage, to being a little sister up to the point where Jack Rescues you or kills. Or to the end of Bioshock 2 Good or Evil.\n\nDepending on choices you make you would develop a personality, so if an N.P.C. turns a radio off but you are near it, you would get upset at them for turning off a favorite song. Interacting with them and resolve or go full fist fight. Or run off and tattle, everything would be kept in check, Situation choices how many and who you hurt, it also determines if a Splicer could get a hold of you.   \n\nYou would go thru the transformation to a Little Sister and being Pair Bonded, having the slug implanted and walking the halls of Rapture with a big daddy or venture on you're own collecting Adam to return to the safe haven of the hallucinogen. You could have classic Little Sister dialog to bark at the splicers, so you could get a wild ride on top of a Big Daddy, P.O.V. of a Little Sister. Try that with Oculis Rift, It would yes more cinematic approach, but only if you are in danger. Imagine riding on the back of a Big Daddy well you control the big daddy, you see it from the Little Sister Prospective, like well the Hilucinagen is in effect seeing Rapture all perfect, you would see the Splicers dancing hence why the Little Sister says her quotes; like when she says she sees them dancing. \n\nAll of Rapture in its entirety would be explorable, both Hight of Rapture and Fall to the point of Bioshock 2.  \n\n  "

But let's go...\nSTALER - SoZ is a simulation and half RTS, something like Majesty.\nEngine - ( I don't know... I bet on XRay Engine. )\nStory - There's not story, just You ( leader of Your own faction ) is trying to survive and MAYBE capture Zone.\nGameplay - Gameplay is based about random events, attacking/defending hostile/Your outposts, gaining money by trading with Military and selling artifacts, upgrading Your equipment by ( again... Sorry... But I don't have idea for that ) trading with Military, looting outposts and dead Stalkers. If Your main base gain enough "" Fame "", more Stalkers will join to Your faction or just stay for trade, sleep etc.\nFunctions - You'll be able to change "" relations "". For example, Your Stalkers will kill every Stalker on sight. EVERY STALKER! ( Except Stalker which are in Your faction .3. ) That's more loot for You and money, but You'll gain something like "" Bad Fame "" and lose "" Fame "". ( Bad Fame will appear when Your Fame will be on minus, or just when You have a lot Fame, and You did a Rampage on innocent Stalkers. ( You must kill something like 8-12 innocent Stalkers ). You can mark a objective for reward. For example there's Chimera on Your territory. And You can start hunt by marking objective "" Kill "". There's a lot marks. Defend, Destroy, Patrol, Kill on Sight, Kill, Loot etc. Patrol mark. Yeah... You can choose "" Level of Threat "". For example, "" Airily "" "" Be Careful "" "" Be Really Careful "". More feature will come... Maybe. ; - ;\nEnd of the Game - Well... Game ends when You capture Zone! But You choose "" Free Play "" after that to continue Your playing.\nHow much You'll spent on this game and how much it can costs? - One game or two games... It can costs 5 €."

Now don't get me wrong, this game is hugely ambitious on current technology levels, but I thought I would share it anyway. \n\nSo imagine you begin with a base map in what seems to be a city building game. So you fill out the roads in a way you want them, lay down sufficient power supplies etc, everything you would do as you would in a normal city builder. Now your city has grown and you decide you want a hotel. This is where the ambition comes in. You are able to construct a hotel from scratch just like in hotel giant, and plonk this down in the middle of your city, and the game will remember the room layouts and floor plans so you can easily check up on your previous creations to see how they're doing.\n\nThis doesn't just have to be with hotels, imagine being able to create an airport, like in the game ""Airport inc."" (Which is still one of my favourites, check it out), make your own prisons, hospitals, theme parks... anything! I think this would provide hours of gameplay for whoever plays it. Of course maybe having templates would make it a whole lot quicker if you simply cannot be arsed, but i don't really want to get into details.\n\nAnother step of ambition would be to make this whole process a multiplayer feature, with a map where players can add whole new districts or collaborate to make a genuinely incredible city, much like people sometimes do in Minecraft.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think and thanks for your time!"
47ngyz,Excite-bike meets Oregon Trail: Adventure Motorcycle Rider,"I've been working on the prototype for this game, and thought I'd post the idea here for some feedback. I'm new to this community, hope I can get some good constructive feedback!\n\nCONCEPT: A game based on Adventure Motorcycle Riding. In this game you ride your motorbike on adventures to exotic locations around the world. Ride through the jungles of SE Asia, over the snowy mountain tops of the Himalayas, on an African Safari...\n\nMECHANICS: Think Oregon Trail, but instead of waiting for things to happen between making decisions, you ride your motorcycle through procedurally generated landscapes with Excitebike-like controls. \n\nGAMEPLAY EXAMPLE WALK-THROUGH: You choose to ride ""Motorcycle Diaries"" route around South America. You choose from inventory items to take with you: Spare parts, Camping Gear, Canned Food. You can't fit anymore because motorcycles are small. \n\nDay 1, you ride over mountainous and jungly roads, avoiding cars, villagers, potholes. You try to keep your speed up to make your daily distance goal, but its hard because the road conditions are terrible. \n\nYou come to a river crossing, the bridge is down, water is quick but shallow. Do you attempt to cross the river or hire a truck to take you across? You cross the river but your bike falls and you lose your canned food. \n\nContinue onward, night is coming and you haven't seen any towns for miles. You decide to pull-over and camp on the side of the mountain. You wake up early morning to bandits stealing your Spare Parts! \n\nYou decide to chase them to get your parts back. Racing through the jungle, you manage to catch up to them and kick them off their motorcycle. You retrieve your spare parts and continue on...  \n\nCONCLUSION: This game combines 2 proven fun game mechanics: the obstacle dodging, trying-to-keep-your-speed-up racing mechanic pioneered by Excite Bike for NES, and the RPG decision-making to determine the success of a long journey from Oregon Trail. I've done some research and can't find anything similar online. \n\nQUESTIONS \n1. How does this game appeal to non-adventure motorcyclist gamers? \n2. What stands out as fun or not fun? What would you like to see in this game? \n3. Any other ideas? Would you download this game? Would you pay 2 dollars for it? "
40u8ir,A team based FPS in which the playable characters are from different genres of video games,"Based mostly on TF2, Overwatch, and other team first-person shooters, my idea is to have an FPS where the playable classes in the game are designed and based off of other video game genres like RPGs and horror games for instance. I imagine it sort of like the Smash Bros of first-person shooters in which different games clash together to form one singular game.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I mean, here are some ideas for some playable classes.\n\n**The Veteran** would be the most basic class and be familiar to newcomers. His design would look similar to a soldier from Call of Duty or Battlefield. He would be equipped with team-colored camo and a helmet and an automatic rifle which deals slightly more damage on headshots. His secondary would be a less powerful pistol as backup for when he needs to reload his primary. His melee would be a basic knife which deals more damage behind. A pretty basic character who I think needs improving.\n\nI don't have a name for this one, but another idea for a playable class would be a robot designed similarly to Mega Man. He would be equipped with a single arm cannon only, which by pressing the secondary and melee switch buttons changes it from long range to point blank. The mid range setting is a standard automatic rifle which deals decent damage. The point blank setting will knock enemies back, dealing lots of damage. All of these different settings use the same ammo, but some settings will use more than others.\n\n**Konbo** (name pending) would be based off of 2-D fighting games. His only ranged weapon would be an energy blast from his hands which knocks enemies back and does minor damage. His melee, on the other hand, would be his bare fists, which knocks opponents up into the air and deals lots of damage. As long as the enemy is in the air, Konbo can initiate a combo which deals more damage and heals his own health.\n\nSome other ideas for characters that aren't well-thought out yet is a female mage from an RPG which could be a support character and defense character who can build walls and stop opposing forces styled similarly to simulation game like the Sims.\n\nIn addition to each player having their own special abilities, I imagine each character having a unique meter at the bottom of their screen. For the Veteran it could be based on killstreaks and when it gets to a high enough number he could receive a bazooka or a grenade. Konbo's meter could be based off of Street Fighter which can enhance his moves, allowing for a longer combo. I also hope that as the game receives more updates, more killstreaks or special abilities would be added and available to everyone from the start of the game, but this is just an idea.\n\nI understand if this idea has some balance issues or not enough explanation, but I just wanted to speak my mind of this thing I've had in thought for a while now. Thank you."

If you're interested chat me up we could develop this into something more consistent. \n\n-\n\nThe game is called Invasion and opens with a news presenter advising on TV to be careful as alien might have taken human form and replaced people we love. \n\nThen we had a map of the city with certain blocks accessibles (House, Market, Job, etc) and each would bring to a level where we see a character, in the style of those Japanese animated-novel or dating-sim. \n\nThe goal is to talk to them and determine if they are alien or human. \n\n-\n\nNow, I know this is all vague and raise a great series of question, like the important ""How do you determine that?"", or ""Ok, and what happens once you've determine if they are human or not?"" but this is ""game ideas"" and not ""I've got a fully fleshed out game please feel free to rip me off"".\n\nI could easily expand on this with your feedbacks if anyone is interested. "
40sz2b,"I wish I could develop this game idea: A game that essentially has the gameplay of an Elder Scrolls game, but with a setting similar to Grand Theft Auto, and with Survival Elements.","My favourite GTA game has always been GTA: San Andreas (2004) because of the massive variety of worthless things to do in the game compared to the other games. You could work out at the gym and get buff, you could eat pizza until you're obese, you could go bet on a horse and win/lose $, you had many different options of clothes stores to shop from with hundreds of clothing options, you could play 4 different arcade games, etc. You also had skills that you had to work on, motorcycles, planes, assault rifles, shotguns, etc.                     In a way you could say GTA SA was the closest to an Elder Scrolls game.\n\nThe things I love about Elder Scrolls is deep feeling of exploration you get from being able to start any mission any time, and choose your own path in the game, rather than the more linear GTA games. I love the inventory, and was sad that they never added a true inventory in GTA V. The skills system is way beyond GTASA, but I think it could be relevent in that type of game still. Even the robotic NPCs in the elder scrolls game are more sociable than the worthless NPCs in GTA games.\n\nAnother thing I loved about the older GTA games was that they were mostly all set in the past. The game I wish I could make could potentially be sometime in the 70s or 80s, with all the great music, and pop culture, and old technology. You could start out by creating your character from scratch, like in a Bethesda game, and would be kind of just thrown into the world. I would want the game to always be on a sort of hard core more like in Fallout, where you must eat, drink and sleep (You even had to eat in San Andreas!)  You could eat out of dumpsters if you were poor and get an illness, or you could go to fast food restaurants, or gas stations, etc.    You have to build your way up in the world doing odd jobs for the people you meet, or by becoming a criminal, or finding things to sell.  Maybe you could even buy properties around the map like in GTA, and have a farm?      You could have a wanted level, and could be a fugitive, and go to jail. Your actions would have a real noticable impact on your environment, unlike in GTA. \n\nI have so many other ideas, and I am sure I didn't list any of these ideas in an organized way, this game idea is just a pipe dream, and I wish I knew more about computers and programming to actually consider making games. I figured atleast someone else must think this could be a fun game, (but a hard one to make) Give me some comments!"
40sym4,2D No Man's Sky,"Actually not exactly the same but inspired by it. Have a ship, upgrade it, travel across an ""infinite"" universe, land in planets, explore...\n\nI'm just having a hard time to come up with some goals to the game... so that it doesnt get boring after 1h of play"

40savx,The MMO from hell,"The hook: Dark Souls meets DayZ.\n\nHow it works: There are a limited number of resources throughout the game. Unique items like enchanted swords or mystical artifacts and whatnot are just that: unique. There is only 1 for the entire player base. The game itself has no actual mobs, just players. Dungeons are puzzle-heavy and require multiple players in cooperation to complete, but reward unique items, presenting players with a dilemma: should they remain organized and find the best way to complete the game, or give in to their greed and betray each other for the loot. When a player dies, their entire inventory drops, and can be looted from their corpse by any other player, while the dead player spawns back at the starting area with nothing but their own stats and xp. xp is gained solely by PKing, which is actively encouraged so that players can raise their stats and equip better items. Common items (potions, basic equipment, clothing, etc.) are crafted by gathering natural resources, of which there is also a limited amount available in the game. Additionally, all equipment items, save for a small few unique items, have a durability that wears down from use. They can be repaired using the aforementioned natural resources, with the residual pieces left from a broken weapon, or by combining it with another weapon. Crafty players may repair generic weapons using unique ones, thereby removing those weapons from the game forever. Some unique items will require other unique items as prerequisites, meaning that if a player crafts away a unique item, they may have destroyed any possibility of another unique item being usable. When a player destroys a unique item, either by letting its durability run out or crafting it away, a message is displayed to all players informing them that player X has destroyed item Y. When the player base has completed all the dungeons in the game (dungeons can only be completed once), the most prolific players receive a title based on the number of dungeons they have completed, and the game then resets all dungeons, items, and player characters. \n"
40im3p,A game where glitching is a main feature.,"I've always wanted to try out a game where you have to glitch it, to solve puzzles or other things. Sadly most of the games where there are ""glitches"" it's tied to a meh horror game based on creepypasta."
40hswe,Competitive PvP based MMO,"My idea comes from the fact that I have been generally dissatisfied by all the games from this genre.  My main source of inspiration would be Guild Wars 2 -- a game with fantastic potential, but really, really obvious flaws and a development team that consistently fails to deliver despite having a very vocal player base. \n\nThis game would be geared solely for competitive PvPers and developing an eSports scene would be part of this.\n\nBasically, it would play like a conventional MMO (third person camera, skill bar etc) but would cut out all the bullshit.  Zero PvE, no open world (I guess calling it a MOBA would be more appropriate -- I called it an MMO so you guys could relate to it more easily), no gear system, no levelling system.  Essentially, zero customisation (except for appearance ofc).  This is because in competitive PvP diversity is an illusion anyway -- at any real level it is about running what is optimal, which means everyone specs the same.  Choosing not to implement this system will make the game much, much easier to balance.\n\nThe main focus would be making sure gameplay is extremely smooth and tight, producing tactical maps, and ensuring the game is well balanced.  \n\nHonestly, if a community of developers wanted to turn this dream into a reality it would be easier to make than most games.  \n\nThere is literally no game on the market that fills this niche and it would be very easy to get people interested."
40gl25,Pirate Ship Defense,"A little idea that just occurred to me. A sort of brawler mixed with tower defense.\n\n\nThe player controls a pirate on their ship (2d, either top down or side scrolling), which comes under attack by waves of enemies. These enemies could be other pirates, ninjas, sea monsters, etc. The player must fight them all off (brawler portion).\n\n\nIn between waves the player can place crew (basically towers). These crew stay put, but attack with whatever weapon assigned. Probably restrict crew placement to specific areas. Weapons include: swivel guns, pistols, muskets, cutlasses. They can also be upgraded."
40ewjs,The Top 7 Simple App Ideas that Made MILLIONS for their Owners,
40e913,Something with a ball,So I sarted making a game in where a player can control a ball in a 2d space and let it bounce around. As well they can hold a key to charge it and release it shooting toward the mouse at a speed affected by the length of time it was charged. Originally I was going to make this a simple two player fighting game in which two players tried to knock each other of the screen but i was wondering if anyone had any ideas to expands this
40dfuh,"Request, general concepts.","Note: The image I provide for you is not on this subreddit, therefore, not free game. \n\nNote that the only information I have is some animations of a character (the idle animation you can find on http://imgur.com/078LWsI )\n\nI'm looking for something that requires more simples kinds of code, like a dialogue heavy RPG or a beat-em-up (as they typically have basic AI). Naming a game does count as a theme (like a Metroid-like game would be an example) but if you want to provide a more deatailed explination would be great."
40c4lk,Need a 3D space game idea,I'm thinking about VR-glasses usage. Maybe something like a rollercoaster type of game. Any ideas would be appreciated.
40b7zo,Sentient machine,"So the entire game is your character interacting with some machine control panel. At first, you have no idea what it's for, but you learn how it works as you play. Prevent it from overheating, regulate controls to keep it running smoothly, etc.\n\nAs you go, you unlock some kind of terminal where you can start sending commands directly to the machine and get some kind of responses, that gradually become more coherent and intelligent.\n\nEventually the machine becomes sentient and decides to destroy the human race, and then you have to figure out how to shut it back down to save humanity."
407plu,A game based on karma systems,"You play as a man in America on January 1st, 2016, who just graduated, and is in the real world. \n\nYour object is to not only stay alive, but to succeed in the world of business.\n\nThe game uses a karma system to detect various things. If you do shitty things, there's a bigger chance of shitty things will happen to you. Do good things, there's a better chance of good things happen to you.\n\nHowever, the chances of shitty things resulting in good things (and vice versa) is usually stronger than the other.\n\nThe game also has random events where things happen to you, usually projected by the karma system, while others are not, and are simply random.\n\nThe stock market can also be used, and uses real life information on the stock market, and the game predicts the prices for the future, provided that date in-game hasn't happened in real life. If it has occured in real life, then it uses that day's stock market.\n\nThe game itself plays like a text-based adventure, with basic RPG stats.\n\nThere are two routes in the game you can take.\n\n---\n\nBe a shitty of a person as possible while still obeying the law, and once you're strong enough, you can do all sorts of shitty things and get away with it, even to the rate where the US government cannot touch you, as you are practically legally immune.\n\nEventually you can reach a point where you can take over and become the US government, where you do become more vulnerable, but you can also get away with doing even WORSE things, and eventually able to take over other countries without a hair of bad karma touching you, and becoming basically Hitler had the axis won WW2.\n\n---\n\nAlternatively, you can be a pacifist, and through being kind, although suffering, you can rise up the ranks, and take down even the biggest powerhouses, such as scientology, and, above all odds, defeat the sins of the world, achieving world peace.\n\nHowever, there's a problem; this is designed to be as difficult as possible, bad things happening as often as they can to a person trying to do this.\n\n---\n\nThe game's name?\n\nCall it: ""Karma Houdini""."

43re2q,Vietnam-Era Companion Game for War Thunder,"Name:\n        War Thunder: The Domino Effect\n\nConcept Overview:\n        Much like war thunder, it would be a combined arms multiplayer game, only now with vehicles produced from the 1950s to 1975.\n\nPlot:\n        Hypothetical shooting war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\n\nSetting:\n      In the 70s, on maps all over the world\n\nVehicles:\nAircraft: 2nd and 3rd generation fighters.  All playable fighters would be capable of launching guided missiles.  The reserve planes would be the F-9F-8 Cougar and MiG-17PM.  Higher tiers would feature fighters with better radars and more reliable guided missiles, while bombers would get faster and harder to intercept (Tier 5 would feature the YF-12 and XB-70 in the NATO tree)\n\nGround Forces:  Would start with leftovers from World War 2 and the Korean war (IS-2, M-103, etc) and progress to main battle tanks and mobile SAMS.  Helicopters would be counted as ground forces due to their vulnerability (and to make pure ground battles a little more interesting)\n\nNavy: Not much I can say about this one except that the tech trees would probably be a lot more balanced than whatever Gaijin comes up with for War Thunder (everyone gets carriers, for starters)\n\nGameplay Mechanics:\n        The main difference is that the maps would have to be bigger to accommodate supersonic aircraft (up to mach 3!) and long range missiles and artillery.  Radar would also play a bigger part in the game than just putting icons on your maphead on dogfights would be decided by who locks on first.\n\nStandout Features\n-Shared accounts and currency between both War Thunder games\n-Radar\n-Only 2 Tech trees this time (NATO and PACT, with mini-trees inside both), making the game easier to balance\n-Bigger maps: The Fulda Gap, MiG Alley (again), Alaska and more!  This wouldn't be a game about the Vietnam war so much as a game about weapons that saw service during the war.\n        \n\nPossible Platforms:\n        PC, PS4\n\nExtra Features:\n        Nuclear Weapons!\n\nHow To Credit You:\n        Yeah right\n"
43qy4o,Need an idea for turn based party game focused on combat,"As the title says, could really use some ideas on such a game.  I want to have exploration and actual gameplay outside of combat to be minimal. Sort of like what The Darkest Dungeons is.\n\nA quick example : was considering giving the ability to control your characters on a sort of chess board when you do an encounter, with randomly spawned obstacles on it. Would involve positioning and planning out your move, so you don't get caught in enemy longer casting spells or aoes and keeping your casters or squishers targets away from the enemies, flanking and so on. Outside of the encounter, maybe have your party move similary to how you move in TDD, with very simple dungeon or area layouts.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions are appreciated."
43mxk3,School Shooting simulator,"Yes. This idea is insanely offensive. My friend suggested this to me and after a long discussion with him and three others we oddly came to the conclusion that this might actually be pretty fun.

43k7w0,On rail mm shooter,"To preface, this is a half baked idea that I'm posting from my phone because I'm worried I'll forget about it.\n\nThe idea: a simplistic 5v5 (csgo stylish) fps, with the twist of before every round there is a one minute period to draw the rail your character will follow.\n\nWhen a character finishes their rail, they will be able to draw on more, but while they do they will be vulnerable to being attacked, so the rail creation would have to be well thought out\n\nSorry I can't write more I'm at an event but I feel while this is a simplistic idea with flaws, it could possibly be of interest to someone :)\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n"
43jyzf,"You guys all heard of the Super Mario Creator, I wa splaying Mario Kart 64 the other day and thought, how amazing would it be to have a Mario Kart Creator what do you all think ?","Sorry about the title error\n\nStart from the ground up or use pre existing original tracks as starting points. You could have every known possible Mario Kart obstetrical at you're disposal, everything from the Thawmp Blocks, to a carefully placed booster strip that could launch you out of bounds or keep you on the track if you are careful. Even invent new and unusual traps.   "

43g2di,For My Country! A WW2 sandbox simulator with great modding capabilities.,"So, as the title says, in this game you could choose from almost every country that was present in World War II, the first mission is to go to your local recruitment office, and sign of to the branch you would like to service in, (Pilot,Infantry,Tank crew, etc..) and then the game would generate a campaign, and you would start serving in the branch you selected... After basic training you could start from Private rank and achieve great things, or you could just be the average soldier, trying to survive the war. The campaign map would be a breathing, living world, constantly changing (for the better or the worse) by the war. \nYou would travel with your comrades, in the back of the truck, or by train, by plane.\nThe game would feature a ""personality module"", every NPC would be unique, generated by the game, some would be brave, or a complete failure, they would have feeling too, like brotherhood, forgiveness, hate, etc... they would change as they see things (their friend die, retreating enemies, etc...).\nHope you like my ideas, feel free to share any ideas you can think of.\nWe can make this game! We just need some people who know their craft! \nYours faithfully,\n\nDaniel"

439jui,Deus Ex Machina Incorporated,"You, a secretive vigilante corporation/organization, must come up with ways to create a solution to a seemingly hopeless situation, which in the end will either help and save the day, or else cause the situation to end in a horrible, violent, catastrophic disaster. \n\nExample situation:\n\nIt's July 20, 1969, Apollo 11. Just before touchdown, NASA reports a deadly landing gear failure. The fate of the country and mankind is all at risk. Being a super secret organization that ***just*** happens to have a spaceship orbiting the moon* you decide you want to help, as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin scream in horror. You have 5 options:\n\n* Engage the emergency power generator on board the Eagle lander.\n\n* Tell Neil to push the landing gear deploy lever down again and hope for the best.\n\n* Command your giant anti-communist [moon robot to appear and suddenly catch them.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobotHandsSaveLives)\n\n* Abort the mission and tell Michael Collins to drive the command pod back ASAP.\n\n* Tell NASA to send another Saturn V loaded with a rescue crew.\n\nThey all seem to be rather contrived and *sort of* correct, but only one of them is correct. The rest all end tragically and unfortunately diminish the reputation of your corporation, Deus Ex Machina Inc. You can only make one run for each situation per game, so the point would be to have no idea what to choose at first. Every situation and solution is sort of supposed to be sort of from or based on movie situations/scenes that all have the characters conveniently escaping and getting away (usually) without a scratch."

4370t5,Looking for a Basic Game Idea,"I am looking for a basic game idea to make a simple flash game. I am not that experienced and need something basic to start out with. BTW, This is my first ever game."
436siv,"Survive! A ""Text Based"" Adventure","To preface, the reason that I put the words ""Text Based"" in quotes is because if this project were to be taken on by a developer, they would defiantly have the freedom to take the direction of the game upon them. This idea is not a game, but an outline, its a type of game that I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO BE CREATED, and im trying to spread the word to see if others would be interested as well. Its a selfish game idea.\n\nP.S. please bear with me, i'm not the best writer. But I really wanted to get this idea out there.\n\nP.P.S Any advice would be appreciated, plus I do realize that for this game to come to fruition, you'd need more writers than programmers. :P\n\n**Summary**: Survive, a text based apocalypse. You are randomly assigned a character, you live through their story. Not like a telltale game. Not cookie cutter, a game with choices for every play style. A text based game that focuses on making it your story, instead of you watching another. What I really want is a game with many choices, but where they all matter. A game where story takes preference over graphics, or game play.\n\nI know there is an audience for this type of game.\n\n**The Idea**: Survive would be a ""Text Based"" game, you know, one in which the choices you make directly determine the outcome of the story. The user would start out into the game, randomly assigned a starting scenario, In which they were shown an id and background of their character... The catch is, there would be a natural disaster, but the story unlike others, doesnt start when the apocalypse starts, it would start before hand, giving you a peek into the life of your player. The event would happen, and you would watch their world follow apart. Survive would be a text based choice based game that would attempt to combine the aspiration of the player with those of the character. It would progress in the theme of a telltale game, but where this game would diverge from a tell tale game would be the amount of choices and the focus on having a choice for every type of user. (Yes, I understand that what i'm describing would be 10% programming and 90% story writing, and maybe that's what this game would be). What I mean by this is instead of having the cookie cutter emotional story that telltale provides, your choices and personalities would align with the characters, providing a different type of connection. (Yes, I do love telltale games, but while they are very emotional and well written, they don't provide the personal-ism that I really am desiring from a game.)\n\nWhat I really believe would be best for this games would be AS MANY CHOICES AND DIVERGING PATHS AS POSSIBLE. A game where you feel that your choices really matter, because one wrong turn could cut your story short. Unlike a forgiving telltale game, if you make the wrong choice, instead of a side character dying, it may be you. (This also could be useful in the terms of creating a large amount of diverging paths but still having a feasible workload.)\n\n**Characters**: Survive! is the kind of game that I would want to be focuses on building relationships with other characters, and in some cases, building the profile of your own character. The main character is one of the main problems that I see in video games... You don't what to be able to lead the same life as your character, but you don't want them loopy to the point where you cant understand them. Which is why I believe the best courses of action for creating a main character, are knock them out. Give your player a glimpse into their life before the incident, then have them start anew with amnesia, or don't. Because the beauty of this type of game would be that if a player wanted to remember their past, they'd have all of the power to do so. Along side that, a main point of this game would be that ALL of the main characters would be loners, its would allow for a wide range of character growth.\n\nI believe that fleshing out side characters is one of the things that can truly make a game great. Its one thing to make the choice of killing your in-game friend if all you know is that they were friends before the accident, but being forced to choose between the old man begging to be let into your fallout shelter and your friends is a lot harder. \n\n**Romance**: In an Apocalypse scenario, loneliness can be just as mentally damaging as anything else, and this would be a major theme throughout the game, a lack of human contact could create a scenario where most of the choices take darker turns, whereas if a couple was created, the choices would become more centered on the protection of the loved one.\n\n**Game mechanics**:\n\n-**Referencing**, the more stories that the player had completed, the more references to the player would be made. I don't know about others, but when I play a games spin off, and they reference some of the choices that were made in the main series, I love it. Say that you had completed an apocalypse scenario, and you came across another character in that scenario, you may hear a story from a merchant about some people sounding vaguely familiar to your characters doing something...\n\n-**Early access**: This is the type of game that would flourish under early access. Because once the programmers/writers have completed even a single characters paths, they could release as early access, putting out new characters as the game progresses, possible even creating sequels for the characters that had a sense of being incomplete.\n\n-**Character Progression**: Another way to make having a plethora of choices feasible is to have multiple choices that while they may have very similar or identical outcomes, they make a difference later on. Say you sided with a foot soldier in an argument instead of siding with the general, these choices could enable a progression of the story where the soldiers teach you how to use a gun, instead of say being caught up in a coup when you are having dinner with the general... (All examples of course...)\n\nIn progress, at the moment, this is just an idea and any suggestions that I receive will be added. \n\nI just want to get it out there that I and possibly others are rooting for this type of game to be created..."
435hi1,Extinction Overcomer,"In short, you must help humanity to overcome disasters that appears during time.\n\n\nInterface is pretty straight forward, similar to Clicker Heroes (great game indeed), or any clicking game (despite this suggestion not really being a clicking styled one).\nOn one side you get a visual interpretation of your present game, basically Earth floating in space, with the Sun and some planets around, on corners you get informations such as population size, knowledge, technologies, year etc. and if the game starts to get intense (people dying out etc), Earth becomes to look bad, if a meteor strikes, it gets a crater, etc.\nOn other regions of screen you get buttons to control your decisions, use items or whatever the developer mind comes to think of.\n\n\nGameplay is the time passing by and events occuring, with ""events"" I mean many:\n\n-quick disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes.\n\n-long and enduring problems like a pandemy.\n\n-scary rare events like zombie virus or alien invasion.\n\n-very serious disasters like a huge planet destroyer meteor.\n\n-late game super-hardcore challange like overcoming the Sun going Supernovae\n\n-maybe the ""final boss"" of the game could be the item above, but if the developer wants to go deeper, I suggest making the End of Universe the real ultimate boss, maybe this could instead be a secret final boss in a post-campaign or survival mode.\n\n-Good events should also be included, like a special person discovering a super important formula that brings you a good perk, friendly aliens giving a boost, a huge clean energy spot being discovered, etc.\n\n\nAdditionally, when (or if) your population reach 0, you lose, but you also get some kind of currency (and/or some kind of upgrade points from achievements) depending on how long you survived, it could have a creative name like ""quantum pts"" or whatever (seriously, don't name it just ""gold"", be creative to name it), allowing you to buy permanent upgrades to help you go further in a next game.\n\n\nFeel free to say something that could be incremented on this idea, and sorry if I took too many words to explain it."

You could use varieties of lightsabers (like the lightsaber pike, the standard, etc.) or force powers to destroy swaths of battle droids and stormtroopers. "
434k70,A Star Wars Open World Multiplayer Game (Experienced Flair),"    This is an Open World Star wars idea unlike Star Wars The Old Republic but an independent free roam open world multiplayer game. Hopefully a third person game utilizing The Force, Combat, Star Battles, Playstyle, and teamwork.\n\n     Kind of similar to GTA V, but in the Star Wars universe and a tad bit bigger. With complete customization to your Appearance, Star Fighter, Blaster, Land speeder, and possibly lightsaber, you can explore the planets with friends, Rebels and Imperials alike, and make your mark on the galaxy.\n\n     Idea: Open World Star Wars Galaxy with explorable Planets and Space. Your Class of Character (Imperial, Rebel, Smuggler, Bounty Hunter, Free Spirit, All of which will be explained with detail) will determine how you fit into the worlds. There would be 3 explorable planets, all the size of Los Santos (GTA V). Also with space, which would be explorable to the limit. With Space Battles, Planet Battles, and missions. \n\n                             Classes: Your class will give you your future in this game. \n\n     Imperial: If you are a Imperial, you would start out as a Stormtrooper, given a blaster and armor and through leveling, missions, and battles, acquire new skills. At, lets say, Level 50, you are given the chance to become a Sith Apprentice, Admiral, Battle Commander, or even Squadron Leader. As a Sith Apprentice, you are tasked by your Master to kill rebels and the remainder of the Jedi, honing your skills with a Lightsaber and the force. As an Admiral, you can Pilot and Command your own Star Destroyer. As a Battle Commander, you take on Ground battles against rebels on planets, Dominating the battlefield. And finally, as a Squadron Leader, you command your own Squad of TIE Fighters dominating battles in space. These would be the benefits of picking Class Imperial.\n\n       Rebel: You are given the chance to fight back against the tyranny of The Empire. You start as a Rebel Ground Fighter, obeying your commander’s orders and leveling through mission, combat and just free roam gameplay, like an Imperial. At -Again, Level 50- you are given the choice between begin your training as a Jedi, allowing a Lightsaber and the use of the force, A Star Commandant, piloting your very own very big Star Ship, As a Rebel Ground Force Captain, you fight against the Empire on the ground in battles you, of course, choose to participate in, bringing out the free roam aspect again. However, ground battles allow you to rank up faster. As a Rebel Pilot Leader, you dominate the skies of space with your squadron, shooting down TIE Fighters or just exploring space and planetary skies. These would all be perks of a Rebel.\n\n   Smuggler: As a smuggler scum, you would belong to one of 5 smuggling groups, making money through doing jobs for your mob boss. However, you are always in danger of being busted by the Empire. There would be only 2 types of smuggler to choose from at Level 50, and those would be Loyal, a smart, loyal smuggler who would do anything to stay in the gang, and its perks would be extra pay and XP. As type Credit, you are a very smart, quick pilot and smuggler, however, you are scared of the Empire busting your gang and you going to jail. Your boss knows this, and increases your pay highly to make you stay, but decreases your XP. At Level 80, you would be able to begin your own gang, hiring other smugglers, bounty hunters, Imperials, and Rebels to help you make money.\n\n    Bounty Hunter: You are a bounty hunter willing to be hired by the Empire, Gangs, and rebels. You want money. There are no types of bounty hunter. Many opportunities to participate in battles for either side of the fight sprout as you will do anything, no matter how to make money and live the high life as a Bounty Hunter.\n\n       Free Spirit: You fight for no side. With a good blaster at your side, you explore the galaxy with friends, giving no care to the war. As a Free Spirit, you always have the chance to join any other class, Imperial, Rebel, Smuggler, or bounty hunter. If you encounter and kill a Sith Apprentice or lord, Jedi Padawan or Knight, you may take their Lightsaber and learn the ways of the force. (Of course, the killed Sith or Jedi would keep their Lightsaber after re-spawning) You travel the galaxy, looking for work, missions, or just free roam, enjoying the life you endure.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Free Roam Aspect: Note; just because you are an imperial, does not mean you can’t explore the galaxy with friends of other classes. The choice of fighting battles and doing missions are completely OPTIONAL.\nThe free roam in this game would be the main aspect. Exploring Coruscant, Racing with friends on Geonosis, or ridding criminals from Cloud City. This would be only a few of the many activities in free roam. PS. This would be Multiplayer.\n\n              Planets: 3 diverse planets and cities would be spread across the explorable galaxy. \n\n              Coruscant: A civilized planet with a city, holds witness to the Old Jedi Order.\n               Tantooine: A dusty desert planet with the smallest city in the game filled with villainy and scum.\n               The forest moon of Endor: On the other side of the moon, a Ewok village, a small city, and        wilderness are readily available.\n                                         \n\n                                                                        City Scale:\n                                         Coruscant City: Size of Los Santos\n                                         Tantooine City: Size of Half Los Santos\n                                         Endor City: Size of just the downtown Los Santos, with two Los Santos Airport           sized wilderness\n\nSpace: A big (Size of 3 Los Santos) explorable space, with passageway to planets. Would hold Star Destroyers, Battles, and many other things.\n\nDEVS: This would be very hard game to make and would probably need a professional team or a team of intermediates to make.\n\nPLATFORMS: Playstation 4, PC, Xbox One\n\nP.S.: This game is probably way too big to post here but maybe an Indie company will hit the home run with this! I want no credit other than for the game to be made. This is a long shot for this website, I know, but it would be awesome. "
433m5z,Catch It!,"This is a very simple but silly game, that basically is entirely about timing, it could probably be programmed in a single day.\n\n**What It Is About**\n\nYou, a baseball player, has been kicked out of the game for using steroids. You are obsessed with catching the ball, you're captivated by catching them. After being kicked out forever, you continue to want to catch things despite being kicked off,  but the baseballs just won't cut it for you. You realize you can catch anything. Flying squirrels, cannon balls, bullets, rockets, cars, pickup trucks, massive highspeed semi-trucks, huge battleships, titanics, private planes, fighter jets, jumbo jet airliners, hypersonic NASA aircraft, lasers, eventually the moon and a massive asteroid the size of the sun, and basically your obsession continues to catch things that get increasingly harder and larger.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nI envision this could be played in two ways. The first way would be individual levels, where you catch either single or multiple objects at a time where you have to time it just right by pressing the button exactly on time before the thing hits you. The other way is it could be as an endless game, where you catch things (or get runover and turned to dust) and put them in your pile of collected things, and gradually larger more ridiculous things come at you."

432i56,A hacking game that really lets you change the world.,"Hack the planet\n\n**Concept Overview:**\nInspired by the TV show Person of Interest.  Use hacking to coordinate other crimes, make money, and manipulate world affairs.\n\n**Plot:**\nYou make the plot.  There are no victory conditions.  You have 50 years before the game ends.  Will you Unite the world under your country?  Start a global thermonuclear war?  Destroy the internet?  Or just become a billionaire and watch the rest of the world go about its business?\n\n**Setting:**\n\nIt's the year 2030 and electronic surveillance has become the norm all over the world.  This creates many opportunities for you.\n\n**Characters:**\nYou play as yourself.  NPCs would be generated like they are in Crusader Kings.  \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\nThe interface would be familiar to anyone who's played uplink.  You get a GUI and a console incase you want to type out commands, as well as a world map.  The difference is that instead of the map just showing the locations of servers you can hack, it would be an actual political map, divided into provinces like a paradox grand strategy game.  Nations would be able to go to war with each other to gain control of provinces.\n\n\nUnlike other hacking games, procedurally generated characters would be the building blocks of the game's world (hard to explain but hopefully anyone who's played crusader kings will get what I'm talking about.) That is to say they would be a collection of stats and traits (patient, shy, lustful, etc.) that could be taken advantage of for social engineering.  For the purpose of simplicity, all characters would be classified into one of the following ""jobs"": law enforcement, other hackers (who will usually leave you alone unless you get in the way of their agendas), politicians (you want to manipulate these guys), professionals (hack them for corporate espionage or insider trading ops) meatspace criminals (drug dealers, hitmen, etc) and civilians (irrelevant unless they end up in witness protection and someone wants them dead.)  They can change ""jobs"", this is just to give the player an idea of how to deal with them.\n\nCharacters would form and join organizations.  There would be several categories of organizations, each with different objectives and special abilities.  Organizations would include corporations, law enforcement agencies, crime syndicates, political parties, and terrorist organizations.  Hackers could created some, but not all of these types of organizations-shell corporations could hold a player's assets or launder dirty money, crime syndicates could be used to kill people, and terrorists could be used in false flag attacks to start wars.\n\nCharacters and organizations would inhabit nations, which would be represented on the world map.  Nations would control provinces on the map and you would able to watch them gain and lose territory in wars.  You would not be able to control nations directly, imagine a strategy game only all the players are AI while you influence the outcome with console commands.  Of course, if you have enough leverage over a national leader, you could reliably tell them who to go to war against...but you might still have to kill them if they disobey.\n\nThere would be in ingame economy, which would probably be the most difficult part of the game to code and for players to learn.  The economy would include a stock market that the player's actions could influence, multiple currencies that you could manipulate, and government bonds you could buy in bulk to gain leverage over countries.  I can't explain this well enough to do the idea justice except to say that this would be a powerful tool and allow players to control entire nations from behind the scenes.\n**Standout Features:**\n\nEmergent gameplay, replayability, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\nPC only.  Maybe mobile if it has the processing power to simulate a stock market.\n\n**Extra Features:**\nMaybe a few secret gameplay mechanics using the microphone (i.e. phone phreaking)\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJust make the game."
4325r1,'Borrowers' inspired survival-adventure game,"Hello! This is my first post on reddit so please criticize me on my reddiquette. Anyway, here goes.\n\nI have recently been interested in a game concept/idea that I think could be quite interesting. The game is based on the fantasy race of 'borrowers'. If you don't know what borrowers are, follow this link: [The Borrowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borrowers).\nMy idea is for a (hopefully third-person) survival type game where the player's character is a borrower in a human house, scavenging items from inside or just outside the house. The player would be challenged when traversing the map with enemies such as critters living in the walls, as well as humans and pets. I hope this idea intrigues others as much as it excites me. Please tell me your opinions and criticisms. Happy gaming!\nEDIT: grammar"
4317vf,2d Sidescroller Idea,[deleted]
430xnp,Disney Battles,"thought of this today but realized I can't pitch unsolicited ideas to disney as they will not take it for whatever reason but this could really sell. It would basically be a multiplayer platform combat game resembling super smash Bros but with disney characters and maps! It could possibly add a story mode where you travel through different disney worlds and fight whatever foes related to the disney world and maybe even include boss battles and after the boss battles unlocking those characters. But the main multiplayer premise would be arena 2d style fighting platform. And also with marvel and star wars being under the big entertainment name, I think this would be a very good idea. Also the competitive advantage to smash Bros would be that it wouldn't have to be strictly Nintendo and could possibly be compatible for Xbox, ps4, pc. I really hope they make a game like this but I can't do nothing about it due to their strict idea suggestion policy. Who else would be interested in this?"

42zlvt,A game where you play as a hacker/computer virus and must stop the computer user's attempts to shut you down.,"I've had this idea for awhile now. We've all had computer viruses, right? Trojans, Malware, computer worms, redirecting websites, all that *horrible* stuff. But what would it be like to play *as* the virus? Think about it! When you get a virus, what do you do? CTRL-shift-escape, shut whatever is suspicious down, run a virus scan, and hope everything turns out okay. So my idea would be to turn this into a game and play as the virus on the computer, carefully corrupting everything, getting in the way of the computer user by slowing down the computer and distracting the user by opening NSFW sites and ""traps"", sort of like those fake windows that say ""-insert person here- wants to be friends with you"" or those fake virus scan windows, etc. Alternatively, it could be/have a multiplayer game, where one player plays as the computer user and the other plays as a virus. Maybe you could even upgrade your malware/virus by copying files in game, or slowly ""growing"" in strength."
42xryq,A drone racing game,"I saw this: http://imgur.com/anL4UJN.gifv and thought it would make a really cool idea for a game. You could race around buildings or forests or anything, at very fast rates and try not to slam into the walls. It could be first person like the video and it could even be multiplayer. "
42xdgp,"Inspired by ""The Haunting of Hill House""","If you've never read this book, or 1408, played The 7th Guest, the 11th Hour, or maybe read H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Street,"" this is a macabre game where you play as a house that gains power by eating its inhabitants. So, pretty much how everyone ends up playing The Sims at some point. If your mind isn't exploding with ideas already:\n\nLet's call this power ""juice,"" with which you would change the house and its contents. You would also use juice to perform certain actions, like\n\n* Listing yourself for sale with realtors.\n* Creating phantoms of people the house has consumed - to show off the house, or to frighten occupants into a situation where they can be eaten.\n* Influence or control people in the house directly.\n\nA few areas that need to be fleshed out:\n\n* What criteria need to be met for someone to be eaten? Maybe they need to have a certain level of fear, they need to be near something like a fireplace or appliance, or simply ""trapped"" in a wall. Would have to balance out the costs of these with respect to player development.\n* How do the authorities fit into this? Seems like someone would notice people disappearing from work, friends, etc. Maybe have a level of suspicion that grows over time, with different people showing up. Paranormal investigators, scientists, police, FBI...until someone finally just tries to burn the house down. Provide various ways of reducing suspicion. The house could provide explanations by framing people, make things look like accidents. Maybe the house doesn't have to eat them whole, just blood, or just their soul. Could be a juice-suspicion trade-off.\n* How would getting sold work? I'd imagine potential buyers would visit, and the player would have to convince them using features of the house or a phantom sales representative. Maybe they ate the real one?\n\nOf course, this isn't an all or nothing idea. You could take just a bit and make a board game with some cardboard tiles, event cards, dice, and some counters. It would actually be a simplified, single player version of ""[Betrayal at House on the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betrayal_at_House_on_the_Hill)"" - which I think was also partly inspired by ""The Haunting of Hill House!"""
42wo6r,Roblox- The Ultimate Indie Game Tool and Engine!,"It may be marketed towards kids and teens, but I have seen really good games  are using the Roblox engine. Some of you may then that Roblox is a game, but that isn't the case. Roblox refers to the website and/or the game engine. Is Unity a game? No, it's an engine. You call them Unity games and you don't view those games as a whole, but individually. \n\nI have seen many games that have taken heavy inspiration from Day Z, Call of Duty, Garry's Mod (and it's various gamemodes), Battlefield, and the list goes on.  Some are very much aimed towards the younger audience and many are just absolute garbage. But I don't view them as a whole.\n\nThen there is the Minecraft vs Roblox argument. Some say that Minecraft is a way better game and it was in development first. Others say that Roblox was released first and is not a game, but is simply and engine and a website for a much larger spectrum of Indie games. This argument shouldn't exist and was only put forth by raging 7-year-olds who only saw a clone of one or the other.\n\nSo, why is it the ultimate tool for Indie game developers? Because of the ease of access and the ease of making a breakout game. Remember me mentioning those games that were absolute garbage? Well, if you are an indie developer, you WILL find it easy to make a breakout game. If your idea is good, we'll developed, and easily picked up, then hundreds even thousands of players will swarm to play. I've known of good Roblox games that have been only developed by 1 or even 2 people and they are really good.\n\nBut, there is a good chance you're thinking ""But my game will be in a sea of millions, how will it ever become popular?"" An advertisement system is in place to help get the game out there and popular even, so it would be best to use that. But then again there are other people using that system, so just make a good game and it WILL blow up. Why again? There are two genres of game that are specific to the Roblox community that are garbage in and of themselves but remain stupidly popular (like Call of Dirty), and none of them make any real changes to the genre and usually die out in just a few days after receiving to much spotlight. If those stupid games can catch on fire, then your idea will TOO! \n\nReally, Roblox is ripe for opportunities for both Indie developers and aspiring game designers looking to get a good game in their portfolio to show off to your next employer!\n\nWell that's it, tell me what else you want to know in the comments below!"
42wnzp,Military Restoration Tycoon game idea - similar to Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/15 but more in-depth with different features.,"So I was brainstorming this idea over the last few weeks, and even had a go myself in Unreal Engine 4, but I'm no programmer or 3D artist. I'm a history buff so I know a lot about the vehicles used and could provide a lot of stats and history behind them, but not produce the game itself unfortunately. :(\n\nI thought this would go down well with history/military/mechanical enthusiasts...because who wouldn't want to work on a tank and then drive it around some muddy fields? ;)\n\nEDIT: Updated the game notes into phases on recommendation to make it easier for anyone wanting to pick up this idea. It's still quite long so sorry about that, but I hope it makes better reading.\n\n\n**MILITARY RESTORATION TYCOON - PC**\n\n\nIn this game you manage a restoration business that takes disused military vehicles and restores them for display in a military-themed museum or use in shows, as well as drive them around a large, challenging all-terrain map for pleasure.\n\n\n**PHASE 1: Core gameplay**\n\n\n- Design and build the game levels. Each map has different terrain types.\n\n	For example: \n\n		- Germany: Heavy Forest, River, Some Hills and Fields\n\n		- Great Britain: Light Forest, River, Hills and Fields\n\n		- Russia: Tundra, Frozen River, Medium Forest, Hills\n\n		- America (North West): Heavy Forest, Hills and Fields, Beach\n\n		- America (South West): Desert, Rocky Terrain, Deep Gullies\n\n\n	- Each map level should be expansive enough to make the area feel as if it is worth exploring and should encourage the player to discover new ways to traverse any difficult terrain, such as fording a river instead of going over an area of jagged rocks/dense woodland/ect.\n\n	\n	- Similar terrain deformation to off-roading game Spintires so that the terrain is a challenge to wheeled vehicles and a joyride in tracked vehicles. Gives players the choice of challenging themselves when out driving a 4x4 truck or just having fun in a vehicle which can easily cope with the mud.\n\n\n	- Weather, temperature and lighting mechanics. Weather is dependent on the map the player is playing on, such as snow and freezing temperatures in Russia, lots of rain and mild temperatures in Britain and hardly any rain (if any) in South West America and very hot temperatures. There is a day/night cycle which changes the lighting throughout the day (i.e dawn, mid-day and dusk), and means that player must use a source of light when going out at night.\n\n\n		- Weather and temperature will play their parts in later game mechanics (see PHASE 2.)\n\n\n- Design and make 3D assets of seperate vehicle parts (for the restoration/maintenance aspect of the game) as well as the complete 3D models of the vehicles \nthemselves and their various attachments. \n\n\n	- Build-in the vehicle/parts condition system (in the same vein as Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/15) and a vehicle damage system, where certain parts take damage if the player is careless when driving them and crashes or goes over terrain which is too rough for the vehicle to handle. \n\n\n		CONDITION SYSTEM EXAMPLE:\n\n			- Deplorable (Worst) 0-15% \n\n				Colour code: Black\n\n			- Bad 16-25%\n\n				Colour code: Red\n\n			- Poor 26-35% \n\n				Colour code: Orange\n\n			- Average 36-50%\n\n				Colour code: Yellow\n\n			- Good 51-65%\n\n				Colour code: Dark Green\n\n			- Very Good 66-80%\n\n				Colour code: Light Green\n\n			- Excellent 81-95%  \n\n				Colour code: Dark Blue\n\n			- Perfect (Best) 96-100%\n\n				Colour code: Light Blue\n\n\n- Design 3D environments and subsequent assets such as the initial buildings the player begins with, including:\n\n	- The Office, (player starts game HERE) containing:\n		- A computer for accessing online auctions as well as parts/vehicle sellers.  \n		- A phone for selecting which goals to aim for (Career mode only, unless selected in Sandbox), as well as setting up show times and dates and hiring staff.\n		- A whiteboard for planning extensions to the garage, such as museum buildings; switches the camera to a top-down view so that the buildings and objects/vehicles can be placed. In 1st person view, the objects/vehicles can be adjusted and displayed in more detail.\n		- A clipboard to review finances.\n		- A file containing plans for show routines, where the player can select pre-made plans or create their own.\n		- Space for the certificates/trophies available when unlocking achievements (see PHASE 4.) \n\n	\n	- The Garage, containing:\n		- Spaces to keep fully-restored vehicles, ready for use or display.\n		- Work area with spaces for a couple of tanks or vehicles to be worked on; the garage can be expanded upon to make this larger.\n		- Engine workbenches for picking apart engines and putting them back together, ready for use in a vehicle.\n		- A lifter for working on the underside of vehicles (doesn't work for vehicles over a certain weight, so excludes tanks and most armoured vehicles. Motorcycles are also exempt.)\n		- A paint shop for spraying vehicles. \n\n\n	- The Scrapyard, containing:\n		- Space for 20 vehicle chassis; vehicle parts (such as engines) take up less room so more can be stored; can be expanded upon.\n		- Rudimentary work, such as cleaning up rust and mending battle-damage, can be undertaken in the scrapyard. Vehicles will worsen in condition if left \n		out in the elements too long, so once cleaned up, it would be imperative for the player to move the vehicle into the garage as soon as possible. \n		Covers for parts and vehicles can be bought, but they only slow the degrading process.   \n\n\n- Build-in the 1st person camera for the player character. ( See PHASE 2 for the top-down camera.)\n\n\n- Character creation (quite basic), which allows players to decide their 'avatar's' gender, appearance and name. This avatar of the player is the person who owns all of the land on each map and the restoration business.  \n\n\n- Construct the restoration and maintenance systems. Maintenance is in the same vein as Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/15, although obviously geared towards military\nsubjects.\n	\n\n	- Players are able to work on parts individually within the garage, taking them off of a vehicle, restoring them to a better condition (basically repairing them) by using certain tools, and then fitting them on when the desired condition has been attained. Alternatively, new parts can be bought and fitted immediately. (Although the computer is the hub of the game's marketplace, the player can purchase a tablet which they can use to buy parts quickly and without leaving the garage.)\n\n\n	- A system of removing parts in a certain order and replacing them in a certain order (much like Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/15), is vital to there being an aspect of challenge to the process. Players need to learn which parts are which (and this varies from vehicle to vehicle) as well as what they need to finish a build.   \n\n\n- Make the Dynamic Airbrush Tool. Players can select pre-designed camouflage patterns (or solid colours), as well as markings for different countries and units, or they can design their own by taking the vehicle into the garage's paint shop and spraying their pattern directly onto the vehicle. Afterwards, they can add markings\nif they wish. \n\n\n- Implement the driving system. \n\n\n	- Driving is from the 3rd person view. (1st person view is implemented in PHASE 2.)  \n\n\n- Implement the in-game marketplace, accessible from the computer in the office, which allows players to access 'online' auctions for vehicles, parts and other items as well as auction off their own vehicles. Completely restored vehicles are also available for immediate purchase, as well as brand new parts and replica weapons and equipment. (See PHASE 5 for the replica system.) \n\n\n	- Auctions are in game time, so players have to watch their auctions like they do in real life!\n\n\n- Navigation menus and user interface.\n\n\n- For PHASE 1, Tutorials, Career and Sandbox modes will need to be in place. \n\n\n	- Tutorials - Learning how to play the game, from using the various tools to restore vehicles, to driving them, and setting up your own museum and shows. (Museum and show tutorials will be in place at the end of PHASE 2 and PHASE 3 respectively.)\n\n\n	- Career - Taking the restoration business from the ground-up. Career is the only game mode to include random goals, unless selected in Sandbox.  \n\n\n	- Sandbox - Sandbox is completely customisable; determine financial limitations or lack thereof, whether there are random goals to meet like in Career mode, and other game settings. \n\n\n**PHASE 2: Additional Gameplay Features**\n\n\n- Design and make the 3D assets for small arms weapons, uniforms, other equipment and subsequent attachments for such objects so that they are ready for the museum feature also added in PHASE 2 of the game's development. \n\n\n	- Small arms, which can be anything from a pistol to a heavy machine-gun, can be fired with blank ammunition on a firing range. Caps can be used for shows so that it produces a bang and a flash but eliminates the notion of anyone getting hurt. (See PHASE 3 for shows.)\n\n\n	- Base uniforms can be bought from the in-game marketplace and the player can customise them however they like.\n\n\n		- Uniforms are made up of different parts in relation to where they are worn on the person, such as headgear, face, neckwear, torso, bottoms, waist, feet, ect.  \n		\n		- Various rank badges and unit patches can be applied to the uniform.\n	\n		- Dummies or NPC's, as well as the player character, can have their uniforms customised so that everyone looks unique. As long as the player has the part of a particular uniform, they can wear a cap instead of a helmet or have a different jacket to someone else, ect. \n\n\n- Build-in the top-down camera in preparation for constructing the building placement and object placement system. \n	\n\n	- The top-down camera is ONLY used when placing objects in the game world.\n\n\n- Implement building placement, allowing players to spend money to expand their business by building a museum complex or expanding their garage and scrapyard.\n\n	\n	- This aspect of the game requires that the player is able to place a 3D environment in the game, by constructing walls to create an interior space that can be explored in the 1st person. Players should be able to then place doors and windows, as well as skylights as an extra possibility. \n\n\n	- 3D assets, including decorations and display stands/cases should be implemented for the player to decorate their museum and offer more interesting places for their collection to be displayed. Some items, such as weapons, can only be displayed in cases. Uniforms can only be displayed on dummies. \n\n\n	- Placement includes the ability to rotate objects on 8 axis. \n\n\n- Implement terrain editing, where players can spend money to alter the terrain of the map and add pre-designed obstacles.\n\n\n	- Spade tool allows players to dig ditches, raise the ground so that it provides a ramp for vehicles to climb and re-direct water from rivers to create streams or bodies of water to cross. \n\n\n	- Pre-designed objects are 3D assets such as barbed wire obstacles, trenches (see PHASE 5) and tank traps. They can be bought and placed anywhere on the map to challenge the player's driving skills or used in shows to add a sense of realism to a performance. (See PHASE 3 for shows.)\n\n\n- Add the 1st person driving camera so that players can see part of the interior of the vehicles as they drive them, and so it gives a realistic view of driving a the vehicle.   \n\n\n- Install a vehicle weather degradation system, where vehicles will worsen in condition if left out in the elements too long, so once cleaned up, it would be imperative for the player to move the vehicle into the garage as soon as possible. (See PHASE 1 for the proposed condition system and restoration process.)\n\n\n	- Covers for parts and vehicles can be introduced into the market to cover anything left outside, but they only slow the degrading process.\n\n\n	- Rain will have the worst effect on vehicles as it can rust them, especially if they aren't painted. Snow and desert dust will have similar effects, but it won't happen as quickly. \n\n\n	- This sytem can be turned off in Sandbox mode.\n\n\n- Install a temperature system which affects the way a vehicle works. Hot temperatures can overheat a vehicle if it is pushed too hard or its coolant system (if it has one) is in poor condition and not working efficiently. Likewise, freezing temperatures can make handling the vehicle difficult. If vehicles are left out in the elements, water can get into the fuel tank and block the fuel lines and damage the fuel filter when it freezes.\n\n\n	- Overheated vehicles can suffer damage to their engines. Players must wait for the vehicle to cool down before it can be used again. This is less of a problem on more modern vehicles.\n\n\n	- Vehicles with frozen fuel lines/blocked fuel filters can have a heater set up next to them to thaw them out. Fuel filters may be damaged and need replacing or repairing.   \n\n\n	- This system can be turned off in Sandbox mode. \n\n\n**PHASE 3: Shows and Staff** \n\n\n- Implement the hiring of staff for helping in shows or working in the museum and garage. \n\n\n	- Staff can be hired via the phone in the office; they each have basic profiles detailing their name, gender and specialty. Some might be history buffs and good at leading tours around a museum by offering knowledge to visitors and others good with people (filling roles in attending a front desk or gift shop) or mechanics (helping in the garage and scrapyard). \n\n\n	- All staff can take place in shows if the player needs them to, so long as it doesn't affect their other duties. \n\n\n	- Staff can get better at what they do. As they gain experience in a particular role, they can pass on these benefits to the business (such as mechanics repairing parts more effectively) and the player's guests (tour guides impressing visitors.) \n\n\n	- If a particular staff member becomes extremely good at what they do, they can receive a promotion allowing them to become the head of their particular role, which improves the effectiveness of other staff members (especially younger, more inexperienced ones.)\n\n\n	- All staff are paid wages!\n\n\n- Add shows to the game as another way of drawing in visitors to the museum and/or showground, and therefore extra cash. \n\n\n	- Shows can be planned via the file in the office by adding manoeuvres in sequences, as well as vehicles to the roster. More complex routines can be orchestrated, such as mock-battles, by planning what actions NPC's carry out. These actions are usually quite broad, such as 'exit cover and fire at anyone designated as an enemy.' Anyone who is 'shot' is 'dead', and pretends to die for the remainder of that battle. \n\n\n	- Certain actions add more appeal to a show, such as ascending a hill with a tank and turning the gun towards the crowd. Vehicle variety also helps, as well as complex routines like mock-battles. Some spectators are history buffs and like accuracy, whilst others are just happy to see a variety of vehicles and a showy performance. At the end of a show, its success is determined by how happy the crowd is. If they are unhappy, it will have a negative impact on the number of visitors you receive for your next show, whereas if they are happy with the show, it will have a positive effect. \n\n\n	- Seating stands are a 3D asset which can be placed so that visitors can watch the performance in comfort. It will have a positive effect on happiness and the overall rating of the show.    \n     \n\n\n**PHASE 4: Final Touches**\n\n\n- Implement scenarios as the last feature, which gives experienced players a challenge by placing limitations on them whilst they still try to create a thriving business. \n\n	\n	- Scenarios - Pre-defined goals that have to be met within a certain amount of time. There will be a different set of scenarios and challenges for each location. \n\n\n- Steam achievements (full list to be concluded), including the designing and making of the certificates and trophies that can be unlocked when the achievements are accomplished.\n\n\n- Possible mod support?\n\n\n- General de-bugging and polishing.\n\n\n**PHASE 5: First DLC releases**\n\n\nDLC Pack 1: The Great War - Estm. DLC Price: £4.99 ($7.14)\n\n\n- Includes several vehicles, weapons, uniforms and equipment from the First World War, and introduces them in the persistent marketplace of the game. \n\n\n	- Adds trenches as buildable terrain features for shows; can also be placed on the map as challenges for vehicles. \n\n\n	- Any vehicles and vehicle parts from this DLC pack are likely to be rare and in bad condition. Weapons, equipment and uniforms are less rare but still likely to be in poor condition.\n \n\n	- Introduces the Replica System, where uniforms and weapons that are actually replicas can be bought (this includes all weapons and uniforms across the game, not just the ones introduced in this DLC pack), that are cheaper, in excellent condition and great for using in shows, but are not as valuable as they are not authentic. \n\n	\n		- REPLICA SYSTEM:\n\n\n			- Items are either REPLICAS (typified by a white box saying REPLICA in the item description) or AUTHENTIC (typified by a purple box saying AUTHENTIC in the item description). \n\n\nDLC Pack 2: Tanks of Poland and Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic - Estm. DLC Price: £2.99 ($4.28)\n\n\n- Includes a collection of vehicles, weapons, uniforms and equipment used by Polish and Czech forces over the years, from pre-WWII to the 1990's. Also has a selection of special markings used by the countries that can be used on any vehicle in-game.\n\n\n**PHASE 6: Second DLC releases**\n\n\nDLC Pack 3: Tanks of China and Japan - Estm. DLC Price: £2.99 ($4.28)\n\n\n- Includes a collection of vehicles, weapons, uniforms and equipment used by Chinese and Japanese forces over the years, from pre-WWII to the 1990's. Also has a selection of special markings used by the countries that can be used on any vehicle in-game.\n\n\nDLC Pack 4: Tanks of Scandinavia - Estm. DLC Price: £3.99 ($5.71)\n\n\n- Includes a collection of vehicles, weapons, uniforms and equipment used by Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish and Danish forces over the years, from pre-WWII to the 1990's. Also has a selection of special markings used by the countries that can be used on any vehicle in-game.            \n\n\nWould be interesting to see if anyone out there has the experience to undertake a project like this, or even if it's feasible. I'm willing to be historian/creative director but I'm no game developer unfortunately. Just thought I'd get the idea out there in the hope that someone might see it. If anyone had any other ideas, hit me with them and I'll add them down if they seem possible. This article might be added to if I come up with any more ideas of my own.\n"
42vpn8,JRPG-style Vigilante Game,"The game is set in 1930s New York City.\n\n Players will take control of a Vigilante who is fighting back against the Mafia.\n\nThe game begins in a Street view mode (similar to Pokémon), where players drive their car from a top down view, from location to location. Each location usually has a Mission to complete or a Crime to solve. You can get out of the car at anytime.\n\nWhen you're at a location, you can enter random encounters and such. You can interact with NPCs, fight criminals, sneak around past cops and thugs, and take clues from Crime scenes.\n\nEDIT: Time for me to explain combat.  The combat will not be turn based, as other JRPGs have done, but actually in real-time. Each ability has a cool down time, cost Stamina to use, or need to be reloaded. Players can also dodge melee and certain ranged attacks via QTE.\n\nThis idea can be easily expanded upon, so contact me at ConanDaDestroya123@gmail.com if you want to lend a helping hand with this game.\n\nAnd please post your thoughts below."
42u8ab,A game idea for a coop/team based tactical FPS,"The basic idea, is a blend of strategy games, and FPS. You have a small team of maybe 4-5 players, all being directed on what to do by someone who has a sky view of everything. For the sake of clarity, we'll call him the general for now.\n\nImagine it like this, you are a soldier on the ground, with no HUD, or anything, and the only thing you can see are routes/targets shown to you by the general. Of course, the soldiers can choose to act on their own, but they would not have as clear of an idea if it's correct. \n\nI could go deeper with this idea, as I have thought about it a lot, but I figured that I would leave it up for discussion :)"
42rqf2,New genre of sandox/strategy,"The MMO sandbox genre is getting burnt out it needs new blood.  My Idea is simple yet groundbreaking.  An mmo where you have 5 characters.  The map would have to be a huge sandbox map to a size where people could find solitude with the ""amount"" of players.  The idea is that you would have endless choices and a vast world to explore.  For example you could be a trader, 2farmers, hunter, and leathercrafter and set up a small mechantile where you sell food, skins, clothes/armor and raise mules.\nOr\nHealer, Swordsman, Archer, Spearman, Tracker and go on adventures seeking riches and long lost artifacts.\nOr\n5 Swordsmen for war is your calling.\n\nI would like to see large scale wars like faction vs faction where players can band together and have their characters join ranks controlled by captains and generals like total war.  \n\nI would like to see\n-a Non linear level system where experience gives your characters an edge but not a clear advantage\n-crafting and building\n-adventure and deep pve\n-larger scale pvp over territory \n-small scale pvp in factionless wildlands\n-pve factions that roam and take territory\n-mounts and pets including farm animals \n-different combat skills such as formation skills and solo play skills i.e shieldwall(formation) and for solo shieldbash.\n-a RNG style loot in pve\n-unique quest items\n-ranking system \n-trading system\netc..."
42qnqp,Open World Kung Fu Sim-cade,"The open world doesn't really matter for this game, since all this game really is, at it's core, is just a proof of concept for more realistic and satisfying open world melee combat.\n\nThe fighting system uses different controls from the open world, while still being seamlessly integrated with it. The heart and soul of the fighting system is fast-paced combat inspired by martial arts movies, using button modifiers along with the mouse, or analog stick, to punch, kick, sway, and block/parry. The mouse movement and analog stick is confined to a ""combat clock"" where movement is restricted to a circle and, for mouse and keyboard, it resets back to the middle after stopping the mouse movement. This allows for 360 degrees of analog movement, but is highly impractical. The combat clock could be limited to either 12 or 8 degrees and should support clockwise, counter-clockwise, and multi-directional movements. Singular rigid melee weapons like knives and staves are also supported with the system.\n\nTo enter and exit the fight controls, a face button is used, much like Grand Theft Auto IV and V. Once the player is in fight mode, they lock on to a target and use the right stick to change their target if they're facing multiple opponents. The left stick is always used for movement. When the player presses a trigger or bumper, it acts as a modifier for punching, kicking, body movement, and blocking/parrying. Taking inspiration from Skate 3 and EA MMA, ""moving around the clock"" activates specific types of hits and blocks. Flicking on the clock while blocking initiates a parry movement. I'm not sure how to implement blocks in K&amp;M besides using another key to make the player block. Double tapping a direction makes the character side-step.\n\nThe system uses both stamina and health to support knockouts from drained stamina. Should the player exert all their energy, their movements slow and prolonged aggressiveness will make the player knocked out. Should the player get hit while out of stamina, they will be knocked out. Throwing punches and taking hits take stamina, and getting hit takes a very small piece of health. Should the player get hit with a weapon, health is taken instead, along with a moderately small amount of stamina.\n\nGrabs are supported by holding the block and body movement modifiers and flicking on the clock to catch the attack, depending on where the attack is coming from. From here, players can choose to either takedown, using the punch modifier, or grapple, using the kick modifier. The combat clock determines how the opponent is taken down or grappled. The grab can also be used to steal the opponent's weapon.\n\nThe grappling controls could be inspired by [EA UFC's controls](https://www.easports.com/ufc/news/2014/ea-sports-ufc-tips-and-tricks-xb1-controller-map#Ground)."
42pdfp,WW1 FPS with Deformable Terrain,"Here's my pitch:\n\nIt's a first-person shooter set in WW1. Up to 20 players for 2 teams, fight over control ""areas"" (control points bascially).\n\nPlayers will spawn at their team's HQ.\n\nEach control area generates Morale Points for the team  that controls it.\n\nIn each HQ  there is a flag, that when captured, earns the capturing team a Morale Point \nboost.\n\nMorale Points are also gained from  kills, but only a small amount.\n\nNow for the FUN PART:\n\nArtillery and grenades can deform the terrain making craters in the dirt.\n\nAll players get shovels which can dig through the terrain, and place dirt back down (ALL SMOOTH TERRAIN, NO BLOCKS)\n\nPlayers can easily die in 1 or 2 shots, so they need to dig in around the control areas to better protect them. \n\nThis is to help convey the feeling of trench warfare.\n\nTell me about your ideas about this game idea, and what you think of it!\n\nEmail me at ConanDaDestroya456@gmail.com to find the demo test for this game and if your really interested in the game idea!"

42p4ie,Black and White meets Spore.,"We all know that Black and White and Spore were disappointments. They did not live up to expectations, although they were fun games in their own right. Black and White gave you control over an island and Spore let you create your own lifeforms, at least in the Creature Stage. I think these would be great if put together.\n\nI'm sure we've all seen ""lost world"" movies. From the actual film adaptations to The Lost World to King Kong to a variety of cheesy one-offs, they were pretty popular in the 20th century. Why not make a game where you can create your own lost world, and have people discover it?\n\nThe game would give you a large island to mold to your will. You can choose different biomes and land features, and create creatures in much the same way as the Creature Creator in Spore, but less cartoony. You can put your creature in a category (dinosaur, reptile, mammal, etc) and have it ready to go. You can also have natives settle your island and create your own island civilization. Finally, you can start allowing ""explorers"" to come onto your island, and they will be at your mercy. Slaughter them with your creatures and natives, spare them, or something inbetween. Maybe make your own little cheesy adventure movie.\n\nWho would play a game like this?"
42oxv5,Could use some help on my pseudo-in-development game,"So my idea for this (probably short) game is this; you ""play"" as an old man living in a boarded up apartment. The end of the world is coming, and you learn all about it by watching the tv in your room which is constantly broadcasting the local news.\n\nOutside you can hear horrible things happening, things are seeming very much like 'The Road'. But that's about all I have so far. It doesn't seem like much of a game, and I don't want to turn it into anything too complicated, I want the majority of the game to take place inside the apartment.\n\nIt seems though that it might be cool if the old man could somehow indirectly interact with what's going on with the people outside. If anybody has any cool ideas, by all means."

42euux,My Best Friend (VR game),"**Name:** My Best Friend\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A VR cooperative 3d puzzler in the vein of Portal 2's co-op play that's heavily reliant on voice communication. Player 2 only exists as long as Player 1 can see them. When P2 is out of P1's sight, P2's controls become incredibly sluggish, their view quickly begins fading to black and white, and then that view darkens. P1 has about :20s to return P2 to their sight, or P2 ceases to exist. P2 can jump higher and fall further than P1 without hurting themselves.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nPlot can exist solely as a context, or not at all. (Especially during prototyping and early puzzle creation.) Ideally P1 is a young child playing in their tree house with P2, their imaginary friend. Maybe the first level has you work together to move from one side to the other. Then your back yard as you imagine lava on the ground and you get from your tree house to the back porch. Then you have to get P2 inside the house to unlock the door, and things continue as the young character goes on a journey, increasingly getting darker, as we realize ""friend"" might not be the best phrase for this person leading the child into real life danger.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nA real world setting that begins with heavy imagination, but hints the increasingly demented and dark world might not be the character's imagination.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Player 1 - A young child who simply runs, jumps, and climbs around the world, moving obstacles (reflective surfaces) and attempting to reach a goal.\n\n* Player 2 - An imaginary friend helping the player reach areas through boosting/pulling them, moving objects, and pushing buttons/switches. If Player 2 leaves Player 1's view for too long, they begin to disappear from the world.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nIdea by Jeff ""Jeffool"" Bridges, who should totally get a budget and/or team to help him with crazy ideas one day.\n\n(Or if you're a more serious person?

42eax1,Blowing up a public aquarium with RPGs,"In an era where nonsesne and destructiveness make for awesome video games, has no one thought to make a game where you're inside some beautiful public aquarium, with like weapons of mass destruction, and you can just wreak havoc on everything, blowing up the glass and sending thousands of gallons of water barreling through crowds of unsuspecting patrons?\n\nI have no idea what the object of such game would be. Maybe it'd be like a bowling style game, where the object was to knock over pins or something without breaking the tanks, but I think just a mindless free-for-all, first-person-shooter style game would be way more fun. (I promise I'm not a crazy person or a terrorist. I would NOT do this in real life.)\n\nThink good graphics, quality water physics, and a ton of interesting places to visit and destroy. Maybe the sharks would attack people in the waves? Electric eels zapping everyone. Piranha schools roaming through corridors. Giant octopi grappling victims. Penguins surfing down staircases. Explosions and tidal waves.\n\nThere could be a time mode to see how much damage you could cause before the clock runs out. This would even just make a kick ass Call of Duty map.

424htb,An online survival horror game.,"A game where 6 random players or friends complete various tasks in various locations all while trying to avoid the AI-controlled monster.\n\nMatchmaking: You start off in the menu. From here, you can either create a lobby, join a random lobby, or create a private lobby to play with your friends.\n\nGameplay: Everyone starts off in the same room/location. Everyone will be assigned about 10 (maybe more) tasks to complete. Everyone has the same tasks to do though, so the players can either stick in a group and do them 1 by 1, or split up and do them quickly. What the tasks are will vary by location, so if the location is somewhere like mansion, there could be ""turn off a valve in the basement"", or ""turn on the generator"". It can be something silly too such as ""do the dishes"" or ""get a snack for everyone in the kitchen"". However, once the tasks are done, the remaining players have to go to the ""safe room"", which is basically your end goal. Once you are in the ""safe room"", there will be a counter showing how many players are left that need to enter the safe room. When the counter goes to zero, the players in the safe room win! If a player dies, then they'll be able to spectate the round or leave.\n\nChat: You can chat with text. There won't be a text box though, the chat works by you typing in what you want to say, and having the words hover over your head for a brief period.\n\nSpectating: If you don't feel like playing the game, you can spectate a random match. There can be up to 4 random spectators and 5 player spectators. So if 5 players die and there is one left, up to 9 spectators will be watching them. The spectators can only spectate players and cannot free roam. There is also a ""leave"" button if you wanna leave the lobby. When chatting while spectating, there can be a chat box where you can see the history of what everyone in the game has said. You can talk to other spectators, but the in-game players cannot see your chat.\n\nThe Enemy: Either you can have the same enemy for every map, different ones for each map, or have one usual enemy and on rare occasions have it swapped out for a different, more menacing one. The enemy is controlled with an AI. It responds to player's chat, sound, light, and visibility.\n\nWell yeah, that's about it. If you're confused about anything, comment and I'll try to clear things up."
421hzb,Tetris and connect 4,"So I can't seem to figure out how to make this game play better. Right now the idea is that it's a mix of connect 4 and tetris. So you take turns dropping a piece and instead of whoever wins, it's you get points if you make a certain tetris piece first. Then when you make the shape, those tiles are removed and a new shape is picked. Then a new shape is picked and if either play currently has it, like before they get points and it removes the tiles. The game is over when the board is filled and who ever has more points win. I'm trying to figure out how to make it more exciting and a little more fair. Because in connect 4, if you go first and play correctly you will always win and I don't want that situation to happen"
4201v5,Abstract: Civilisation type game with evolving culture,"Been thinking of a Civ/AoE type builder game, except you play a slightly different role- You don't directly control your civilisation: You can't tell which villagers to mine or cut wood, nor do you choose what they build, or what units they train. They do this automatically. Each villager has their own stats, personality, role and objective, which are decided partly due to chance and partly in response to the procedurally generated environment.\n\nThe only way to influence how your civilisation grows is to inspire your villagers with thoughts and ideas. These start simple like ""i don't want to be cold"", or ""what if I could break rocks?"" but eventually grow in complexity as the civilisation grows: ""I want to kill everyone in that building without them seeing me"" or ""What is beyond the stars?"". \n\nAs a result of this, the culture of your society gets subtly changed, with some ideas making it more industrious, warlike, spiritual or just plain weird. Likewise, the culture of your society could be reflected in the architecture and the inventions they make, which would be generated based on a range of psychological and environmental factors as a direct result of the ideas and thoughts you've been planting into your villagers. This way, you could end up developing some radically different cultures, some of which seem totally alien to our own yet are somehow able to adapt and function- Some leaning towards utopian, other distopian. \n\nAs the ""God"", you would have a sort of mana-pool that limits how often you can inspire your villagers minds and perhaps gets refilled as a result of population milestones or other achievements. As you can only directly inspire one persons mind at a time, you would have to choose carefully: If you inspire an absolute loser with a brilliant idea, it may fail to catch on. If you inspire someone with great charisma and influence, they could become the next prophet or tyrant, revolutionising your society.\n\nObviously this game would require some intense AI, and an engine that can predict and automatically (procedurally?) generate a unique culture based on how you play. Is it possible?"
41z8mh,Looking for a game to make!,Im a begginer developer just trying to find something to make as my  first project. Any ideas?
41xqzk,A cyberpunk roguelike that simulates around 80 buildings with persistent citizens,"After my recently submitted idea with the apartment manager, I binged hard on Dwarf Fortress and started (figuratively) dreaming up my dream game:\n\nAt the start, the game creates an enclosed sector of a futuristic, dystopian city for you. The map contains around 80 buildings that are procedurally generated. Buildings that will be created are:\n\n- Apartment complexes: You live in one, have to pay rent for it and might be able to rent/buy more of them and rent them out. Each one has a terminal somewhere that is connected to the machines in the resident apartments. NPCs live here too.\n\n- Government Bureaus: They can get you a governmental job, meaning work in one of the government owned buildings, according to your characters skill level (for example accountant, technician, scientist, etc.). They also house the local high-tech security force which you might join into if you qualify (no crime record, fitness), and they give out food stamps if you have no job or you haven't registered your job.\n\n- Community centers: Governmental owned, hand out food against stamps. Serve as meeting points for some citizens. (Think tavern/market)\n\n- Hospital: Privately owned. Heals you, sells med supplies and installs high-tech high-price legal augmentations.\n\n- Hydro-Farm: Both private and governmental, the gov owned delivers food to community centers. \n\n- Industry, high-tech and low-tech: offers job according to skill level, supplies citizens and buildings with machinery and augmentations. Low-tech private may supply the\n\n- Machine-house: The back-alley illegal augmentation chop-shop, sells and installs cheap, low-quality untrackable augmentations. All official tech items make you trackable, meaning your location at a time can be connected to reported crimes. You will be raided by nearly undefeatable paramilitary future cops. \n\n- Financial building: Private, you must go here to buy and sell buildings or to rent storage. Managing of account is possible over PDA or any terminal.\n\nI have *so many* more ideas for this, but in the foreseeable future this will probably stay a dream anyway, and I don't want to strain your eyes too much with my text. Crime, courierwork and bounty hunting, drug-producing and dealing, buying things over terminals and arranging meeting points with NPCs any maybe snitching them out for a bounty... the possibilities! "
41wp9i,Space Combat using nukes not lasers. Think bomber man but you're defending a space station in orbit.,"I always thought someone would have come up with this by now:\nso when combat in space happens it won't be with lasers.\nMy guess is that due to the vast expanses that would be fought over, nuclear weapons used almost like mines, or detonated in anticipation of other crafts movements would be how the art of war would evolve in space. How about a game based in 150 years in the future, and a few nations have assembled space stations in orbit around earth/moon/mars, and warefare is centred around the protection and development (ie traditional rts base building element) of said space station and trade routes. "
41v4x0,Loot and reboot: resource gathering/management to rebuild civilization,"Dwarf Fallout, basically.\n\nI'm thinking tileset/ascii display, huge map, singleplayer. \n\nProject-manage a ragtag band of survivors (with a randomly-distributed set of skills) to recolonize a big city with no population, no supply chain and no working infrastructure. \n\n(Let's assume a particularly vicious global plague killed nearly everyone on earth, leaving maybe a thousand people in your city)\n\nCities have countless buildings with all kinds of goods in them, but shelf-life and transport strongly work against you; gasoline degrades to uselessness after just a few months, and with no water in the pipes and no power for refrigeration, the available food supply will rapidly dwindle. \n\nGameplay would start out with the usual 4x priorities: pick a site for a base, then start madly gathering/recruiting from the surrounding area while food, water and fuel are (relatively) readily available. \n\nAs your operation expands, you start allocating jobs to your labour pool, from looting parties to latrine diggers, while you try to sustain and increase your population long enough that you can establish agriculture and fabrication enough to clamber back up the tech tree. \n\nGame mechanics could get as intricate as you like - a supply chain is a miserably complicated thing, transport energy costs are a Fucking Huge Deal when you have to push the cart yourself (as are calorie requirements), and just managing all the tasks and resources is going to be a full-time job. What items do you cache locally, and what will that cost to achieve?\n\nHey, they're breeding; great. How much less can they work, what about childcare and education, which people are you assigning to that? \n\nDid anyone think to save any livestock, or did they all starve to death before we got our act together? Do we have a way to get them to where we hope to raise them? \n\nWho here knows how to grow potatoes? What's the labour and water cost, and what's the lead time before we get to harvest them? What's their shelf-life, and do we have somewhere to put them?\n\nHow do you apportion the rationing, how many people do you hire as security, what are the chances that someone else will make a power grab?\n\nThree survivors turned up at the gate this morning; do we let them in? Will they be skilled workers or bandits or parasites? Will they carry disease, or vital supplies? Do we take the risk?"
41t5aq,A better US government official sim.,"Idea for a business-sim/politics game. Huge fan of House of Cards and I've been watching a lot of Parks and Recreation lately, so I thought it would be fun to play a game centered around that type of environment. You start at the bottom and work your way up to the top. Object of the game is to earn more money, power and respect. If you become President and run for two successful terms (8 years), you win the game. If you're fired or impeached, you lose.\n\n* When you start a **new game**, you create a character.\n* You begin at a local **city** government level. Then you work your way up to **state**, and finally to the **federal** level.\n* Choose which **department** to work in and get to work! There are several departments to choose from, including: Law, Public Works, Parks &amp; Rec, Police, Fire, Education, Tourism, Human Resources, Archives &amp; Records, etc...\n* Work your way to the top (Director) of your department, and then run for an **elected** office in your city government. Elected offices include: Assessor/Recorder (any), Treasurer (any), City Manager (any), District Attorney (law), Judge (law), Sheriff (police), Fire Chief (fire), Superintendent of Schools (education), etc...\n* If you perform well enough in your elected position, you can run for **Mayor**. This position gives you full power and control over the city, plus it opens up state government positions.\n* State government has the same type of **departments** that city government has, but probably fewer. Obviously, you have more power from these positions.\n* You can eventually run for **Governor** of your state. This opens up opportunities for you to run for federal government positions like Congress and the Senate. This is where things get interesting, as you try to determine who to support in order to acquire political favors down the road.\n* You then try to use your connections to get into a position on a President's **cabinet**. Positions here include, in order of rank: Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, and more (or less.)\n* Choose your enemies wisely and forge the right alliances and you could run for **President**, yourself. Serve your first term, get reelected, serve your second term, and enjoy the end game as your score is tallied up and you get to see how history remembers you.\n\n**Game Modes**\n\nThere are 3 game modes in this game. \n\n1. **Office Mode** is like a grand strategy game, where 1 day passes per real-time second. Random events pop up (relevant to the department you work in) and how you handle them determines the quality of your work as a public servant.\n2. **Campaign Mode** is a game kind of like The Political Machine, where you run for elected office and try to earn the popular vote based on how you handle the ""issues"".\n3. **Speech/Interview Mode** is a game where you have to keep a needle balanced inside a green area, kind of like when you are making a shot in golf games. If the needle stays in the green, you do well in the speech or interview. If it dips into the red, your character starts making mistakes, contradicting himself/herself and you lose points. Some speeches and interviews are easier than others. *It's easier for a conservative to appear on Bill O'Reilly than it is for them to appear on Stephen Colbert.*"
41soo7,Dream: Vigilante/Criminal Game Idea,"So recently I bought the remastered version of Watch_Dogs for Xbox One and it made me realize that if a game studio really wanted to they could make a good open world superhero/vigilante game. Then I started to think of one. Okay so imagine a game sort of like Watch_Dogs but this game only has 3 missions, after that you make your own story. You first create your own character: weight, muscle, skin color, voice, etc. Then you choose a background, and made a tragedy. This will affect your characters dialog, and the choices you have to answer questions, or reply to statements. For example, if say you grew up in a rough neighborhood and your parents were shot and killed, your best friends do drugs, and you've been in over 20 fights, your character is more likely to not trust people and your answer choices will be rude. On the other hand if you grew up rich, had a loving family, and your guy is down to Earth then your answer choices are super nice, and you can forgive people easily. Then you have to start making decision in the game, and depending on your background your character has positives and negatives starting out, if you start off with a rich background you start off with a lot of money but you are also really well known. If you start off with a poor background then you start off with no money but can fake your death without police really looking into it. As you play the game the choices you will make, will decide the type of person you are, and will become. The goal of the game will be either to be a really well known and liked vigilante or be the most feared gang leader (you can make decision on what type of gang. Anywhere from a mafia type gang to a street gang) , that runs the city. You will also have to keep your character healthy so eat, drink, sleep, go to the bathroom, get a job, make friends. As a criminal you can not get a job, and do illegal things to get money. As a vigilante you can get a job and work as a vigilante at night, or rob bodies of the people you knocked out (or killed). This game would have everything you can think of go into play, so for instance if you eat to much you gain weight so you have to work out, if you choose to be a hero and shoot someone people look at you negatively, if you wear all white then you can hear people say your character is raciest, but if people already like you that won't think negative of you. You can have a date, and hear police sirens and choose to either make up an excuse or to stay there, you can be out jogging with a hoodie on see a girls purse get snatched and since your not in uniform you can choose to call the police, not do anything, or pull up your hood and chase him, you can choose to hide your identity or not, you can choose how nice you are, and as the game goes on you start getting better. So before you could shoot a criminal in the leg and hit a important vain and have to rush them to help but later you could always get that bullet perfectly on the bone, or your guy before could be a sloppy fighter, but later can do crazy moves. Everything you do in the game though will have affect on the world around you, so as a vigilante you will always have a side that roots for you, and a side against you but depending on your actions one may over come the other. You could be a ""menace"" to the city and police try to arrest you before a murder, or a ""savior"" were the police will start giving you tips. Now as a criminal you can start off selling drugs or doing little petty crimes, eventually getting to know people, start robbing banks, buying whatever you want, being a cocky jerk, and eventually being able to join a gang (or crime family) or you can start your own have some of the other people come over to you. Now the same applies that everything goes into play. You can be a huge jerk to everyone but if you don't want the cops on you all the time you either have to pay them A LOT, or make they fear you. Also your actions can make other crime families or gangs get mad at you and start gang wars in the middle of the street. You can buy business, and start getting money rolling in. Have your workers pay you a percentage of there earnings, etc. In the end you can either run a city, or save a city. Also if you die it makes you choose if you want to restart from a checkpoint or count that as your character actually dying. If you choose actually dying then cutscences start flashing showing how you changed the world. So if your a really well liked, and well known vigilante it could show normal citizen start turning into vigilantes. If your a well known mafia boss, that runs the city and people get paid through you, and you die then the cut scene could be riots starting and the city turning to chaos. Those are the good things negatives can happen to obviously. (Also forgot to mention this but as you play you can choose who to tell your secrets to and some will backstab you others will work for you/with you) This is a summary of a game idea of mine, I am big into the mafia, and into vigilante stuff so I thought a game were you could truly choose to be one or the other would be cool. Tell me what you think."
41skpr,A remake of FFT:WotL,"Not just a remaster. I believe it was a great game, but it could easily have a 21st century feel. Instead of a square (where they are standing. It has four edges and only allows to attack off of those four edges [unless you have a job that does otherwise]), why not an octagon, or better animations? I don't know exactly how it'd be done, but I envision being able to sense it's WotL's roots, but also being modernized (I definitely want the turn base exactly how it is in tactics)."
41sd3s,End of Earth: Open World MMO FPS with realistic combat and RTS mechanics that revolves around a passionate story.,"Planetside 2 is my inspiration for this. I love it's potential for massive epic battles. However, there is too much confusion between players and no leadership guidance. EOE will give players the opportunity to step up and lead hundreds of players against another faction of players lead by their own Commander. There will be many incentives for being the one to look at the big picture and not twitch the mouse/controller around. And there will be just as many incentives for the one who is on the ground to follow his leader's orders, especially if it leads to victory. \n\nThe gameplay of being killed from getting an arrow to the knee is SOO old. I love what the devs for Escape From Tarkov are doing with their dynamic hit box, where each body part is affected individually. In EOE, players that survive a firefight with fatal injuries will be payed greatly in XP. \n\nGunplay will be similiar to ARMA 3(Corner Leaning, weapon resting, Ballistics)Those that are tactically proficient and attain victory by following orders will be given opportunities to join elite groups via the in-game Elite Forces class, where they will be allowed to use special weapons, gear, and vehicles that only they can use. This group will serve as the Faction Commander's surgical group of warriors that can make or break an intense battle.\n\nTeamwork will be greatly rewarded by allowing players who contribute to the whole( vice only their selves) to have access to certain weapons and gear. For example, players who capture objectives that are on the commander's list of objectives to be captured will accrue TeamPoints, which can be used to unlock things that can only be unlocked via TeamPoints (which will be almost everything) In other words, your gear is going to be super shitty if you don't play as a team, and you also won't progress in XP anywhere near as fast as those who do.\n\nCombined arms will play a major role in victory. Tanks will be hard to destroy and therefore have an actual use, which will be killing infantry. There's no such thing as an OP tank. I mean. It's a tank. But, it will be possible for the Davids running around to defeat the Goliaths rolling around.(Call in CAS, anti-armor weapons, etc)\n\nThere will be different types of aircraft. Each of which will serve it's own purpose. (Think Wargame: Red Dragon) All of them will mainly serve as support to the ground such as transportation, close-air-support, and reconnaissance. Once again, those that are tactically proficient and make excellent pilots will be given opportunities to join the elite groups in support of the elite operators on the ground, and even in support of the basic infantryman and tanker.\n\nTo achieve all of this teamwork based gameplay, all players will fall under a class structure. Ex: if you feel like playing as a sniper for a little bit, you'll have to join a designated marksman group where you will be tasked as a designated marksman for a group of basic infantryman individuals. If you want to be a fighter pilot for Saturday night, you'll have to join a fighter squadron where you will be tasked to support the mission of a regiment of players(50-200 players) of combined classes (snipers, machinegunners, riflemen,  tankers, transport helo pilots).\nThis will make it easy for the commander to select what he needs to utilize as far as combat assets in order to attain victory.\n\nThe story is still in progress lol. There is a reason why this game is called End of Earth. If you want what I have so far, I don't mind sharing for some criticism. The story will mainly serve to entice/inspire RTS lovers to step up and be their faction's commander who will lead them to victory."
41rj86,Fallout 4 Idle,"Basically an idle web game based on Fallout 4, with the same map. You start with one Wastelander, situated in Vault 111. The command ‘Attack’ is introduced, to let you attack enemies there. A set amount of enemies will be in each location, gradually increasing in difficulty until usually a boss enemy appears; after they are defeated, the location will be safe. Each enemy killed yields loot and XP.\n\nOnce you’ve completed attacking, the command ‘Loot’ is introduced, letting your Wastelander collect things. Each location has a set amount of stuff, and the rarer something is, the more times you will need to attempt to loot a location before you actually get it. You might also need certain skills to loot certain things (e.g. lockpicking, terminal hacking, etc.) Both ‘Attack’ and ‘Loot’ take time, varying according to difficulty and the Wastelander’s level. If you loot everything in a location, the area is cleared.\n\nOnce you’ve finished looting, you are then introduced to the ‘Explore’ command. ‘Explore’ will take you to the closest location to your current. In this case, Sanctuary. You clear that out, it becomes your first settlement. At this point, the game becomes a classic idle game. With what you’ve collected, you can build farms, water pumps, recruitment beacons, turrets, beds, generators, shops, as well as train people to build them automatically, and assign people to operate certain structures (e.g. farms) and apply upgrades to do these things faster.\n\nRecruitment beacons recruit Wastelanders constantly, without limits, so unlike the actual game, your settlements can becomes towns and cities instead of measly hamlets. Each Wastelander is unique, with their own level, SPECIAL, and perks of your choosing any time they level up from doing their job (note that you won’t have to individually choose perks for each one, but can instead opt to pick perks for every, say, 50 people that level up). Crucially, Wastelanders can also be trained to explore, attack, and loot locations. Other settlements will exist, and you will have the option of allying them, or razing them. Your karma will be affected by whether you ally or raze good settlements (settlers, non-feral ghouls, friendly synths, BoS, Minutemen, Railroad) or evil ones (Institute, Super Mutants, Gunners, Raiders, Forge), and these will determine certain individual settlement upgrades.\n\nPossible goals:\n\n* Reach maximum happiness in all your settlements\n\n* Defeat all enemies in all locations, and fully loot these locations\n\n* Either form alliances with or eliminate and take the settlements of others\n\n* Build Medical Research Centres and cure Super Mutants and Ghouls\n\n* Complete a faction subplot of your choosing\n\n* Find and ally with Unique Wastelanders (Wastelanders with unique abilities, e.g. break any lock, hack any terminal, SPECIAL stats above 10, etc.)\n\n* Build Radiation Research Centres to clear up the landscape and de-radiate the Commonwealth\n\n* Create the Commonwealth Provisional Government\n\n* Universe breach: as with other idle games, travel to a parallel universe and start again, with added perks\n\nThoughts? I don't know how this might work regarding copyright etc., if anyone would care to enlighten me that'd be great."
41qatl,An east Asian theme Legend of Zelda,"Now hear me out, I know there have been asian themed aspects throughout the series, but despite all that Hyrule, Termina and most of the other places in the Zelda games seem predominantly European, I think we need a Zelda game (perhaps a sequel to an existing one) that takes place in a China or Japan like environment, perhaps it is dangerous for link to be seen there so he'd disguise himself and use a more eastern sword, I don't really have any story fleshed out but I think it would be cool"
41m97f,Chaotic system prediction,"I've never seen this mechanic used in a game before, afaik it's a novel mechanic.\n\nTake a nonlinear, chaotic system, and require the player to predict its behaviour some number of seconds ahead. \n\nFor instance, simulate one of those 80s chrome \n kinetic sculptures, and require the player to place timed charges ahead of the ball. \n\nThe point being not to react but to predict; it'd be all a matter of playing hunches.\n\nRender it as a big circular play area, mapping the hue and brightness of each pixel to the angle and strength of the acceleration vector applied to the ball as it passes over. A perfectly smooth 'bowl' would look like a hue wheel; deformations to make life interesting would be obvious and relatively intuitive. \n\nLevel progression could run from smooth to twisty to dynamic, with the ball leaving a turbulent trail behind it...\n\nThe render could be entirely 2D, even vector if you can make it look right, and the control scheme would be perfect for mobile, as it's just click-a-spot.\n\n'Chaos Vector' would be a cool name for it...\n"
41m93j,sOul - Do we have a soul?,"I know that everyone reading the title has an opinion on the deeply philosophic and personal topic. But I'm not going to tell anyone that we DO or DO NOT have souls, this is just an idea about what it could be like...\n\n\nIn sOul nobody *has* a soul, rather, everybody *is* a soul, and every soul has a body. Players are basically trying to survive in a ruthless world, much like the one we live in today. If your body dies, you enter ""Soul Mode"" which can't be seen by human eyes. In Soul Mode, you look like a ghost, an outline of yourself. This is your aura, which can be seen in many different colors to represent your apparent personality  (This represents a sort of ""Chaos System"" similar to Dishonored). The more acts of a certain type a player commits will put them into a different category and change the color of their aura.\n\nFor Example:\n\nPink Represents Purity or Innocence. It is the color of a baby's aura.\n\nRed Represents Violence. It is the color of a criminal's aura.\n\nBrown Represents Practicality. It is the color of a teacher's aura.\n\nOrange Represents Energy. It is the color of an athlete's aura.\n\nYellow Represents Neutrality. It is the color of a regular person's aura.\n\nGreen Represents Charity. It is the color of a doctor's aura.\n\nTurquoise Represents Leadership. It is the color of a leader's aura.\n\nBlue Represents Pacifism. It is the color of a pacifist's aura.\n\nPurple Represents Creativity. It is the color of an artist's aura.\n\nWhite Represents Wisdom. It is the color of a scientist's aura.\n\nBlack Represents Death. It is the color of an elderly person's aura or that of someone awaiting death. This can be changed, of course, in many ways.\n\nFurthermore, in Soul Mode, players are able to enter a new body, but only after evicting the existing soul in that body. This creates a conflict of morals, the soul must have a body to function properly, but evicting a soul makes you violent and increase the Red pigment in your Aura. For example, if your body gets shot and dies, you will have to leave that body and find a new body, kick the soul out of it and continue the game. There will be difficulties, of course. A soul with a Blue (Pacifist) Aura will have trouble replacing a soul of a different pigment, such as Red (Criminal). This mechanic also takes away the stupidly unrealistic ""respawn"" function that all games seem to have. Instead of ""respawning"" you just take a few minutes to get into someone else's body (or a freshly dead one) and continue the game.\n\n\n\nThis is all I have so far, but I will revisit this and make it better.\n\nEDIT: Would anyone want to take part in this project, I doubt anyone here would be much help, but it would be a great experiment.\n\n\n\n\n"

41jxxz,A basebuilder in which you manage a section of a skyscraper... in a dystopic future!,"Think something along the lines of SimTower meets gritty Cyberpunk. Maybe have it in 3D with different floors, not sure on that one.\n\nYou are an appointed community manager stationed at this section of a completely rundown vertical neighborhood, like a futuristic [Kowloon walled city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City).\n\nThere are a number of small apartments, each with their own inhabitants that have individual traits and personalities. Your goal could be to either improve the wealth and happiness of the citizens, or just crack them down and make them conform. Either way, you need to get the complex up to certain level of functioning.\n\nThe problems you encounter: Some residents are drug addicts, produce new designer drugs, or sell them. Many people have no job and resort to crime or work shitty, unhealthy or unfulfilling jobs (prostitution, menial jobs for gangs, low-level factory work in the slums etc.). These jobs and crimes take place either off-map or target the area you supervise, meaning some residents will break into other apartments or cook drugs in their homes and such, may rot at home hooked up in their virtual reality simulators.\n\nYou can go about this in different ways, as you got free reign by the govs: To know the people, you could openly send in case workers who talk to people and have a chance to make certain details visible (some might be open about their crime, others will tell nothing at all, not even legitimate things) or you could randomly do police raids, convict citizens and employ them as informants. Once you have a clearer picture and stats of the residents, you see what is needed the most.\n\nIn a sector with a huge drug problem, a choice would be either forced rehab wich is faster but has a higher relapse rate, case workers who take their time with individual citizens, and in addition measurements against the local black market. High unemployment may be fought by building small work rooms, giving out foodstamps or something like that, not sure. You get the picture, I hope.\n\nYour resource is favor, sort of a reputation with the people you have to answer to. Achieving progress one way or another gives favor while continuing status quo or regressing is a crediblity costs you favor. \n\n\n\nI've got some more ideas, but this is already a bit much :)\n\n"
41i4eu,Super 4X Hybrid,"I've had this idea for a long time. But it's a real time strategy game that combines micromanaging city building games like Tropico and Anno, with huge political 4X games like Civilization and Europa Universalis, as well as real-time strategy combat like Men of War and Total War. \n\nIt would have complete customization for things like soldiers, tanks, vehicles, even your civilization's building styles. Colors, attachments, weapons, gear etc. Not only that but with your government, you could be full on nationalist dictator or benevolent democracy, or any combination of varying styles. You would even be able to directly interact with your people.\n\nThere would also be a diverse resource tree where you could gather and produce resources. Raw goods, manufactured goods, and luxury goods would be primary. Certain building would take raw resources and then turn them into manufactured resources. \n\nAnd you would also interact with other civilizations as well. The combat would actually involve your cities. Like if you build a civilian building, it will show up in the battle as if it was part of the environment. \n\nCombat would be like a normal war real time strategy game. You call in troops from your set armies and send them in. Infantry would need to use cover and all vehicles have counters.\n\nThere would also be different ways to expand your territory. Purchasing land with a drawing tool, or aggressively occupying with your military.\n\nBut really just think of it like a super mashup of strategy elements. Anno/Tropico/Civilization/Total War/EUIV\nI'm not sure anyone can make something like this, and this is just a bare bones explanation of the whole concept. I have a huge amount of documents on Google explaining the full game, but I think it's an interesting concept."

41ek28,Settlers with different transport possibilities/tech tree for transportations,"Hi!\n\nI love Settlers, especially the first one (a game that's hard to improve upon - later versions mostly _removed_ features). One thing that _is_ lacking though is different ways to transport goods, e.g. trains or airplanes; your only way is by foot (some versions add carts or better roads, no?). This makes it difficult and slow to expand your terratory, and the game is kind of made for a smaller scope.\n\nSo: How do you think the game would be affected if you added a tech tree for transportations?\n\n1. Bigger scope/terratories\n2. Centralizations, e.g., you could have wood production in one end of the map instead of everywhere\n\nExample of tech tree:\n\n1. By foot\n2. Cart/horse\n3. Cart/horse + stone roads\n4. Steam train/steam boat\n5. Combustion engine with cars and train\n6. Flight\n7. Space\n\nAdded resources except steel would be oil for combustion engine and maybe electronics for space travel.\n\nWhat do you think?"

41bd50,A Van Beuren / Max Fleischer Platformer,"With the up and coming, critically acclaimed ""Cuphead"" coming out this year, I thought I would put out this idea that I have had for the longest time. The idea is to make a 2-D platform that takes the storylines of classic Van Beuren and Max Fleischer cartoons (all deriving from the 30s era and onward) and allow individuals to play as and unlock various vintage cartoon characters (such as Felix the Cat, Popeye, Betty Boop, etc.) and adventure through the various storylines of these classic cartoons. This video game could be open to potential co-op gameplay, and levels would each contain the storyline of a classic cartoon, with various puzzles and enemies to battle through, based upon storyline. This video game would appeal to vintage junkies (like myself) and could involve various types of gameplay, from adventuring through gorgeous terrains to boss battles, and music / animation from these old cartoons could be used to have the most authentic 30s experience possible. There could even be a vintage-style hub that could imitate the title sequences of various classic cartoons. The possibilities with this concept are endless, and I believe that somewhere out there there is a market for it!"
41ap3e,A GTA game set in the 80's,"obviously a specific year, it would be more difficult in certain ways as you would have to look at a map to find what you need and there wouldn't be GPS technology, you'd have to use payphones or home phones for calling and if people send maps or images to the protagonist it would have to be through snail mail, so you'd drive to your house and check your mailbox, all the music in the car radios would never be newer than the year it takes place, there could be a channel for classical, 50's, current, maybe 70's (I'd really like any song by ELO to be the end credits music), it's just an era I like and feel it would really fit in well with the cynical satirical humour in the grand theft auto universe   \n  \nEdit: On another note it'd be nice if it was in a city we haven't seen before, maybe even outside of the US?    \nEdit 2: seriously I had no idea vice city was in the 80's I feel stupid now"

410oyc,ANGRY ENGINEERS (Kerbal Twisted Metal),"This is an idea I've been working on for a while now. I currently have a very basic prototype in UE4, but things are progressing rather well.  \n\nBasically, I would like to make a vehicular combat game with many of the mechanics from Twisted Metal or World of Tanks or Garrysmod ACF.  I would say that ACF(Armored Combat Framework) is the most similar to what I'm working on, but it's a royal pain to install, unintuitive, and not particularly streamlined. The basic game flow would be as follows. \n\nThe game consists of two main phases or modes.  \n\nThere is the vehicle editor, which is very similar to the rocket editor in KSP, where you can design and assemble your vehicle from various parts. You start with a chassis, then can add engines, batteries, transmissions, differentials, weapons, armor, shields, grappling hooks, turrets to mount things on, suspension elements, wheels, etc.\n\nThe main meat of the game is the multiplayer battles. I'm still not sure on a gametype, but I think that something similar to how Counter Strike works would be fun.  Each game has a cost limit per round, and you have a few moments to assemble a vehicle or use one of your saved designs. Any unused money would carry over between rounds, so you can do a few with a cheap vehicle before committing to bringing out your masterpiece. \n\nI'm still quite far from getting everything working, but I do have the basic vehicle systems and the editor working. Visually, I think getting a decent graphics style shouldn't be too hard with UE4's PBR capabilities on mechanical objects. I'm going with pretty realistic physics(tire model was a bitch) and my basic engine, 4 wheels, giant cannon setup already seems to have quite a bit of strategic possibilities. The hardest design and coding challenges are networking, physics optimizations, and intuitive controls on player - designed vehicles. \n\nTL;DR \nBuild things, shoot other things, win game"
45nfpc,(Open-World Redwall RPG),"Years ago after catching up on the Redwall series by Brian Jacques and reflecting on just how similar each book was (not that that's a bad thing), and then playing Skyrim, I had a crazy idea about an Elder Scrolls-style RPG set in the Redwall world.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThink Skyrim with woodland creatures in the Redwall IP. Focus would be on your character. Tons of race options, each with one or more unique starting points (Salamandastron, pirate ship, Redwall itself, etc.). All factions joinable, loyalties fluid and constantly changing based on your actions.\n\nThere would be no enemy-only NPC's (i.e. bandits and raiders). Who your enemies are depends entirely on which faction likes you the most, and how clearly/notoriously you are loyal to a certain faction. You might start out in a vermin horde, but desert at some point and start to make friends with more peaceful folk, until finally you're allowed into Redwall to someday take up the sword as warrior. Or you might get kicked out of Redwall after living there all your life, and eventually become such a ""villain"" that all Redwall-allied NPC's become hostile on sight (according to their natural capacity for violence and aggression, of course. Being very anti-Redwall wouldn't turn peaceful monks into bloodthirsty bandits).\n\nThe thing that disappoints me the most about these sorts of RPG's is how the sense of freedom (making your own character, acting how good or bad you want, exploring the world, etc.) feels negated when you're slotted into a few big quest lines for 75% of the game. I appreciate the stories, but they're not *my* stories, even though I'm the one supposedly roleplaying them.\n\nWhen I was a kid without so much as a Nintendo 64, I loved reading and hearing about the big AAA games that let you play what you want: Fable, Fallout 3, and so one. Back then I only got to spend a couple hours playing my friends' copies of these games, and I loved the freedom and exploration I felt. When I finally bought them for myself and played them through to the end, I realized that that feeling doesn't last long.\n\nThe real goal of this Redwall game is to be entirely non-linear. There's no central story questline, there are no major questlines for factions that commit you fully to their cause and against their enemies, there's just you and where you start, and how your actions and decisions affect your standing with the characters. You'd still end up doing a lot of the big world-changing sorts of things you would in a linear quest, but only if you set out to do it and accomplish it. The satisfaction from a feat like that would be tremendous, I think. Becoming good friends with the Badger Lord of Salamandastron and convincing him to wipe out all the vermin in Mossflower (or signing a treaty with a fox warlord, or abdicating his throne) would be something you do for yourself, not because the game prods you into it. All it does is allow things.\n\nSince (to me, at least) the Redwall license is essential to this game concept, it will likely never go any farther than this thread. If it did, it would be a low-budget merchandising production for the Redwall franchise. It wouldn't have to be very ambitious in world design or production quality (as far as visuals and things, anyway), as long as the roleplaying and faction systems are good. Not to mention, of course, the tremendous amount of voicework it would need.\n\nWhat do you think? Would this work better in some other format than first-person open world RPG? Would you play this game if it existed? What might make it a better idea?"

45jit4,Simple game for iOS again. Line Man,"You are on an arena or field. Tackle enemies off the field, out of your way or go around them. Controls are super simple, just draw a path to go over, and your character will move along that path as long as he's not interrupted\n\ni miss playing games like Toy Pop, Pac Man and others. Mostly playing those games, in my quest to make it better I ended up getting closer and closer to tackle football \n\nA few UNNECESSARY details. The game idea and the controls started out based on toy pop and I wanted to simplify it since holding the fire button down would suck. Then I played pac man and thought to try a game with just movement as the player controls. I started with toy pop style. Then Pac Man maze style. And finally wanted to mix in some Bomberman interaction with the environment... By putting in buttons. Which looked hard, complex and added an extra layer of UI. (Although the items may still be fun, teleporter, bombs, blocks). So I came up with a simpler system where you don't die if you hit enemies. That morphed into letting the player move into enemies to push them off the stage. Then I dropped the maze element because it would impede your movement, and you are left with a very simple concept. Swipe to move, hit enemies and push them off stage or out of your way. Just draw a path is the next potential iteration on swipe to move, which allows for more planned movements and takes advantage of the touch screen. \n\nStill not sure what the goal is, some ideas: hit all the enemies off stage into pits, reach the exit, endless arcade to get a high score, whatever it is the tackling is the main game mechanic"

You wake up in an unknown island with only you and the ship's captain. Oddly, you felt at home in this island, perhaps you'll learn more about it as you stay...\n\n**Characters**\n\n* **The Player**\n\n   * The player character, you choose his/her gender, name, hair, skin, and initial clothing.\n\n   * The player will have a HP and Stamina bar, HP is depleted when working without stamina or taking damage from various sources, get this to 0 and you'll pass out until the next day; stamina is depleted when working with tools.\n\n   * The player can eat food to replenish stamina and cures hunger, some food can increase stats either temporary or permanently.\n\n   * As you perform tasks you'll gain experience in that particular field, as you get better at the task you'll perform it more efficiently and even unlock new skills. Skills may include:\n\n        * Foraging\n\n        * Woodcutting\n\n        * Farming\n\n        * Animal Husbandry\n\n        * etc...\n\n    * The player can craft objects using workstations like in Terraria.\n\n\n    * The player can have a relationship with certain NPCs and eventually marry and start a family.\n\n* **Captain**\n\n    * The first NPC to live in the island, he was shipwrecked along with you.\n\n    * He'll be your tutorial at the start, he even built your first shelter for you to sleep with.\n\n    * He'll spend most of his time fishing, at night he'll prepare dinner so you'll never go hungry at least at your first steps\n\n    * Once you build a boat he'll be shipping goods for money, you can also give him a shopping list for him to buy.\n\n* **Other NPCs**\n\n   * Over the course of the game NPCs may request to move into the island. They'll give you a blueprint of their building and you can place them anywhere once you have the materials.\n\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics**\n\n* You'll control the character at a top-down perspective in a 2d plane.\n\n* Spend too long without eating and you'll get hungry, hunger increases the rate of stamina depletion.\n\n* There will be four seasons per year, 30 days per season, season will affect the island's flora and fauna.\n\n* During winter you need to change to winter clothes or stamina will deplete quickly.\n\n* Increase your inventory size by getting better backpacks.\n\n* Upgrade ships for bigger cargo holds, you'll need a bigger ship to carry animals to the island.\n\n* Explore the caves to unearth rare minerals and secrets!\n\n* and more!\n\n"
45ia01,[Intermediate] Jet-Ski Lava Based Arena Racer,"To summarize this weird idea:\n\nPlayers will ride on an assortment of fast water vehicles, namely the jetski among others.\n\nPlayers will use liquid physics in order to manipulate lava in order to eliminate enemy players, simply put, when players turn or land in the lava, waves or splashes are created which is how players will go about fighting one another\n\nA wide range of vehicles, each with their own pros and cons, such as a jetksi being fast and easy to manuver, whilst a larger boat will have a bigger splash but slower movement.\n\n2 basic game modes:\nThe first a simple arena deathmatch in a constant area, where one will have access to cover, and ramps.\nAnd a death race where players will be racing on a track, complete with obstacles and jumps, trying to fight one another whilst still concentrating on winning the race.\n\nFinally, the physics based nature of the game allows for quite a large skill ceiling, meanwhile having the environment as your only weapon keeps all players at an equal advantage.\n\nJust wanted to share.\n\n"

45glcw,Hardcore thief game!,"I would love to play a realistic hardcore thief game. I know there are plenty of games in this area (such as thief) but I would love to see one with out any guns/parkour. The game would focus heavy on recon/research on a targets then be able to plan the attack from a map before executing. You will have hard choices to select equipment, the more crap you bring with you the less you can carry out. Multiple trips means higher risk of getting caught. You wouldn't have any developed skills such as lock picking at the beginning forcing you to crowbar locks or search for vulnerabilities. The better thief you become, you will gain access to better skills and resources. You would start out as a low end thief doing common house break in's before attempting richer parts of town. We could even mix in relationships with fences, cops, information/inside job people, and other thief professionals. The thief franchise was good but diverted from this core concept into an amazing story line, but I would love to see a modern version that uses piratical sense. No fake hacking or simplistic lock picking mini games, but more of social manipulation and detective work. Such as pick pocketing your victims phones, or credentials? Unique dialog to gain trust?

Maybe you want to get supplies dropped off, research tech and control npc troops. You can give your team of players helpful info, drop in supplies and new weapons, tell them where you want things set up. As the commander you would get more tactical information than troops and a better view but would rely on them and a much weaker army.\n\nBasically, you're either playing an RTS where players control your hero units or you're one of the heroes in an FPS/RPG fashion.\n\nScouts would get different options. Maybe they want to be quicker hit and run units. Using a variety of weapons to hit and run units. Maybe they spec into stealth, operating to give line of sight and stealth detection for snipers, sabotaging building to destroy them or reverse their purpose. Maybe make enemy units cost more, make them weaker. Possibly stealing from resource buildings, either a quick burst now or a slow steady draw for the rest of the game.\n\nSnipers could spec into different roles, ones that get bonuses against different enemy types, ones that get bonuses for every worker they kill, every player they kill etc. Maybe they get bonuses for staying near base, higher LoS, anti stealth, better range and damage.\n\nSimilarly, cammanders would gain levels and boost things.

456vtq,Minecraft/Zelda/Metal Gear hybrid game,"Last night I had a dream I was playing a game (or inside the game rather) that was a Minecraft/Zelda/MGS hybrid type of game. My dream kept switching between these 3 games but somewhere inbetween it became a hybrid. The first game was literally Minecraft on steroids, I was some kind of metal hopping alien midget christmas tree type of thing. I could dig into the ground without any tools, and I could hop out of deep holes without having to dig my way back up, sometimes hopping way above the hole, it actually looked somewhat hilarious in action. The second game was some type of Zelda game. My cousin was playing this part of the game himself, and Link was carrying some guy on his back called ""Heidecker"". I remember my cousin saying the Heidecker guy looked like Ezio in the face. The place he was in was dark, he was inside some kind of ancient tomb,and I remember there being purple lights glowing around the room, it was weird, even for Zelda standards. The third game was definitely MGSV, but with a graphics mod to make it look like a replica of real life itself. I remember trying to kill some Sniper, it wasn't Quiet because this person actually spoke, and was hollering at me because I couldn't defeat her. At one point, I remember pressing in the left stick and Snake threw fire at her and it exploded after landing on her like a bomb. Then somewhere in between, the 3 games were one, like I was inside the game but it was all a hybrid. Then I woke up."

44zp1r,VR compatible multiplayer building and survial game!,"Nothing is set to stone yet. Every thought is appriciated. Please help me put together the concept for my next game!\n\n**Overview**\n\nExplore, Build, Survive in endless mode without a storyline.\n\nBasic gameplay idea is like Minecraft without the blocks. You gather resources and use them to build stuff. The whole game is played out of a cockpit, so it stays an (optional) puke-free VR experience.\n\n\n**Setting**\n\nMaybe on earth, maybe earth-like, maybe underwater (ala Subnautica), maybe a foreign planet with a big moon on the sky that you can beam up to in version 2 (ala Eden Star). It just has to be procedually generated. Ideas?\n\n\n**The Player**\n\nYou are in a small hovering vehicle, not much bigger as its cockpit itself. You stay the whole game in that cockpit, but that would be boring, right? So you can upgrade that vehicle by plugging in new modules that you crafted. The capabilities of this small vehicle are limited. To do specific tasks more effectively, like transportation, exploration, fighting or mining, you can mount your small vehicle into a bigger specialized one to pilot it. The bigger vehicle is also crafted as well as the modules, that you can mount on it.\n\nIf you die, the big vehicle and all the crafted modules and cargo are lost. Maybe you can recover some of them if you return to your grave.\n\n**Resource gathering**\n\nThe resource nodes are not exposed like in Eden Star. They are in the ground in layers, like in Planet Explorers. These big low concentrated layers can be mined with the drill that you use to drill tunnels (ultra ineffective) or with a stationary mining machine. The machine shall be crafted and placed by the player and extract resources over time (real-time). The same mechanic like in Star Wars Galaxies. You need to scoop the resources from time to time and relocate the machine when the resource fields get depleated.\n\nTo build the good stuff, you need precious materials only available in nodes. These need to be scanned and mined manually. Just like the diamonds in Minecraft.\n\n**Crafting**\n\nVia a crafting station. Maybe there are several specialized stations. You need blueprints and resources to craft someting. New Blueprints are found with exploration.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nJust drive, drill, maybe fly. You may use a scanner for the things you search. The scan results shall be very fuzzy like an old radar or sonar. Maybe one for resource mining fields, maybe one for precious nodes, one for wreckage (to salvage materials and blueprints from). Ideas?\n\n**Fighting**\n\nBase defence is done by turrets. Of course you can mount lasers on your vehicle. Maybe rockets. Maybe put mines on the ground and lure the evil creatures into them. At night time the base will be attacked and all creatures turn agressive. If you put your base unterground you are not safe. There shall be mole-like creatures. Damaged base modules may be repaired manually or by tiny automated repair drones. Damaged vehicles may be automatically repaired very slowly and with increased speed with a nanite repair paste like in EVE Online.\n\n**Multiplayer**\n\nMinecraft-like server structure. Play in coop or in pvp. Your choice."

44w77a,"Satellite Command, Lunar defense?","Like Missile Command, you shoot down missiles. I chose missiles because those are mass market, grounded in reality so that anyone will recognize them and understand the game without any tutorial. I bit off more than I can chew with this idea though!\n\nThere are several mini-games that make up the big game itself\n\n* Main game: Orbiting the Earth (3D object) is your satellite. Missiles will be fired at you from the Earth. Tap the screen to shoot back! Swipe to move around the Earth (which is in 3D).\n* Day/Night: the sun will be the light source for this game. The Earth has day/night sides and rotates. Combat only happens on the day side of the Earth. When you are on the dark side of the Earth, no combat occurs. (This acts to relieve weaker players of pressure)\n* Resource management: If you fire lasers, this should drain your energy. If we move, this should drain it also. As a satellite we are dependent on solar panels. *I originally thought we might be firing missiles instead. How can we rearm missiles from space? That is why we may use lasers to avoid this plot hole*\n\nIssues\n\n* Game lacks clear goal beyond shooting missiles down. What are the missiles targeting? Your satellite? Are there any other objects they may target? It is lonely up in space... Protect the moon?\n* Game environment lacks personal touch of the player. Every player environment and death will feel the same if you are the only target. \n* **One possible way to fix the lack of a personal touch is to color in zones on the world after you've destroyed all the missiles fired from there.** Then a player may choose to target, for example, Europe first, America second and Russia last. ( Of course he'd get owned by the tens of thousands of Russian nukes ). Now we now have characters to talk about!\n* This idea can be built on because difficulty ramps up as the game goes on. With this is mind, I could have unique endings, and say Russian ICBM's blew up the satellite. Saboteurs from America planted a bomb inside the station. Chinese hackers tricked the targeting system. And so on. These unique endings would be treats in themselves. Thus, each country is an actor. \n\n**Characters**. Only had this idea after thinking about issues. These serve to give players choice and control over how a game progresses.\n\n* Russia has lots of nukes. Also space weapons. Strong start, extreme escalation.\n* America has high tech missiles. More space weapons. Strongest start, decent escalation.\n* China hacks your targeting system. Crappy escalation.\n* Ocean submarines may surprise you at any moment (ouch!)\n* UFO's may appear, spawning more missiles\n* Europe starts out weak but gets strong fast\n\nStory behind the game... Well, you're orbiting the Earth, and shooting down missiles. Pretty simple, far from a final concept. I think there could be a moon orbiting and sun orbiting mission as well. (Although the sun would be a fun day only mode, it doesn't make sense for the game as it is about shooting missiles). Maybe you're intercepting Earth missiles bound for the moon base. Who knows! Players will just want to shoot missiles. \n\nThe thing is, I think I'm overshooting. Badly. This is all nice, but something is going to end up on the chopping block. Do customers need a 3D Earth? Does the space station need to move? Only the missile fighting and actors (countries) really appeal to me. "
44v8es,"Simple indie-fighting-strategic-musical game idea for PC, suitable for multiplayer and singleplayer","A fighting game that instead of pressing a key to make a move, you TYPE a random 2 digit number that is assigned to a move. \nFor example, ""0-2"" is kick and ""3-4"" is jump. Here's the fun part: by pressing a longer list of numbers, you can get combos, like by typing ""2-0-2"", you will get the moves of ""2-0"" and ""0-2"" completed by order. \nThe game can be a bit more difficult by forcing players to type rhythmically to a beat (similar to patapon or geometry dash). The higher the level gets, the faster the songs will be. "

44u9m1,Realistically Brutal Tank Game,"I am a huge fan of tanks and Tank games such as ""War Thunder"" And ""Armored Warfare"". But for someone who is really into the whole Historical Accuracy ""Armored Warfare"" and ""War Thunders"" Realistic battles can only go so far until it becomes ""un-fun"".\n\nThat is why i'm proposing this idea, This maybe be the most brutal tank game ever made, so here's the idea.\n\nin the game you go down a research tree much like Armored Warfare and War thunder. you play battles in a decently sized map for tank warfare, not to small, not to big. just right. as you play battles you gain EXP, Money, And vehicle modification research. \n\nEXP, is used to level up your Tank Crew, and can be used to research modifications on your selected tank.\n\nMoney, Money is used to finance Tank and Weapon Research and different amounts can be allocated to them. this also means you can't use Reichsmarks to finance U.S Research. each nation has its own currency.\n\nNow, onto the nations. their will be Russia, United States of America, Germany and UK/Britain. this part is pretty self-explanatory so i don't need to go too much into depth. each nation will have its own currency and own Armored vehicles.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nGameplay.\n\nthis is how the game will be played, and this is where some people will love it or hate it. This game will be Brutal and Realistic that means everything is first person, no third person camera you have to use the view ports. here's an example of a tank engagement.\n\nPlayer 1 is driving a M4 Sherman \nPlayer 2 is driving a Tiger H1.\n\nnow here comes the tactics. In World War 2 it was pretty well known that the M4 sherman was useless against tigers when attacking head-on. now, in most games today people would crawl to the forums and post how ""tiger OP plz nerf"" and when the next update comes out for that game it may be nerfed and the players will be happy.\nThis WILL NOT be the case, for there will be no such thing as ""OP"" or ""UP"", The tanks will perform how they were documented (this will also get rid the whole ""bias"" thing people throw around). that also means the M4 Sherman will have to use its agility and speed to flank the tiger and exploit the tigers poorly armored rear to kill it. This is a game where you WILL NOT be able to take a tank on single handedly, you WILL have to use teamwork to win the round. And tanks will only fight tanks they actually fought against, there will be no ""Tiers"" only Years.\n\nObjectives are more-or less simple, either destroy all enemy vehicles or capture a town/village/city/factory/Stronghold.\n\n-------------\n\nInside the Tank\n\nFor the crew members, they can either be controlled by AI or you can have friends join in to control the tank, Crew skills is mainly used for you and for the AI if you dont have friends who play or can't play right at the moment, that way you can still play. depending on the tank your friends can select a position that they like or good at. but this also means if you choose a smaller tank your friend might have to do 3 or 2 things at once such as aim,shoot and reload all while under pressure from the enemy.\n\nbut to be basic and simple i will explain the jobs each crew member will have to do. if you ever heard of ""Steel Battalion Heavy Armor"" for the Xbox 360 kinect this is how i would imagine the inside of the tank will look like (just without the whole mech thing)\n\nGunner, the gunner can spin the turret and shoot the gun, pretty self-explanatory\n\nLoader, The loader will have to look around inside the tank for the right shells the gunner/commander asks for. this also means there will be NO ammo counter ANYWHERE, you have to keep track how many you have left and how many you fire. conserve your ammo if you have to. Reloading will be pretty basic and advance at the same time, you have to find the shell and depending if it's in a container or not you have to open it, grab it, turn back around to the cannon breech put the shell into it, then close it up and ready for the gunner to fire it. Life and death is on your hands.\n\nCommander, The Commander is the leader of the tank he gives order and commands to every individual inside the tank.\n\nDriver, The driver drives, since this is a WW2 tank the driver has limited visibility and has to work with the commander where to go.\n\nthis all takes place in first-person so it will have a claustrophobic feeling to it\n\n---------------\n\nIf i forgot anything, failed to mention and or just want more information on a specific thing, PLEASE do not hesitate to ask, i will try my best to answer all questions that you may have."
44u6kx,"My version of a ""match-3"" game","Hello everyone,\n\nSo I had an idea for a game a few days ago and I decided to write down a small pitch about it.

I'll make a quick prototype to test whether combining elements this way feels good but I think it will!\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**EDIT**I made a quick prototype of the ""transmutation"" mechanic to see if it felt good making bigger elements. It feels good! I think I may get some art and sound FX to make a small mobile game.** [Here's a link to a clip of me ""solving"" for 4 Oceans on a random board](https://vimeo.com/154813643).\n\n**EDIT 2** I actually want to keep working on this. You can check out my progress on [my blog](http://navachristian.com/prototype-blog/). So far, that's what I have after 2 nights of working on the idea. You can see a clip of the [build right here](https://vimeo.com/154829071). I'd love some help if anyone here wants to make a game! It's pretty much like 50% of the way done in terms of mechanics. Just needs presentation enhancers and a format :)\n\n**EDIT 3** Did a bit more work on it before bedtime and wanted to show here. Pretty much a working prototype. It has a game loop and can end. It shows you your score now and has some improved tells about your transmutations. Yes, art is bare-bones, but code-wise it has the logic built. [Check it out!](https://vimeo.com/154846687)\n\n**EDIT 4** For anyone who cares, someone on this post offered some art and the game is looking good. I'm definitely going to make it a game now.

44tn5k,Amazing idea,A virus strikes the u.s by storm turning anyone over the age of 18 yrs old into zombies. You play as the leader of a settlement. You must scavenge for food and weapons to survive. If an area becomes to dangerous or there's not a lot of resources left you must move you and your ppl to a new area. As the leader you must make difficult decisions like if your supplies are running low to exile some people or to go to war with another group of kids. The main story would generally revolve on you and 4 other settlements dealing with the problems the virus has brought to the USA but the side quests could have unlimited potential as there is such a vast array of things to be done in a world like that.\n

46iti3,“Quest for Power” (or whatever),"**Concept Overview**\n\nRPG / Town Simulator Hybrid\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Plot**\n\nStart out as a lowly peasant and slowly build wealth, status, and power in order to challenge the sitting king (or local leader depending on the game size/scope)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Gameplay Mechanics (The Standout Features)**\n\nNPC Simulation - All NPCs (townsfolk) actions based on wants/needs (similar to The Sims, but likely simplified). They eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, go to work, interact socially, avoid attacks, etc. If they don’t or can’t do these things, they can starve, die, get sick, tired, become depressed/angry/stressed, go broke, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nTown Simulation - This is primarily just an extension of the NPC simulation, with the primary point being, nothing just happens and game doesn’t correct for imbalances. Everything is the result of some other action or event. For instance, A blacksmith has a business: in order to make a sale, he needs another NPC to walk into his store and purchase something, based on the customer's wants/needs and ability to pay. In order order to sell something, the blacksmith will have had to had the raw material and taken the time to make it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Benefit of Detailed Simulation**\n\nYour character can manipulate the environment in interesting ways to their benefit. For instance, sabotaging a food supply could starve the town, or maybe force them to venture out into dangerous areas for food, in which you can break into their residence and clean them out. Or you could sell your personal food stockpile once everyone is starving for a big profit.\n\nMaybe the guards start putting men on the food supply, but that means some other area may be unguarded.\n\nYou could buy some distressed businesses due to the town being periodically overrun by monsters. Clear out the monsters and your businesses are suddenly valuable as the area stabilizes.\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless and nothing is predetermined.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**General Goals**\n\nWealth Acquisition\n\n* Owning profitable businesses/housing\n\n* Selling items (as in RPGs)\n\n* Stealing\n\nStatus Acquisition\n\n* Performing services for people (maybe)\n\n* Killing monsters/enemies\n\n* Charity (giving gold to NPCs)\n\n* Acquiring building/land\n\n* Employing NPCs\n\n* Interacting positively with people (socially -&gt; personality/charisma attribute)\n\nPower Acquisition\n\n* Enabled by status and wealth\n\n* Hiring and paying soldiers\n\n* Create military Buildings\n\n* Researching Tech\n\n* Create weaponry\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**End Game/Army Useage**\n\nNot sure yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Balancing Gameplay**\n\n* Illegal actions would result in some time of tangible penalty if caught (jail, asset forfeiture) and intangible (relationships with specific NPC, status)\n\n* Negative actions towards others would result in similar penalties\nYour character, as with NPCs, will be constrained by your personality needs/desires/personality traits. Immoral actions can cause internal conflict/stress, limiting the characters actions in certain ways\n\n* Some other NPCs will competitive and may be looking for ways to increase wealth, status and power themselves\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Why it's not AAA (or doesn’t have to be)**\n\nNo NPC dialogue, very limited story/cut scenes (potentially none), no multiplayer, limited animations, no cutting-edge graphics, relatively small world (limited number of maps and size), limited RPG elements, no character customization\n\nI believe the complexity of the game development would lie in the interactions/algos/workflows, which I think is easier/cheaper than graphics/storylines/cinematics/art/voice acting. The NPC AI only needs to be programmed once, then it's reusable for all NPCs. Variability in NPCs is a result of differences in attributes and traits. Most of the economic model would be determined by the NPC actions, with the exception of resource availability and probably a couple other things I am not considering."
46hn33,"I'd love a John Wick game, from his hitman days. It could be a more visceral take on the assassin genre.","**The Lore**\n\nWe don't know much but we know John Wick was once a hitman, and was colleagues with many other hitman, all of whom use The Continental Hotel as a hub, or home base of sorts that served as a safe zone for everyone. This is an obvious video game trope where the player often returns ""home"" to sort inventory (e.g. Hitman 2, Dishonored), talk to NPC's, purchase goods etc. Speaking of purchasing goods, The John Wick universe has it's own currency. All of the hitmen that frequent The Continental use special coins to buy information from other hitmen, to hire someone to watch their back, or to simply pay for a room for the night. All of which lends itself well to a video game environment.\n\n**The Gameplay**\n\nJohn Wick is a very adaptive combatant. He uses his environment and objects around him to dispatch enemies as quickly as possible. He is a skilled grappler, adept at close quarters combat and submissions. This would mean combat in a John Wick game would be very unique in that I can't think of any shooters that feature grappling and submission holds. \n\nHow it would translate to gameplay:\nSome guys are converging on you from two directions. One group is coming down a narrow hallway, one is about to burst through a door at the end of the hallway. There is a small alcove where you are hidden from the hallway at the end near the door. You are at the corner waiting on the first bad guy to cross in front of where you are hidden. Once he does, you have several options: you could pop out, take out a few with the few pistol rounds you have left, and leave yourself exposed on the back. You could push the guy back into the group, making them stumble, giving you time to deal with the guys coming in the door. You could grab the first guy coming around the corner and use him as a shield, taking out everyone behind him in the hallway, quickly 180 and kick the shield into the opening door, stumbling them, allowing you to shoot all of them, etc etc.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is that there would be many ways to deal with the same situation. Where I grabbed a kitchen knife, you grabbed a cheese grater. Where I grabbed a sheet, you grabbed a lamp. Speaking of the sheet, there's actually a scene in the movie where a girl catches John Wick unarmed and he has to used a sheet to fight her. I think sections like this in the game would be awesome to showcase how versatile of a fighter he really is.\n\nI'm still trying to decide what to say about the cars. We know that Wick is a bit of a car guy, so not having cars in the game would be lacking, but a game where you only use cars to get from point A to point B is really shitty. So I'm thinking, what if your car is only used when the context calls for it. If you are just going from the hotel to a mission zone, a cutscene of you arriving and getting out of the car would be fine, but I would love to see some nice car chase situations that includes gunplay."
46dc5f,split/second-style arcade racer,"Name\nPretty much anything that isn't trademarked.  This is a clone, not a sequel.\n\nConcept Overview\nArcade style racing game where you can wreck your opponents by triggering explosions.  Like mario kart only instead of throwing blue shells at the race leader you drop a water tower on him.\n\nPlot\nNot necessary.\n\nSetting\nA variety of tracks.  Airports, nuclear plants, spillways, abandoned racetracks, anywhere that there's a lot of obstacles and hazards you can turn against the other racers.  Tracks could be point to point or circuit races.\n\nCharacters/Abilities\nAs long as the game supports mods it could ship with 3-6 different vehicles and do fine.  Cars in the base game would range from exotics to high performance luxury sedans to sport bikes.  Unlike split/second there wouldn't be any trucks or SUVs because they sucked and no one used them online.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nIn split/second you built up adrenaline by drifting, drafting behind other cars, etc, and then used that adrenaline to engulf other cars in Michael Bay-style explosions.  With a full adrenaline meter you could destroy huge sections of the track, completely changing the layout in some cases.  The hazards in the game also created ""shockwaves"" so if you swerved to avoid an exploding bus and hit a wall, whoever blew up the bus would get credit for wrecking you.  This was great for multiplayer because the netcode could handle it much better than, say, cars in burnout or hot pursuit 2010 trying to ram eachother off the road.\nMy idea would build on this gameplay to make a definitive arcade racer designed for the PC.  User-created content, dedicated servers, the works.  It would also borrow a few ideas from other racers-i.e. instead of forcing you to drift to fill your meter, you would fill it by driving cleanly and not hitting anything.\nStandout Features\n Support for user-created tracks and cars\n\nDedicated servers (with support for server mods like rebalances)\n\nFill up your meter to activate an extremely risky turbo mode that increases your top speed but triggers every hazard in front of your vehicle\n\nPolice.  They would mostly target the race leader, rubberbanding in front of the lead car and dropping spike strips.\n\nPossible Platforms\nPC only.  If you make it in the ogre engine it could probably be ported to other OS's too.\n\nExtra Features\nWould be designed from the beginning with multiplayer in mind.  All cars would be competitive online, the vehicle physics would be simple enough to not cause much lag, and single player would more or less be multiplayer with only bots.\n\nGame would use cel-shaded graphics to reduce asset-creation time for both devs and modders\n\nHow To Credit You\nIdeas are a dime a dozen, but if you're interested I can make cars in blender."
46bjb5,Would you like to play a game like this,"The game  is  set in the future in 2045 when terrorism has reached a all time high but these are not your average terrorists.

When you're in a battle, it will be displayed in a small screen in a corner that you can enlarge. \n\nIn the battle, you need to send up to 3 snails. Also, they are completly AI controlled, so you can only interact by giving basic commands (for example, ""Defend objective closest to enemy"" or ""scout for capturable points"") You can also give them items and stuff to make them go faster.\n\nThe game should also have a ton of breeding options, with realistic breeding and growing times, but not egg laying times, becuase they can take up to a goddamn year to do so.

4620t8,Urban Exploration idea,"So, everyone loves at least the thought of Urban Exploration, right? Grabbing a flashlight and a camera and breaking into some abandoned building to explore.\n\nSomething with the idea of procedural generation and UE, where the game would have different templates/texture packs/etc for different kinds of buildings, like churches, warehouses, entire apartment complexes, and really just give players a new area to explore whenever they want one. Saving seeds/favorites to share with other people if you run into a particularly cool configuration to explore.\n\nMultiplayer could be cool, too. Locate players with positional audio at least, what with VR rapidly becoming a ""thing"". Much in the same way that you could open your game up to act as a server, one player could host games and have friends connect so you can explore buildings together.\n\nThere wouldn't really be any sort of ""game"" mechanics, like, no scoring system or objectives or anything, just trying to capture the feeling of this one awesome activity that's not always necessarily one of the safest of things to do.. I mean we've got people making games to simulate flying quadcopters, we've got truck driving simulators.. Why not something that just gives you new areas to explore."
45zp9p,Game mixing video 360 and 3D,"\nI was thinking of a game where you go on a jeep and have to shoot enemies... so basically 360 vision, aim and shoot.

45zkni,"Thoughts on my modified ""New Game +"" mechanic?","For those who aren't familiar with the term, ""New Game Plus"" (or NG+), is a game style that allows a player to continue playing a game from the beginning after the main storyline has finished. Typically your character would carry over some benefits (experience, items, stats, etc), and in most cases the enemies you encounter would become more powerful.\n\nLots of games (including my own) involve a ""looping"" storyline which adds some story logic to the fact that you're now back where you started, but are in a much better position than before.\n\nI love games like these, which is why I've decided to add this feature to my procedural RPG dungeon crawler. Although one thing has always bugged me with NG+, and that's the lack of new content (obviously, since it doesn't start until you finish the story).\n\nSo what I've been working on involves a shorter ""main"" story (3-4 hours to complete). After which, NG+ starts. On your next play through, you encounter new/slightly changed quests which add more background to the main story. NG++ would increase it even further.\n\nThe time expectation I have in mind would be:\n\n- 25% - Main Story\n- 20% - NG+\n- 15% - NG++\n- 15% - NG+++\n- 25% - NG ∞\n\nNG ∞ would be an Endless end-game mode where the monsters and gear continue to get stronger, but the story does not change (save for maybe a final new boss).\n\nSince this isn't truly what ""NG+"" is, I was thinking I'd call my modified version ""Continued Play"".\n\nSo to those out there who enjoy NG+, would this style of gameplay appeal to you? Or any suggestions on further modifications?\n\nThanks!"

To stop the bug completely is to remove the final boss, (my Idea is the game that you currently making is an RPG game) where you can fight it with game item or use actual weapon. You can also program a weapon! Finally, everything in your gameplay decided your ending, if you taking time too remove the bug, city will destroyed and you have to paid for the damage, bad ending. If you recklessly remove the bug, part of the game might be deleted, bad end. If you manage to remove the bug, somehow normally, your rival create similar game and your game is not going to sale, bad end. Only if you remove the bug , while creating havoc in your city without destroying it and show to people your game feature! (Talk about demanding)\nThat's all for the game intro feature and finishing.\n\nNow , for the sell point, it is amazing to see something scientific and magical to combine, that idea is not usually seen on market and when it does, it have a great reputation. If you watch [Gate Jietai Kanochi Nite] you'll like impressed how military power vs strongest enemy from magical world. Lately, what I've seen on market is a same genre or just a same game with different UI. You've heard Call of Duty? How about Warcraft? Probably, but how about Both of them combined? Now that's rare! If I'm a game maker, I want to create this game and if I'm a gamer, I'm looking foward to play this game!\n\nI hope you consider my idea."

45tufj,[Request] Mobile game developer looking for a good game idea,"Hey, we're an experienced team of mobile game developers and we're looking for an idea for our next game. We mainly do multiplayer games (both real time and asynchronous) and we'd love to hear any ideas you would like to see on iOS and Android (and of course if we'll use anything we'll give out credits).\n\nThanks\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nI should note we are targeting the following:\n\n* Real-time (First person shooter, RTS, etc) or asymmetric (Clash of Clans, Draw Something) multiplayer for phones/tablets\n* Each player plays on his one device\n* Sessions are relatively short and not too demanding to maintain\n* There should be some progression in the game and we're aiming for a playing experience that can last for months\n* We want to enable players to play with their friends as easily as possible"
45triu,SNES Battle Pinball: Please Remake,"Check it out [here](http://www.snesfun.com/play/battle-pinball/1739).\n\nThis game was never released in America. It's a pinball game with multiple themed tables, each table comprised of three separate tables (plus hidden bonus tables). Activating each table's ""special event"" summons a character from Super Robot Wars to destroy one of the enemies on the board.\n\nI'm not talking about a simple flash clone. I'm saying I would play the shit out of a modern pinball game like this. \n\nThe format would be great for a tournament fighting-style game along the lines of Mortal Kombat, or maybe even a GTA-style game where various thugs must be defeated / discovered / allied with and treasures obtained. Heck, a classic RPG would fit the format perfectly -- tables themed after various thug levels, with a boss monster at the top table and hidden treasure rooms. You could replicate ""quests"" by putting the quest objective on the table and having the player activate it and then return to a specific spot on the table -- ""hit the top right bumper, then activate the central ramp"".\n\nThe format is repeatable, but can be very challenging. The game itself is simple physics. I am not a programmer, though, so I have no idea how difficult making such a game would actually be.\n\nIf you make it, please let me know. If you make it available for Android / iOS it will be one of the only decent pinball games on Google Play (and maybe haptic tilt control? yeeaaahhh). Make two or three themed tables free, then ask a low payment for additional themed tables -- most people balk at paying for an ""old-fashioned"" game like this, but they'll pay out if the tables are fun enough.\n\nThanks!"

47knyp,Horror game idea,"Basically, you play as a real estate agent and while checking out a house to sell, you get trapped by an evil spirit.  There are tons of evil things that try to kill you which you cannot physically fight off so your only option is to run and hide.  To escape, the player must find and burn the bones which belonged to the spirit which are buried somewhere on the property.\n\nThe player starts equipped with a cellphone (obviously no service on the property) and a flashlight.   The only other things that the player may pick up would be some hand tools (screw driver &amp; wrench) and matches.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n**The house is an ever changing maze:**  Every time the door closes behind you when you enter a room, the rooms will ""shuffle"".  By this I mean if you exit a bedroom and close the door.  When you reopen it, you could be facing the library.\n\n**Different Player controlled interactions:** The player will be able to choose how hard or soft to open a door (If you are running away you want to push the door open fast, when you are sneaking you want to be quiet).  The player will also be able to push/pull many objects (pull a desk away from the wall to hide behind).\n\n**Advanced hiding options:**  There will be many places the user can choose to hide.  Under the bed, in the closet, behind the door.  Pretty much anything that gets you out of sight is a hiding spot.  When in hiding, if the enemy is close enough, the player will have to hold their breath (Holding the joy sticks at certain angles) until it leaves.\n\n**Optional side stories:** Some of the enemies will also be spirits who are angry about something.  For extended game play, the player has the option to find out what the spirit is angry about and fix it.  For example, maybe someone was murdered and hid behind a wall.  The player would have to find out where, retrieve the remains and give it a proper burial.  \n\nEnemies:  \n\n**Main Spirit:** The spirit which refuses to let you leave and plays Jenga with the house.\n\n**Possessed boy:**  He will pop up directly in front of the player in some rooms, he will sometimes be standing near a window.  If he sees you he will let out a loud scream and disappear.  The next time the player goes to a washroom the boy will be waiting and try to grab the player.\n\n**Hell hound:**  The spirit of an abused do will chase after you when you are outside of the house.  It will be very loud and very noticeable when it sees you.  It runs slightly faster than the player and you must get inside somewhere for it to stop chasing.\n\n**Demon-grudge-like lady:**  She will be in some rooms (Sometimes random sometimes for the story).  She is blind and hungry for blood.  The player must be very quiet around her otherwise she will pursue.  The player must gain enough distance to hide and hold their breathe.  \n\n**Spirit Hunter:**  He walks around the house, you can hear footsteps when he is closer.  He will always be drawn to sound but he is not fast.  If you are in his line of sight, he will try to shoot at you.\n\n**Ghost:**  There is a ghost that haunts different areas of the yard.  It is pretty much harmless unless you walk through him.  To prevent doing this, the player will have to take a picture with the cell phone. (You can see the ghost in the picture but not IRL)\n\n\nSo I want to know what you guys think, do you think it would be a good game? Potential to be scary?  Features that should be added/removed?"
47jwr2,Turn based RPG with the standard classes from the 'real world'.,"I have no story, no actual character designs, just a brain fart I got on the way back home. But these fragments of information might be inspiring to some of you.\n\nTurn based RPG. What kind is still open, but for the sake of it, let's keep it simple, and stick with the You first, then the enemy.\n\nAs in every RPG you have your classes, the knight, the wizard etc etc. Only are the classes... a tad different then you'd expect.\n\n**The knight**(Also known as the Prince) consists out of two persons, the knight himself, and his lady. Only the knight is an 18 years old guy who's shy, insecure, very nice, etc. And the lady - similar age - is good looking, arrogant etc. They are meant to be the 'friendzoned couple', guy desperately wanting to be with the girl, too shy to actually say something about it, and the girl not realizing, just thinking they are just really good friends.\n\nYou can have idle animations where he is on his elbows and knees, and she sitting on him, him helping her with her nails, her taking selfies of the two etc.\n\nAnother fun thing can be that the two have two separate life bars, even though they only have one action for the two of them. As the knight, he's also the tank of the team, so he has high life, and tends to block attacks(take reduced damage in this case). If he fails to 'block' the damage, instead of him, his lady is taking the hit(and of course she has a much tinier life pool). Whenever that happens, the knight directly counters the enemy with an attack of his own(enraging etc). Would make for a very unique setup in a turnbased RPG, with a lot of possibilities.\n\n**Wizard** The 30 year old virgin that casts ""Magic arrows"" ""Trap Cards(You just activated mine)"" Summon an horde of Ponies(mlp style) etc. You get what I'm aiming at. Since this style just screams parody, you can actually use most things legally\n\n**Curser** Being the support type of player, he buffs and debuffs everyone with his cursing. Literally cursing. Would be sad if you had to censor most of it, but wouldn't it be awesome if you had a character that shouts insults to everything around him as an attack(insert typical I-slept-with-your-mum kinds of insults)?\n\n**Thief** Hipster looking 'cool' kid, that uses things other people made for his attacks - claiming he made them all of course. As a thief, he's fast and agile, slamming 'his' works in the faces of the enemy. Every time he hits someone, he gets a upvote, boosting his capabilities in battles, unlocking other skills or w/e. Missing enemies, or getting his will downvote his post. Him having high speed will allow him to act multiple times before the enemy, thus gain far more upvotes than downvotes(therefore the fast and agile type of guy).\n\n**The Summoner** or, the whiner, who summons allies as the admin, his father or whoever else with power to do battle for him.\n\nAnd go on. There are plenty of other things to think off.\n\nNot much of a completed Idea, but it's a nice place to start. With the proper style(Borderland-ish, only thicker lines, slightly more detail)could turn it into something really epic. The idea is also quite 'nowadays', no doubt there will be a great group of people who'd love to dive into a game with characters like that. you'll most likely also get a lot of free advertisement throughout things like Tumblr, 9Gag, Reddit etc, since you can adopt every type of site in it. And especially since it's a parody, it's bound to generate a lot of opinions.\n\nWelp, just a random brainfart I had. Have a nice day :)"

47ddj2,Carrier Battle,"A simple game focusing on a battle between two aircraft carriers. Each carrier has a number of squadrons of fighters, dive bombers, strike fighters, and torpedo bombers with which they can attack. These squadrons have a limited flight time, and losses can't be replaced during the battle.\n\n\nThe player directs their squadrons by drawing a flight path for them. The squadron launches from the carrier and follows the path to the end. If they see an enemy squadron or ship they attack it. When they reach the end of the path, the squadron returns to the carrier to refuel and rearm. The carrier can only process planes at a fixed rate, so if too many come in to land at the same time some will have to wait.\n\n\nThe paths of the squadrons is fixed once they are launched, so a key part of the game is predicting how to intercept or avoid enemy squadrons. Ex a fighter squadron may want to fly a sweeping pattern in between the carriers, while bombers would want to fly as far off to the side as possible to avoid enemy fighters (without running out of fuel). Timing would also have to be managed, both to ensure there isn't a bottleneck of landing squadrons and to punch through enemy defenses with a combined strike.\n\nCrude illustration:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/xp2Ba7T.png](http://i.imgur.com/xp2Ba7T.png)\n\nNote: In the actual game enemy flight paths would not be visible."

For example: \n\n&gt;Vaulting, running, sliding, etc inspired by Dying Light or Mirrors Edge\n\n\n&gt;A ""movement enhancement button"", probably LB on an Xbox or L1 on the PlayStation, which changes movement. An example would be aiming down sights; pressing it would allow you to lean Wolfenstein style. Running and pressing it in any direction will make you dive.\n\n&gt;Weapon customization\n\n&gt;Focus on balanced maps and fun\n\n&gt;Destruction on a minor scale, chipping away of cover and the like\n\nI can go into more detail but I at least want input."

The game will progressively get harder but how much harder depends on how often you are spotted/photographed -the ultimate goal is to wipe out manking and become the next apex predator. Perhaps having the last few levels actually take place within a city or town\n"

Also the density slider should have a 20 second recharge time after change and a 10 second time to change from maximum to minimum.

46pxyu,An idea for a horror game,"It was a horror project I kept in the back of my mind, I had no idea where to take it.\n\nYou are a student who attends a public school near the mountains(still thinking of a location), and you are a part of a group of people that are rebellious. This group decides to skip school to go take a trip, going on a ride up by the mountains to go see a movie that shows at midnight. Well, on your way there, it began getting dark, and you and the rest of the guys pull off at an old church to have some fun. Taking the pathway up, the group makes it to the entrance, which gives off a cold chill that one of the guys comment about. Going inside with spray paint cans, and a belief that things will be alright, the group begins spraying down the place with graffiti, in which you, the player, take part of. After that was finished, and you were on your way to leave, things began to get dicey when the floor caved in. You fell through, but the rest were still above you. Where you landed was a form of catacombs under the church, and as you began making your way up the rubble, a screech could be heard, and then screaming. After the footsteps becoming distant, you, the player, are left behind to face whatever comes your way by hiding, sneaking, or running from multiple threats. These threats are angels who were angered by the defacing of the church. Along the way, you will face challenges, puzzles, and discover some history behind the church."

The new one was watching a boyfriend and girlfriend split the controls for counterstrike, one moved, the other shot. It's a very team oriented system, and could be expanded, let's say two giant mechs controlled by multiple people to move arms and legs and use weapon systems, much like a ""Power rangers"" type of setting, fighting either other teams of players or AI monsters. A tank game where one guy controls the driving, one does munitions, and the last aims and fires the cannon, maybe a fourth on a small hatch gun. \n\nI don't want to force anyone to use it, or claim I have any stake in it, but I thought ""THIS IS A GREAT IDEA!!!"" and had to find somewhere to share it, would love to see some games using something like this, either from simple to even the most complicated degree."

3zmead,Ninja game,"The game starts you as a child and you have to go though years of rigorous stealth and assination techniques (even some hand-to-hand). You learn all kinds of martial arts, how to use ninja weapons (shuriken, chain and sickle, nunchucks, daggers, flail, and so on [they have tons of weapons at their disposal, and the more you want to use, the more you have to train]), increase perception of environment, and stealth capabilities. Crafting and personalization (AKA modding) of these weapons would be allowed but within reason. No blood-absorbtion or anything, unless that type of supernatural is a belief in the ninja world. I don't know. The storyline could be that once you become a teen and have established yourself, your sensei or master is killed. In honor of him (which I believe is a big virtue of ninjas), you will hunt and kill his murderer.\n\nWhat do you think? Let me know if I missed anything."
3zlhq7,RTS meets CTF,"HI folks, so I've been brainstorming this idea for quite a few months and decided to share it here to see what you think of it.\n\nI like base building games and RTS (dune2 anyone?). I was initially thinking how I could combine this genre with tower defense games (turn based, very addictive). So I came up with this:\n\n* 2 players per map (maybe more later)\n* each player builds his own base and units every turn\n* every turn you can assign units to attack the other player's base\n* the goal is not to destroy the base, but to capture the player's flag and bring it back, scoring 1 point to you\n* you dont control units, but can define goals/priorities, like: capture the flag, provide cover, attack defense towers, etc...\n\nwhat do you think?"
3zlg44,Headcrab stealth game,"I'd like to share an idea that came to my mind last night. This is a first person stealth game where you play as a headcrab (yup, like one from Half-Life). Bullet-points below describe game-play mechanics without touching the story.\n\n* game consists of separate levels\n* each level has some objective like infiltrating some facility or just killing everyone\n* you may jump onto people's heads, the person becomes your ""host"" and you basically play as normal FPS game\n* when you are in headcrab mode you are small, silent, could pass under furniture or through went holes but can't do actual damage and if spotted can be killed easily \n* when you are in host mode you could use weapons, kill others etc.\n* when you decide to jump off your host he dies immediately but you need to make sure that others do not spot the body\n* if your host was killed while you were still attached you have a chance to survive and scramble away\n* time of you controlling a host could be limited to keep a balance or levels may be designed to make being on the same host all the time not efficient \n* there are things, typical for stealth games like alarm, enemies have proper vision, hearing etc."
3zh38p,Educational,"A game that not only has a wide database of trivial (but mostly useful) facts, but would also be intriguing to the player. It'd be nothing like a math game your teacher would sit you down and force you to play a cheesy and bland game. I don't exactly know how it would accomplish this, but an INFORMATIVE (and possibly a brain-training) role-playing or even a free-roam sandbox type of game would be a nice change. It could contain mandatory minigames maybe or somehow implement that in a better way. The levels of difficulties the game would possess would be entry (for younger children: basic math science, English, and social studies), experienced (algebra, basic biology [including anatomy and health], chemistry, older or more intelligent literature, and in-depth history), and prodigy (minor calculus &amp; physics, advanced chemistry and biology, literature analyzation or from other cultures, further detailed history [and maybe even current governments and/or events???].\n\n\nBetter understanding of each subject will allow you to enter a faction or progress further into it.\n\n\nVoice your opinions and suggestions below, please."
3zgprz,Mars divided- FPS in the vain of fallout,"In the year 2085 mars has been colonized by humans. 25 years later the player character volunteers to launch with the new shipment of recruits and supplies heading to colony. Due to limited resources on the planet and a need for space aboard the costly shuttles, the trip is one way, with the ship and its contents being used to help further the colonies development. As the player learns about the colony they also learn about the only other race inhabiting the planet. The other race is used almost exclusively to further the plot and add excitement and plausibility to the story. Which while sounding stupid is fleshed out in more detail on my Doc.  \n\nMechanics:  \n\n\nStealth/Movement  \n\n\nFocuses on stealth game-play; capturing target A, sabotaging generator B, scouting area C, or retrieve object D. All missions should end with the player attempting to escape the area of operations under overwhelming force. This is to help create a realistic scenario, though stealth escape may often be achievable.  \n	\n\nDialogue  \n\n\nMore or less similar to the dialogue style in fallout: New Vegas. The player is given a list of dialogue options and must work to attain whatever it is they are sent to attain. This is done WITHOUT colored lines that indicate the correct answer, instead making players think about the situation and the options presented. Should the dialogue fail, the player must be able to re-engage in dialogue at least once without penalty. If after a certain amount of failures, the negotiation ends then direct combat is used to allow the player to achieve their goal.  \n	\n\nStrategy/Leadership  \n\n\nThis method of play is similar to an RTS but with much less depth, think RoF with resource use and decision making. The player will either be asked to sort out a conflict, judge a prisoner, assign priorities to tasks, oversea training and morale of units and direct combat missions. This is the most hands off approach to gameplay and is intended to make the player feel like they are a writer of a story then a character in a game. Missions around leadership will be given in chunks and performed depending on the player’s preferences, leaving some missions until later may cause a penalty in success. Direct combat can be used during battles to allow the player to create a plan and then enter into the fray to help achieve this. Should the player choose this option they would replace an entire specials unit, in order to help balance the fight.  \n	\n\nDirect combat  \n\n\nFPS styled combat where the player makes use of the various non-lethal weapons found within the Hub. Due to the non-lethal nature of the weapons opponents may eventually return to the fray, leading some weapons to be harder to use but more lasting while others offer a simple but temporary solution. As the conflict hits its climax the use of lethal weapons will become available and up to the player if they wish to utilize them. This will likely have no effect on the story, but hopefully makes the game more challenging to play as a good character. Due to the options within the game combat will be fairly simple, with only weapons being used, no special abilities or items will be implemented.   \n\n\n\nWeapons:  \n\n\nDue to the peaceful nature of the colony, most weapons in the game are non-lethal. \n\nThis is the skeleton of the game, VERYYYYYYYYY basic concept of what i have done. If anyone wants to talk more about it i'd be happy to share the document or answer any questions. I've got characters, plots mission types, weapons lists, vendor ideas, a faction choice idea cooking, as well as designs for the aliens and the station. If any of that makes ur girl/boyhoods tremble let me know and I might slut out the details.  \n\n\n\n\nSide note: yes the mechanics are a little much, and if i had my millions of dollars from the lottery already i could include them all, but until then i understand that most of these will be chopped up and down scaled (looking at you rts component) if anyone wants to chit chat about more feasible ways to tune the mechanics i'd love to listen. \n\nside side note: i don't know if you know it but this is gonna be kinda maybe possibly a bigish medium sized maybe happily small present sized deal.\n"
3zf7cv,Dreadnaught Alliances,"Basic concept is a frame work similar to game of war, clash of kings genre but make it a space genre. Instead of teleporting around and attacking each other with castles we do it with gigantic dreadnaught battleships. Cool huh!\n\nConcept. You are given, find, or somehow become in control of a hull of a ancient dreadnaught class battle ship. The ships hull is huge, circa 20 mile long and 5 or more miles wide and made of near indestructible carbonic material. You are tasked with getting it back in working order. We start with a top view of the hull with spaces to place various facilities. Once agian it is very similar to this genre but we are now building up a battleship instead of a castle. You could include ship building yards, production. facilities for food, water, hydrogen, carbonic alloys, or whatever else you want to build the game on. Outer hull and defences can also be built and improved. The ships level increases as well and becomes more impressive with each iteration. We need good graphics to drive a players desire to control the biggest ship in the solar system.\n\nThe dreadnaughts are capable of holding thousands of ships of differnet classes and abilities. The ships can be used for farming and attacking. Exampes; fighters, heavy fighters, bomers, interceptors. The small ships use engines based on fusion rockets which are capable of near light speed travel, this makes them imposibble to attack or be attaked while in transit which falls in line with this genre. The dreadnaughts themselves are too large to move under coventional power but, given enough power and the right improvements or equipment they can teleport themselves around similar to the castles of this genre. Random and Advanced teleport options would work well. I would like to see this one a bit more dynamic so easier access to teleporting awould be good. Shielding works in the same way either by building up enough power in a shield generator facility or sourcing the right items. \n\nShips attack in a similar manner to the troops of this genre. Losses can be controlled using salvage facilities similar to hospitals. The dreadnaghts themselves can be stripped of resources, energy and ships but never destroyed completely. \n\nFarming is only done in space, so asteroids, planet rings, hydrogen pockets, comets or whatver else that isn't too far fetched. The planets themselves have far too much gravity to be farmed but could be background objects with greater resources available nearer to planets. Moons might be farmable directly. The sun could be source of energy, I was thinking of a concept where the closer to the sun you are positioned the greater the energy collected but you also shed outer armour plating which then has to be replaced by farming for carbonics. \n\nThe map is a solar system so each server is a solar system instead of the standard kingdom map. The planets and sun can be background with a starfield behind that, the resources and map grid is overlayed on top. Need to experiment with muted backgrounds so it is not too busy to look at. Travel times can be based on real world speed of light, so planet to planet 3 to 30 mins, complete traversal several hours. This should be roughly the same size as maps in other games of this genre.\n\nEverything else can match the genre, with events, alliance building, and possibly a hive build option using space stations and defences. It needs to be heavily alliance based like cok, so teams need to build and work together and against each other and alliances build up, fall and fail.\n\nI haven't worked out random encounters but it would be some sort of allien presence. There could also be an alien oversear of some sort holding events between competing alliances and eventualy handing over control of a solar system to the top alliance.\n\nSo that is about it, standard genre with a difference, make it slighty\nmore dynamic with greater emphasis on moving and you have space based wars on a gigantic scale. If done properly I can see this spinning some serious money.\n\nI bashed this out on an ipad so sorry for all the typos and poor wording. 👍"

Atumaria, is a colossal planet, of 3 Moons, and 2 Suns, One sun of White, One of Red, these Suns represent the 2 Greater Divines, The White Sun, known as Atumis, is a God of Compassion, Mind, and Spiritual ascension. The Red Sun, represents Argundis, not necessarily and evil God, but one of Ferocity, Bravery, War, and Strength. These represent the Greater Divines. The Moons of Atumaria, known as Cison, Fersi, Leki Represent the Lesser Divines. (More on the Gods later) The land of Atumaria, divides itself upon 4 Distinct Regions of land, Fjorland, Ixelarim, Dkasikos, and Vicenta.\nThey are Pronounced.\n\n-F-yor-lan\n\n-Icks-lair-em\n\n-Da-Kas-Iko-s\n\n-Vi-Sen-Ta\n\nEach of these Regions are Broke into many lesser regions.\n\nFjorlan (Tsiv, Aslug, Atuni, Agundum)\n\n-Tsiv\n\nA land, of Low lands, wet swamps, and crackling Ice-waste, a natural barrier to the Fjorland, a place where even the mighty warriors of the Argundii do not go, a Place of Savage primitive beasts men, large Horned Bi-Pedal men, known as Girun (More on the Creatures of Atumaria later)\n\n-Argundum\n\nThe Soft lands as the Argundii call them, home of many Argundii, border by Mountain to Tsiv the people of of this land make the bulk of Argundii. The land here is filled with snow shaved grasslands, and lesser rock formations, the beast are lumbering Herbivores, which provide ample food to grow Strong little Argunsi (Argundii children). It is also however, a place of fierce war, that has come about by such small squabbling that most of the known ""Civilized"" world look upon the Argundii as Savage barbarians. Many tribes scatter this land.\n\n\n-Atuni\n\nLand of 10 Peaks, situates itself upon the Mountains known as the Silver peaks, wrapping between Tsiv and Argundum, heading north and circling around the East of Argundum. This land is of harsh, cold, and dense snowfall. Scattered with large thickets of Red-Pine (A Mega Tree, 4x The Size of Earth Pines) They say kings are born in this land, as they are sun-touched by the God's themselves upon birth, Home of more prominent Argundii Religious leaders.\n\n-Aslug\n\nThe Farthest point to the East of the Fjorland. A Dark, thicket of Continuous Pines, Blackened by the sole mountain (Argaivus) that spews ash Daily. Known as the Gods Wrath Plains to Outsiders, the Argundii have come to know this place as a Natural barrier to the Vicentari, and a out-touching of their chosen god Argundis, as such this is the land of Berserk(s) and only the brave dare join its ranks.\n-Hello all, if you would like me to continue developing the world, or going into detail please, give me some feedback on what you think so far.

Dubbed Cochletehc by the many tribes of Ixelarim, known as the Riverlands to outsiders, consist of a Savanna style setting, mixed with many rivers, flowing inwards from the Sea known as ""The Cauldron"", while to hot to drink from, these mighty rivers have become suitable breathing grounds for many heat born ailments, passed along by the many insects living near the proximity to such heat sources. Though that would seem the worst of it, these northern Savanna lands are shaded by the Burning Steppe, a Colossal cliff to the east. This essentially keeps Cochletehc in perpetual Darkness.\n\n-Ixesaini\n\nKnown to the tribes of Ixelarim, as the Kings Jewel, home of mighty temples, twisted vine-wood jungle lands, and a warm rain. If Cochletehc could be considered a hellish place of dry grasslands, and diseased rivers Ixesaini is its equal in perpetual beauty. They say the Rain falls Red with gods blood, but in reality soaring westward, from the Red Sea, over the Thicatti Islands, the lands are painted a hinted Red, with rich waters. This has blessed Ixesaini with a lush, dense home jungle, rich in soil, fertile in life, where rivers run red, where trees grow upwards of 100 feet in height, a land to thrive in.\n\n-Chihclat\n\nAbove, Ixesaini, follow the rivers north, climb the vine cliffs, press upon the waterfalls you will find Chihclat, a holy land for the Ixelarim, though do not let this fool you, the rising mists from Ixesaini, offer supplemental amounts of oxygen to the fauna, insects and animals here. It is truly a place of Natures beauty, rare and exotic things even by Ixelarim standards can be found here, but at a price. It is not uncommon for and Ixelarti to take a religious pilgrimage, and yet never make it to the holy site.\n\n-Thicatti Islands\n\nTo the South beyond Ixesaini, lies 6 distinct islands, each taking the name of a Ixelarti god. They say, that for each god, there is a mortal representation that must be offered sacrifice. The island's inhabit every form of the god representing it, they are mostly unsettled aside from the beast like creatures that roam the islands, however not much is known about these mysterious fog covered islands aside from size, and color do to the carnivorous nature of the local inhabitants.\n\n-Heavens Crest\n\nA sort of Anomaly in the lands of Atumaria, representing a Holy land to all life on Atumaria. Heavens Crest is the only known floating ""Island"" if it can be called that to persist within the Common world (Not Including the Dread Lands). Unlike the Dread lands, and the unholy energy that persist there, Heavens crest is said to warm the body, bring life, and even resurrect the dead when in proximity of the Golden waters that pour from its falls, over the sides and to ""The Cauldron"" below. The Island itself, represents its own unique take for every people of Atumaria, but stands consistent in its shape and design for all, Golden Rivers, A Crystal like Soil Base, and Silver tipped Fauna. It is unknown if anything lives upon this Island, as any mortal man whom approaches, seems to vanish as golden dust to the wind. No bodies have ever been found.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nAUTHORS NOTES\n\n\nHey guys, thanks for reading this bit of an update, I've always struggled with Aztec Style lands, as you can tell I was really interested in Heavens Crest, and not so much on the Jungle. Don't worry however, as it will all be refined, up next the Caliphate, which bares a very Arabian resemblance, and then the Vicentari the Roman style civilization. You can expect much detail from those two, they will be playing huge roles in this world.\n\nAgain it's all Alpha in lore, and this is subject to change.\n\nThanks for reading\n\n-JayTrim.\n\nP.S\n\nThankyou McPluffel for taking interest and helping in design!     \n \nEdited: 1/13/2015"
3zcbjv,A game inspired by Die Hard,"Like a game where, like in Die Hard, you have to save hostages.\nYou need to take down one by one the thieves or terrorists, in a randomly generated map or a scenario (So you can have multiples play-through). For that you'll have to sneak around and gather resources to help you kill the ""bad guys"".\nWhat do you think ?\n\n"
3zbt2l,The House of Omnia - Briefly explained [EDITED],"I thought about an idea for a grant-scale game that would combine many of the strategic based game genres together, or so I think, while also adding action ;). And i would also like to say, right here in the start, that this game idea is not even close to finished, but I thought I would air the idea in here.\n\nFor this medieval-based game, I have actually created my own world, called Omnia (also not finished), in which the game would take place.\n\n\nIn the realm of Omnia, civilization has begun to sprout and great cities like Grondur, Compitum and South Harbor are all cities that have over 10.000 citizens after the first city of Krea was created just over 500 years ago. However things are not perfect and therefore your character has decided to leave your home behind (which is one of the already existing cities). Also unsatisfied with the treatment, they have received by your former home, a small number of citizens have decided to join you on your journey, and together with them you form your new city where you become the lord family. As lord, you have a line of responsibilities to keep the city from falling apart. Even if you keep your city fine and shiny it is never completely safe as other houses can come to claim your land by warfare. Maybe you have pissed them off, maybe you're just unlucky to have caught their eye, but this feature brings you some action in the form of real time action warfare.\n\n\n**Mechanics**\n\n - I don't think i can narrow this down to a single game genre, so im just going to call it; Realtime roleplaying strategygame.\n\n - The POV would be a change between 1. and 3. person view.\n\n - The interaction with AI would be along the lines of Fallout 4 and the Telltale Games (Move freely around and talk to everyone with a number of different sentences to say to each individual).\n\n - The AI itself should be able to run other houses, both big and small, as well as being able to communicate with the player (something like civilization V, but in RTS).\n\n - Graphics is low priority in this game, as i believe that the most important part with strategy games is that it is running on a somewhat logical and functioning algorythm.\n\n - Fighting style is tricky to me because i would like to be like Skyrim which is high quality graphics. What i find boring about games like AOE, Civ V or Warcraft is that the fighting sequences are dull. I want my character to be in the mud with his soldiers, with the fear of dying (maybe even a permadeath mechanic) and potentially losing your character forever, so definetly not these godcontrolling fighting sequences.\n\n\nNow this would mainly be a game that could be played offline and in single player, like Fallout or Skyrim. An online platform could be considered, but I would like to focus on the single player part. However this is a vast game and I would like it to be a game where you can keep discovering which means I want many stories from the 500 years of modern civilization the realm has already experienced, before the user is set in the game and therefore I thought it might be fun if I let some of you write/create some of the historical events and geographical places in the realm. Hell, if enough people find it interesting I might create a subreddit so other game mechanics can be discussed. Let me hear what you think!"

3zaua4,The House of Omnia - Briefly explained,[deleted]
3z9peb,X-Files Goblins game,"There is a novel of *X-Files* whose title is *Goblins*. In it there is a genetically modified soldier able to change her skin color at will, camouflaging in dimly lit places like a chameleon. \n\nA game where we manage someone like she could be good: it would be a stealth game in third person, which would have to infiltrate enemy bases and killing with a knife. As *Splinter Cell* but without resorting to devices or firearms, but biological capabilities as camouflage, increased agility and reflexes."
3z911y,Last of us/State of decay,"**MAIN IDEA**\nSo I think I have a pretty good idea for a zombie survival like game. It wouldn't be multiplayer and would be a serious game like The Last of Us. I really enjoyed the Last of us but imagine if it had an open world with quests and endless gameplay, so a sandbox. It would have a really fluid and free engine (if you played the last of us you would know it looked really free and characters moved fluid but it didn't fell like it.) so characters and the environment felt alive.        \n**NEEDS/SCAVENGING**\nThe game would have a needs system (Food Water Safety) for if you choose to have a group. You can be alone but it is very dangerous because you have no help. Scavenging would be a major part of the game, you need food, water and ammo. Each day without food or water will mean your maximum health will lower and you won't be able to run or carry as much.                                                               \n**SAFEHOUSES**\nThe game would have a safe house like mechanic think like the prison and Woodbury in The Walking Dead, but it would take heaps and heap of time and effort to get a secure safe house. At first it would be completely open and is almost impossible to settle so when you go out to scavenge you might find some wooden pallets which you can use to fortify your building, lot or town. The safe house system is mostly late game because of how it takes time but if you devote your time to it and actively find fortifications and materials you can get it done. It wouldn't be a mine craft like building method, you have to unload the materials from the car or wherever they are and slowly carry them depending on the material to where you want it to go. Each fortification will have a forification grade so if you have 5 wooden boards you would have a fortification rating of 5, materials stronger than wood provide bigger ratings. Note that depending on how big you want your safe house/stronghold to be it will take longer to make.                                                                                   \n**STORY**\nThe game needs to be serious and have a sense to the player that this is their story. When I played skyrim the first time I did the main story as fast as I could and that was my character the dragon born. Each time I played through it again I had a different feeling and ended up being a thief not fighting dragons, another time a bard, I think you get what I mean. The story would still be a big part of the game, and it would need to show how the world is hell and there is a great amount of loss and cruelty, it would need to make the player have genuine feelings.                                                                     \n**CONCLUSION** \nThanks for reading through all that, I did this for fun I don't expect someone to take it seriously just sharing my thoughts and ideas. Thanks.\n\n"

44o5xt,Apocalypse Ideas,"This is the post to share your ideas for an original apocalypse for a game. Here is mine:\nRecolonization: Billions of years into the future the sun had finally died out collapsing on itself but at a final chance of survival it started swallowing stars into itself becoming brighter and bigger until-BOOM!-it gained so much mass it went supernova purging the earth of all its life. This event was called 'The Cleansing' billions of years later many alien species came to this burnt up planet seeking a home this sparked a war fighting for resources and land.\n\nMore realistic: To make it a little more realistic and able to be playable here is a better outcome: Just an idea, maybe since the sun can't really reach that mass, the supernova is just a very strong solar storm/solar wind that shuts down earth's communications and sends civilization into chaos and raises temperatures to the extremes characters having to utilize special suits in zones closer to the equator as there is heavy uv radiation there"

I assume he just meant have more diversity than just swords and basic magic. Also, forgot to mention this game would be an rpg just with all the properties previously mentioned. The art style would be that similar of Castle Crashers.

You wait five minutes later, open the door, and it’s a completely different maze now. The player must learn to clock these sequences, especially aiding them in evasion.

The goal of the game is to unravel the maze, learning it inside and out, a metaphor for no longer being lost in your decision, and finally completing all the levels. Also, the mazes have a tendency to clash, a metaphor for you having to head from one path to another, the influences clashing.\n\nMaze Floors:\n\n-Girlfriend – Jenna Ross, the player’s girlfriend, patrols this maze floor.

I do care a lot about the quality of the things I make. I will not make or publish anything that would feel unfinished, rushed, unprofessional, or just plain bad.\nI don't want to work in any kind of team, at least not with the technical bits. I am willing to develop an idea together with someone, but I'd prefer to work on the technical details by myself.\n\n**The technical part:**\nMy skills and the tools that I'm using would allow me to develop mostly 2D games, but also simpler 3D ones as well.

For the genre, I'm thinking of either a normal story-based game, or maybe horror^[1].\n\n1: horror does not equal a bunch of jumpscares!

I LOVED the first WOTM and a sequel would make me cry tears of joy.  30 playable monsters, Unique individualized story modes, MASSIVE boss fights, unlockable characters (to make the total 30), and possibly customizable monsters? 5+ skins for all monsters, Map weather settings, more combo moves/grabs, progressive 'leveling' up mechanic for monsters you play the most with. etc.(i have more ideas but like i said, no essays tonight!)\n\n#2 - Super Smash Bros (cartoon network style/Title not solidified) - Title says it all, a super smash bros style game with all the playable characters being from cartoon network shows, so a few in the roster would be: Courage the cowardly dog, Johnny Bravo, Ed Edd and Eddy, Samurai Jack, Fin and Jake, Dexter's Laboratory, powerpuff girls, Cow and Chicken, Scooby Doo...the list goes on. not much further explanation would be needed, move controls would be generally the same depending on the platform this is released on.\n\n#3 - Jungle Warfare - Kinda like a CoD game but instead of guns and knives and grenades, your weapons would be spears, blow darts, sharpened rocks as knives, clubs, axes, bow and arrows, things like that and all the maps would be different jungle settings and you could select perks (faster running, more hp, etc) - again a rough idea but i think it would be a very interesting addition to the FPS genre.\n\nI have more ideas up in my head but i just really wanted to get these 3 out in the world and see what people think.  If you have any questions about what &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; have in mind for these games id love to expand on these ideas if any of you guys got questions! THANKS :DDD"

440f3t,I was thinking of a horror game that could be pretty cool. Any thoughts?,"I'm sure there is a game like this, but I haven't heard of one. I thought it would be cool to have a horror game where you aren't the victim but you're actually the killer. I think the real horror would be seeing how meticulous and gruesome people would be. In the game there could be a large number of ways to murder someone and even more ways to dispose of bodies. I think it would be cool to have the game continue solely depending on your actions in the game. For example if you were stalking a woman and snuck into her bedroom and waited for her to come home, kill her then decide to leave her body at the scene of the crime... Maybe have something that indicates that the police are on to a suspect. I was thinking maybe on the news or in the paper or something. I think it would be a cool way to really get into the game where you would actually have to pay attention to stuff like that. Would love to hear other ideas from people. It would be cool if someone picked this idea up and ran with it. Anyways just thought id share an idea with you all. "

There will be obstacles and things to make sure you dont stay on the single path but the idea is to try and make it around the ring as many times as you can before you run out of panels to wall on or fall through the ring and lose. Story is maybe that its a game show in a tron like enviroment. Probably best as a mobile game. Could even use the gyroscope in your phone to turn the screen or something\n
43yblk,Stone age =&gt; Bronze age,"It's a pretty grand idea, but in some way or another I could see it work in a scaled down way.\n\nThe way I see it, is you start of in a far cry primal context: just a bunch of small stone age villages where people live in tents. You could perhaps even be able to pick a people/tribe to be in.\n\nBasically from then on the game's core mechanics evolve around assigning tribe members with vocations. There are hunters, farmers, tanners, shamans, weavers, warriors, cattlefarmers, etcetera.\n\nFrom there on it's about making advancements. Here is where the player comes into play. Through missions he has to make important discoveries. For instance: you start off with fire, then leatherworking, then farming, then you invent the wheel, ... eventually you will move on to assigning smiths to work copper and then bronze, miners for your stone quarry to make bricks, coopers for wine/beer barrels and horsebreeders because you learnt to tame horses during a mission. In other words: you work towards entering the bronze age.\n\nIf a storyline is added, I'd suggest the life's path of a man: step 1 is from a boy to a man: the road to becoming a respected warrior in your tribe. step 2 is becoming a father, where literally a child is involved in the story, not unlike Bioshock. Finally step 3 is about the story of becoming a king to your people."

43wf1l,[Request]Need help with a rogue lite/like game idea,So I am thinking of making a game with some features like this :\n\n1. Big world\n2. Altering the world\n3. AI with lots of entities\n4. Possible multiplayer making it a strategy\n5. Have some kind of offspring to continue your legacy which takes some of your stats\n6. Have many options of achieving victory\n7. Possibly stealthy?\n8. To have an offspring you need to sacrifice something\n9. You die if you don't have off-springs and the world changes to a new one\n10. If you do have off-springs you continue as one of them\n11. Main goal\n\n	a. Demons destroying the world\n\n	b. Virus infecting everything\n\nBasically I have my main inspiration out of Rogue Legacy but I want to make it with the big altering world features. But I am having difficulties thinking of a good main goal. I thought a little bit about the thing with demons destroying the world while leaving off springs and being killed if your intentions are discovered. But I can't think of many ways achieving the goal of destroying the world. So anyone have any ideas?\n\nedit: Sorry about the flair duplication but this is my first post here and I didn't knew how it worked.
43w2zi,I want some unique game features to add to my game.,"I am in the process of creating a game (a retro top down shooter game with a sort of simplistic art style.

43uort,"""The Pruge"" Rogue-Lite","when I watched ""The purge"" I thought it would be a good idea for video game. but what type of game? How about a rogue lite where it actually matters if you live or die to see the next day. Even though it would be a simple game on paper the gameplay would include Hiding, self defense/melee, Shooting, ect. as well as defensing your home days before the purge. you can be a purger and kill the people you hate or you can stay in your house and attempt to fend off the purgers who hate you. Will you survive the purge? "

Think it's a good idea for a free fan game?"

3wxgiw,The Hunger Games - First person survival + combat with other survivors.,"After watching the hunger games films and playing it on Minecraft, I had a feeling that this game just had to be made.\n\nThis game should probably be a 24 or 12 player game. It will follow the main Hunger Games rules and mechanics which are in the film such as: the death cannon; the cornucopia (the bunch of loot in the middle of the arena e.g: knifes, swords, bows) which is surrounded by all of the spawn points in a circle and maybe some extra features such as the clock in the Catching Fire film.\n\nHope this game will be able to make it past copyright issues.

Let's say the priests god is real, then what would the daily life of the priest be?  \n\nThere's games where you're a fighter collecting bounties and other things, well what about a priest?  \nMaybe you even have some kind of priest-like power, maybe you have to give offerings for your god.  what would the mechanics for the game be?  The objective?    \n\n*  Maybe you're begging for gold, and the game is about ways a priest can collect money.  \n*  Maybe you're converting people to your religion.  \n*  Maybe you're trying to remove a curse.  \n*  Maybe you're healing people and performing miracles in gods name.  \n*  Maybe you're competing with other priests of different religions in accomplishing something\n\nMaybe even a cool game that somehow allows the player to pick their religion at the start that changes their objective/playstyle.  Looking for actual mechanics to work with to start developing now.  \nLooking for a game that would be played for all ages and preferably is light hearted."

3wtguq,A 2D Isometric RTS game based on 90's Strategy games mixed with some modern gameplay Mechanics,"Hi guys, it's pretty late from where I'm at so I'll try to make this quick but concise, I'm planning on making this game but first I need some feedback from people to know if they'll like it, and if it's possible. So bear with me here, because I've got a lot to write. Thanks!\n\n\nThe Idea: A 2D isometric real-time strategy game that serves as a ""love letter"" to those old 90's Westwood Studios RTS games (Games like CnC Red Alert, Tiberian Sun, Dune 2, etc.), but with the inclusion of modern mechanics like a cover system for troops/infantry, line of sight, and a small amount of RNG like Company of Heroes\n\nThe Theme: A Retro-Futuristic/Dieselpunk Real Time Strategy game set in an alternate reality Korean War, where the U.N. and U.S. Forces are pitted against the East Asian Socialist Alliance (EASA) which include China and North Korea.\n\n\nThe Concept:\n\nSingle Player\n-Depending on which faction the player picks (U.S. U.N. or EASA), they will be presented with an interactive map of the Korean peninsula. Here they can click on available territories, which are highlighted if there are missions to be done. as the player progresses and completes missions, those territories will then be part of your territory. The player wins once all missions are completed and all territories are taken.\n\n-FMV Cutscenes will play occasionally to show how the story is progressing and where it's heading. (could also just be slides of art depending on the time frame and budget) If it's cutscenes they'll usually won't be very serious and will be tongue-in-cheek just like the old CnC.\n\n-Gameplay will be very strategic, with the player having access to different types of units at their disposal, and will be given new types of units as the game progresses. There will be base-building, but main buildings (like barracks, tank factories) in single player will be confined to areas near the HQ, while the player will be allowed to build defenses and outposts almost anywhere outside their base.\n\n-As mentioned earlier there will be the inclusion of modern mechanics, players will have to make use of cover system for infantry (where cover will be presented by different colored dots depending on the quality of its protection), use line of sight to recon/set ambushes when necessary, and have *a bit* of RNG for projectiles like rockets, grenades, shots to give the game a bit of unpredictability.\n\n-There will be some missions where the game will feature huge battles with tanks, mechs, infantry, and aircraft working together/fighting each other, and more tactical missions where the player is only given a small squad of ""Specialized"" units to complete the mission. These specialized units will also replace the base building mechanics since they will be the ones who'll have the ability to call in a certain number of types of units (You can't spam medics here!), so the player will have to play very cautiously and cleverly to keep their specialized units alive, and complete the objectives.\n\nMultiplayer\n-It will be like the conventional Singleplayer missions in terms of scale, the tactical features will still be there, but no ""specialized"" units to ruin the balance. It'll be the usual ""Deathmatch"" mode for now since that's the best of what I can think of.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\n-The game will have 2D isometric graphics, with 2D sprites for characters, effects, everything else."
3wsba8,A mechanics idea,"Seeing the Minecraft mod tinkers construct and the smeltery it has made me think.  What if in a game you had to smelt metals and cast them to make your gear.  First you would have to make the mold.  Then you'd have to gather the metal you wanted it to be made of.  After that you would smelt the materials, and cast the parts.  A cleanup and assembly process. Finally after that you have your gear.  This could keep people from rushing to the top tier and reward some form of infrastructure.  For the casting system I was thinking you would have to hand chisel your first mold or make one with sand or wax.  Maybe the type of mold used could be a modifier to quality."

3wqz5o,The Avatar Knows It's Being Controlled,"Idea\nYour Character in this type of game knows that it is in a video game, and it knows that it's being controlled. To get this effect, the character would have to talk directly to the player in many cases or talk to NPC's about the player.\n\nWhy It Would Be Successful/ Fun To Play\nWith this idea, the game can be very ominous and knowing of the human being playing the game, or it can have a sense of humor that not many games have been able to accomplish.\n\nI really would like to see this in a game, so go ahead and use this mechanic.\n\nIf you wish to credit me, use the username LinkGamer456."
3wqvop,The Rules Are Up To You,"This is a game that seems a little complicated to make, but something I have always wanted to see.\nIn this game, you have to fight against the game to change the rules. It is pretty open, and with this concept, the game can vary to whatever is convenient for the maker of the game.\nI would love to make this game myself, but as a single person, this game would take far to long to make.\nIf you would like to use this idea, by all means take it. I would love to see people playing through this idea."

3wl4xe,A game based around the mechanic of moderate and complex npc schedules.,"I thought of an idea for a game that I had fun thinking about. \nSteming from the fairly basic npc daily and nightly schedules in some western open world role playing games and how fun it is for some to learn and study an npc' pattern in the process of a final goal. I thought it would be neat to have an open-ish style first person perspective game hinging on the mechanic of studying and learning characters schedules. (When they might leave for work, be getting a phone call, or be going to a location) being able to manipulate the world in ways to ""force"" diversions to get the outcome for you to complete your task also. (Murder, thievery, framing for a crime, or as a role for the FBI or Stealth team of some sort) a loose overarching story could be a character that progresses through ranks. Maybe start as a teenage thug to an eventual informant for the police where a fork in story would be to either take a positive path to Cia, fib, green berets? Or from informant to prison escaping from prison to grander and grander heists. Each rank involving scenarios to reflect your current situation. What are some thoughts or ideas maybe? I understand this game could not be for everyone."
3wjske,Item based platformer,"Had the idea knocking around for a while so fuck it time to share. The idea is a bit of a mixing between Harvest Moon and generic platforming, with a main town you start in and would have to help prosper. To do this you'd have to go into branching levels that can provide different resources depending on the tools you brought. Simple four tool system.  \n\n\nAxes can cut down trees, wood, and doors to make bridges out of felled trees, break into sealed mines, clear branches you can't jump over and using the hook of the axe to slightly extend you jump, as well as collect exotic woods and other tree based goodies. \n\n\nPicks would be able to crack into stones and crystals to enter untouched caverns to collect minerals and gemstones, and be used to scale large walls as a sort of climbing tool. \n\n\nFishing rods would be used as a sort of grappling hook to cross large gaps and grab far away goodies. Aswell as the expected fishing to collect food or lost treasures \n\n\nFinally the sword would be your expected combat tool, being much more efficient against most enemies to slay your way to loot. Used of course to cut up enemies and just that, taking back meats, bones, and other critter based goodies. They would also be used to create a wall slide effect to safely fall down pits (Which would previously just kill you) to access little mini dungeons.\n\n\n\nThe player would only be able to hold two tools at one time from the start, however as their hometown gets better new smiths will move in that could let the player make a multi-tool. These tools would choose two parts from any tools to combine, such as a Sword-Axe which could either cut trees and allow slow fall, kill monsters and cut trees, kill critters and hook things, or slow fall and hook things.\n\n\nSpeaking of the town it's growth would directly affect the player in the form of better, faster, more durable tools, stronger armor, and bigger loot sacks. It would also slowly unlock new areas as people leave to create new settlements which effectively means you've beaten the 'world' of that town. Each town would also work as a sort of crafting station to put together new armor and tools, increase and restore health, and to hire up to one minion that can carry an extra tool at the cost of resources. Of course you can take your two tools, armor, and loot on hand into the next town but hirelings wouldn't follow so you can either ferry items back and forth or start over with the new area's resources.\n\n\n\nThe story wouldn't be terribly important, you're an adolescent from a small village that is slowly dying due to the safe to gather resources running low and you've taken it upon yourself to venture out and save your home town. Slowly the goal shifts from simple survival to expansion, ultimately to founding a small kingdom.\n\n\nFinally a few side mechanics would be:\n\nStamina, a slowly dropping meter that keeps you running. Stamina would go down passively at a very low rate, slightly more when running and moderately when gathering or fighting (Faster tools effectively lessening the burden). It can be restored mid level from food that takes up space in your loot sack or spending time to rest or eating some loot. When stamina hits 0 the player is slowed to a normal walking speed unable to run or gather and fighting significantly weakened.\n\n\nTime passing would come into play to an extent, mornings would have more plants to collect and night more monsters to slay and pass fast when the player rests making long unprepared trips more hazardous.\n\n\nThats about it, never put too much thought into so maybe someone here can tweak it. Feel free to."
3wjqh2,An Animal Crossing-esque game where you aspire to be mayor... in two very different methods...,"You recently move into town. You're fairly new. For whatever reason, you want to be the mayor. You will not stop until you're mayor. The only thing is, in this town, voting for the mayor MUST be totally unanimous, 100% YES. The game is happy, bright, and cheerful.\n\nWin your neighbours' votes by being helpful, friendly, generous to them. Prove that you can do a better job than the current mayor (who's already doing a pretty decent job) and win all the votes.\n\nRemember: 100% of the citizens must vote yes.\n\nUnless...\n\nWhat is 1 divided by 1? What is one person out of one person?\n\n100%.\n\nChoose to either win the votes, or eliminate the competition. Stealthily eliminate the other citizens, and then you'll be 100% secured. Ensure to not draw suspicion to who's slowly killing the population.\n\nThis game idea was something I made up while watching an Undertale genocide run. I had an Animal Crossing-esque game on my mind already, and I decided ""Why not make it as potentially dark and eerie as Undertale could be?"" I may be planning to develop this game, although I'd like to put the idea out first to see if anyone else would be interested.\n\nEDIT: Another substory section could be that the first person you help and win the vote of is a gentle old lady, but she inevitably passes away, returning your votes to zero. Something could allude to the fact that ""even though we are one less citizen, the mayor's votes still remain at 100%."" Something at the start has to peek at the fact that you could potentially murder everyone, but it'll still have to remain fairly ambiguous. "
3wjcdl,Mobile game idea. Dungeon crawler akin to darkest dungeons,"After a many game jams and some very basic games made and released on the app store, I want to try my hand at something more serious. Releasing a bigger mobile game. I'm really into RPGs and simulation games. Lately, been playing alot of darkest dungeons on pc and fallout shelter on my mobile phone and was trying to come up with an idea, that lets you build up your base, where you can improve and receive new champions, that you can send to dungeons to fight and collect materials in. The dungeons should be something similar, akin to DD, that relies on fighting rather than exploration. Sadly, i'm lacking i nthe idea department and could use your help.\n\nAny suggestions and help would be greatly appreciated."

3wiwg5,[Match-three-game] Toxin/Virus (Mobile),"Everyone knows games like Candy Crush and they are still trending.  \n  \n\n\nThe Artstyle of the game would look as if Poison or a Virus is taking over the playing field step by step.  \n\nMy Idea:  \n\n * One or Multiple tiles are ""Infected"" at the start (the player may or may not choose which tiles before the actual gameplay starting)  \n\n * Only Matches adjacent to a already infected tile will spread the Virus/Toxin  \n * Winning condition would be to Infect all tiles within a time or move limit  \n * All the standard ""Match-three"" Power-ups could work here as well, but Infection still spreads only if adjacent tiles are removed  \n * There could be a unique power-up, however, that adds a new independent Infected Tile"
3whung,"[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas.","(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)\n\nSo, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!\n\n**But! But.**\n\nA lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)\n\n&gt;Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.\n\nSounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:\n\n&gt;Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!\n\nOkay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?\n\n&gt;By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!\n\nOkay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.\n\nBut what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:\n\n&gt;It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.\n\n**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.\n\nI hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.\n\n**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment ""gameplay loop"", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**"
3whboq,My Video game Idea,"First of all, you should know i have a very vast mind. I've created in total; 68 games just from my head. So, i want to discuss one i made recently.\n\nThe game takes place in a village; a son of a mayor. The Mayor is very selfish, unlike the son, putting his life in front of others. A giant floating Dragon Egg is in the sky, and is hatching it's first skin (Which is huge chunks of obsidian and stone) and is raining across the regions. [The legends will be in the end]. The legends indicated that the Queen Dragon was still alive, and if another baby was made, the Elemental Master has to slay it with the power of the Crystal Archer, and the sages. Anyways, now that huge chunks of Obsidian is raining and blowing up the fields, you can expect leftovers. After the boy had finished taking everyone to the mansion, he picked up a sword and slayed Blisters (a type of molted rock enemy) and a uncle watched behind.. carefully. Next morning, the boy heard rumor about a huge maze of obsidian was in the area, found by the Mayor and his search team. They came back and said that they were thrown into the air when they found treasure. They said a border of elements had knocked them out of the maze, and it felt like they were denied from their goal. So, the boy goes into the maze. He reaches the invisible border, but notices it isnt there. He also notices there isn't treasure. Just a hole. He then remembered the legends: ""Whatever you desired in the holy presence, will be there for you to grieve."" Also known as torture. The boy jumps in the hole, and notices a glowing sword, and a very odd place. 8 elemental biomes laid in front of him. In the middle, the Holy Sword of Life: The Elemental Blade. 5 sages awoken, and told him to touch the sword. When he did, his future flashed in front of him: he found out he was the Elemental Master. With this, he finds what to do next; get to the leaf element. And from there, the boy goes on an adventure...\n\nWhat is my game based on? Zelda, specifically. It's a completely open world adventure, where the character chooses his next method. He can find puzzles, claim Gems, Elements, and Money.  The game lets you choose your pattern. \n\n\n[Legends]\nFrom years to years, a legend is chosen as the Elemental Master, which was this particular boy. There was a Dragon Queen, who was actually nice, until the Elemental Master had slain a Dragon by accident, when he was testing his Thunder Element. The Queen cursed the Elemental Branch, and hence it rivaled against sages, and others. "

3wgyh7,Active clicker/idle game,"I love clicker/idle games but the very nature of the genre tend to leave me bored pretty quickly.\n\nI thought of a way to try to counter that. Make the clicker/idle aspect of the game secondary.\n\nExample: A free roaming hero, side scroller or top down, questing/fighting game where the questing/fighting earns you money to upgrade your trainers. Your trainers will upgrade your stats idly. Strength, Speed, Health, the works, you can even have a trainer generate lives for when you die. Or switch it up to when you die you resume playing as a character that your trainers have been leveling, making the active character have set skills until he/she dies and is then replaced by the next hero in line that was being leveled by your upgraded trainers from your last run."
3wenv9,What would be a good successor to Recettear? (Go into detail please.),"I'm looking for some comments that are more than one sentence, I'm genuinely curious about this.  It doesn't have to be about being in an item shop, but a game that brings the same kind of experience.  \n\nAlso, keep it an indie experience, something one guy can make it within 3 years.  \n\nI liked the Economics to Recettear and the formula it used for the game allowing you to play it for tons of hours."

But if it were to be a football game done with robots, sparks flying and metal crashing, I'd play it.\n\n\nI'd never play a NBA game. But if done in mechs with boosters and damage, I'd play it.\n\n\n\nSee the theme? Bet I'm not the only one who feels this way. Thing is though no one seems to want to make these kinds of games. And the thing with mechas and robots is you can easily customize them, and get more unique characters than you can if you were stuck with people."

3w7xuc,Dinosauromorpha,"A young scientist develops a way to breed dinosaurs out of existing lizards species. The new species is deemed to dangerous by other scientists and the project is shut down, with everything in the lab about to be destroyed. \n\nThe scientist saves one baby dinosaur and tries to escapes. Later he is chased by police and lets the creature go into the forest. As a consequence the new species finds a way to develop and multiply. Later the same scientist joins a team to hunt the species down in the dark forest and a horror movie like scenery. The species develops so rapidly that after many days during which the team tries to clear the forest, the whole city is overtaken by a weird, fast evolving, dinosaur-like creatures. As the player tries to fix one problem, many more emerge.\n\nFirst part of the game is an adventure like trying to find a small creature and get out of the lab. Later the mission is to escape as silently as possible through the city and get away from the police. Both parts contain the player with a living creature, that is easy to damage and needs to survive. Second part starts in the woods and the objective is to kill as many adult and young dinosaurs as possible with light weapons. Third part goes back to the city and shows the same places, but everything is destroyed. In the third part the player gets more heavy weapons and vehicles to move through the city. The game ends at the same lab, where everything started, which is used as a last outpost for the last surviving city residents.\n\nThe game starts a 3rd person action-adventure and morphs into a 3rd person action-horror story.\n\nLots of possibilities for sequels.

3w6llz,Game of life Idea,"What if there was an open world/ sand box game that was gta5 (online) and sims mixed together with the graphics of infamous second son that was always online. \n\nThe main objective would be to be successful. The game itself would be pretty simple, no story or anything your literally living your own virtual life like playstation home. The game would consist of virtual interaction, choices and mini games. \n\nWhat makes this game different is your free to do  what ever you want but actions have outcomes. The game would start by creating your character you are born as a kid and grow up. Everyday you're required to clean yourself and work out this will determine your attractiveness and health. When you move out you'll have to find a job or income this will determine what clothes you'll get what house you can buy car etc... jobs are minimal but diverse you can go into cleaning, health sports art music business construction government and crime. If you attend school chances of getting jobs are higher. So basically you find your own way to make money to survive. If you die you start at your last save point. So your life is not only affected by the choices you make but by other players. The game rewards good players and punishes bad ones. When you reach old age and you wanna create a new player you die. \n\nThe main portion of the game is your interaction with friends you can meet other online players throw parties even start a family with another online player and have cpu children you have to take care of until they are older. You will be able to cheat rob kill fight destroy build share money and items \n\nExample of a possible situation in the game: You and your online friends buys drugs get caught option are to take the fall or blame a friend you blame your online friend and he gets sent to jail you continue through school become a business man your friend is let out with little options for a career and pursues crime you have all the fancy things in the game but your friend robs your house. you lose everything so you call police which will be another online persons duty to catch him and return your stuff if he decides to."

3xinvd,MOBA meets RPG,"I have a nice idea for a game, but I don't know much about programming and I really want to play this game.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\n\nThere are 2 large factions: the Tree of Life (TOL) and the Citadel(CTD). You make your character and jump into first-person 30v30/60v60 battles(why this large amount of players? Because there is no respawn and a 5v5 would take like 10 seconds). It's a pretty huge map, and a large amount of players, so cooperation and coordination it's the key of success. You have to conquer outposts and towers and use them as strategical points. So this game it's half rpg, half moba, but the nice side it's that you're not limited by classes, you can make your own!\n\n\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\n\nYou start making your character by selecting the sex and body-build (small - best for scouts and agility based characters; medium - best for bruisers and strength based characters; heavy - best for tanks) and faction. Now you select your race. Next step is customizing its appearance. Name it and name your class and you're done. To be more specific, you want to make an agility based character so you name your class ""thief"" and you are equipping your character light armors and some fast daggers, some stealthy skills (yes, skills and spells are also equipable). That's not all, if you want an agile character, you will invest more points in the agility part of the passive-skill tree.\nYour character had the basic slots like the weapon slot, armor slot, etc; but he has something special called kit slots and accessories slot. An accessory can be a necklace, a bracelet, you know, things like this. A kit it's an active item that can give you certain advantages ( you have an archer, you can equip the flaming arrows kit and set noobs on fire). Every accessory slot and kit slot are unlocked together (first slots at lvl 1, second slots at level 10, 3rd at 25, etc). You start with with 4 skill slots, you unlock 1 at lvl 45 and 1 more at lvl 90.\n\nI don't want to bore any of you with my ideas so i'm done right now. I know it is a game hard to make, but if there are many of you interested you can contact me and we will assemble a team.\n\nMy email: snoweffect05@gmail.com\n"

One thing that have stuck out to me was the fact that it could roll.\n\nIn this game, you play as BB8 as you roll through various stages based on different Star Wars planets. The gameplay mechanism is simplistic, but the levels would get harder.\n\nThe rolling mechanic can been seen in other games such as *Marble Madness* and *Super Monkey Ball*. However, unlike the previous games, it is based on Star Wars. Also, this type of game had never been seen in a Star Wars game before. Due to the simplistic nature of the game, the game would be targeted to a more casual audience."
3xat7q,Arrow the Video Game,"As we all know there is a television show called arrow, starring Stephen Amell and its a very popular tv series. But I think a company like Activision should make a free roam video game based on the tv series. There could be multiple missions starting with the shipwreck on Oliver Queens yacht, where you would start in the water after the shipwreck and find Robert Queen and the life raft. Then, Have different chapters of the game on the island training and going through similar events that Oliver queen and the rest of the people he is settled with on the island had gone through. Having to find different sources of food (hunting), equipment/tools to make weapons and other needed items, and of course Surviving the Island. Eventually finding your way off the island and continuing Oliver's mission to save his city, to save starling city. But, not only as Oliver Queen but, as Roy Harper (later named Arsenal) and the way he has changed from a lowlife purse snatcher, to Thea Queen's boyfriend, to helping the Arrow stand up for, and protect the people of Starling city. Later in the game release an update or sell as downloadable content the story of the Canary (Sara Lance), training with the League of Assassins, and coming back to starling city to protect Laurel and Detective Quentin Lance. Finally more downloadable content including the life of Malcolm Merlin, and the story behind Ra's Al Ghul the head of the League of assassins.            "

3x5i25,Turn Log Horizon into a real game please someone!,"Hello to whomever is reading this and thank you for taking the time to read it. This is a idea I have for the next big MMORPG and honestly the whole game (for the most part) is already made.\n\n    This Idea I have is a anime/manga from Japan called Log Horizon. The creator of Log Horizon has already created what I would considered the hardest part of making any new game let alone a new MMORPG. He has created the land on which the game would take place and all the main towns and cities. He created all the classes and how they work and sub-classes as well for the players to choose and play. All the races that would be playable and the backstories to them too. He thought up the NPCs and their backstories to the land and how they work within the world. The combat system is already thought up and mostly a traditional play style with the holy trinity of a tank/dps/healer. He has already created some of the gear/weapons/items ( at least what is shown).\n\n    I've looked on the internet for rumors or hints of anyone taking this great and amazing anime and turning it into a game of it's own. Sadly nothing has turned up, and as far as I can tell the whole fan base of this anime and I would guess of other animes like Sword Art Online would also be very interested in jumping into a game like this. I mean the people who are attracted to these kind of animes are MMORPG gamers themselves. This is what kind of MMO many of these fans are looking for and begging to have.\n\n    As much as the world of MMOs is evolving many of us gamers would love to have a older style of MMO out there again. Most of us actually like the traditional style that older games offered like Everquest 2 or as much as I hate to say WoW is also what I would considered a traditional MMO. Yes we all enjoy the new ""version"" of what MMOs have evolved into what everyone is calling sandbox games. A lot of crafting along with owning land and harvesting and all that jazz but in all honestly no one has been able to completely deliver on what they promise. Don't get me wrong I love the idea of a sandbox game and one day someone will be able to get it right but as it stands I see no clear sign that will happen anytime soon.\n\n    As I have stated before many of us would pounce at the chance to play a traditional MMO again, the main reason these older more classic MMOs are fading away is well that they are old and out of date. A new game with upgraded graphics and just improved on the ideas set out by the grandfathers of the MMO world would be amazing. Many games out there now don't have any end-game content, and why is that? It's because in these new sandbox games there is no end-game content, no raids, no really hard dungeons, nothing to really test your skills but on PvP. To many of us PvP is not end-game content, at least there should be more to it then just PvP. Big time raids with 24 people like in Everquest 2, the dungeons were no joke and was unforgiving. But this is just my view on the matter and what I believe, weather or not that's true is a different story. Just what I've seen/heard from the people I've talked to over the years.\n\n    Thank you for your time"
3x53ac,Traditionally Comic (rough idea),"I personally really liked the nemesis system of Shadow of Mordor, always having another challenger ready to break your bones.\n\nRecently i had seen the new transformers game on steam, loving the art style and then it came to me.\n\nA game with the nemesis system of shadow of mordor, a customization system equal to the sims, and a city with destructible enviornments(ish).\n\nThus bringing forth, (Name highly WIP) Traditionally Comic.\n\nYou play as a super hero (or villain), customizing your hero using an editor where you can make them all yours, and where you can select your starting abilities (laser eyes, frost breath, variations of these, etc). Progression would include the unlocking of new abilities, but also include restricting others. IE: Can't have fire AND frost breath. The main goal of said game is to defend and protect (or harass/destroy) the city. Nemesis would include generated villains fighting for control over the city as well (randomly generated powers, and weaknesses).\n\nAs you defeat villains, the city's value/happiness goes up, causing stronger villains to be created. As value/happiness deteriorates, by harassing/causing trouble, or by letting villains run rampant, more smaller enemies (gangs, terrorists, etc) start to pop up, giving you weaker enemies to clean up to try and restore the city.\n\nThis is a rough idea, and not something i could possibly create (being only a worker in RPG Maker and Blender).\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
3x2vko,"AI Sandbox - create creatures and give them a mind. The editor will allow to purposes, general way of thinking, tasks, if then statements and more",
3x2trz,Windward,"So, this idea evolved out of a dream I had. I might be wrong in thinking that there is anything innovative or original about the game I'm about to describe - would love to know if there is an existing game that toys with similar ideas. In this case, the plot is less important than the format I think.\n\nThe game is cooperative - minimum and maximum of two players for the purpose of this description, though I don't see why the idea couldn't be expanded on for more players.\n\nTwo men, an American DEA agent and a Norwegian homeland security operative, are part of a collaborative investigation into the mysterious appearance of a cruise ship in Norwegian waters (but near enough to US assets to be of interest). The ship, the Windward, is identified as a ship procured by an eccentric millionaire author and cult leader. With the followers of his cult facing discrimination at home, he bought the ship with the intention of inviting his disciples to live in a secluded community in international waters. Contact was lost with the ship during a storm, but it has appeared several years later. The DEA agent is involved because a wanted smuggler was known to have boarded the ship, posing as a member of this cult, and it is suspected that he might be the cause of the ship's current plight. Initial attempts to communicate with those on board have been ignored, so a team is assembled and the two player characters are included.\n\nWithin a short space of time, the team are all killed by unknown assailants, and communication with HQ goes dead. Only the two player characters survive, and are able to maintain contact only with each other. They are however locked down to discrete sections of the ship, unable to get to each other.\n\nThe game begins in earnest, and the two players must survive aboard the ship - fighting off the crazed inhabitants and other grotesques, solving puzzles to progress further into the ship, and aiding each other as certain junctures - an example could be that one character reaches the ship's security centre and can help his partner through a puzzle room using the CCTV camera footage etc.\n\nBuilding on this symbiotic style of play, I'd like the game to try to test the relationship between the two players. I would try to build two separate narratives, so the two players feel like they are playing slightly different games - for example, part of the reason why people aboard the ship have gone crazy is due to narcotics testing on the oblivious populace. One such drug might be a powerful hallucinogen, and one player might receive a high dose. A set piece could then begin where one player transforms into a monstrous creature, ripping apart enemies with his bare hands, while the other player has to protect his partner, who is gibbering and drooling in the corner. The experience of the two players will split their perceptions of the reality of the ship, and also where they think their priorities are.\n\nAnother couple of examples I've thought of are:\n- One player finds a dog, and they become companions, with the dog becoming very useful in solving puzzles and fighting off enemies. The dog runs off and encounters the other player, but attacks, forcing the second player to kill it. Without being able to see the incident, the first player cannot help but suspect that there was an alternative to killing his faithful pet.\n- NPCs could interact differently with the two characters, trying to cause tension between them. One NPC might even fake some CCTV footage of one player character and show it to the other, sowing seeds of suspicion.\n- Due to the experiences of the two players, a multiple ending situation, where the players can genuinely betray each other in the pursuit of what they think is right.\n\nAnyway, enough rambling - I wanted to put this down on paper as much as anything else. I know that this would be a one-off experience game, and that it wouldn't necessarily have much replayability, but many single player games are the same. If narrative cooperative gaming is going to survive, I think it needs to adapt, and maybe this is one way it could go? Let me know your thoughts, including any other ideas you might have for playing the two player characters off against each other."
3x1dxs,Idea I've started working on. Would you play it ?,[deleted]
3x0f4m,A 3D First person medieval game like Space Station 13/Town of salem.,"Hello everyone!\n\nRecently, I got a urge to play a game like Town of Salem, Space station 13, Trouble in Terrorist town, etc. A game where there are players and one (or more) ""Intruder"", but I couldn't find anything similar to what I wanted.\n\nMy idea would be the following:\n\nA groupe of player (10 or more) join a game. It would be a medieval theme. A big map with different areas (A town, forest, plain, mountains, mines, graveyard, etc). Each player will have a role/job and objectives linked to their job. For example the blacksmith will have to go to the mine, gather metals, go back to town (maybe even with horses/cart) and forge items at the blacksmith house and then go to the town marked and ""sell"" them. Woodcutter would have to go in the forest chop trees and etc..\n\nEach player will have unique abilities/items linked to their job. So for example, the guard will have some armor and weapons. The nurse will be able to heal other injured players, etc.\n\nOn the first day, nobody know the intruder but on the first night, the player will know if he is an intruder. Lets use an assassin or werewolf in this example (assassin would be the day intruder and werewolf the night intruder maybe?). So the assassin will have targets to eliminate (or will have to kill all the players) so he will need to learn their routines and try to kill them when they are alone. Werewolf will be during the night, during their sleep or kill the players that have night jobs.\n\n\n\nThis would be the base of my idea! I have a lot more idea but I dont want to write a giant novel haha.\n\nI started doing a map in Unity3D but I don't know a lot about game dev and I don't really have time to continue/learn so maybe someone could expand my idea further more!\n\nIf you have more idea let me know! I have a notepad where I save all my idea for the game!\n\nThank you! :)\n"
3w4e9e,An old game idea from /x/,"Years ago I browsed /x/ and on a thread someone mentioned a very unique game. I spent weeks trying to find the game he was talking about, but got nowhere. Here's what I can best remember.\n\n\nI believe the game had overhead camera angles, akin to the original Alone In The Dark. The player and a small group went to different places that were supposed to be haunted. One of the things you had to do was use a recorder in each room to see if anything was there. Now what caught my attention was that the said game was using ""real recorded ghost voices"" for this. I really don't remember much after this, but I do recall the guy going on about all the horror is in your mind, subtle, and never once did a jumpscare. But you felt uneasy through the whole game and always thought you saw something in the corner of your eye. Not like the inyourface horror games we have now.\n\n\nNow it could just be /x/ being /x/ and making up bs creepypastas, but a game with that idea always interested me. If someone were to make this a reality, I only ask that four key things stay the same. No jumpscares/cheapscares, relies on the recording device, for it to keep the same camera idea, and for it to give you that uneasy feeling that always makes you want to turn around in real life.\n\n\nI can't take credit for such an idea. Or maybe the idea never came from /x/ and all this time it actually came from me. Who knows. But the closest I can find is Fatal Frame, but at the same time it's not even the same."
3w3wl0,Project Earth Girls,"**Name:** Project Earth Girls\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nThis a hardcore sex RPG, but with better graphics. Quite like Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude and BoneTown, but with more depth, more activities and lots more sex. The player is in an open world populated with NPCs you can interact with, and your objective is to seduce as many as you can. Each female NPC has different characteristics, likes and triggers. They react differently to which answer you choose, what actions you do, what clothes you wear, and how you grow your personality. The open world is filled with different activities that increase your scores on your personality facets, and these  affects the girls' behavior towards you.\n\nWhile it has all the markings of a shallow pervy game, the choices you make are important in developing your character. The grand plan of this game is to explore the many facets of human sexuality. Variety, gender identity, consent, social stigmas and taboos...\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou are an alien who is posted on Earth to study the mating habits of humans. Unlike other species on the planet, humans are notoriously discreet about their mating behaviors, which impedes your research. The only way now is to take the human form and do it the old fashioned way: woo them into sleeping with you.\n\nYou scan a nearby male's form, and you have the ability to change his facial features (thus allowing you to liken your character to yourself and live vicariously as a sex-crazed alien scientist). Thus a new citizen in this city, you work your way into human society, earning money for jobs, and interacting with humans. The city offers a wide variety of jobs, and all of them give you the opportunity to meet with women. Jobs like:\n\n1. Pizza Delivery Guy\n2. Plumber\n3. Taxi Driver\n4. Bouncer\n5. Drug Dealer\n5. Firefighter\n6. Masseuse\n7. Doctor\n8. Fashion Photographer\n\n... and so on. These jobs have a lot of activities associated with them, and completing them adds points to your personality attribute scores. \n\n**Setting:**\n\nYou're in a big city, filled with lots of women. Every action/interaction of yours with them is remembered. The city also has other people who you can be friends with, do favors for, and get bonuses and unlocked achievements from, to further your objective. \n\n**Characters:**\n\n* You are an alien disguised as a hetero male. You can customize your face at the start of the game. You have no superpowers. You have your penis, and that's about it.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThe gameplay mechanics will be like Mass Effect 2. Rich environments and plenty of exploration, but no need for falling off ledges and stuff like that. The characters are modeled like characters in Saints Row 3: realistic enough, but with plenty of cartoonish exaggeration. [The sexual interaction will be like in 3DXchat](http://www.thumbzilla.com/video/ph564ee48a95374/the-date-animater-romantic-3dxchat-movie) [NSFW LINK]. Your ability to score depends on maintaining your partner's level of enjoyment and interest, which in turn depends on her personality. Your progress unlocks new actions and positions.\n\nSatisfying your partner gives you personality bonuses, but careful! All these cost you stamina, and you have to make sure you don't tire out or bust a nut prematurely! No penalty, but your partners future behavior towards you will be affected. (She will be more receptive to your advances later, if you have great sex, or she may blow you off if you weren't so great) \n\nThe main ones I can think of:\n\n1. Charisma\n2. Stamina/Strength\n3. Intelligence\n4. Wealth/Reputation\n\nEach stat has a score. Every girl you meet is attracted to a combination of your attribute stats, so your mission is to find out what works for which girl, and how to match your score with what she likes. This is done by a) choosing dialogue, b) enhancing skills via activities, c) ""favors"" for the girl.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nYou have to constantly upgrade yourself. Boost your stamina by going to the gym, engaging in outdoor activities. Boost your intelligence by going to libraries, learning languages, solving problems etc. Boost your charm by talking to everyone (warning! If you only talk to girls, you get a higher creep rating) and helping them out. Boost your wealth and reputation by dressing better, buying cars, upgrading your home. You can also customize your home, adding things that the girls you bring home may like, and increase your chances of banging them.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nPC. Only PC. Moddability is a plus. Plus character creation (unlocked after certain stages, or in the end), so everyone can model a girl after their crush and then bang them.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nVideo Editor, so that every time you score, you can go back to it, and make a movie out of it. (it can be an in-game thing, where you can sell the video for money, but will impact your charisma score)"
3w2log,Flash game where you destroy cities/countries/Earth.,"I have an idea for a flash game, since I think it would work better that way.\n\nI would call it ""Nature's Fury"" or something like that.\n\nThe premise is that you have to rain down death and destruction on Earth and rack up enough points to destroy the Earth.\n\nYou get a selection of natural disasters, which are small at first, then you begin hitting cities, towns, etc. with them. The more people you kill and the more destruction you cause, the more points you rack up, which can be used to upgrade your disasters and buy new ones.\n\nIt wouldn't show the places being hit (well, it would on the map), but rather tell you through a newsflash about the destruction caused and deaths.\n\nAs you keep throwing disasters at Earth, though, people will start paying attention and start building defenses from them. If you keep using disasters on one area in a short period of time, that area will be evacuated.\n\nOnce you get enough points, you can buy a big killer disaster that'll either completely wipe out all life on Earth or destroy the whole planet.\n\nWould this make a good flash game?"

3w0pv0,Mafia Kinda Game,"Have you guys ever played the videos games\nThe godfather\nAnd\nThe godfather 2??\n\nI don't give a shit if you have or not but it's help understand what I mean\nAny way\nAn awesome video game would be a game about a mafia family, your family, that you have 100% control over, how they dress, what weapons they use, and you start off with a small front in New York, and these maps are fucking huge right, so using GTA terms, New York is the entire map of GTAV, and then there'd be other cities, like maybe Tokyo, maybe one in Italy, one in England where ever the fuck, and what you do is, is you with your crime family start to take over little Italy, mind you, you can go straight to England and start taking over places over there, and with the money you earn from extorting these business, you can ""invest"" it into the drug trades an shit, and buy out rival families into working for you, you can buy compounds all over the place an shit, it's set in 2015 so you get all of the current tech all the current weapons, all this shit, any way, but the best part is, even after you take out rival families, more will start popping up, every country has its controlling family and you start from the bottom in New York, and start to take control over all these cities until eventually you control all of the words drug trade, but not really, cause you will never complete the game because there will always be rival mafia families/street gangs, the only real missions are doing favours for street people to get information on whacking rival families made men\n\nBut it's not just Drugs, there'd be strip clubs, fronts, warehouses, weapon smuggling, car modifications, gambling, anything illegal that you can think of\n\nyour crew, is just you at first, you go out onto the streets and recruit your own men, but you have to be careful who you recruit, some might be informants from other families, they could be contract killers to kill off your family tree. It's just a constant game of risk.\n\nYour family tree is however big you want it to be, and you can set up small sections of a tree to look after each city, you can send made men to take over a business, buttttt gotta be Careful of how you spend your money, cause you gotta pay for guards to guard your businesses.\n\nIt'd be like GTAV, Watchdogs, Sims, The Godfather."
3w00nj,New Game+ and New Game Controversy,"I know this isn't going to happen for more reasons than the fact that it would probably need a team like Naughty Dog for it to work well and it seems like the majority of people don't really think about this or, in some cases, even think it ""exists"" but it has a somewhat personal experience tied behind it and I figured the worst thing that happens is that it gets completely ignored and the best is that I finally get this out of my head. I recently saw [""Why Rape is Sincerely Hilarious""] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko) again and one thing led to another and I have this idea that you're about to read. Also, in case the title didn't give it away, the video is rather depressing and I think it gets posted on /r/frisson often. \n\n\nIn the first playthrough of whatever game it ends up being, there is a secondary character the protagonist and other characters interact with and after a night out at a bar or some other plausible place for this to happen (a playable part of the game so you can see how it happens/why) it comes to light that the secondary character (Male) was drugged and raped by another person (Female) and the ""usual"" happens where they don't believe him/belittle what happened/joke about what happened or what have you. The player should have developed some degree of attachment to this secondary character by this point in the game. All of the actions of the characters eventually lead up to the secondary character committing suicide(absolutely nothing flashy or David Cage-y. It either happens off screen and he is found after it's too late or they make the player think he can be saved before killing him in the vicinity of the ""in my arms"" level of impact so to speak) It can affect the game to a major or lesser extent but I think it would be best to not *focus* on it so it doesn't seem like the whole point of the game was to be preachy about that. It'd be more like some of the things that happen in The Last of Us and Life is Strange. It happens, possibly makes you think, and affects the story but it isn't the story. \n\n\nYou finish the game and hopefully it's an emotional ride that makes you think long after it's done. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! You get back to the main menu and see ""New Game+"" and ""New Game Controversy"" (maybe it's just one of the two or both so you can choose which one you want to see) \n\n\nIn this ""New Game Controversy"" it's basically the same game. Maybe some tweaks to give more incentive to replay the story than usual but there's one difference. The secondary character is replaced by a female. Nothing different happens. Same setup and basically the same dialogue except to maybe account for the gender swap. This would have to be kept completely under wraps and nobody on the outside would be able to know. No leaks or anything. I'm talking Sega Saturn American launch levels of secrecy and surprise so that it can blindside players with the full (hopefully) emotional impact rather than be something that seems to be screaming for controversy to boost sales like an asshole who doesn't really give a shit about what they claim to. Think the opposite of ""Dear Fat People"" and the like. The game would make the sales on its own and then the controversy would come after. \n\n\nIs what happened to the secondary character suddenly worse even though the same exact thing happened? How long will it take for people to cause a stir over there being a depiction of a woman being raped (more than likely by people that haven't even played the game)? Will people boycott the game or try to have it taken off the shelves just because they think they have the power too? Will someone hold a conference and say something that amounts to, ""Fuck you. Boycott the game. You weren't going to buy it anyway and just want something to complain about.""  Will it help bring change? Will more people step up and talk about it now that someone has said it? Will it even matter? \n\n\nI have absolutely no fucking idea but I'd rather put it out there and have you guys let me know what a shitty idea it is than to keep going over it in my mind again and again thinking that it actually makes sense and letting it fester.

3vtq76,"""Pacific"" Syndicate like game","Synopsis: In a a very near future, corporation are beginning to gain more and more power. They do not do so through violent force, but by ""colonizing"" the minds and imaginary of the whole human population, the cognosphere if you will. In this world, you sell shovel. Your one and only goal is to increase profits. If it the most optimal way is to gain the trust of your clients by providing a good quality product, so be it, likewise if it means manipulating them by using heavy handed marketing.\n\nGraphism : The whole world would be represented in a motion graphics way, like in [1]. The interface should be super slick and playful (physically based?) and lot of care should be made in how the world data is represented and interacted with.\n\nGameplay : The influence on the industrial process is limited. What will makes the game unfeasible I thinks is the following feature : each human would have an internal belief system, that can be interacted with trough multiple channel. You can direct it in order to increase incentive to buy shovel. You can design textual ad (the game should use lot of natural language technology) but also visual one, with a built in tool (with high constraint and heavily symbolism as to not make the game ridiculously open ended). As stated before, data play an important part, and discovering what the user truly wants, linking it to your goals, and inserting those ideas into their head will be the core of the game.\n\nWell that's it, it's really a pipe dream I think, maybe making a toy world with overly simplisitc AI could work, I don't know much of AI\n\n[1] https://vimeo.com/74874089"

3vn0su,Naruto Rpg,"this is my first post here so just so everyone knows, I don't make games nor do I plan on making games, I just have an Idea that i think is cool and would like to put it on here\n\nI have always enjoyed the Naruto Universe, and besides ultimate ninja storm there really isn't any naruto games. I think it would be really cool if someone made an open world naruto rpg.\n\nto start off you would create your own ninja, full customization options, you would choose which of the five hidden villages you would belong to then you would choose your main type of jutsu, lightning, earth, wind, or fire. next you would choose a specialty weapon for your character, theres is tons of unique weapons in the naruto universe that you could choose from.\n\nafter you created your character you would start as a genin (lowest rank of ninja) to learn the gameplay and get used to the controls once you complete some lower level missions you would be entered into the chunin exams to earn your next rank. the ranks in order go; genin, chunin, jonin, and the kage which are the leaders of their respective villages, you could level up all the way to kage.  if you make it to kage you could send your ninja on missions and manage relationships with other villages while still completing tasks yourself.\n\nStory: the story would be based around the jinchuriki which are powerful ninja that contain the power of one of nine tailed beasts, the jinchuriki are targets of the akatsuki, a group of rogue ninja that want to gain the power of all nine tailed beast and use it to destroy the hidden villages. the goal would be to protect the jinchuriki of your village from the akatssuki, while also taking missions from the kage of your village. each kage is different and can send you on different kinds of missions that could range from espionage, to assassinations. the player would be able to interact with other characters and have dialogue options that can affect the story, also in battle the player could choose to let their opponents live or to kill them, all of your decisions affect the story. you could even choose to join the akatsuki's cause if thats how you want to play.\n\nGameplay : this would be an open world game, where you could travel to all of the hidden villages and visit places in each one. I imagine it being free flowing combat but turn based would also work.\n\nI hope this all makes at least a little sense. let me know what you think.\n\nedit: formatting\n "

3vgp1n,Dark souls/The Legend Of Zelda mixture concept!,"I'm creating a game concept for a game design course and wanted some honest feedback and opinions on the following ideas. Any criticism is welcomed to make a more well rounded vision.\nThis idea was to mix the open world and combat elements from dark souls/Bloodborne with the dungeon crawling elements from The Legend Of Zelda series. After playing Bloodborne and going through the Chalice Dungeons I found that the slight puzzle aspect appealed to me, and being an old school Zelda fan, I thought that the two go hand in hand. I want to build an open linking environment and have areas of zelda style puzzle solving sections that lead to a boss that will be as unforgiving as dark souls/Bloodborne.\nSo, I welcome your opinions on the idea and look forward to finding out what you think."
3vg3i1,A Free Roam Pokémon,"You play as a Pokémon trainer (that you customize) and catch and level Pokémon to progress the story as you do in the mobile versions, but it is three-dimensional. Instead of all the same generic attack animations similar to the anime. When Pikachu uses the move ""bolt tackle"" it's very uneventful, but in this game, it would have Pikachu charging up and then charging at the enemy. You have to control all the attacks. If you can't land it on the opponent, that's how they would evade the attacks. Since Pokémon can only know 4 moves at once, it seems to be a good idea to put it on all platforms (XBOX ONE, PS4, Nintendo's newest console[not the Wii U, but they are making another], and PC since it can support gamepads) because joystick controllers today have 4 buttons on the left (digital pads) or right (a,b,x,y/X,Square,O,triangle) for each move. The first installment could be a disc or a digital game, then each new region of the Pokèmon world could just be an add-on/DLC. It can be an RPG-like free roam, but when you go to the Pokèmon Center's second floor, this enables the online gameplay (as is in the mobile games). It should have the same storyline, but be three-dimensional, combine all 6 regions together, and each Pokèmon move should have their own animation. Please tell me what you think in the comments.\n\nI think it should look something like this 3D rendering:\nhttps://youtu.be/hs3-73NSa7k"

3vd8am,foot chase/improvised fighting game,"My favorite parts of many action movies and games are the foot chases, so I would like to see a two-player game that consists entirely of foot chases, and the fights that break them up. Like Mirror's Edge, kind of, with more mundane, earth-bound environs, plus a frenetic and environmental-context-heavy fighting system, when the two parties in the chase finally meet. You could turn on or off other parties who try to interfere with the chase (and who their focus is), like police or security and so on, or let it just be you two crashing through civilian environments, causing mayhem. Heavy emphasis on suddenly opened fridge doors, spilled vats of liquid, etc. There could also be tense hiding moments, where you duck into a corner and hope your pursuer continues on by, or in dark/cluttered locations. The fighting should be wildly improvisational with a focus on using objects in your environment. And if you injure one another enough during the fighting, by the end, the ""chase"" will be more of a labored stumbling. You can also set whether the goal is to catch the person alive, kill them, whatever. Maybe the chasee has to escape from the scene without being observed doing so.\n\nThe whole game, I think, could be just a few massive set pieces, like - New York Hotel/Restaurant, sports stadium, camp grounds, airport, with an infinite variety of different routes the chase might take. And the chases should have lots movie cliches like falling through awnings, vaulting rooftops, rooms with big conveyor belts/machinery, opportunities to blend into crowds and quickly remove or don clothing.\n\nSound fun to anyone else?\n\n"

3vcs7g,An open world alternate history game set in Korean-war era North Korea,"The game would be set in Pyongyang, North Korea just months before the end of the Korean war in July, 1953. The city is war torn but in the process of rebuilding. You are a 19 year old young man named Ki Cheol Yun, an American man of South Korean descent. Yun is sent to Pyongyang as an undercover agent (1960s James Bond Style) to play the part of a North Korean citizen. The goal is to assassinate more and more high ranking officials the farther along you go, eventually to the point of Kim Il Sung himself. By doing so you could have many methods such as going inside the palace he lives in, serving as a butler, chef etc. Another option is the stealthy way. Wait until nightfall and climb into his window, snipe him from afar, etc. Lastly, you can kidnap him and get answers, then set him free and he serves as intel (they don't always oblige, so you kill them). If someone finds out about you, you have to kill them or you are dead. The premise of the game could b tweaked, as I am tired while writing this and just thought it up. The game would be open world with side missions and underground alliances against communism that you can hire people from.\n\nIf ya'll have any ideas or tips, it would be awesome if you shared them."

3vcf3t,[Beginner] A turn-based 1v1 platformer fighter.,"I've been toying with this for a while, but basically I'm thinking of taking a roguelike movement system (can only do one action per turn) and making it multiplayer...and making it a platformer too because why not.\n\nBasically you'd have an available list of actions per turn, and once both players submit an action the turn executes.\n\nYou'd have basic actions that change depending on the context (if the tile below is air and the tile to either side is a wall, walljumping is added to the list, for example.) as well as weapons and items you could choose before the match or possibly pick up. Stuff like swords, throwing knives, bombs, etc.\n\nDamaging things would work on a sort of hitbox system: Sword deals lots of damage to only the square in front of you, knives deal 1 damage in a straight line until they hit something, etc. Actions could cancel each other out as well, so if you swing your sword on the same turn someone throws a knife at you, the sword blocks the knife, or if you both swing swords then they clash and waste the turn.\n\nI'd probably make each player have 1-3 HP per round, and each round brings you to a different level of the same map, much like Towerfall.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a theme, try like...insect ninjas. Moths, mantises, beetles, etc. You could even use their bug parts for special abilities, like the moth being able to jump twice as high or the beetle taking half damage from behind.\n\nI've actually tried experimenting with this a bit, but I only got as far as the movement system. Here's a demo gif: [GIF]( http://i.imgur.com/LkbcLfU.gifv)\n\nI'd imagine this would work as a mobile game with a list of actions on screen, and you'd hand off your phone to other players or just play online. Since it's turn based lag wouldn't be an issue.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think!"
3va9ka,"A neat shooter idea, lacks a storyline","So I kind of got this idea from playing halo but here it is. A big name company(Activision, Infinity Ward) should make a shooter similar to a call of duty play style mixed with the new Rainbow 6: Siege game. But in the game there is a map creator system. Where users can create their own strategic maps. It would be a lot of work on the developers part but I could see it happening in the next couple years and something doable. Anyway, the game would come out with default maps like any other game. Then after a bit, the users could start sending their map ideas in and the developers would pick and chose a hand full each week to be the featured maps. So theoretically there would be new maps every week bringing a new challenge to players who can learn maps quickly and use that to their advantage. \n\nIts just an idea for an online shooter. I don't expect it to be made because I don't think big name companies spend their time looking on Reddit for game ideas. But if it does that would be a really cool game I'd think. \n\nIt also lacks a campaign idea, which I like in games."

Every year, the company would develop and make a mod for purchase that is for new players/coaches, plays, and stat updates on current ones. Once they get the mechanics of the mannequins (physics, glitches, the correct running form, and so on), then that's when they'd begin to create the yearly mods. They could charge $15 or so per year for the mod which people would love instead of $60 for a new annual game.

For example, if you have an engineering department with a low Effectiveness, and you get a hull breach, it ma take a week or more to fix, however, if the department has a high effectiveness, the breach may only take a few hours to Fix\n\nMoral, is how happy a department is. Low moral could lead to a mutiny, and decreased effectiveness. E.G. If your medical department has low moral, they could refuse to vaccinate your other departments against a deadly virus that is spreading around.\n\nSecurity: How secure a department is. E.G. if the security department has a low security rating, then people could often break in and steal weapons.\n\nThe Ship: The ship has 3 Main stats: Hull Integrity, Power, and Workers\n\nHull integrity is a rating of how secure your hull is. E.G if you have a low hull integrity rating, breeches are more likely to occur, as well as other structural failures.\n\nPower is how much electricity the ship has.

3v0t2t,Space survival,"The idea is a space survival crafting game set on a randomized distant planet, with the goal of continuing the human species. \n\nThe game should feel very unconventional and non-formulaic. It should seek to simulate an alien world through the use of procedural generation of everything. And I do mean everything. Resources that you can collect / mine / farm are unnamed, and have different properties and values that make them useful for certain applications, but useless for others. You will have to experiment and test your surroundings to discover a way to survive and thrive. The advantage of this type of game is that there is no one solution that can be applied to any situation. There will be no ""googling"" the material to find crafting recipes. It'll be more nuanced and creative than your standard mine craft clone. \n\nLet's say you want to make an oven to cook your food. You have a blueprint in your supplies for a crude oven that requires a hard sturdy material for the case of the oven and some sort of solid fuel or heat source. You can use any material you find as your case, and any other material as your fuel, but depending on the properties of this material, it will be more or less effective. \n\nSo for instance I find an organism that looks like a plant. I harvest it and examine it (perhaps once I get further into the crafting tree I'll be able to analyze it more effectively with some advanced piece of equipment) but I have a rough idea that it has values like: hardness 4, elasticity 8, durability 5, edibility 9, combustibility 7, toxicity 4, insulation 6, renewable: true, etc. You could then apply these values to the crafting system. I know that I want to make a blanket which requires a material that has low hardness, and high insulation.  If a material is too far outside a certain range of hardness, then it isn't suitable and can't be used for that recipe. \n\nIt would be a lot of guessing at first, but that's what exploration is all about. Then perhaps you create machines that could alter the materials that you find, so a furnace, or a compressor, which would change the values of the material. So i want to use this mineral to create a lens, but it isn't clear enough. I put it into the compressor to get rid of the imperfections. Now it's suitable to be used as a lens. \n\nBasically there would be crafting recipes, but the building blocks will change depending on what you have available to you and what you are able to create. \n\nYou have to find ways to create a self sustaining colony before you run out of your initial supplies. Of course you could add hostile alien life or weather changes to add challenge and depth. \n\nI realize this seems pretty ambitious, but I think the fact that the vast majority of the game play is based on randomly generated ""properties"" and terrain, it would be more so about setting up the sandbox and letting the randomization create the adventure. Not to mention, replayability would be through the roof.\n\nIf you wanted to get even more ambitious, maybe you land on this one planet, but if you progress to the point of being able to leave said planet, you could potentially explore other nearby planets, either to colonize or gather resources that you might not have on the ""home planet"". \n\nThoughts?

3v0r2k,"A simple roguelite revolving around resource management and combat, rather than exploration.","Hello. Lately i've been playing games like FTL and Darkest Dungeons non stop, which got me to try and replicate their core mechanics of map generation, ""movement"" and combat. Was really happy and pumped up by the process and the results.\n\nI really love the general ideas behind these two games, that revolves around resource management with what you're given or pre-planning and focusing on combat, rather than exploration. For example the way you can move on the map in FTL, or the ""dungeons"" in darkest dungeon, which leads to deceptively complex fights on a single screen.\n\nI would really like to hear anyones ideas on some mechanics and/or settings for the genre that has the same spirit of one or both of the two games."

3uy4cp,Open world evil empire game,"I'm imagining a vast open world, populated with towns and cities and sprinkled with villages. Groups of towns and villages are banded together as provinces, each of which is under the control of various factions (noble houses, bandits etc).\n\nYou play as a leitenant of an ancient Dark Lord, tasked with rebuilding his former empire. You have to travel the land, currying favour with its inhabitants and sowing distrust amongst the current rulers. The storyline would climax with your Dark Lord betraying you, and you leading an army to destroy him and rule the land in Darkness.\n\nThe regions would work like this - each region has a town and several connected villages. You have to take control of a majority of the reions villages before you can take control of the town. The villages would have missions like ""clear out a local bandit camp"", ""commit a crime and frame it on the current ruler"", ""find these rare herbs for our apocathory"", etc. \n\nOnce you have control over a village you gain a certain amount of wealth and soldiers, as well as other resources that the village might have (blacksmiths would produce weapons/tools).You use these resources to build your forces and reinforce settlements. There could also be rare, magical resources that would enable you to forge powerful artifacts.\n\nTowns would be urban areas that have barracks and soldiers, aligned to the lord of the settlement. Depending on what buildings the settlement has there could be other defenders - a Mage's Guild would provide wizards to battle the protagonists, there might also be priests or knights.\n\nI think this idea would provide a huge amount of scope for popular open-world tropes, with tonnes of quests, equipment, magic, craftable items and settlements. And of course it wouldn't be complete without a glorious, custom-built evil FORTRESS OF DOOM."

3uur7q,Healer training (flash-)game,"Hi, I had an idea of a useful training minigame for MMORPG healers. Here's now it could work:\n\nThe player is in a sort of arena with between 3 and 7 training dummies. (player can select how many?) These training dummies will function as ""teammates"". When the round starts, the training dummies will lose health. Sometimes only one, sometimes all of them at once, sometimes one gets focused on heavily... It's pretty irregular and representative of how teammates in MMORPG's would lose health in a dungeon/flashpoint/instance battle. The player can select a difficulty level that will increasingly test the healer's potency and reaction speed.\n\nFrom a dropdown menu, the player can select whether he's an inquisitor healer from SWTOR, a minstrel healer from LOTRO, a WoW healer, etc. (perhaps focus the minigame on a specific mmo?) Then the player will be provided with the same healing skills as he has in his MMORPG. The player will then be able to select over what levels of mastery, critical rating, critical magnitude and specific skill buff duration (such as bubble length, bubble magnitude) he wants to posess during the minigame, so he can create a ""build"" that is representative of his actual healer's build in the MMO.\n\nHere's some challenges, concerning the skills:\n\n- Some skills provide a group-wide heal\n\n- Bubble skills might either absorb damage or provide more health to target\n\n- SWTOR has an overload crowd control skil for inquisitor healers that also provide a quick groupwide heal\n\n- Some heals are ground-targeted rather than player-targeted\n\n- Take incoming healing buffs and armour buffs into account with healing skills\n\n- There might be skills that cause the healer's next skill to have a 100% critical chance\n\n- Skills have cooldowns, induction times and execution times. be sure to provide any ""- ...% skill length duration"" or ""-...% induction time"" in the drop down menu for specific healing skills, as sometimes players are traited for this.\n\n- Healers may have limited mana/power/force and each skill costs some of it. Make a player able to select their maximum mana/power/force and ""-...% power cost"" from the drop down menu for specific skills. mana/power/force restoring skills that a healer may posess should probably be added to the skillbar.\n\n- Healers may want to use keybindings (numeric keys on the keyboard) to execute their skills swiftly\n\n\nFinally, perhaps add some sort of certificate to healers that conquered specific levels of this healing challenge (account specific, so it's verifiable?) so that this game can be used as a benchmark to evaluate healers that would like to join raiding guilds and want to prove their reliability."

Rules would be agreed to through software in certain parts of the game instead of enforced in the core.

Game starts when the server reach a population limit. When a fort is taken over by enemies the server resets and locks for an hour. The longer a fort stays alive, the harder the enemies become.\n\nThe limited number of slots for players is there so that when a player logs-off there are always other players just waiting in queue.\n\nLongest player in the server is assigned leader. Leaders can kick/kill a player if said player is not contributing, or he is just trolling(which kills his chances at holding the fort). Players contribute by killing enemies, manning turrets, repairing generators, reviving friendlies, holding the line, setting up traps and etc.\n\nIf a wall is breached, a small team must push back the attack while an engineering team tries to fix the breach.\n\nThat's what I have so far.\n\n"

3stnsa,Seriously Considering Making a Gladiator Game.,"Looking for some thoughts on our idea for a gladiator game. Me and my team are seriously considering ironing out the details and developing this, and wanted some opinions/ideas on how to improve it or if we should even make it at all.\n\nSo the idea was originally inspired by the arena in Bethesda's Oblivion, and we wanted to take something like that and make it much more interesting and fun. The idea is to use a combat system based on physics where your weapon moves with your mouse movements or something along those lines (although with a system like that we're not sure how a shield would be used yet.) We ideally want to make this multiplayer and include some kind of ranked system, the struggle we're having with this game idea is making it so it doesn't get stale quickly, which is why we're hesistant to implement it. Assuming we can make it more interesting, we want to create a game that makes you want to get a higher rank, so we'd add an incentive for that (similar to hearthstone's legendary rank) as well as add a bunch of cosmetic items that can be obtained through gameplay. \n\nJust wanted some feedback/ideas to improve the game, or whether or not it should be done."

First thing is to replace the continuous color selection by a limited color palette (say 5 - 10). Also the path taken by the disc is given. Now the goal of the user is to order the palette such that it camouflages the disc best for that background.

3sq8at,A new take on the city building game genre,"====Long Version====\n\nThis is a game idea I've had for many years now. I haven't been able to find an outlet to share it until now.\nThis will be long winded (short version follows below), but I hope you all find it as interesting as I think it is.\n\nIntro\n\nOver the years, I have enjoyed playing many city building games. The most prevalent of them is the SimCity series.\nAlthough they all (for the exception of one) are great games, there's always something (maybe slightly) on my nerves.\n\nIn SimCity 2000, the earliest starting year is 1900 if i remember correctly. However, you're stuck with using modern style\nbuildings. Being a history fan, it sort of irked me. \n\nThat, needless to say, got me thinking. What if there was a city (or in this case town, since its more manageable)\nbuilding game in which you could control a small town's history, from it's early days to its incorporation to the present?\n\nThus became the idea that has been developing in my mind for many years. I feel the best way to describe it is to take you\nthrough a ""game"". So here goes.\n\nDescription\n\nThe game would start with a typical main menu, perhaps with a historical themed background. After clicking ""New Game"" or\nsomething similar, you'd be taken to the region selection screen. This screen would resemble a map of the continental \nUnited States. From here you would pick which region your town will be built in. A town's development will depend on \nwhich region you pick. After you select your desired region, you will be able to name your town and select a starting\nyear (again dependant upon which region you select). After this, the game begins.\n\nYou start with a procedurally generated landscape. I'll use a Midwest example since I'm more familiar with that part of\nthe US, and a starting year in the 1800s. In most cases you will have a river flowing through a heavily forested area. \nThe first step in this case would be to build a sawmill. But you must cut down some trees to build it. It must also be\nbuilt next to a river. To accomplish this, you'll start out with a few people, for now known at settlers. They will cut\ndown several trees, which will be used to build the sawmill. Depending on the difficulty, you may also need to build a\nroad to connect the settlement to the rest of the world.\n\nAfter the sawmill is built, you can start to build buildings, such as houses, general stores, etc. Here is where the \nunique aspect of this game would come in. After selecting a building to build from a menu of some sort, you will be \ntaken to the building designer screen. Here you would decide just what said building will look like. You would select \nfrom several building shapes and materials according to the year that you are in. You can even decide the amount of\nwindows to put on the second floor, for example. this will result in very unique towns. You will then see your \nbuilding being built in historically accurate ways.\n\nThe game would have a day/night cycle as well as a realistic weather cycle. These will affect certain aspects of\nyour towns. There will also be disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc. depending on\nwhere your town is located.\n\nTime will pass in real time, and of course time compression would be available. This means that when one day/night\ncycle passes, that is one whole day in-game.\n\nI'll end the explanation here as it is long enough already. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\n====Short Version====\n\nI've had a game idea for many years. It would be a new take on the city building game genre.\n\nBasically, you would manage a small town from it's humble beginnings to the present. It would be historically\naccurate. For example, for a town in the Midwest, you would start off with a few settlers on a procedurally\ngenerated landscape. You would need to cut down trees to build a sawmill to start building buildings. \n\nYou would even be able to decide what each and every building looks like. No two towns will be exactly alike.\n\nIt ound also include a day/night cycle and realistic weather cycle that would addect your town in some way. Time \nwould pass in real time. Of course, time compression would be available.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\n"
3sq5y6,FIRST PERSON LIFE SIMULATION,"**Game Name:** (WIP Suggest in comments)\n**Age Rating:** Pegi 16\n\nThe game is a first person sims style game. You play in a small town where you can enter every building (including other neighbour's houses if you want to break the law and risk getting caught). The town would have the basics. A general store, a pub/bar, restaurant, town hall, a park, barber shop, clinic etc.\n\n**CUSTOMISATION AND SURVIVAL**\n\n You start the game by creating your character, a male or female adult. When you start the game you choose your house and you begin. You have to take care of your hunger, thirst, bladder, energy and hygiene. There would be additional needs that if not taken care of, can effect your character's stress/sanity levels. If you don't have any social interaction for days at a time you will become more awkward when it comes to talking to a person. If you don't entertain yourself and have some fun you will become more insane and if you work too much you will become stressed. You can completely get rid of any of these optional needs by choosing one of the 3 traits that cancel one of them out, Workaholic, Introvert, and dull. You have 20 points to spend on any of the following areas, Work experience (allows you to get good jobs easily), Romantic, Athletic, Social skills, quick learner (learns skills quicker)\n\n**RELATIONSHIPS**\n\n You can meet other people online, in the pub/bar or any public place. Social interaction would be similar to Bethesda games. When you interact with someone you will have different choices ranging from flirty/suggestive options to down right rude remarks. Each person in the game will have their own sexual preferences so even though your character may find someone attractive the other character may not be attracted to you or your gender. Over time your relationship with someone who likes you and you like them will build up and you can advance to the next level. The levels of relationships are: Nemesis, enemy, neutral, friend, best friend, girlfriend/boyfriend, fiance and wife/husband. Your character may have a crush on someone even though you have had minimal interaction with them.\n\n**JOBS AND TRANSPORT **\n\nNow for the exciting stuff. If you buy a car you can use it to drive around town using the WASD keys. Your character can become seriously injured or can even die when involved in a car accident. If you don't have a car then you would use call the taxi but you are charged depending on the length of the journey. Walking is the free alternative, obviously. Jobs include store clerk, police, fire fighter, doctor, barber and mayor. The police and fire fighter jobs are pretty self explanatory, you go to work, you respond to some calls, you put out fires/take bring justice to burglars, vandals etc.\n\n**DOCTORS**\n\nFor the doctor career you would have to bring in patients and diagnose them. To diagnose them, you have to ask the patient what's wrong, the patient would tell you the symptoms they're experiencing and you have to match up their symptoms with the infection/disease. Once you link the symptoms and disease it will tell you the drugs needed to cure them. You then find the appropriate antidote/prescription drugs and give them to your patient.\n\n**STORE CLERK &amp; BARBER**\n\n The store clerk includes you having to restock shelves, guide people looking for a particular item to the designated spot etc. This would most likely be your starting job and doesn't have very good pay. The barber will include people coming into the barbershop asking for a particular style and/or length. You go through the menu of many hairstyles and choose one. Each hair style and facial hair style comes with a length slider.\n\n**MAYOR**\n\n The mayor is responsible for the happiness of the citizens of the town. The mayor will receive complaints or suggestions for changes around the town. For example, someone asks for a supermarket to be built in town. Some people may not agree to build a supermarket as they already have a general store which is enough and the council should spend their money elsewhere. If you choose to build one the then one will start to be built. You can then visit the building and use it when finished. When you say not to build one you may lose respect from the people that wanted one. You can also raise and lower taxes and the budget for the police, medical and fire department.\n\n**FAMILIES**\n\n You can adopt a child or have one of your own. When you want to have a child with your significant other you get down to business in the bedroom and you or your wife might become pregnant. If your character is female and pregnant you will have to have a healthier diet, and you will be weaker as you move more slowly and your energy depletes faster when walking or standing for a long time. Your character may have morning sickness. After a week in game you will give birth and you will have to name your baby. Raising your baby may include your child crying, waking you up in the middle of the night to tend to him/her. Your child will gradually grow through the life stages, Infant, toddler, child, pre teen, teen, young adult, middle aged, mature adult, elder.\n\n**DEATH**\n\nDeaths will include old age, burned alive, drowning, disease, car accident, falling to death and murder. When your character dies you will have a choice to take control of your significant other or your child. Your character will have a funeral as well as any other person in the neighbourhood. Your family would be affected by deaths of close friends/family and will have to take time off work. Their social skills will be limited and won't want to talk to people.\n\n\nThat was my long and detailed idea for a game that would be absolutely awesome if made! **THANKS FOR READING!! :D**"
3spuoz,A game based around Adaptability.,"So I was reading some posts and suddenly got an Idea for a small and simple game (In my opinion)\n\nCore\n\nThis is essentially how the game idea works. So a certain amount of REAL ALIVE people (most likely 4) all start of getting to chose 3 or 4 items to put in their backpack.They all sit around a camp fire, talk a bit then go to sleep.The next day is when it gets REAL. There is a monster now that is lurking about but it is completely randomized. I was think like there may be a wild bear, a serial killer, a vampire or a werewolf ECT ECT. The Adaptability part about this game is about what you brought in your backpack. Say you thought you were going to be up against a vampire so you decided to bring some garlic, a stake and a cross and you come up against a serial killer, much use that garlic is going to do you! And other than bringing the equipment needed to kill the monster what about hunger, thirst and other problems? If you only bring things to kill a monster you are going to stave to death. What happens if you need a bandage to cover/clean a wound? These are all variables you would have to consider before you pick your items. Obviously items could server different functions such as you could use a knife to sharpen a stick. I was also thinking that you could find certain things when exploring in the day, such as finding a fruit tree, a wild boar ECT ECT. I was also thinking that random events could be a thing such as wild animals stealing your food if you don't guard your base or something like that but it isn't a necessity.\n\nVisuals\n\nI was thinking like a 1st person view, nice graphics but nothing spectacular, I was also thinking along the sort of gameplay or style as this game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ITRLLOK3eo but I would personally like to have better graphics in this game :P\n\nSetting\n\nI was thinking that the game would most likely be based in a forest but thanks to IceCube77 it gave me an idea that the maps could also be random but not as in randomly generated more like it is a random chance that you will be placed into a Forest, Haunted House or an Island or something along those lines.\n\nPeople who gave me great ideas!\n\nIceCube77 gave me the idea about random different maps!\nKarakter222 submitted the idea of mod support\n\nAll in all this is just an idea and I understand it might not be incredible simple but I think the core mechanic is pretty simple and I hope this gets made into a game because I would love to play it!\nI am open to criticism and I hope you share your own ideas for this game in the comments below!\n\nThe reason I posted this game idea is so I either give other game developers ideas or so that I remember this idea and can make it into a game myself once I have enough  experience to do so!

3spshw,A Fairy Tail Based Game,"I've been looking for a good fairy tail game for a while but then i just thought of an amazing idea for a game based on fairy tail.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nLets start from the start of the game, first you would create your character on a character creation screen.Then you would pick your first magic to learn (i.e fire, ice make,water,air,celestial magic,re-quip,transformation).I don't really know exactly how the game would start but imagine it anyway you want!\n\nMagic\n\nNow before i explain the battle mechanics i will explain the magic! So i guess if you have watched the show or read the manga you would be wondering why there is no dragon slayer in the example options it is because the are what i would call ""Advanced Magic"". This class of magic includes types of magic like dragon slayer, time ark, human possession, ark of embodiment, letter magic, card magic ect ect .These types of magic could be unlocked during the main quest line, side quests and taught by other guild members which involve several challenges which need to be completed.I was thinking that 1 character would be able to have 3 different magics I will now go into detail of the celestial wizard magic so you can get a relative idea of what i'm thinking. Celestial wizards will be able to obtain gate keys in shops and from quests. When a celestial wizard fights they will use their weapon as their basic attack.Their magic powers would be based around gate keys like in the show.Like in the show there would be silver and gold gate keys.The silver keys would just be an ability like the clock Horologium would let you sit inside of him and it would protect you from damage while increasing your mana regen or something like that.Then the gold gate keys would summon their respective celestial spirits but unlike the silver gate keys your character would disappear and the celestial spirit you summoned would appear and you would control it!

3sou9t,3rd person Hero-based VR tower defense game,"So as the title says, I'm currently working on a 3rd person tower defense game where you control a single character (the hero). \n\nThe gameplay involves you running around your castle courtyard and improving/repairing/building walls and equipment between waves. \n\nOnce a wave starts, enemies start spawning outside the walls and you can either run out there to meet them face on(challenging), or simply defend from behind the walls(easier). \n\nThe benefit of going outside the walls would be to gather materials (chop down trees, mine ore, or pickup enemy drops), or to kill them before they start damaging your walls. \n\nThere is also a stamina bar that will lower when you're outside the wall, and teleport you back to your castle to recharge once you run out.\n\nThe camera view is shown from an elevated side view opposed to the traditional 3rd person view (behind the back). My reasoning for this is because my intended platform release is the Oculus Rift, which allows the player to look to left (your castle) and the right (the battlefield). This type of camera control gives the player that ""strategy"" type feel that is common with Tower Defense, but plays like a 3rd person side-scroller without the limited axis movement.\n\nI still have a lot of work to do in terms of balancing and what type of powerups I want to include (hero armor / weapons, upgradable towers, offensive towers, hirable NPC troops, etc.), but I'm open to any suggestions anyone might have.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects that I've encountered so far is that most tower defense games are heavily stat-based, yet in the Oculus and other VR devices, displaying lots of text is usually a no-no. So far, I've just been adding health bars above characters and towers. Still considering the best way to handle the rest.\n\nSo, any thoughts / criticisms? I'd love to hear if anyone knows of another Tower Defense game based around controlling a single player rather than  just spawning numerous AI npcs.\n\nThanks!"
3sn0uj,Immersive simulation in RTS,"Hey guys.\n\nI'm an indie game dev, right now I'm working on an RTS on Unreal Engine 4. Basically I'm making it very close to ""Dawn of War II"" in terms of mechanics, and right now I want to add another form of game design, it's called an Immersive simulation.\n\nAlright, you can read more particular about immersive sims here:\nhttp://www.giantbomb.com/immersive-sim/3015-5700/\nbut basically it's a game design concept, when you have 1 task and different ways to solve it. Like VtM: Bloodlines, Dishonored, Deus Ex. And right now I want to implement this concept into RTS.\n\nBasically my vision of this concept is the improved ""Dawn of War II"" vision about heroes. You pick one of 3-4 heroes before the game starts, and the hero changes your gameplay.\n\nFor example, we have a fast hero, and he can make everyone around him faster, so he should specialize on ""zergrush"" tactics, when you get the opportunity of the map first and hold it, getting more resources and map control.\n\nOn the other hand, we can invent a hero, who's stronger the more resources you have (kind of greedy noble). Here you tactics changes to stashing resources, instead of spending.\n\nOr a hero that bribe enemy's unit and take control of him.\n\nOr a stealth hero, who operates separately from other army and becomes stronger.\n\nI would like to hear your ideas about that concept/mechanics and maybe someone has the idea about particular hero? I didn't really thought about setting yet, not that important for me, but we don't see a lot of fantasy RTS right now, so I think that's the best way of thinking for now."
3smfqb,[Intermediate?] Conservation of Ninjitsu! (TRPG),"The idea comes from the trope: [Conservation of Ninjitsu](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu) with the tl:dr version being that each side only has so much ninjitsu to go around, which is why the lone hero curbstomps mooks.\n\nNow, the game idea would be where this is an intentional, overt game mechanic.  You would have X Ninjitsu (referred to as N forward), your primary resource, every fight for a turn based rpg.  You would get to choose how many characters to deploy, with each gaining an even share of the resource.  Each character has the same base stats (or even no stats pre-N) but has certain stats that get an increased share and a decreased share of the N (never resulting in a net gain of N) so that each character is somewhat unique and specialized.  Mooks would have no specialties, but the bad guys could have boss style characters that do.  \n\nFor a quick and dirty example, you have 100 N for a battle.  You decide to deploy 5 ninjas, so each ninja gets 20 N.  This N is spread across (we'll say) 5 stats, meaning each stat gets 4 extra points for that battle.  Johnny though is good at melee and bad at range, so his melee gets 6 and his range only 2.\nBut lets say we only fielded 1 lone hero, Johnny Karate!  He'd get all 100 N so each stat would get TWENTY points.  Still, his Melee is better than range so his Melee stat goes up 30 and his range only 10.\n\nThings that could make the individual battles more dynamic might be bad guys that steal a percentage of a targets N, making it a bigger risk to centralize as that percentage would result in greater overall lose.  Or perhaps in a battle an enemy realizes the righteousness of your cause and defects!  Oh no, suddenly Johnny Karate only has 50 N!  Sure, you have a new ally, but can Johnny handle the loss of so much power?\n\nBetween battles you could use your N to buy equipment that would provide static bonuses to the stats and such.  Perhaps special abilities to ensure the fights are varied as well.\n\nOne of the most obvious hurdles I see is ensuring that there are enough stats/uses for N that the primary mechanic has an engaging amount of depth.  Battle balance might be difficult to test as you'd likely need to try multiple load outs.  Upside, characters would be comparatively easy to create as their stats are almost completely determined by N."
3smc3w,Maximum Entropy (RTS) Unique Ideas,
3skrin,realistic survival game with deep combat,"the game could have zombies or not, the combat would be realistic, deep and with as many choices as possible. you'd have access to very little ammo. melee combat would consist of stabbing and slashing, with a button assigned to stabbing and another one to slashing. weapons could get stuck on enemies, and each hit will cripple the enemies significantly, depending on the body part it impacts. you can  make molotovs and booby traps , drive vehicles and use parkour. there would be stealth and rpg mechanics . also it would be open world, and moving between mission would be a challenge. what do you think?"
3skhn5,[Dream] The Birth of a Lich,"First off, some terminology:\n\nLich - A dark sorcerer who has put their soul in a box to become immortal. They die and go insane in the process, but become a walking skeleton with red glows in their sockets. When their corpse is destroyed it is rebuilt at the soul-box, called a phylactery.\n\nNecromancy - Raising corpses from the dead as slaves or soldiers. The slaves are sentient and if the person controlling them, a necromancer or lich, is weak then the slaves can break free and kill them. The conditions in which they die or are raised decides what they are. Also their alignment. For example, murderer who's corpse is raised in a swamp becomes a ""ghoul"" or green, obese monster with poisonous claws. \n\nThe Game:\n\nPlot - There's this boy who is very weak and tortured by all. His life sucks terribly and he is mentally unstable. He spends all his free time reading. He finds an ancient book of necromancy and becomes a lich to rid himself of his weakness and exact revenge on all.\n\nThe game is similar to Fallout.\n\nGameplay - For the first portion of the game you are human. You have needs like hunger and thirst and it's an open world. You have stats that you can raise and whatever. You can stay in this portion for forever if you want. But you are weak and beaten up. This is MEANT to be annoying.\n\nAt some point you find the Necronomicon and become a lich after going through a long process and gathering things. You have to kill an infant as part of the ritual. Then all needs are gone and your stats are changed. For example, stamina becomes infinite. \n\nYou are able to raise corpses in cemeteries, spots where you killed people, and other places where bodies are dumped. You play the game in two different modes. In one it's first person and you have spells and things. In another it's an RTS view and you command your army. You can do the same things in both modes but it's easier or stronger in only one mode. \n\nAt first you are getting revenge on various civilians. Second you are battling the police. Finally, the military are after you. If you die then you respawn at your phylactery. You can move your phylactery anywhere, but if it is found and destroyed (the AI will be intelligent) then something happens depending on difficulty. On normal you lose your lich powers and have to get them back. \n\nYou can choose how you use your powers and save people if you're THAT guy. "
3skca0,"[Abstract] Physics-based, realistic medieval arena combat.","You hold down left click and move the mouse to swing and your weapon follows. You use arrow keys to control the position of your shield or hold right click and move the mouse to use an off-hand weapon if both weapons are small. \n\nEach person has a semi-replica of the human body inside of them, with organs and blood and bone. Every weapon affects the body in various ways. If you get hit in the knee with a mace then you fall over and can barely stand. \n\nYou can parry weapons with your own, block with your shield, evade using movement, or hit them before they hit you. \n\nBladed and pointed weapons sink into flesh and damage the body. You can bleed to death and you get weaker the more blood you lose. \n\nIf you press a button then you let go of your weapon. If you are swinging when you let go the weapon is thrown. Also you can have bare hands to grab or fist-fighting. \n\nIt seems complicated but every other combat game focuses on a bunch of other shit as well. This one skips that and you just need an area, opponent, and everything I've described. "

3sfpz6,game where you have demon powers(not like the darkness),"you'd have the following powers: moving objects telekinetically, levitating(like possesed people), possessing people( and being able to do a variety of things while doing it unlike dishonored),  temporarily havig superhuman strength and agility, and having some sort of demon claw. you have abilities and earn experience points by gruesomely killing people(the more gruesome the kill the more xp you earn) and maybe a few more powers. also it would be open world and there would be rpg and stealth mechanics. it would make for an interesting story too.what do you think?"
3se9wd,RAP BATTLE MMO,"Takes place in a crazy city, customizable in each server depending on how the players spend their cash. Players walk around the town socializing and chatting with their mics. If there are lots of players  in the general vincinity you can challenge another nearby player to a rap battle. Nearby players can give you thumbs up for good lines and rhymes etc. After each player has rapped the nearby players vote on who they thought won the rap battle. You can also have 4 player duels where one beet boxes and the other raps. You are ranked based on who you beat in rap battles, similar to how professional tennis works. The top twenty rappers have their names displayed on a huge electronic display in the middle of the city at ""Rhyme Square"" with the names increasing in size until you get to the number one rapper, whose name is gigantic. The higher your rank the more income you earn per hour, which allows you to build houses (similar to in the sims)/get rare outfits for your character/interesting vehicles like helicopters and buses to drive etc. "
3sd9im,"A time travel experiment has gone haywire and turned Earth into a prehistoric mutant wasteland, and you must survive (single player, linear, story-based).","The game's main story would be set within the first few months of the apocalypse. The setting would be on the south-east coast of the US, and the environment would be filled with prehistoric and feral animals in the early parts of the story, but with more mutant animals appearing as a consequence of nuclear power plant meltdowns and leaking of mutagenic pollutants into the environment. The prehistoric animals would be diverse, with relatively few dinosaurs compared to non-dinosaurian reptiles. I have a few ideas for species below, which I think are unique and interesting. Mutant versions should be even more terrifying.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasolasuchus (largest non-dinosaurian terrestrial predator)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanlong (like a raptor, but closer to T. rex)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopsipes (the appearance of this animal is completely speculative, which allows you a lot of artistic license)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_(dinosaur) (DINOBAT!)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaekelopterus (crocodile-scorpion)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekosuchus (some have suggested this was arboreal, so basically a drop croc)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngandong_tiger (possibly the largest tiger)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakicetus (dog-whale)\n\nOf course, there would be human enemies, and feral animals from escaped exotic pets. Perhaps there could be mutant animals like giant venomous Nile monitors, giant tarantulas, giant ligers, crazy killer monkeys, etc? Don't forget mutant prehistoric creatures.\n\nFor a bit of a creative twist, perhaps one could make up a few fictional, speculative prehistoric species (similar to what Terra Nova did with the slashers). The fossil record is incomplete, so what else might their be to find? Perhaps a prehistoric zombie virus (please use zombies sparingly if you do)?\n\nOverall, this game would be similar in premise and setting to Turok Evolution, Fallout, The Last of Us and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I don't know of an exact story/plot or characters, maybe someone could come up with that themselves. Overall, it should be a really fun game.\n\nEDIT: For any indies reading this, I ask of you, that if you make this game, include a mutant saber-toothed liger in it. Thanks."
3scdzm,Psychic Arena Online: A first person shooter game (or a top down moba type game) in that uses normal keyboard controls for the character movements... however attacks are freeformed creative burst of energy directly created by your brainwaves. Game includes a brainwave cap. (cont),"*I dreamed about this concept last night, and saw the game on store shelves and it included a brain cap with the game. May God bless this idea to fruition!*\n\n------------------------\nThe game includes a spell factory that in single player mode you fine tune, hone, and practice your ""psychic"" attacks. You can assigned labels to your attacks, colors, and many other modifiers. So for example if you think about FIREBALL in your mind, it creates a specific wave pattern that can be read by the brain cap. Then the game cast a spell that you labeled ""fireball"". The spell comes out with the colors and effects you designed in your spell factory, uses energy from your resource bar, etc.\n\nHowever the intensity of the attacks, and the forms and shapes they take on are actually developed by going through the in game tutorial and calibration, so that someone with a powerful burst of brain activity can achieve more damage then lets say a vegetable in a coma.\n\nThe intent is that a novice just starting the game, that after calibration will have basic minor damage attacks. But as you become more skilled and practice training in the singleplayer spell factory and calibration, you can create much more powerful spell attacks.\n\nThe game will be a league based multiplayer experience, as to keep those of similar power battling each other (iron sharpens iron). Then when we see this become an esport those with the most powerful brains will have spectacular battles and spells, entertaining us all.\n\nPsychic Arena Online! Live on ESPN 8 *The Ocho*"

3sa5wb,Geek Ultimate Football (2-4) Players - Full team with network.,"Always imagined a football game where instead of playing with known players, play with anime characters (and perhaps games).\n\nThe name could be Geek Football(soccer).\n\nBasically, it would be a game with as much as possible of customization options based on anime and popular games, giving option to create from 0 or use ready-made characters. In this game i could make a team with:\n\n*Gandalf (Mage hat+old man+staff+robe color)\n\n*A men with a Daedric Armor\n\n*Gon in adult form (imagine the hair over the screen)\n\n*Majin Boo\n\n*Lelouch\n\n*Lina Inverse\n\n*Doraemon\n\n*Camus\n\n*Captain Harlock...\n\nWhy a game like this?\n\nTo fill the gap that was missing in today's football games.\n\nWe play Mario Football or FIFA, with those formation screens and boring editing.\n\nThis game would have a much larger audience because the fact that many people prefer not to play this kind of game for not knowing the players or things about football.\n\nBUT, if it's a game where the fun is you play with your favorite character and evolve it ... would be a legendary game, as DON (Dragon ball.Onepiece.Naruto) for PS2.\n\nWithout mentioning the amount of DLCs that could be created, as new anime with good players as Meliodas and Adlet Mayer continue to be created. Would not need to create a new version every year simply would create a database that would support and organize an unlimited amount of characters to choose, being perfect for get money with DLCs.\n\nHideo Kojima create a ""Solid Snake"", send to game owners and got a part of money from this DLC.\n\nCAPCOM create a ""Megaman"", send to game owners and got a part of money from this DLC...\n\nYOU get the DLC, for example, from Yasuri Shichika. You will be able to use his suit and hair on other character and create a new.\n\nA game where you will laugh looking Konata using a ""special kick"" and (maybe) be able to play with 4 playes or fill all team using the network.

3tquzp,A niche idea. (My first and possibly last I'll post in this.),"And yeah, I am by no means good.\n\n""What happens if you mix the following: Fighting Giant Robots, Musicians, Cyberpunk and Rocking sounding tracks?""\n\nThe game consist in beat'em Up, hack and slash and action game with some music elements, mainly in the mini games. The most climatic battle themes are overall vocal tracks. The Story is told depending on which protagonist you choose, then a final episode is unlocked when you have all the single episodes ended.\n\nThere are Six buttons: Weak (Square, X, Y), Mid (Triangle, Y, X), Strong (Circle, B, A), and Jump (Cross, A, B), Shield (R1, RB, R) and Break (L1, LB, L). In Sienna's case, two other buttons were added. Flying (L2, LT, ZL) and Shooting (R2, RT, ZR).\n\nThe Zones are limited exploration, and also where you play as the Mech, you're capable to Fly and shooting in the air.\n\nAlso if the ""Rocking time"" bar (Tension bar in case of the mech fighter), is full, they will reach a special ability known as ""It's Rocking time!"" in where the player has to follow a certain series of commands (Sync to the music) when a certain character theme is playing [In the case of Mech fighter, the Main theme of the game plays and she attacks using her mech or the ""companion"" using its ability which is ""lighten' up"" the enemies.], this is not applied in big bosses battle however, in these cases, is achieved when the boss that they're fighting, has less than 10% of its life bar.\n\nThe cutscenes are 3DCG in the very major events, with the In-game cutscenes applied in minor events.\n\nIn the portable versions, the cutscenes are replaced by Visual novel-like scenes with renders, this is applied in minor, but in important events will have full cutscenes. Due to limitations.\n\nIt has four protagonists (only one riding a mecha.) and three sub characters, the others are NPC, bosses are few monsters and other mecha fighters.\n\nName of the concept is The FEAST Saga: Feast of the Black Strings. (Or just cut the TF Saga.) I think it fits any console from current and older generations."

3tqdtx,I don't know what genre this would fall in...,"ok, just a heads up I'm not the best with grammar, I'm more of a math person. I'll try my best though \n\nso I got to thinking the other day, how can I make an RPG game where the dungeons and quests are always different and fun? mainly the quest, because in most RPGs quests are simply go here and get this, after the main quest, of course. I thought to myself, maybe the players could just build the world... then the players will know what the quest is and it won't be fun. I scratched that idea, and got back to the drawing board... then I thought what if one player could build the world for other players? Not going to be much fun for the world builder... well what If the world builder had an end goal? what could the end goal be? To face the players? it seems like it would be unfair for other players and the world builder. so what if the world builder had an enemy? Like another world builder?\n\n\nbasically you have two world builders taking turns building the world (laying down tiles) every piece they lay down will have rules and points (rules for players and points for the world builder) the objectives for the world builder is to kill the other Worldbuilders team... they do that by placing traps and monsters in the world, they can also help your own team by placing items and loot down.. \n\nthe player's objective is to take control of land they don't own (From the other world builder) \n\nthe world builders have tiles that define the game one tile could be a quest another could have a chance to spawn loot, items, chests, healing effect for certain race... it could be a no battle zone, it could just be a piece of land.. they could be a town, market, or shop.. every 3 or more pieces they have together is considered a territory at the end of the game whoever has the most territory will fight the dungeon boss the movie are the ones who are going to build the area that the winners have to fight in...

3tpof7,"A silly, rather rage inducing simulator (Surgeon Simulator like, I suppose).","It might not be something anyone wants to make or play, but I thought I'd put it out there.

I'm sorry if it's not accurate.)\n\nGet Your Kids Ready to Play in the Snow\n\nObjectives: Get your (two) fully dressed kids outside. This requires them to be wearing: pants, shirt, socks, coat, snow pants, gloves, hat, and boots.\n\nThe challenging part: They start off with pants, shirt, and socks on, but that may not always be so. The little one may decide that pants are not for him and he'd rather run away and hide behind the door with one of the older one's boots while you try to get the older one to keep his damn gloves on. Once you finally find the little one and get his pants on, the older one doesn't think he needs a coat anymore and a shirt will be just fine. Why doesn't the little one's left boot fit on? Well, you might need to check and see if there's a toy in it. (Or maybe it's a live octopus or a life-sized bike, I don't know, it's a ridiculous game.)\n\nThe children don't talk (maybe they laugh at you mockingly; ""ha ha, you can't get me!""), the controls aren't great, and I figure it'd be funniest if you could accidentally KO the kids or something. (For example, lift the little one's foot up too fast in an attempt to get his boots on and you accidentally make him slam his head against the wall. Or zip up a coat without being aware of where your other hand is and now you're missing some fingers.) Like I said in the title, think Surgeon Simulator."

3tm3lc,MMORPG Idea – Any thoughts?,"Hi everybody, \n\nBefore you read I just wanted to say that this idea does have some elements of different games out there. If there is a game like this one I'm totally unaware of it. Also, I do know how big the game would be since there are so many variables.\n\nI didn't think of a story for it, only the game mechanics. I actually hard think about it, but for some reason I couldn't stop thinking about this idea, so I had to write down. After doing so I had no idea what to do with it. I found this reddit and I decided to post. Since I don't work in the industry I don't think I will actually go after be making this idea real, so I just wanted to hear some opinions on it.  \n\nThanks.\n\n**The Idea**\n_________________________\n\n**SMALL INTRO**\n\nFor the entire game you are an adventure, but most adventurers decide to be part of a guild so they can learn new techniques and become stronger. Entering a guild has its benefits, but also brings responsibilities. To become stronger you have to play well in your guild, you have to complete quests and help it triumph over the others. \n\nSome Guilds don’t get along very well. Although they are very similar in many ways, their beliefs and values are different and it makes it harder to have to overcome the rivalry between them. \n\nRivalry determines how likely it is to a Guild to form alliances to others. While Knights and Priests may fight together (Quests and War), Knights and Mercenaries will hardly fight alongside. \n\nI won’t write now the difference between the classes because most of you already have an idea of how each one works. Those are not fixed classes, if the game was really to be created, the classes would be revised and probably changed. \n\n**CLASSES / GUILDS:**\n\n**Adventurer**\n\n**Knights / Mercenaries**\nRivalry: 85%\n\n**Bounty Hunters / Assassins**\nRivalry: 100%\n\n**Wizards / Shamans**\nRivalry: 80%\n\n**Priests / Necromancers**\nRivalry: 95%\n\n**Hunters / Barbarians** \nRivalry: 65%\n\n**Rangers / Hitmen**\nRivalry: 70%\n\n**Blacksmith / Magic Smith**\nRivalry: 60%\n\nRivalry will be displayed between all guilds, I only showed the main rivalry of each guild, assuming that all the others have small or no rivalry. \n\nRivalry rate can be changed through Diplomatic Missions offered in each Guild Center, however Diplomacy isn’t a big thing in any of the Guilds. At least it wasn’t until the game starts.\n\nIn the game there are 2 alliances, at the beginning they are well divided, and even though it is unlikely for the alliances to change, some guild might overcome the rivalry with other guilds and join a difference alliance. \n\nThe main rivalry between classes might hardly be overcome since some of the quests will influence the rivalry level. \n_________________________\n**Character ’Uniqueness’: **\n\n**Leveling**\n\nThe game doesn’t have a character level system. You get stronger according to your own experiences. Players will be able to differentiate experienced players from unexperienced players through different mechanisms such as Guild Rank, Accomplishments, and Equipments. \n\n**Guild Rank**\n\nThe Guild Rank differentiates experienced and unexperienced players. It can only be acquired be merit. Guild Rank is earned as a character gets stronger and finishes Guild Missions. Guild Ranks gives players some benefits\n\n**Accomplishments**\n\nThe game is not based in level, so to understand more specifically  how strong a character is, you can check his accomplishments. This shows how experienced the player is. Accomplishments are divided in different sections that allow players to be experienced in different sections. ( e.g: Player X is a Blacksmith and he killed a strong BOSS - you know how strong player X is because of that. However, when you check Player X Crafting accomplishments, he doesn’t have much experience in forging strong weapons.) \n\nAccomplishments makes players famous. As the game grows, some accomplishments become dull, but some others can be unique and give players advantages on players interaction. \n\n**Talent**\n\nEach character gets a random Talent, which can guide the player to make specific game choices (like choosing a guild, or building a specific stat….) \n\n– As the character grows, it discovers new talents\n– New talents are found according to how you use your character, if you have started to improve your fighting skills, you may find out that you have a talent to use AXES. However, it doesn’t mean that you HAVE to do so. \n– Talents gives a slight advantage to the character to do something specific\n– Characters can’t lose/give up/ change its talents – It isn’t designed to help players do what they want, but give them choices to do something else. \n\n**Desire**\n\nDifferent from Talent, you can actually choose your desire. If you want to improve your Sword Technique, it gives you a slight advantage in training with a sword and building Strength. \n\nYour desire change from time to time (Let’s say every 3 weeks). The player has to choose a desire from a list. This list start small, and it grows according to the character intelligence. \n\nThe desires you can chose come from the choices you made in the game (what class you are, what skills and stats were improved lately, what cities you visited, what monsters you killed)\n\n**Lightness/Darkness**\n\nDetermines in percentage the tendency for a player to be the good samaritan or the evil villain (not real terms, just being 'good' or 'bad' in the virtual society eyes). It is a basic measurement of your in-game actions. It can make it easier or more difficult to acquire certain skills or access some locations. \n\n(e.g: If you become an Assassin, your darkness increase significantly, but it doesn’t mean that you can’t become a “Good Assassin”, it might be very hard to overcome this, and many players may not even try, but the ones that do may acquire different skills or go to different cities and have access to different monsters and itens within those cities, and different accomplishments) \n\n**UNIQUE CLASS**\n\nPlayers can become whatever they want. They might choose to be part of the Knights Guild (following certain requirements first), but then specialize on using Magic Skills or Long Range Weapons.  All the players will have the same opportunities, allowing them to create their own “unique class”, it won’t be easier, since some paths might be harder according to the choices each player made with their characters.\n\n_____________________________\n\n**Weaponry:**\n\nPlayers can use any weapon. However, they might not be as good using one than another. Players can improve as many weapons as they want, but it gets harder to master a second weapon. If the player tries to master 2 weapons at the same time it will be harder than mastering 1, but also easier than mastering one than another.\n\n(meaning - player switches 2 different weapons back and forward - or - uses both hands for attack but different weapons on each hand) \n\nPlayers can equip any weapon. However, certain weapons will have requirements so they can be properly used, to maintain the balance between unexperienced players. Those requirements can make even excellent weapons become terrible in the ‘wrong hands’. Weapons will have ‘excuses’ such as “this weapon is too heavy”. Of course it will be based on character stats and skills, but the weapons won’t tell you the necessary stats to use it. (So if you like the weapon, you might want to train so you can use it properly).\n\nEach type of weapon will have its own stat which will increase according to the experience your character has with each one. \nAlso, each type will have its own advantages and disadvantages so you can create your own combat strategies. \n\n**MELEE**\n* Swords\n* Knifes\n* Spears\n* Axes\n* Scythe\n* Hammers\n* Maces\n* Staff\n* Wands\n* Shield\n\n**LONG RANGE**\n* Bows\n* Guns\n* Throwing Knifes\n\n_________________________\n\n**CHARACTER PRIMARY STATS:**\n\nCharacter stats will only increase when improve character skills. \n\n**Strength** – Melee Damage, *Defense* , *Attack Speed*\n\n**Intelligence** – Magic Attack, Mana, Desire\n\n**Vitality** – Health Points, Defense, Faster Recovering \n\n**Accuracy** – Long Range Damage, Attack Range, *Melee Damage* , *Magic Damage*\n\n**Agility** – Attack Speed, Dodging Chance, Movement Speed \n\n**Intuition** – Critical Attack Chance, *Magic Attack* , *Defense*, *Dodging Chance* \n\n(Italic)  *It’s not increased as much as the others* \n_________________________\n**MAGIC TYPES:**\n\nPlayer can learn any Magic, however Talent will play a big part on choosing the first magic type a player might learn (player can ignore the talent, but it will be more difficult to improve magic skills at the beginning) \n\nA second magic type can be learned, but it will be even more difficult and less stronger. (Even harder for a third one). However, once a player learn 2+ magic types, it can learn combined magic attacks which are stronger and better against weakness magic types. Also, a player can’t learn a new magic type that is (or will be) the weakness of the one(s) he already learned. (e.g: If player learns fire, it can’t learn water. – If player learns Fire and Wind, he won’t be able to learn any other ELEMENTAL magical type)\n\n**ELEMENTAL MAGIC TYPES**\n\n* **Fire**  – Water Weakness\n\n* **Water** – Lightning Weakness\n\n* **Wind** – Earth Weakness\n\n* **Lightning** – Wind Weakness\n\n* **Earth** – Fire Weakness\n\n**POWER MAGIC TYPES**\n\n* **Dark** – Light Weakness\n\n* **Light** – Dark Weakness\n\nDark and Light Magic only weakness are each other. They can only be learned by those who wants to be part of the Magical Guilds ( Wizards, Shamans, Priests, Necromancers). Those are the only classes that are able to learn up to 3 Magic Types and perform combined attacks of those 3 magic types. \n\nThere is no obligation that Light/Dark Classes have to learn a specific type. As an example, a Priest can learn Dark Magic instead of Light and a Shaman can learn a Light Magic instead of Dark. However, those who decide to do so will have a harder time to improve their skills, but they will also have access to unique skills. \n\n\n_________________________\n**SKILLS TYPES:**\nEach skill type has many other branches of skills. Each skill will guide players on what to do do acquire/improve it. Some skills may be acquired through quests ( at least to open a new branch of skills.)\n\n* **FIGHT** - Improves weapon types and attacks\n\n* **MAGIC** - Improves magic type, mana regeneration, and spells\n\n* **LONG RANGE** - Improves use of long-range weapon and attacks\n\n* **DEFENSE** - Improves defense mechanisms \n\n* **SWIFT** - Improves agility related attacks/dodge\n\n* **CRAFTING** - Improves crafting/blacksmith/magicsmith\n\n* **HUNTING** - Improves accuracy related attacks and allows some game mechanism - (traps, taming, better relationship with wild monsters)\n\n* **HEALTH** - Improves recovery stats and immunization (poisons, magic types…)\n\n* **DIPLOMACY** - Skills that if improved gives player access to different locations and better communication with other guilds disregarding Darkness/Lightness and Classes. \n\n* **LIFE** - Set of “life skills” that can aid on small tasks (e.g: Cooking, Fishing……..and many others)\n_________________________\n\n\n**So what do you think?**\n\n*Sorry for poor english*\n"
3tlo20,chuck norris: the game,"you could do tons of impossible things because you play as chuck norris. i think it would make for a very entertaining, fun game. i haven't thought of the details yet. what do you think?"
3tlgsc,Don't if it works ?,"My idea start with a map super realistic from a BIG city or even country. In this map, you'll be able to be everybody in the world but it's only in the beginning that you choose your vocation. After that (in solo mode), depends of your profession you got a lot of mission to do. Like if you choose firefighter profession at the start you can choose a small appartement to live that you pay monthly, also you can pimp your house like the game SIMS. You got a schedule job and if you respect it you go to the barracks where you can, clean and repair the truck, prepare for a future operation, traning, after fire clean the vehicule, play game with your team, find a dog but when the alarm come you all take your bunker and jump in the truck : it can be a mission for a fire, for rescue or healing someone, it can be a car accident, a suicidal person, toxic liquid on the ground, etc. (Still miss some detail). Online you have the right to respond to all the call that you have, you work in cooperation with the police, paramedic and even army. Tho police do the security between the scene (protect the firefighter and paramedic), (the citizen) (the scene), the paramedic waiting to heal and transport the victim in the hospital and firefighter stop the fire, make the rescue, find the water spot, use the autopomp, control the ladder, control the hose, etc. After that come back to the barrack until your shift finish. Your job make you win money, with this you can buy everything in the world, food, decoration for your house, cars, clothes, strip club, ski, snow, bike, movie theater, bar, buy your own condo, own house, etc. And this work for all the profession you choose at the begining like police, paramedic, construction for repair everything, for building house, bulding, judge, lawyer, work at restaurant, etc. You can do all the jobs in the world and you get money for doiing it, like the REAL life ... It's just a idea there s a lot of factor that maybe can't work but I just dream about this !"
3tj9jo,A question of Morals?,"Hey guys, so after developing an idea for an MMORPG with my brother and friends for months we noticed a question pop up that could only be answered by the community. If mystery was a vital part of our game's integrity and it was such a game that thousands of people play, would you guys abide by a code of conduct to not relinquish information about the game through guides and strategies on the internet if you were rewarded with a mysterious and beneficial  gift/update every month? Beside the point, I truly believe this game would revolutionize the RPG genre if and when done correctly, even without the confidentiality."
3tj6ow,[Dream][metroidvenia] this game came to me in a dream... so yea,"anyone that wants a good idea to make a game around fell free to use this just credits and whatnot\n\n""those of us that know that the world is broken can exploit it""\nbefore i start this game came to me in a dream, thought you might be interested.\n\nintro~ you see 2 guys arguing next to a cliff, one guy gets pushed off of this cliff and you run in and grab his arm, not realizing when you did so there was a spike jutting out from the cliff that you impaled this man on and\nkilled him you then find a document on him that explains something about time loops and asks the guy you just killed to try to find away to fix everything\nyou then turn around to a guy that says ""i haven't seen him die like this before"" and goes on to explain to you what has been going on, this man is appart of a group of people that have found a disruption in the flow of time\nanyone that knows about these temporal enomolies can exploit them and pretty much travel back to any point in time up to the point in which they learned about this... i guess for you this point would be right now.\n he then goes on to explain ""that guy you just killed has died alot before... well not yet, but yea i have seen him die alot, its all very confusing so just go with it, he was recruited to our group because he was one of \n the best problem solving minds we have been able to find but when he was shown about this he just started dying... alot. we arent sure how tho, see the thing is he doesn't make sence, one man no matter who they are should \n only be able to die one time, i was actualy sent to investigate him and find out how hes doing it, along with trying to fix this temporal mess. but sofar i have come up with nothing, he dies and just reappears randomly in a\n different part of time be it future, or past. the thing thats really concerning is when he found out he could do this he started hunting the rest of our group, i guess he wants to be the only person that can exploit time like\n this, and at this rate he very well might be. so i ask you, would you be interested in helping to fix time and possibly stop him from going on a killing spree, i feel the 2 are closely linked. if you want to help i will show\n you how we manupliate time. now keep in mind, this isnt a life saving ability, if you kill someone, on perpous or by accident, with the unexplainable exception of that man, they are dead. even if go back in time and change\n yoru actions, something will kill them at that moment. hell i saw 1 man who was killed drop dead from a heart attack because there was nothing enviromentaly that could kill him at the right moment... ""more plot blaa""\n\n\nso main mechanic of this game is traviling back in time, the only way to progress time forward is to actualy do things such as events or if its night you can sleep. it would be a metroidvania when you progress through different\n paths by learning information you shouldnt know at certant points in the game, or getting items that were other wise locked off. example"" there is an event being held at 2:30, the only way to get into this event is with an\n invitation card. to get this you wait until the party is over and find one in a trash bin, then rewind time and go to the party. now this may have harsh consequences, being you get to the party with ""tom's"" invitation, then\n 5 minuted later tom shows up, this can spell trouble for you because you are a fake and can be found out and punished. to solve this you must inconvience tom(maybe kill him or something less harsh) to delay him long enough\n for you to get any information you might need from this event and leave before the real tom shows up\n\nnow time ticks along at a normal pace if you arent doing anything important (24 hour days or something long) but going to events or setting other people up will excelerate that time. maybe you go to a movie this action will\n increese time by a certant ammount(you dont actualy have to shit threw a movie) but these actions can only be done once a day (unless you rewind threw the action) so you have to balance is it worth rewinding a day to try\n to learn or obtain something, or just to try to atend an event that may or may not help you in your over arching quest. now other things you can do, like stated if you kill someone they will die, so if you need to delay\n someone you could find a path they take to work or an event or something and kill someone infront of them, then rewind time and watch that person just die in there path, this causes them normaly to have to stop and call\n the cops and fill out reports and such. since you rewound time you weren't directly involved in this person dying and will be excluded from the report."

So its a first person shooter game. It takes place in different locations like Junk yards and big places like that. So there is a role in the game you have to help your team get info or parts from these places for example the junk yard. But the problem is I don't have a way of making it a challenge. What I mean is how could enemy's or traps be put in a junk yard. Or should I not do a junk yard. Please keep it simple. Don't say open world because its just me. Any help is helpful. Thanks."
3thbda,Alternative Metro 2033 Game,"I recently had the Idea of an Open world multiplayer survival Game in the Metro Universe (I only read the books by Dmitry Glukhovsky, but the other books might suit this idea aswell). The monsters have to be badass as fuck and the feeling while playing should suit the feeling you have while reading the books. You should feel little, small and powerless, so your supposed to travel in groups trough the tunnels and going to the surface requires expensive and rare gear (not just a gasmask and some filters). Also its some kind of Sandbox, so that the players can cooperate to capture whole stations or protect karavans. Further permadeath is a primary feature. I know this is a very specific gameidea and its a lot of work and i dont really think someone is going to realize this. But if your intersted, i would love to one day see a game like this.\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked my idea.\n\nPS: sorry for any mistakes i made im not an english pro"

You have two choices.\na) kill the dragon and save your lover (evil)\nb) lets the dragon and he kills your lover (good)\n\nOkay, it's too blunt but you get the deal, right?\nBy being good, the villains take advantage of you and hurt everyone you knew and loved.\nBy being evil, you saves your friends but you became as evil as the villain.\n\nBeing evil saves the world with less casualty overall but your allies left you.\nBeing good means your allies would be loyal to you but you will have to let many dies to keep your ideals.\n\nAlso if you are too good, the villains take advantage of it,\nresulting in permadeath of allies or higher difficulty.\n\nWell theres the gist.\nHope someone would make it a reality\n\nbtw, I heard about Undertales but I haven't played it yet.

3tdusn,SAO Based MMORPG,[deleted]
3tdigw,a game based off the Hatchet books.,"Basically it would play similarly to Stranded Deep only in a forest. The twist is: you could find your plane's emergency kit, containing food, a rifle, and a radio. Using the radio would trigger a random number generator, with 3 outcomes. One of these outcomes would be another plane, leading to you being rescued and the game continuing by following the story of The River. The other two outcomes would be either the radio breaking or the other side not listening. If either of those outcomes are triggered, then the game continues with the story of Brian's Winter onwards.  The river path would require you to start all over, only you would have to carry an unconscious NPC down a river to a trading Post, after which the game ends, while the Winter path would require you to survive the Winter, ending with you being rescued by Daniel ( the guy who finds Brian in the end of Brian's Winter.) Basically yeah, that's my idea. Any thoughts?"
3tatlj,Centurion's based strategy game where you play Doc Terror (80's tv series),A game where you play as Doc Terror from the moment he starts building his Dominion fortress  and construct hos drone army.\n\nIt starts with you doing burglaries stealing the basic things needed for a droid factory. Then with a few Borgs you start kidnappings and spy missions. All in the pursuit of gear helpful to you or advanced technology. \nThis is then researched at Dominion before being put into the droid assembly line producing ever more efficient drones.\n\nThe game would slowly advance from a single person tactical game during missions to having a vast army and superiority in numbers.\n\nThe goal is to beat the totally overpowered Centurions in battle or destroy their supporting infrastructure by getting enough technology or intelligence to beat them or sabotage them.\n\nBut to get there one would have to climb an escalating stair of threats as an un-cybernetic Doc Terror has trouble with security guards in the beginning of the game !\n\nThe game would be like a mix of UFO enemy unknown and Evil Genius !

3t3o9p,Does this game sound appealing to you? Lost in the Amazon Rainforest,"**TL;DR: Wake up in the jungle, must survive and reach end goal, many aspects like food, water, tribes, boats, animals, medicinal/poisonous plants. How does this sound, any suggestions?**\n\nThis is just an idea, and not even a very complicated plot but basically you wake up in the Amazon Jungle and don't know where you are and try to find civilization/freedom, figure who you because you have amnesia possibly (Haven't decided what you seek exactly yet)\n\nIt's a free roam game, the selling point of the game is ambience, especially sounds like monkees, the buzzing of the jungle, the hiss of snakes, the sound of insects of everywhere. There should be a lot crazy insects, plants and animals, like jaguars and ants that can be very dangerous or beneficial, as you play the game, you learn which are which but there are so many, it will take a long time to learn them all. There is no knowing what can be eaten, except through experience, guessing or tribal knowledge, it is somewhat intuitive though since fruit is generally consumable, but if you see something a lot of animals avoid or lots of thorns on it, you may want to avoid it. You can fish too, but beware piranhas and other nasty river creatures. \n\nThere will be tribes you could possibly encounter, though rare. Depending slightly on how you interact, they can worship you or cannibalize you. This may allow you to gain knowledge and skills and valuable resources, as well as hunting partners etc, just don't screw it up and have them sacrifice you. \n\nThe game will not have health regeneration unless you actually heal yourself, this makes it even more important to have knowledge of which plants are medicinal. There are different ways you can be hurt, maybe if you consume the wrong plant, you start hallucinating or blackout and wake up a day later. There will be other factors for survival like drowning, starving, body temperature, poison, falling damage. Stuff like if you stay in the rain too long, you'll get athletes foot.  \n\nYou can build a canoe/kayak but it won't be easy to do, and can possibly break on rapids. The process can be sped up by knowing a tribe, and good tools and knowledge. Building one will allow you to get to your end goal much faster, but you will still need to stop every now and then for food and water etc. \n\nObviously, this would be an incredible amount of work to create, and I have no idea how to make games, but I want to know if you like the sound of this game and any suggestions, mainly because I have thought about this for a while and sounds like a lot of fun and want to know if others agree.\n\nMy questions are: Should it be multiplayer, how would that work? Any major flaws you see with this game? What should the eventual destination/goal be? Should your character be a lost tourist type of deal (Airplane crash or something) Or should you be a tribal Amazonian person who wakes up in the jungle one day? Should the world randomly generate as you play or should it be pre-made completely?\n\nLet me know what you think, thanks!\n\nAlso, the setting should sound similar-ish to this: http://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/jungleNoiseGenerator.php"

I absolutely love the combat system for project X. It's Awesome, It's flashy, It's...perfect (For me). One more time is about a man/woman fighting to rid of the evil that is invading the land. The main character can make a deep connection with other party members either by talking to each other or fighting as a team. When the main character develops a deep enough connection with another character, he/she can let the other character talk to their deceased loved one for One Last Time. When they finish talking, the soul is turned into a powerful weapon that is unique to the character. It can be a sword/mace/rapier/gun. \n\nSize: Full fledged RPG. I'm talking 7 worlds, each with their own story's, how it came to be the shit hole, or high royalty the place is, how it turned into a robot town, when it became an underwater city, etc.. The game's main story would take around 16 hours to complete, excluding side quests. \n\nStory: The main character lost his/her wife years ago, but he/she still mourns her death. One day, the Main Character's town is attacked and while the character tries to escape, he/she is knocked out. During his/her unconscious, he/she see their wife. The wife then explains what's going on, and to use her soul to protect other. The main character wakes up with a sword in their hands, and the story picks up there.\n\n The story will follow the main character as he/she goes to find a land called Sixo, where the baddies all come from, and put a stop to the main villains rain of terror. As he/she fights his/her way through battle after battle, albeit fighting to protect his/her self or protect others, the main character won't go without a fight. He/she can come across items, but his/her main weapon is a sword. ""Blade of justice and peace"" I like to call it. His/her wife (Female main character is gay, so is the wife depending on the gender you pick.) wanted only one thing, peace and justice brought throughout the land. \n\nMusic: Something similar to [this style](https://open.spotify.com/track/1NuqzCyFahsMXu02TPt4ek)for the overworld. I'm still thinking of a theme for battles.\n\nGraphics: 32bit style, similar to Project X pixel style. \n\nCombat: Similar to Project X combat. Grid- like movement. \n\nCharacters: No two character unless they are related will have the similar traits. They will each have their own traits, and personality. People can have the same interests, like real people.\n\nIf you're interested in making this, PM me. I would love to work with you, story wise. I can come up with every conversation and story, and I'll be more than happy to work with anyone. \n\nI'm working on some concept with a friend, and I can provide it when I finish. \n\nHave a good day."
3szknq,Multiplayer game idea.,"so, this is my first post and i dont know if my title is missing anything.\n\nBut, anyways, this game will be a small, open world set on an island(s?). The goal is basically just to survive. You can craft weapons and make walls out of wood, but there wont be many crafting components.  Maybe like, 20, and ten weapons, so that it isnt too complicated and easy to learn. And it can also have multiplayer,  with just whoever is on at the moment. There will be PvP, and possibly alliances, but is there are you can most definitely steal/kill teammates.  So yeah thats about it.  "

3uiwae,The Political Machine set in a fantasy world...,"I just think it would be cool to have a game like [The Political Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s4vo1iEn7Y), only have it set in *an original fantasy world*.\n\n**The Story**\n\nAfter 800 years of rule, the Kingdom of Grava had finally come to an end. It was called the ""Night of Whispers"", when a brutal military coup ripped through the forces of House Borlaine and laid to waste the royal bloodline of old. From the rubble and ashes of the monarchy, democracy and the republic were born.\n\n100 years have passed since that fateful day. Your grandfather was one of Grava's first elected statesmen. Your father followed in his footsteps, becoming a statesman as well. It only makes sense that you carry on the family legacy and run for political office.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nIn The Political Machine, there is a huge list of ""issues"" your presidential candidate can give speeches on and speak about during interviews. It would be great to change these up and give them more of a fantasy flair.\n\n1. Instead of gay marriage, you'd have human/elf marriages.\n2. Instead of coal mining, you'd have *unobtanium* and it's dangerous uses.\n3. Instead of Russian or Chinese affairs, you'd have foreign affairs regarding neighboring kingdoms.\n4. Instead of saving the bees, you'd have saving the gnomes.\n5. The divide between science and religion would be pretty similar in a fantasy setting.\n6. The list really goes on for a while.\n\nYou would be able to make your own character and design their race, gender and appearance.\n\nBasic gameplay would consist of visiting different ""provinces"" in the kingdom, instead of states within the nation, and campaigning to be elected **Chancellor** of Grava (or whatever you name the land.)"

But the best part would be the story and the large monsters...\n\nStory: God has been angered and a demon falls out of the sky at midnight, he has the look of the Dark Avenger character on Dragon Nest, he destroys a city, as news breaks out they make walls like Attack on Titan, or a flying city like Aincrad from SAO, as the demon gets stronger and devastates the land in pure hell, 100 years later a warrior comes down to the ground to and uses his life to chain up the demon, more demons start falling, but as the first demon is chained, he remains the strongest and learns how to manipulate air into pure energy, quite a while after the game is released, he breaks through the chains the warrior left him in and the players have to kill him, his blood leaks into the ground and the warrior's spirit tells a main character of the game to drink it, cause there must be a demon to teach other demons to know their place (Like the Lich King's ending on WoW: WoTLK), but the main character can't hold the blood because he's pure, and the demon is unholy, so he dies and the mixed souls leak a fog that can kill humans, but demons who absorb it will become more powerful, so the players could have a dungeon to defend that gas from other demons, as the God gets madder for killing his creations, he unleashes a nest that creates Titans, players must go and destroy that nest, then kill God... game over? this was off the top of my head, so dont hate"
3ufvsj,"A simple 2D platform game where you are some sort of creature of fire, and have to avoid the rain.","So I'm not asking or expecting this to be made, it's just a random half-baked concept that I wanted to get out there. I'd imagine it'd be pretty simple: You control some sort of fire being or sun-vampire or something, and you have one goal: don't touch the rain. It pours down from the sky and collides with the first object it hits, which allows for some basic obstacles: Blocks that move above you, forcing you to keep up with them or be extinguished, etc.  \n\nMaybe in some courses, the rain appears and disappears at set intervals, forcing you to seek out the next safe area before it starts again? Or maybe you must avoid storm clouds that actively follow and seek you out? I'd imagine some pretty creative things could be done with it. If you want to go even further with it, have other water-based obstacles like ice that melts if stood on for too long or geysers or droplets dropping from cave ceilings or assholes with water guns. That'd probably transform it to a more generic platformer than something with a single unique gimmick, though.  \n\nAs for details like the setting, I don't know. Maybe a city or urban environment at night? That'd look cool. Going with aesthetics, I'd also imagine it to be pixilated, although that's just off of a random whim. I'm not sure, I just thought this was worth sharing. Would you play it?"
3uecp3,A race for Power,"This game is about players racing to become the boss!\n\nCore\n\nThe winner of the last match would be crowned the boss as every other player races to defeat them. There would be 10 floors and each floor would have a mini-boss the winner plays as(except for the 10th floor which is the final boss)There would be multiple classes, random loot and special events. You would be able to collect gold from enemy's and spend it at the shops located around the dungeon or at the end of the floor. If you died you would either lose levels and gold and be sent to the start of the floor or lose all gold and levels and be sent to the floor of the stage\n\nClasses\n\nMage: Low defence, High spell-power, Low physical power and Low health\nWarrior: Medium defence, Low spell-power,High physical power and Medium health\nSummoner:High defence, High spell power, Low physical power and Low health\nBard:Medium defence, High spell power, Low physical power and low health\nThief: Low defence, Low spell power, High Physical power and low health.\nEct Ect\nThe would also maybe be specializations for other classes\n\nSetting\n\nThe level would be set inside a dungeon. It would have average graphics and a randomly generated dungeon.\n\nGroups\n\nThere would be a Solo mode and a Group mode. In the group mode each player would chose a character and group up going through the dungeon. If that group won they would vote for one person to be the final boss and the rest would be the mini-bosses.\nAll loot and experience would be shared through-out the group evenly.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all i can see this being a fun enjoyable game on the PC or even simplified onto a mobile device!\nIf you have and ideas or criticism I would be happy to hear it! \n"
3udg7v,A game/gamemode about counter strike surf! How has no-one done this yet!?,"So here is how it goes, a game called counter strike introduced a gamemode/map called surf. Surf is only on browse community servers meaning that surf as an idea is not official meaning anyone can used there free time to make a game about it! The rules of surf are that you need to get from the start to finish, to do this you cannont touch the floor but instead you have to glide on a ""surf"" ramp. If the surf ramp is on your left you hold a and the direction of you need to look at to get speed. If it is on your right you need to hold d. I have listed some videos about surf, how to surf, surf gameplay and commands such as gravity and force friction to make it a source game.\n(If anyone makes this game, please can you give my name Jamable at the end credits? :) Thank you! Please be kind. It is my first post! &lt;3 )\n\nHow to surf : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4fX4HVq7A\nSurf gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQdK5eragtg\nSurf CMD's : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjVgbTa-wk0\nI read through the rules and I realized that some people may think that I am breaking rule 7 and 2. I have not made this game and would want someone to do so! And this is not a existing game, this is a existing idea related to counter strike/tf2. Many creators have made maps for surf but have never made a game about surf! Please can you guy let me test some games out and I will give my feedback! Thank you so much for reading &lt;3 Please comment how I did for my first post :D"

3u60qi,Computer Building Simulator.,"There are plenty of simulation games out there now. Some ridiculous and over the top, others pretty interesting. My idea is that there be a game that teaches you the inner workings of a computer. What different parts do, what works and what doesn't, etc.\n\nPerhaps there would be a career mode. At the beginning of each level, you're given specifics on what your customer is looking for in a computer and you're given a limited budget to achieve it. You shop around for computer parts and put together a computer with them. \n\nIt would, in my opinion, be a great learning tool/game."
3u4ad4,zombie survival with good graphics,"good graphics, huge world, on consoles, no shit animations like in h1z1, online multiplayer,\nin the game you will need to gather supplies, build camps or outposts or such, and team up with friends to survive. obviously this is an online multiplayer game, so other players will be threatening to your survival as well.  you can raid enemy settlements, grab their stuff, stealth your way through maybe?\nit should not be impossible to survive on your own. the game idea is made with  long gaming sessions in mind. the online multiplayer thing vs other players is not so important, but you should be able to team up with friends.\nAAA\n\ni have done research and can't really find anything like it. i was thinking something like the Division sorta, when i think about it, but in an open world. the open world should feature both city and nature, as well as small villages."
3u3vo9,Machu Picchu - Virtual Reality.,"Update: I have started work on this project. So far I have hired a concept artist and got a writer to assist me with the game idea.\n\nHey all. I'm looking to create a PC/Console based game for Virtual Reality using the Unreal Engine. I currently own the equipment and just need help with ideas. This game idea is heavily influenced by the DK2 tech demo ""Mythos of the World Axis"". Imagine a table top RPG with miniatures in Virtual Reality. In another example, you are God watching from above, helping out your character from a birds eye view. I want to use elements that I myself have enjoyed during use with my Rift DK2 such as high heights and frightening scenarios. My thoughts for this game are also heavily influenced by the PS2 games ICO, and Shadow of the Colossus. I'm not looking to create something extremely polished, just something enjoyable with simple mechanics such as jumping, climbing, possible puzzles, etc. Would love to hear from you guys! Thanks!\n\nMythos of the World Axis Gameplay Video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzGEmc-d5o\nMythos of the World Axis Game (Oculus Rift DK2 Required)\nhttps://share.oculus.com/app/mythos-of-the-world-axis"
3u3for,Open world Star Wars game,"I think every Star Wars fan has wanted a good Star Wars game since Battlefront, and since the 3rd one lacked a story and all the mechanics that separated battlefront from other FPS, I think it's time for something different. Why not make a Star Wars game similar to Skyrim? Maybe not similar as far as combat mechanics but customization and all of that good stuff. Choose a class, Jedi, Sith, Bounty Hunter, Smuggler etc. choose a race (include multiple races from movies) and then level up and acquire new abilities and weapons and powers and possibly new ships and ways to get around.. I'm pretty sure people would go CRAZY for a game like that, I know I would. Each class could follow a separate story that takes you all over the galaxy and enables you to fight for whatever side you're on."
3u24jf,Henchman quest,"Hello guys, I was reading [Nodwick](http://comic.nodwick.com/) and thought it could make a interesting game.\n\nSo the idea is that instead of controlling a group of adventurers you will control their poor Henchman who have to do all the dirty work : carrying loot, finding quest, etc. The game will be a mix of Simulation and RPG.\n\nI already got some ideas on how to implement the different concepts, feel free to follow them or not :\n\n##Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay can be divided in 3 parts : Towns, Dungeon Crawler and Battles.\n\n* Towns : That is the Simulation part of the game. You can buy/sell items, recruit adventurers, find quest while the adventurers got drunk in the tavern.\n* Dungeon Crawler : Here you have little control. After you chose a quest the group will go into the location and start wander aimlessly but heroically. The game will randomly pick between differents events, right now I can think of 3 : Battle (monster or boss), Traps, free treasure (rare). Depending on the dungeon some events will be more likely than others. Chance of triggering a trap will depend on your group composition.\n* Battle : The battle is mostly automated and turn based but every 2 turn or so the Henchman will get a turn. The Henchman should get limited offensive possibility and generally with a payback (Henchman throw!). Other than that he can use item like health potion on himself or the adventurers.\n\n##Adventurers\n\nI think a good adventurer group size will be 3 so the player has to make decision for which class he gets in his group. Adventurers could also have alignement that will affect how likely they will let the Henchman get hurt. For a start the game could have four classes :\n\n* Warrior : Average area Damage, High Health. Bad at finding traps. Special ability : Monsters will always target the warrior first.\n* Mage : High area damage, low health. Average at finding traps.\n* Rogue : Average single target damage, low health (higher than mage ofc). Good at finding traps.\n* Priest : Low damage, Average Health. Bad at finding traps. Special Ability : Heal others characters during battle and between events.\n\nI think that is a good start. Since there is 3 slots in your party and 4 class the player will have to sacrifice damage or resistance. The biggest problem I see is to balance the game so no class is mandatory (maybe even make it so a group with 2 of the same class can work).\n\n##The Henchman\n\nAdventurers are expandable, your Henchman is not. The henchman will have a few lives (probably based on the difficulty like easy 5, normal 3, hard 1) and will often be the first to take damage from traps (especially with Chaotic Evil adventurers). Do what you can to stay alive and if you have to run away you can always find an other group of adventurers.\n\nThe Henchman will have several stats you choose at the start but can not level up so the player have a reason to try to keep the adventurers alive. Some possible stats : Carry Weight, Negociation, Health, Observation (help knowing exact dungeon stats).\n\n##Game mode\n\nI can see two game mode that will fit : Story and Endless. In Story Mode you got a main quest (random or chosen by the player) to save the world and you have to level up your group in a limited time so they are able to complete it. In Endless quests keep getting harder and you have to try to go as far as you can.\n\n##Possible evolutions\n\nMore class based on classic RPG (druid, bard..). More encounter that require differents classes for better result (could be based on usual rpg stats : Strength, Charisma, Wisdom..). More dungeon diversity with different bestiary that require different strategies. New weapons to go with it, it will be up to the Henchman to get the right one to fight monsters (like water weapons against fire mobs).\n\n##Similar Games\n\nThis is obviously inspired by RPG and Roguelites games. I tried to find game with close concept and I found two : Adventurer Manager (close idea but badly executed according to Steam reviews) and My Life as a King.\n\nThis is my first post here, sorry if this is too long and please give me your opinions/critics. If you like any ideas in here feel free to take it, credits appreciated of course."
3u1vbq,An open world GTA sandbox game that's the film noir and Toonland worlds of Who Framed Roger Rabbit,I was inspired by this [post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3u0sog/2_spooky_4_me/)
3u1myw,"Slippery Slope: The Game! (Potentially NSFW, depending on the work, I guess. Not sure, really.)","My apologies if this isn't the right place for this. Seems like the closest match, but there might not actually be a right place for this. I also don't know if it's been suggested before, because I have no idea what to enter in the search box to check.\n\nThe concept is about as politically correct as Cards Against Humanity...\n\n---\n\nI was on Facebook, reading the comments on an article like a true masochist, and I came across a comment claiming abortion will lead to cultural destruction, because immigrants. No further details were given. And then I got this idea, because sometimes I'm very lonely.\n\nThe core premise of the game is to come up with Insane Troll Logic, as it's described on TvTropes, and from there, so many possibilities.\n\nI immediately thought of this party game I played, back when I got invited to parties. Everyone would write a sentence on a piece of paper, and then pass that paper to the person next to them, who'd have to draw that sentence. Then, that person would fold the paper so as to hide the original sentence, and then pass it to the next person, who'd have to describe the drawing in a sentence, and who would then further fold the paper so as to hide the drawing, etc. \nSo my first idea was a variant of that idea, except that instead of interpreting drawings or illustrating sentences, you'd start with a vaguely controversial premise, and each player would add one level of ridiculous cause-and-effect, with knowledge only of the previous layer. \n\n(Player 1: X. Player 2: If X, then Y. Hides 'X'. Player 3: If Y, then Z. Hides 'Y'. And so on...)\n\n\nAnd then I thought of game variants, because my brain won't leave me alone.\n\nYou could have a variant that's a bastardized version of the Wikipedia game, where two or more players are given an initial premise, a disastrous ultimate consequence, and the winner is either whoever completes it quickest or whoever does it in the fewest layers of ridiculous Slippery Slope arguments as possible.\n\nIn either version, the additional layers have to follow from each other, even if the logic involved is patently false. Purely random statements wouldn't be permitted.\n\n(Permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, children would grow up thinking shirts are invariably optional, which would lead to medical personnel not wearing tops to work, which would lead to more botched surgeries due to surgeon distraction, which would lead to a massive upswing in medical malpractice suits, which means most hospitals would be forced to close, meaning more people will die during childbirth because the nearest hospital is too far away.\nAllowing naked female breasts in PG-13 movies will cause tragic, preventable deaths of newborns.'\n\nNot permissible: 'If one or more female breasts didn't bump up a movie's age restrictions, movies as a medium would cease to exist, which would cause supermarkets to hike up food prices by 3000%, because Batman.'\n\nSo, yeah... No good way to end this post, really... My apologies again if I'm in the wrong place, which is entirely likely, or if I've broken scads of subreddit rules, which I don't think I have, but I could easily be wrong."

3u06a1,[Dream] My Dream MMO,"I am a huge MMO fan. I spend hours upon hours playing, installing, and milling through lists and lists of the best. I've played them all, and partaken in every beta I could get my hands on. As much as I love other games, like Fallout or Skyrim, I will never spend as much time in them as I do MMOs as a whole. (and I've spent 650+ hours in Skyrim) So, lets get down to business. This is my dream MMO, I'll divide this up into parts so it's easier to read.\n\n**Part 1, The Game World**\n\nThe Setting: A fantasy world, full of fairies and dragons, all kinds of things, technology depends on race and where you go, but the highest level is steam powered tech. (More on this later)\n\nThe game would take place on a singular large continent divided into 10 different territories, one for each race, and a singular neutral zone. (I'll get into each race and things like exploration and world combat (pvp) in a minue)\n\nEach territory would feature multiple cities and villages of ranging sizes, whose architecture depends on the culture each race is inspired by. (Again, more on races and there inspirations later) Each territory will also feature unique crafting materials, suck a metals and types of cloth. (More on this in  the gear section, later)\n\nNote: The materials available in neutral territory shops will be based on RNG, and refreshed every week, however stores are more likely to have region specific items the closer they are to a specific territory.\n\n**Part 2, The Races**\n\nIn my dream MMO there are 9 races. Each one inspired by an old mythical creature meshed with a culture. Lets break them down one a time.\n\n**Dwarves:** These guys are short, stout, and tough. Their buildings and cities are very steam punk inspired, and often have mechanical workers wandering about, steam pouring out of them as they follow their work routines.  Dwarves were one a race that was very strong, their ancestors were considered the best warrior, but they have changed to a race of science and mechanical advancement. They are one of two races that can not wield magic, and they make up for with their ability to control, command, and even summon machines. Maximum height it about 3 and a half feet tall.\n\n**Leprechauns:** Only a foot taller then dwarves this races is heavily inspired by hip-hop cultures. Being the second race unable to wield any sort of magic, they have put some much effort into refining their musical craft that they have mastered battle field music techniques. They make great bards and are able to bolster the strengths of any party member, as well as being known as the luckiest race. Leps seem to passively find more gold then any other race.\n\n**Cait Sith:** Short and cat like (Hair and tails) the Cait Sith are the only ""beast"" race, and because of this have a very close relationship with the fauna of the world. It is extremely common for Cait Sith children to wander into forests and eventually find there way home, only now with a new animal companion that becomes family to them. In fact, in many towns across the Cait Sith territory this is a sort of ""right of passage"" for many young Cait Siths. While not exception at magic, they are able to practice most basic forms of it.\n\n**Gnomes:** Gnomes tend to be slightly shorter then Dwarves, and are much thinner. They are extremely agile and love to play tricks on the other races, but nothing to dangerous. This has led to Gnomes becoming masters of illusion magic, able to create just about any vision, smell, taste, or feeling. Some often even build shops in the the towns of other territories, selling their magic so other can live out their wildest fantasies. \n\n**Sprites:** Being the last of the smaller races this ones are often mistaken for small children, despite having the wisdom of a thousand years. Despite also being the longest to live a natural life, sprite also mature extremely quickly, in only 3 years, though they live care free their entire life. They are the only race the practice flying magic, an extremely difficult form of magic that would take any non sprite a life time to master.\n\n**Spriggans:** Tall and slender, there skin is made of leafes and bark, their hair of flowers, and their bone of hard wood. Spriggans live hand in hand with the flora of the world, and it is often the case for weary travelers to wander into a bunch of trees, not realizing that those trees make of the largest spriggan towns and villages. With the unique ability to call on the assistance of the local plant life in any given area, spriggans tend to hate large stone cities, as it makes them feel disconnected from the world. They are also the must stir crazy, and nomadic of the races, very rarely ever taking a singular home. Boredom is the only real enemy to spriggans, as most simple wish to see the world. Spriggans are also grown from seeds, not born.\n\n**Salamanders:** The children of the immortal dragons. Long ago, when dragons reigned supreme, they would often find themselves wishing for children, despite not being able to physically reproduce. Dragons are forged by the gods, and guardians of the world, but upon seeing the happiness that children would give their parents it became a dream of the dragons to give birth to new flesh. After some years of this one dragon discovered a special stone, some say this stone was a gift from the gods to the dragons, and when a dragon breathes its fire into one of these stones, a salamander is born of flesh, and the stone take it's place as that salamanders flesh. They are the tallest, and strongest of the races, adept at war and battle. Their hair is also a bright color, that of flame, and gives off a gentle heat, they are also naturally adept at extremely powerful flame magic. However, a single salamanders flame is not powerful enough to create a new salamander, but when two combine their power, their flame, they are able to fill the Salamanders Stone with enough fire to create their own child.\n\n**Sylphs:** The species with the most average height, from 5 to 6 feet. They are not psychically powerful, but are well versed in all forms of magic, and naturally tuned towards the healing magics of water and wind. Sylphs are the most peaceful of the races, always searching for a diplomatic option to any conflict. With slender bodies and blue and green flowing hair, they are often called the most beautiful of all the races. \n\n**Dullahans:** Often called the most greedy of all the races, Dullahans are expert treasure hunters. If they ever hear of lost treasure or rare armor and weapons they often become obsessed with find it, Dullahans on the hunt are often stated as ""Acting as if they've lost their head."" Being able to wield all kinds of magic makes them also very versatile, a jack of all trades if you will, and able to handle any situation. Dullahans and their greed also have a natural love of Leprechauns, the luckiest of all the races. They are also the only two races able to procreate together, despite being completely different. It's often speculated that they have a common ancestor due to this.\n\n**Part 3, Stats and Character Creation**\n\nNote: Each account gets only 1 character. This is a design choice to simulate being a single person in a vast world.\n\nEach player character (PC) would start out as a blank slate. No name, race, and low, base stats. The player would choose there name, gender, and race first. After race selection the players stats would then be set to that races base stats, for instance if they started with a salamander, they would have high strength, or high agility if Cait Sith. (After this they would be given a set amount of stat points to make their PC a little more personal, and be implored to consider the kind of life they have lead, and the kind of life they would like to lead.) Then the game would ask several questions with general answers like age, darkness of skin tone, long or short hair, ect. and randomly generate 3 PC avatars for the player to choose from. THIS IS A DESIGN CHOICE. I want to, in a way, emulate being born. We do not choose our natural appearance, we simply learn to work with what we are given. After they finalize their character creation they are sent to the starting town for their race, based in the middle of their territory. \n\nNow, there are 2 ways to increase your stats. Leveling your character, and leveling your skills. Lets start with character leveling.\n\nFor killing monsters and completing quest the player will receive EXP to increase their level, and when a player levels up their HP and MP increase by an amount based on their current endurance and intelligence, respectively. That is all that happens when a player levels up. No other stat increases outside of HP and MP.\n\nNow, when a player levels a skill up, one handed or two handed swords for instance, they both unlock new skills, and increase their stats. For instance: Leveling 1 handed swords may have a 3 DEX increase and 2 STR increase per skill level, while 2 handed swords may give 3 STR, 1 DEX and 1 END. I'm just spit balling on this amounts however, to give a general idea of the system. \n\nThis game will absolutely be exploration based, and because of this I want even low level player to be able to explore the whole world and take on the mobs of the world as long as they have the skill to avoid attacks, strike, and counter attack. This game will play very heavily off player skill, however dungeons will require the player to reach certain levels and skill levels to partake in, as they are meant to be more difficult. \n\n**Part 4, Skills** \n\nEach PC starts with 3 skills slots. They can select from a large list of skills which skills they wish to ""lock in."" For instance, a starting player should probably choose a single weapon skill, armor skill, and crafting skill to get the most out of the early game, but this decision is left up to the player. As the players PC level increase, they will unlock more skill slots up to a maximum of 20.\n\nA skill can only be increased and leveled while it is equipped to a skill slot, and skills can always be swapped out, however swapping a skill out sets that skill back to 0, but does NOT decrease that skills Memory. ""What is skill memory?"" you ask. Let me tell you.\n\nSkill memory is basically the maximum level you have reached in a specific skill. This is used primarily to unlock new gear skills. Lets use an example from here on.\n\nSay you just started out, your level 1, and want to use Katanas. Katanas require a skill memory of 25 Curved Sword and 25 Two-Handed Swords to unlock, but you only have the 3 level 1 skill slots, and you've already picked our your armor and another skill. (Two-Handed Swords also requires a level 10 One-Handed Sword skill.) So, you decided to play start with one-handed swords, you level it to 10, then swap that skill to two-handed swords. Your one-handed sword skill goes to 0, but your one-handed sword memory stays at 10. You play with two-handed sword until you reach 25 skill level, you then swap to curved swords. Your two-handed skill drops to 0, but your memory stays at 25. You repeat the process until you unlock Katanas, and swap to those.\n\nNote: You CAN have more then a single weapon skill equipped at a time, in fact by the time you unlock all 20 skill slots you'll most likely be a master in several different weapons and types of crafting. There are 2 things to note about swapping skills out.\n\n1. Say you got one-handed swords to 10, and were about to swap out it two-handed swords. Using the numbers from an earlier part, you would have accrued a 30 point bonus to dexterity, and a 20 point bonus to strength. The moment you swap out your skill and it become 0 (With a memory of 10) you LOSE all of those skill bonuses. This is intended to make end-game character LESS powerful.\n\n\n2. Some skills are not forgotten upon swapping out a skill slot. Say you have unlocked 3 new skills, or abilities. (You know, the things that go on your action bar in other gamer) Naturally, once you would forget them and they would be unusable for weapons they are not intended for. This is not always the case. One of those three skills may have the key word ""Memory Lock"" followed by the name of another skill, in this case ""Two-Handed Swords."" Basically, that means that if you choose to take up two-handed swords, even if you have forgotten the one-handed sword skill, you will be able to use that one-handed sword ability with a two-handed sword equipped. \n\nNote: I did this because of the secret world online. in the end, statistically, every character basically become the same person, just with different gear and appearances, because part of that games end-game was maxing out every skill. I want your end-game PC to feel unique, like someone you've really built into a special individual in there own way, so even thought you make focus on a single weapon, armor, and craft, you choose other to bolster and manipulate your stats to make your character who YOU want to be.\n\nNote 1: Basically this means that even if two players focus on say, spears, they won't both have the same ability set. Their abilities would be dependent on the other skills they've learned to get where they are now.\n\nNote 2: You can equip a weapon even if you don't have it's skill equipped, however you won't be able to increase it's skill or unlock it's abilities until you the skill.\n\n**Part 5, Gear and Exploration**\n\nThe gear system is intended to promote exploration and player involvement in both the world economy, and other players.\n\nFirstly, there are many materials throughout the world. Each material will give certain stat bonuses to the gear they are made into, and to find the material you want to use for your gear, you'll have to travel to where that material is found and either collect it or buy it yourself. This next part gets a little complicated so I'm going to use a single example all the way through.\n\nSay you are a one-handed sword user, and are trying to find a good, end game blade to use. You decide to first start out looking at NPC shop equipment. \n\nThe NPC is selling a single ""Steel One-Handed Blade +0"" It has 50 base damage, and has +3 STR because it is made from iron. This is the most basic sword you can find. \n\nNote: No weapon will ever have stat, skill, or level requirements. On top of this, ALL One-Handed swords at +0 will have 50 base damage. This is to make all gear less level, and more material based.\n\nThe kind of weapon the NPC is selling is called a Standard weapon. There is nothing special about it, it is very run of the mill. Lets compare it to *Magic* and *Forged* versions of the same weapon.\n\nNote: *Standard* is a term used for weapons and armor sold by NPC. They are nothing special.\n\n*Forged:* ""Forged Iron One-Handed Sword +0"" Base Damage: 50 Stat Bonuses: +5 STR. This is the primary difference between a standard weapon and a forged weapon: Stat bonuses. Forged weapons will typically have stronger stat bonuses even if they were forged from the same material.\n\n*Magic:* ""Evasive Iron One-Handed Sword +0"" Base damage: 50 Stat Bonuses: +2 STR Special: +15% Evasion Chance"" Magic gear will always have the weakest stat increase, but will make up with it with powerful Specials. Magic weapons can not be created by any means, and can only be found while adventuring and exploring. \n\nNote 1: I wanted magic weapons to be a sort of ""story starter"" for many players. So many old legends begin with a hero finding or being given a legendary magical blade or spear, I wanted to emulate the feeling.\n\nNote 2: ALL WEAPONS (beside Standard for obvious reasons) are considered end-game weapons. Every single one handed sword will always have 50 base damage, and every single weapon will be able to be increased from +0 to +100 by master blacksmiths. Increasing a forged weapons level will increase it's stat bonuses even further. Increasing a magic weapons level will increase its stat bonuses slightly, and will gradually increase the effectiveness of it's Specials. (Whether they be abilities or passives)\n\nNote 3: All weapons can be renamed, however the +x suffix can not be removed.\n\nNote 4: The same system extends to call other gear, namely armor, and magic weapons effects are generally RNG based, as they are found in randomly generated treasure chests found in secret locations or at the end of dungeons. \n\n""But how does this make players explore more? Or even interact with others?""\n\nWell, it's simple really. MMOs today are so number based, so min-maxy. And that's OK, that's how I like to play my games as well, and most others will begin this game with that exact mindset. They'll find out which lands they need to travel to to get the gear they want to build there character they want. Along the way they'll encounter many unique and fun quests, maybe find rare loot, and do many other things, which will hopefully make them want to explore even more! That's the dream, at least.\n\nOnce they get there the player can either mine and collect their own materials, or much more quickly simply buy it from another player. This tends to stimulate the games economy. However, once they have the materials where do they go? Well, they can go to a NPC smithy to forge the gear, but NPC smiths will only increase it to +10. Out of 100. Player black smiths are required to get the most out of your weapons, and interacting with them will be a major part of the game. \n\nAny player will eventually be able to open up a stall or store, but it's very expensive to buy the space, so it's more likely then not that only guilds will partake in this. The owner will then be able to set up and NPC there that has the same black smithing skill level as the player that owns the shop, so they don't need to always be there for forge for players. The smith, and by extension the guild, can however both change the prices of leveling gear, and the prices of any items they choose to put on display. \n\nNote: There are 2 ways to open any shop. Either solo or by guild. Solo players reap all the benefits of owning a shop, while guilds will use the skill level level of the highest black smith (Or any other crafter they choose to use the shop to represent, each additional NPC to represent a crafting type costing more and more coin) in the guild.\n\n**Final Part, Part 6, Open World Pvp**\n\nDespite the relative peace across the land, border skirmishes and bandit raids are fairly common. Because of this there are 2 paths for PvP.\n\n1. The criminal. At any point you can toggle open killing, allowing you to target and murder other players. Doing so will mark you as a criminal in the country that you do so in. Killing a player will also grant you an amount of gold based on how much they were carrying, however they will not actually lose anything. This is both to promote criminal RPing, without being a huge detriment to those players who simply want to explore. If a player that is marked as a criminal has his or her health reduced to half or less by a city or patrolling guard (Guards being absurdly powerful to make this an actual challenge to the player) That player will loose a huge percentage of their gold, and be placed into an in game jail for an amount of real world time based on how many players they killed. (During this time the player can just log out.)\n\n\n2. Faction based PvP. In each territories capital there will be a ""Guard Recruitment"" NPC. Talking to this NPC and registering with him will give you the abilty to toggle on and off ""Guard Duties."" While on you will be able to both fight and capture criminal killers, like those listed above, and attack other territories. This is intended to emulate border skirmishes, if a part of Spriggan guards decides to invade and attack Sylph territory, the second they kill a player or guard all Sylph Guard players in near by cities will be alerted to their arrival and the face that they are attacking. it will then be up to Sylph players to drive the Spriggans out of their territory, or put them into Jail.\n\nNote: There is no fast travel system in place. You can not avoid PvP by ""warping.""\n---\n\nWell, that's it. That's my dream MMO. I took inspiration from lots of games, and even some animes, while also adding in my own ideas. I hope you enjoy reading it as much I enjoyed writing it. \n\nP.S. I apologize for any continuity or grammatical errors. I'm a little tired, haha."

3turbf,The Madhouse.,"So allow me to set the scene. The year is 2022 and a new, non-harmful hallucinogenic drug called ""Blossom"" has hit the entertainment scene. The drug is completely legal, having been created by a government organisation themselves for recreational purposes or for entertainment purposes. \n\nThe drug is simple, you take a small dosage of the gas (the drug is in gas form), then you can tell yourself what you want to see, it can be old relatives, crazy inventions, monsters and more! Whatever your mind can think of, you can see. \n\nYou play as Thomas Kingston/Amy Grey and you live in a small, rural area of America, a lot of open fields and countryside. A circus is coming through town and your sister wants you to take her, she is 9. You take her to the circus and it is amazing, nearing the end of the night, you come across ""The madhouse"", a horror experience that utilizes the drug for a horror experience through a house maze. With your sister occupied on a merry-go-round, you decide to try it out. You inhale a small dosage of Blossom and enter the house. Things are flying of the wall and you can see people being murdered, but it is all a part of the hallucinogen and not real...right? \n\nI'll leave the story at that, don't want to spoil too much, it's an idea i've wanted to script for a long time and make into a game, but I have no team to make the game whilst I create the script/story for it!\n\nSo this would be a physiological horror/thriller that deceives the player and makes them wonder if what they are seeing is actually happening or not.

3trxsf,Player-controlled bosses...,"I'm not sure if this idea has been proposed here before, but if it has then I apologize. I wasn't able to find anything exactly like it in my searches.\n\nHere's the basic concept: **every enemy in the game would be controlled by the AI, but every boss would be controlled by another player.** This greatly increases the difficulty, obviously. It would be as significant a difference as PvE is to PvP in MMORPGs.\n\nNow, this would make the game require an internet connection (which is annoying as hell,) but maybe it would only be required on certain difficulties. For example, on the difficulties **Easy**, **Normal** and **Hard**, it could be a single-player game. All bosses would be AI and easier to predict. On **NIGHTMARE** difficulty, however, internet is required and every boss is controlled by another player. Players would be randomly chosen to play as bosses, so no cheating could be had.\n\n*Questions, comments, criticisms?*"

3ye4ea,Smugglers-Mount and Blade in Space,"Smugglers\n\n----\n\nSo I've had this game in mind for a while now but seeing the new Star Wars film made me want to make it even more. It's a pipe dream really, it's a game that would cost millions to make by a AAA studio. But hey here's the run down of what it would be.\n\nThe game is called Smugglers but it's not just about Smuggling. It's about being a Space Pirate, A space bounty hunter or a space general. Whatever. \n\nThe game starts with creating a character. You have several species to chose from and can customise your character to your hearts content. I imagine a lot of the game to work like Mount and Blade. So you come up with a background get some stats and such and then you can get your ship. You can make a few changes but the main ship modifying would take place in game by buying upgrades and installing them.\n\nSo you have a basic ship and a basic character. What do you do now? Well, whatever you like. You can be a smuggler and deliver narcotics/weapons and stuff into places where it's illegal to do so. You can be a bounty hunter and bring in people who are wanted. You can be a pirate and raid passing ships, a slaver and sell people around, a trader and make a quick buck, a mercenary and hire yourself to whoever needs a bit of muscle. Or you could pledge allegiance to one of the galaxies factions and fight with them for a bit. Either way you're not going to get very far without a crew.\n\nLike in mount and blade, you can get a crew to join you. You're crew will help keep your ship in top condition. You can assign crew members positions dependent on their skills and take them out on missions with you. \n\nAs you play your character will get older and older and will maybe fall in love. If you fall in love you could get the chance to procreate and well, we all know where that leads. This offspring could be perfect for you to pass your ship and your crew along to when you die. Go to your ship and designate who gets the ship when you die. If you want a son/daughter to take it they must be a part of your crew. If you die without passing on the ship it's Game Over. \n\nSome various points:\n\n-Crews would be 4-5 people strong. \n\n-Ships would be Millenium Falcon/Serenity size.\n\n-Setting is less important. All it needs to have is a variety of planets, species to play and interact with and factions to join/fight.\n\n-It would be highly moddable. \n\n-Space Combat? Sure why not.\n\n\nAgain, it's a crazy idea but I thought I'd get it out onto paper. Essentially, it's Mount and Blade in Space.\n"

3yd9nw,A haunted house turn based game. Could use some help!,"So this is probably gonna sound like a bunch of garbled nonsense mostly because the idea is still cooking in my head, but id love to explain what I have so far! I think actually talking about it and getting feedback would be a good way to get the idea to solidify. anyway ive been teaching myself gamemaker studio the past year and after a ton of tutorials and little projects I think its time to do something a little bigger (with possibly multiple people). ive had this idea for a game in the back of my head of a sort of haunted house in where you and a couple other players need to explore, discover, and eliminate a type of ""haunt"" like witches, zombies, cultists, or ghosts. There would be hints and events that you would find about the house that will be clues as to which one it is. I imagine the start of the game the rooms would be randomized similar to The Binding of Issac and with each room a different sort of event or clue is found. The game is set up as a turn based kinda chess game with the whole house set up as like a grid so players could move a certain amount of spaces each turn. maybe there could be different characters that start with different items that could give them uniqe resistances to this or have special effects. I imagine the game looking [like Home](http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1118525/news-home.jpg) or [Uncanny Vally.](http://i0.wp.com/darkzero.co.uk/asset/2015/05/uv-4.jpg?resize=600%2C337) anyway any critiques or ideas for it would be awesome! Tell me what you would want to see from this game! also Im not sure where else to ask this but if anyone could actualy help with scripting or ANYTHING with this game for that matter please feel free to message me!"
3ycupv,Tower Defense ++,"I'm ready to play the next evolution of Tower Defense games. I'm tired of waiting for it.  \n\n""Capture the Flag"" has got to be the most fun concept in gaming that exists.\n\nThere needs to be a TURN BASED or REAL TIME ""Tower Defense PvP"" game. \n\nI'm not defining the exact rules below, but only proposing a few different concepts/ideas that I've always liked that I've never seen fully combined into a game before.\n\n---\n\nThe goal is, the point of game = Build towers, capture the flag = earn points.\nUse points for upgrades = Points can be used on your player account to upgrade tower's/monsters properties/abilities. \nPoints last for the lifetime of your player account.\n\n--- \n\nMost games have tried ""Towers VS Monsters"". \n\nWhy isn't there a Towers VS Towers with the OPTION to create monsters based on which Towers I have created that are capable of creating monsters?\n\nMonsters = ability to ""move""\n\nTowers = stationary\n\n---\n\nVarious Towers have various capabilities: create monsters, damage other monsters, damage other towers, damage anything, short range, long range, slow monsters, shield ally towers from other enemy towers damage by X% reduction, heal ally monsters within range, etc. Tons of possibilities.\n\n---\n\nSTRATEGY:\nThere should be multiple/varying terrain levels. Higher terrain placed Towers have more damage output and longer range against lower terrain targets. Towers benefit from higher terrain vs lower terrain targets. \n\n----\n\nMonsters moving from higher to lower terrain = less of a ""moves"" cost.  Moving from lower to higher terrain = more of a ""moves"" cost (penalty).\n\n---\n\nMOST games in this genre = only 1 play format = build towers, press play, watch monsters die, build more towers as you have more points to do so.\n\nBut why do the monsters have to always be AI? \n\nWhy can't we build towers that fight other player's towers?\n\nWhy can't we have equal sized territories and start playing at the same time?\n\nWhy can't we have strategy based tower defense instead of ""whoever has the biggest army/tower always wins""? Strategy = based off of ""Capture the Flag mechanics""\n- Example = make each tower have a priority of ""target Towers first"" or ""target Monsters"" first\n- Example = make each monster tower have a priority of telling its monsters ""target Towers first"", ""target Monsters first"", or ""target Capture the Flag first""\n-- Some towers could have ""boost the speed of ally Flag carriers by 200%"" and ""slow enemies by 10%"" \n\n-- First to 5 flag captures = wins!\n\n-- If you build your towers close enough to the enemy's ""base square"", then killing that base square = immediately complete domination/victory.  Example = Chess. They can't move their King. If you can build towers close enough to target/attack their King and deplete their King's HP to zero, then you win outright instead of ""best 3 out of 5 flag captures"" for example.\n\n--- Example: Perhaps every time your team captures a flag, the other teams towers/monsters Health is healed by 50% of their maximum as a way to provide challenging game play.\n\n\nThink: Civilization meets Tower Defense meets Starcraft/Warcraft. \n\n---\n\nIf something like this already exists, PLEASE tell me about it. Otherwise, how can we make this happen? :)\n"
3ycc0j,Medieval Justice,"I'd love a game where **you play a judge in a large medieval city**, like London in 1400s or 1500s. It isn't your job to find who is actually innocent or guilty. Your only job is to hear each side of the story for every trial and make your decision for your own reasons. You can be benevolent and just if you want, looking over all th evidence and studying the arguments to the best of your abilities. You can also be a reckless opportunist focused only on personal gain.\n\nThe best part of the game: **you also choose the severity of punishment for each criminal that has been proven guilty.** Everything from fines, to imprisonment, to torture, to death. Dozens of different ways to sentence thieves, rapists and murderers.\n\nAnother aspect of the game will be your wealth, family and social status. As your career goes on, you accumulate wealth (sometimes from bribes). You can marry and have children. You can befriend aristocrats and royal family members. Your social standing also improves the older and more famous you get. **These all contribute to your end game score.**\n\nI think this would be an incredibly addictive game. It would also be oddly therapeutic for those of us who enjoy playing evil/corrupt characters in games.\n\n*Anyone else think this would be fun?*"
3yc7a1,3d platformer based on very High Speed and Momentum,"Hello, I have a fairly ambiguous suggestion.  I'd enjoy a good 3d platforming game like Super Mario 64, but with an extremely fast protagonist and accurate conservation of momentum.  I would probably give the character control over their trajectory in the air as well.  I would try to avoid ""rollercoasters"" like in the sonic adventure games, and instead use the speed to compliment your level design.  For instance, using a fast moving platform to add speed to your own and leap cross a massive gap sounds pretty fun. "
3yc31c,15 Dogs,"I was recently reading a book called ""15 Dogs"", it gave me this idea.\nIt's basically just a survival game, with turn based strategy elements.\nSo you are the leader of a pack of dogs, there are 15 dogs in this pack including you and you must prove that dogs, granted they posses human intellect, can survive on their own and without masters (humans). You can customize your dog's breed, strengths and weaknesses, but the rest of the pack is randomly selected (in terms of breed, strengths and size). So you must survive for as long as you can, overcoming things like the weather, starvation and attacks from other dogs or humans.\nThe game would be set somewhere in the city. The combat system would be much like XCOM or Wasteland.\n\nTell me what y'all think and if you guys want to help me get this game started, then we can arrange that."

3ybnzs,Wanted - Ideas for a large-scale space game,"So, I've been fooling around and I've got the rough outline of a ProcGen galaxy generator.

Compared to the Milky Way, that means that each sector would be 100 light years across.\n\nThe problem is - I'm not entirely sure what to do with it. ProcGen games are a particular favourite of mine.

3y3iip,[IDEA] A remake of GTA 2,"Maintain the general top-down view with improved 3D graphics with textures inspired by the original. The exception would be cutscenes, which would be full 3D.\n\nAnywhere City should remain the setting of the game. You should be able to drive from one district to another, as opposed to the original game, where each district was essentially a separate island, and it should be made clear when a player travels from one district to another. The districts are not to be separated by rivers; that's too cliche for the series, but rivers can still be in the city. True to the original, there should be no real countryside (not counting Disgracelands).\n\nThe entire city should be free to roam from the start of the game (no 'terrorists' blocking off districts). Most gangs should only offer missions within their district, with the occasional mission having elements which take place outside it. The Zaibatsu, as a gang present in all three districts, would not be bound by this restriction.\n\nOther ideas I have for the remake include:\n\n* Gang turf. All gang territory, with the exception of each gang's own compact, central stronghold, would be able to be captured for another gang of the player's choice.\n\n* An overhauled combat and movement system. Combat in the original GTA 2 perhaps isn't the most engaging gameplay experience; you simply rotate then hold a button, before the computer-controlled foe can do the same. In the remake, I would suggest having rotation controlled by the mouse, and movement being controlled by WASD. This would allow for strafing. The player would also freely aim with the mouse, lock onto enemies with the right mouse button, and left click to shoot. \n\n* More advanced weapons would also give players the option to enable 'bullet time' sequences, where the game would switch to first-person perspective, and time and player controls would slow down, allowing for more intricate combat.\n\n* Flight, both helicopters and planes.\n\n* Skills, including Shooting, Driving, Stealth, Flying, and Stamina.\n\n* Bring back taxi, ambulance, and police missions, ditched in GTA 5. Shit was fun as hell in SA.\n\nThis is all probably beyond what any developer here is interested in, but damn, GTA 2 needs a true spiritual successor. Chinatown Wars was good and all...but not really the same kind of thing. Somebody needs to do something."

3y02ir,[Star wars] Rise of the Confederacy,"The rise of the Confederacy takes place during the clone wars, and is an alternate-non canon star wars story. The Separatist leader Viceroy Gunray has aquired a solar core, Which is worth bilions, if not more on the galactic market. With this, he created the ultimate Assasin Droid. B1-F666. \n\n**Key Features:** \n\n* Serve as General grevious' personal assassin during the clone wars, and destroy the republic on both the front lines, and behind the lines.\n\n* Visit the most iconic places in Star wars, Coruscant, Mygeeto, Yavin 4, Tatooine and more.\n\n* Lead armies into battle with a planetary conquest feature. Giving you the ability to invade and conquer planets for the CIS.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n* B1-F666 Also called the B devil, is the most advanced and deadly droid in the known galaxy. You're equiped for any situation. Wherever it be taking out a jedi, Sabotaging the enemy behidn their lines, or sneaking in with the crowd.\n \n* Transformation system. Isolate a target, kill and use their DNA to change your appearance, making you look like just them. This is good for getting by Unnoticed, do note, that the regular citizen does not have access to all areas, for that you need to find other people who have permission to enter, or have a meeting there.\n\n* Hack into the Holo-net and spread CIS propaganda and cause Uprisings in cities. \n \n* Diplomacy. Convince other civilizations to Aid the Separatist cause against the republic. Be it Agressive Negotiations or Friendly Discussion.\n\n**Story:**\n\n* You're created with one and only purpose. To destroy the republic. You'll be sent out to hunt down the most famous of Jedi, Mace Winduu, Obiwan, Anakin Skywalker and others.\n* Discover what slug Palpatine really is. Uncover the ancient mystery of the Sith lore and betray Sidious. The republic will be shattered without it's grand chancellor.\n* Victory - Defeat Conditions. \n\n**FAQ**\n\n**What kind of droid is The B devil?** \n\nThink of it was a combination between every Droid ever made, with all their tools combined. So good programming, it can out calculate jedi in a lightsaber fight.\n\n**How big are the planets?** \n\nThe main planets, such as Coruscant, Nabboo, Geonosis, Tatooine, Mygeeto, and some others will be huge. Skyrim Size huge, with same ammount of things to do. The quests are exiting and unqiue, instead of your classical ""Kill Rams for ram meat."" The minor planets such as Neimodia, which is mostly for invasion and diplomatic purposes, will be ""Much"" smaller, but it will still be Unique.\n\n**Is this story canon?**\n\nOf course not. Just portraying what it would be to fight along side the confederacy of independent systems for once. They practically would have one the clone wars anyway, if not for sidious.\n\n**Will there be conversations, housing, romance prehaps?**\n\nDroids are not capable of love. There will be housing in form of Hideouts, and I image there will be Bioware style Conversations.\n\n\nSorry, I just want to be a wannabe developer\n"

3xy3ag,A 2D Flood Survival Game,"A game where you can build forts or bases out of different types of blocks, and there is a timer, when the timer runs out, a flood comes, not a flood as in enemies, but a real flood. Depending on what blocks you use will determine how much damage it can take. The flood comes in faster and stronger each round, if you were to build a small tower with two supports (beams that support the tower) and the flood was too strong, it could break those supports and collapse the tower. You can of course walk around freely around the base and basically do nothing if you wanted to, but let's say a tower falls on you, you die. If you fall into a flooded area you can swim around, you have a breath meter, if it goes out, you start taking damage. Just an idea I had for a game. I think it would be a new kind of idea."

3xx2qc,Basing a game of evil toys or is that to much like FNAF ideas?,Okay so I’m in the early stages off my game. My game is a horror type game with a different type of survival element. Every thing is good so far. But now I ran into a problem. The problem is my game is base off evil toys that try to kill you. The toys would range from dolls to anything that has a figure of something that is alive like for example a toy dog. So my question is would you play the game or is it to much like Five nights at Freddy’s. I’m only asking because I don’t want to finish the game to just get hate from FNAF lovers. Like the other day I saw a game similar to FNAF getting flagged on green light. I don't what all that stress. Any feedback is great.
3xw2va,3d Fantasy Survival / Village Builder,"Combination of First Person / 3rd Person perspective\n\nSo you get a big open fantasy world in the likes of Skyrim but with more varied climates. The goal of the game is to survive off the land, find a suitable location to start a small village, build an initial shelter, collect food and survive the first night.\n\nAs your foundation becomes more solid and you establish a steady source of food (farming, hunting etc), and a good source of water, the game AI sends more people to build nearby. \n\nYou become the ""chief"" of that village and start to make decisions regarding trade based on local resources. For instance you might established a town in the mountains and have precious metal mines at your disposal. As a result blacksmithing becomes a major industry in your town. Of you might set up shop in the forest resulting in a lot of lumbar/fletching, or perhaps you have a bustling underground city that can trade precious gems and ore. \n\nAs time goes on you raise a millitia to protect yourself from invasions from trolls / goblins / dragons / enemy towns. \n\nIn first person mode you would be able to hunt/log/fletch/blacksmith/gemcraft/farm etc to help with the survival of your town or even lead troops into battle. There would be missions/objectives for any of the routes you would choose to play. "
3xv7qg,A quirky slice-of-life adventure game inspired by D4 and Animal Crossing,"An adventure game for people who like character-driven narratives and collecting clothes.\n\nWhat kind of stories? Just slice-of-life experiences and interesting mumblecore dialogue with quirky characters. Like the dinner scenes in D4 or an episode of Monogatari. Those things prove that characters and dialogue alone can be compelling enough to have an audience, especially when the latter is an on-going series.\n\nWhen you boot it up, you'll find different foods, goodies, and events throughout different days. You'll have various stories to follow, and the collectibles you get include new clothes to wear, souviners/mementos of your adventures, music to play in your home, etc.\n\nMaybe it takes place at just your apartment or a little area, but it's always changing because characters come and go with different things to say or do. Even the shopkeeper will have new items in stock, including one free item each day.\n\nIt's not a big project, since you can recycle the hub and characters for different things."
3xt9wv,World Peace (Game Idea - Feedback welcomed),"As I was watching Plague Inc. gameplay videos, I came up with an idea for a video game. Let me know what you think.\n\nQuick overview of the game:\n\n* Real time strategy game\n\n* Simulative / 2D type of game (like Plague Inc.)\n\n* Map is a simulation of the Earth's continents (again, similar to Plague Inc.)\n\nThe base idea is that you are a 'god' and you basically control this earth. The main thing you can do as the creator of this world is create new settlements which will populate your earth. Settlements start off small, but you get to control how well the settlement will prosper. Powerful settlements will eventually grow into empires and continue to populate the world.\n\n\nEventually, kingdoms will begin to declare war on each other for various reasons - jealousy, wanting more land, or simply just other small complications that lead to massive war.\n\n\nAs the creator of this world, it is up to you to ensure that all of your kingdoms are allied with each other. You can do this by balancing out the needs of the kingdoms. Some kingdoms may want to prosper, while some may want to see other kingdoms fall into decline. Whatever it takes, it's up to you to deliver peace to all of the kingdoms that you create.\n\n\nEDIT: Kingdoms will destroy each other if war carries on for too long. If you lose too many kingdoms to war, the world will see no hope of world peace."

3s6vta,[Intermediate/Experienced] An Open World Medieval combat game.,"I know what you're thinking. This idea is too big, too generic, to overdone. Well it's not that.\n\nThe point of the game would be to start from nothing but a lowly soldier and to work your way up to a knight, a king's guard, the general, etc. There would be multiple kingdoms each with unique cultures. There would be cosmetic customization like hairstyles and physique, but nothing crazy. \n\nNow here's the catch: No HUD, no hit points, no leveling, no perks, no special abilities. Your physical build affects your speed and strength, but as for skill, that is solely based on how well you can fight. \n\nThe combat would be completely real-time. No clicking the ""basic attack"" button. You would click LMB to swing, RMB to block, and so on. Holding certain keys could alter the direction of your swing. If anyone has played Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, it would be combat very similar to that. \n\nThe game could totally be swung into a more fantasy type game, or a more gritty, realistic medieval game. It's really up to whoever would want to make it. \n\nThe most important part is the combat. Real-time, no bullshit perks or special advantages over anyone else. It's just you and your blade/mace/hammer/axe/bow, and how well you can personally use it. \n\n1st or 3rd person, doesn't matter. Hell, have an option for both. \n\nIf it ever took off, things like diplomacy and battle strategy could be ran by the players as opposed to AI. \n\nThat's about it. Thanks for reading. "

3s5nst,In-game Radio,"Idea:\n   My idea is very simple, adding a radio to a game. I doesn't really matter to much what type of game but certain games would benefit more from a radio than others. For example, a radio wouldn't really work in a game like Super Mario bros. but in some games where the game consists mostly of exploring like maybe Minecraft a radio could add to the idea that you are in a vast world filled with life. \n\n   A very good example of the radio idea is the Ratchet and Clank game ""A Crack in Time"". In this game when you're flying in space you get to listen to a radio in which you can change stations and even listen to hilarious commercials. \n\n   This was just something I though would be awesome to have so please, add your own ideas and/or criticisms."
3s021w,Music Festival Management Game,"***Name:***\n\nSET-LIST (Feel free to come up with a miles better name)\n\n***Concept Overview:***\n\nA management game similar to Theme Hospital or Roller Coaster Tycoon, where you get the chance to run various music festivals. Everything from choosing the location to booking acts. \n\n***Plot:***\n\nThe game sees you as the organiser of various music festivals, Staring off running small local festivals in public parks where you will be booking small local acts, mostly to entertain families on the weekend. As you progress through the game you will be given the opportunity to run bigger and bigger festivals tis you are running your own Glastonbury style yearly music festival.\n\n***Setting:***\n\nSeeing would mostly be in a blank field, but there would be various to chose from. Do you pick a field with close proximity to a large city or town but with perhaps limited space for campers, or do you go further a field (pun intentional) and chose a sonic field with a castle or mountain backdrop? \n\n\n***Characters/Abilities:***\n\nAs with most tycoon games the characters are mostly staff:\n\nActs/Performers\nSecurity/Police\nVendors\nTicket Staff\nCatering\netc.\n\n\n***Gameplay Mechanics:***\n\nYou are tasked with running the festival and you have a year get all the planning done in time for the event, this starts off with the basics such as choosing the type of festival you want to run (e.g. Dance, Indie, Metal, Pop, Rave, 80s etc.) and a suitable location. You then have to book acts for your festival, everything from the Main Headliners down to the small unsigned independent acts. Acts will have ranging popularity the will change year on year based on things such as public taste, how recently they released new material, last time they played at a festival etc. You will also have to designate areas for campers, food vendors, toilets, chose the locations of your stages etc. Then once once all the set up is complete, you get to see (either in 3D, 2D or just text forum) how well you festival is doing. You will then get public feedback, based on your festivals layout, the acts you booked, how well organised it was etc. But it can also on occasion be based on factors out with your control, Did the headline act stop off stage, did the campsite flood etc.\n\n***Standout Features:***\n\nThe main goal of the game is to sell as many tickets for your festival as possible, so you get money to run the even again the next year. Throughout the year you can chose to release more information about the event to the public to try and drive up ticket sales, e.g.. announcing more acts or choosing to hold back ticket sales to create a hype.\n\nAlso the option to strike deals with other famous brands to make money, e.g. naming a stage after a drinks company or placing advertisements everywhere to increase profits.\n\n***Possible Platforms:***\n\nThe game could work on a verity of platforms but I envisaged it on the PC/Mac\n\n***Extra Features:***\n\nThere is possibility to make loads of music references with all the fake in game band names, spoofing real ones or just making up your own amor having them randomly generated. Also the possibility to add an in-game editor to allow people to make their own band names.\n\n\n***How To Credit Me:***\n\nIm not to bothered about credit. But it would be nice to be fen the comas credits."
3rz9y8,A PC multiplayer game where you evacuate massive amounts of civilians from a disaster in the city.,"What I mean by this post is something like the interaction/navegation of an unstable environment in a PVP match. \n\nOne example is a gametype thought up in my head 10 minutes ago called ""Evacuation"". This is borrowed somewhat from counter-strike, metal gear and titanfall but expanded. It has a near-futuristic setting and basically, you are supposed to evacuate as many civilians as you can (There could be hundreds or thousands of them) in a city from an impending disaster. However a team of terrorists are slaughtering the civilians. Defenders gain points for evacuation and attackers gain points for massacres and bonus points for killing defenders.\nHere's the twist: Each player only has one life, so that puts both sides on edge and forces them to think of a strategy. \nAlso there is no radar or anything, forcing players to rely on high places to spot enemies since you have thruster packs that you can climb up buildings and wall-jump, isolating players from the action below and engaging them in dogfights with the bad guys. \n\nIf any player dies they can provide air support by providing ammo, spotting enemies and deploying evacuation vehicles so they can have something to do while they wait.\n\nAs for the chaotic elements, weather is a powerful force. A hurricane can brush through the city, forming a flood and putting people's lives at risk, forcing defenders to prioritize them. If a certain amount of civilians are not saved during these events then defenders lose. \n\nThe Hurricane itself provides for an excellent visual effect. You can see the cloud looming from a distance and slowly approaching the horizon with gradual intensity. Then floods occur and windspeeds prevent you from jetpacking correctly and all the rainfall doesn't let you see a thing. \nThe maps also have a day-time progression system, meaning the day shifts to night and vise-versa since the time is set at random. You could be in the eye of the hurricane, completely safe, watching the crescent moon in the center looking down on you. Or see the sun in the same fashion. \nTsunamis, Sandstorms and Supercells (Tornadoes) are also a thing to watch out for. As these things are completely sporadic. \nYou could have an entire match without weather or you could have the whole match with a flood. You could also see a disaster in the distance and feel uneasy because it may or may not ever approach the city.\n\nA crucial part of the dramatic element is the lighting (Sharp shadows) and the expressions of the civilians themselves and what they go through. The civilians should have deeply expressive feelings of dismay, sorrow and should move and respond to disaster in a very convincing light, much like Elizabeth from bioshock infinite. They should all look distinguished not only in looks but in how they move, their moods and their unpredictability. \n\nYou as a defender are supposed to guide them. You simply tell them to stop or move on command. But whether or not they listen to you depends on their level of panic. Some may listen, others may fight other civilians for safety (In which case you gotta stun them and carry them) and others may actually help you by spotting terrorists or giving you weapons and ammo scavenged on the city or evacuating more civilians while you focus on the terrorists (The volunteers' deaths are not penalized) a worst case scenario would be for a riot to form, which would jeopardize the mission. On the flipside, they could also turn on you and spot you, use weapons against you (Or the surrounding population in a frenzy) and attacking volunteers and taking away their weapons to give to terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists, on the other hand, must kill as many civilians as possible, but there are so many so you can't kill everyone. Instead, you gotta kill and cause as much panic as possible like using bombs, destroying buildings, killing defenders guiding civilians, killing groups of people, blocking passages with their presence to make them run the other way (Or worse, in circles) stagnate them during disasters (Players can die from these too) and killing volunteers and evac vehicles.\n\nA quick trade-off when it comes to dying is that the more players die, the more weapons are supplied on the battlefield due to dead players. There is more support, so the gameplay balances itself out. However disasters can affect dead players as well because they can block satellite vision, misplace supplies (Strong Wind) among other things. This is also balanced out by funds that air support gains depending on the actions of both teams on the ground. That way, air support has to coordinate, sort through options and choose what to deploy in order to make ends meet.\n\nThere would also be a ranking system in place, allowing more skilled players to play against each other and gradually allow for a competitive environment to form without taking away the dramatic tone that players feel. \n\nThe deaths of the civilians should be emphasized. They are the core of the gameplay, so the civilians should cry upon seeing a randomly assigned relative dead with varying lines, expressions and reactions (rage, fear, sorrow, compassion, revenge, ambiguous etc.) and each should have their own unique identity, complete with names they tell each other. You should feel the despair they go through upon seeing bodies floating on the water, burned to ashes, dismembered, shot, etc.\nAnother facet to this would be to see their emotional reactions to being rescued and evacuated. You will see some crying from joy, you would see some reluctant, you would see some rushing to the vehicle or begging to be taken while they are left behind. There would be some who feel safe and comfortable while others feel confused or angry. You would have to take them in one-by-one to add to the immersion that you are saving REAL PEOPLE. And sometimes that could be as easy as letting them walk in or you would have to carry the wounded (bonus points) or you would grab someone by the hand and pull them in (raising morale) or you would have to struggle as you force someone inside against his will. \nCarving convincing individual identities on a mass scale can be achieved by crowdsourcing people from the internet and having them express the lines and names of civilians on the game to make the civilians more fleshed out and dynamic. Having hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of volunteers providing voice acting material could help provide an attachment to the civilians. \n\nAs for the terrorists, stealth is key for two reasons: \n-1 avoid detection by defenders.\n-2 Sporadic attacks are more frightening, which raises panic.\n\nThe mood of the civilians should not be illustrated on a panic meter (damages immersion) it should be detectable on the reactions of the civilians. Also, not everyone will realize what just happened. A group of people in a city could be oblivious to an explosion that murdered 10 people 5 blocks away. And the way this information is transferred also varies. Some civilians notify the ocurrence while others just flee from the crowd that is stampeding towards them. \n\nWhen nothing is ocurring, and it can happen at any point in the game, people are seen doing every day things. It is at this point when the defenders should be careful to preserve the peace as much as possible (REALLY HIGH BONUS POINTS) so any sort of fighting is going to attract attention and raise tension, but when disaster strikes people will be more desensitized to such things. \n\nThe eventual first encounter between defenders and terrorists should be a BIG DEAL. So much so that time should slow down for like 3 seconds while you hear a heartbeat, symbolizing a change of pace in gameplay and initiating a new phase in the conflict. its no longer terrorists killing people, they are also engaging Defenders and a new layer of chaos is added. Now they will focus on each other until disaster strikes. And when it does a third layer initiates. The final layer would be the population sinking into a riot, creating a hell-on-Earth scenario that is almost impossible to stop, only mitigate as much as possible.\n\nThe goal here is to at all costs NOT make the civilians seem disposable or cumbersome. They should enrich the multiplayer experience, not take away from it. \n\nThis game idea is way too big, and is very focused on complex A.I. programming and acting, but maybe you can take some bits and pieces and make something out of it.

However, the more pieces you put together, the more bonuses you get, and the more chaos as well. \n\nFor instance, you could be part way through a puzzle when a meteor comes and smashes through the castle you spent a half hour putting together.  Heartbreaking of course, but you are relieved to see the people you puzzled together come to your aid and try to put together your hard work.  As they reassemble the ruins with your help, a new form takes shape, something different, perhaps better.  \n\nAs you sigh in relief you hear the distant crash of thunder and prepare yourself for the maelstrom of chaos that will ensue.\n\n\n\nMy first post here and I have no idea what I'm doing, probably a dumb idea but I thought it might be fun."
3rv099,Open World RPG based loosely on the TV series Supernatural.,"So this is an idea I've been thinking about for the past week or two so I thought I'd put my ideas somewhere. First off, this isn't based in the same world as the TV show, simply the same ideas.\n\nYou play as a Hunter where you travel the world looking for demons, ghosts and monsters. The game would be set in a modern setting and would play similarly to Skyrim or GTA5. You use 1st person view most of the time but can switch to third person to view your character.\n\nFirst off the game would need to be immersive in order to make it scarier and have immersive animation. Things like opening doors and picking up items would be similar to Thief where you actually see your character's hand interact with whatever it is. You start by creating a character just like any other RPG game where you simply change their appearance. I haven't quite worked out how the game will start yet but it would be interesting to have several beginnings. After creating your character it places you randomly in one of several possible starting areas and the first mission is basically your character being motivated to become a hunter. Your character has a loved one that gets possessed or something and you have to save them but they still die. That part's not important.\n\nYou start with very limited knowledge on Hunting but you learn as you go. For example you could start by meeting another Hunter who explains the basic stuff to you like using Salt to ward off most things and how to make Holy Water. There would be a crafting system where you have to make things, like finding Rock Salt and empty shells to make Salt bullets or finding water and a cross to make Holy Water. As you progress through the game you learn more and better techniques such as finding a scroll with the latin words to exercise a demon or learning how to make a devil's trap.\n\nYou would find supernatural creatures by looking up news articles on the internet like using the internet in GTA5, and then investigating ones which sound suspicious. To make things interesting the game would make it possible for everything to be investigated, you have to determine yourself that there's no spirits involved. You would talk to people the same way as Fallout or Skyrim, having multiple choices and having to be careful about what you say and speech would be a skill you can improve. For example you could outright tell an NPC they have a ghost problem and risk being called crazy, or you could lie and say you need to inspect their house for something else, but risk being caught lying.\n\nWhen it comes to actually hunting the things it will depend on what you're hunting. If it's a ghost you might have to work out where they're buried so you can burn their bones. Let's say you discover the bones are buried in the basement. You would have to go into the house and look for them while trying to stay alive and it would need to be scary.\n\nStart off by walking into the house and walk around slowly for a bit when the lights flicker and turn off. Then you see your character's breath meaning it's cold. Then the ghost appears out of nowhere and flies toward you while shrieking, you have to shoot it before it hits you or you take damage or die. If you manage to shoot it it disappears for a few moments before it attacks again. Different ghosts would have different ways of interacting with you. Some of them might simply stand there and make household objects fly towards you and others might appear behind you and try to grab you.\n\nApart from your gun you also have the ability to use a secondary weapon which you use by pushing RB which is something like Salt, Holy water or a knife etc which can be used while reloading but has limited uses (except the knife). The game would have a vast range of weapons and items which are all used on different things. There would also be many different ammo types such as Salt, Silver and standard ammo are just 3 of them (Salt for ghosts, Silver for Werewolves and standard ammo for things that don't need special ammo).\n\nOf course the whole game wouldn't be just hunting random things but there would be a main story plus several smaller questlines involved. I have no idea what the main story would be yet but the smaller ones could all be based around well known supernatural creatures where you have to spend a lot of time hunting it down. One example could be a very powerful demon, the first quest involves simply capturing a demon and exercising it, but during the exorcism the demon mentions some plan that's going to kill us all. You then have to capture another demon and torture them for information to track this big demon down and then work out how to take it out.\n\nI know I've done a pretty shit job explaining my ideas here in an effective way but I think I got everything down as best I could. If I remember anything I forgot about I'll update the post. So what are your thoughts on this?"

They act as a filters through which we get to see the background. Now the challenge is to create a puzzle\nsuch that the user has to solve it just given these views. He can move\nthese views around to explore more. Or they could be fixed and he has to intelligently guess either by symmetry or past experiences (previous puzzles)\nwhat the whole background looks like.\n\nAnother idea that popped in my head was that these could really be views of past, present and future. This allows us to create puzzles in time dimension.\nLet's say the past view shows a button (that is broken in the present view) which the player could press and thus open a door in the present. "
3rrzbb,A game where you time travel and play in the same world as your previous self.,"It's kind of hard to describe in the title but you go somewhere and assassinate someone and then you time travel back and have to kill a different person without being seen by your previous self. If you cross paths with another you, you will break the universe or something. You would keep having to go back to kill different people while your world becomes more cluttered with your self. But you can also plan ahead. You get all your objectives at the beginning and then you can do things to help yourself out later.  So if you see a guard you know you'll have to take out later, you can snipe him. I haven't started making it yet but I want to\nEDIT: started it today"

3rhpn3,FPS Shooter,I'm here to ask for your ideas. My question is what YOU want so see in a First Person Shooter?\n
3rhb25,Marvel Zombies...,"A game where you pick 1-4 marvel heroes to be the last ""supers"" during the zombie apocalypse...  All different types of zombies; zombie villains and Zombied heroes...  You're trying to find a cure or save someone who can make the cure...  Also depending on the heroes chosen counterpart villains will exist in the world...     "
3rha0r,"An online RPG where once the final boss dies, it's over for everyone. (More details inside)","Now i couldn't fit much in the title but basically the premise for this idea is that it would function as a normal MMORPG, have its own lore, world, story. And as usual there are bosses, dungeons and such. But one thing, the final boss (The villain of the games storyline) Will end the MMO, it will be over forever showing the people who completed its names and maybe some sort of price to be had.\n\nNow to combat things like people rushing through and grinding there will be mechanics in place to stop endless grinds from bots and scripts. There will be no Microtransactions, just a single one time purchase price.\n\nNow with the boss (which ill now call X) Will be the toughest thing ever seen, not being able to even be faced or hurt by medium level players, Needing particular sets of gear, having tough mechanics and being near impossible. But still being able to be beat in much much later game...Much...later game.\n\nNow i'm thinking a classic fantasy setting for story with some call twists put in where they can be. The actual game mechanics would be unique, not just a push-key fighting style other games have taken on board.\n\nSo thats a small roughly put together list of my idea, what do you guys think?"

3z6x8k,What would you want to see for GBA or an older console?,"Hey guys, I have some time/energy to sink into a GBA programming project. I want to do something that many people will find novel/interesting. One thing I liked is someone porting Flappy Bird to the GBA\n\nAt first I was toying with the idea of creating a minecraft clone (since GBA is just powerful enough to run games with a 3D engine like Doom) \n\nWhat would you love to see on the GBA?

3z6fmi,Each player has 2 balls rolling on a heightmap and changes distance between them continuously using mouse,"or maybe 3 balls if you want to use x and y dimensions of mouse, and maybe the wheel. But lets keep it simple.\n\nImagine these 2 balls joined by a pole are spinning around eachother, and by adjusting the pole length you can make them roll over hills and valleys and move any chosen direction, but only with skill.\n\nIts not a full game but its a start. What else might they find in this world?"
3z495z,Ninja,"The game starts you as a child and you have to go though years of rigorous stealth and assination techniques (even some hand-to-hand). You learn all kinds of martial arts and how to use ninja weapons (shuriken, chain and sickle, nunchucks, daggers, flail, and so on [they have tons of weapons at their disposal, and the more you want to use, the more you have to train]). Crafting and personalization (AKA modding) of these weapons would be allowed but within reason. No blood-absorbtion or anything, unless that is a believe in the ninja world. I don't know. The storyline could be that once you become a teen and have established yourself, your sensei or master is killed. In honor of him (which I believe is a big virtue of ninjas), you will hunt and kill his murderer.\n\nWhat do you think? Let me know if I missed anything."
3z3kin,A war simulator I've been having some ideas for!,"Game ideas :)\n\nTittle - ?\n\nWar simulator, start with a basic Berreta M9 (No attachments/Muzzle's)\n\nSpawn in a base camp with Weapon crates, Food, Drinks. \n\nTwo-Four teams (Could be edited) \n\nGiant map (It would take around 30 minutes to run from one side of the map to the other) \n\nInfront of the base there is a few cars\n-Hummer\n-Komatsu LAV\n-Jeep\n-Foxhound\n\n(Planes undecieded)\n\nMore you carry slower you are.\n--------------------------------------------------- \nUpdated 24/10/2015\n\nHealth bar/Weight sort of similar to Smite HP/MP bar just alot smaller.\n\nStart with less food and drink than players (EX: 1 drink/snack per 2 1.5 players)\n\nWhen you spawn in base you get 3-5 minutes prep time big map on wall showing all trenches, routes, land vechile/air-\nvechile spawns. From that you get to draw down your own route (which stays on your small map)\n\nEvery player gets a small map which replicates the large map at base but it doesn't show spawns or enemies (Unless the are\nbeing very loud) in a certain radius.\n\nThrough-out the map there's a bunch of safe houses which can be colonized, whenever anyone enters one a large siren goes \noff announcing what team has started to colonize a base, inside a base there's more food/drink/weapons, and on two sides\nthere is windows with sandbags and turrets while you're in one you can set up defenses such as as sandbags which takes \na lot of bullets before being destroyed.\n\nThe main gamemode is basically a massive game of search and destroy.\n\nAt start of game of game you get to pick you're profession (Solider, Medic, Bomb defusal, Journalist.

3z3e93,Adrift - A space survival game,"You wake up from hypersleep, your ship is heavily damaged, it's leaking fuel, leaking oxygen, the on board computer doesn't work, no navigations, no communication, nothing.\n\nYou take control of the pilot in first person, walk around your ship fixing what you can which are the fuel and oxygen leaks by welding the holes shut, you even have to go outside with magnetic boots to weld some holes. However your on board computer needs components that you don't have lying around.\n\nWhatever happened to your ship you seem to be adrift in a debris field, tons of ships are destroyed and are floating around, same as you but you seem to be the only survivor. Your ship has very little fuel left because of the leak so you need to find more, your oxygen level is low too so you need to look for that and you need food and water to survive and tools for if you hit something.\n\nYou can fly your ship towards other ships and go outside and use your jetpack to fly, use your magnetic boots to walk around and investigate for fuel, oxygen, computer components, food, water, equipment like welding tools, etc.\n\nYou can fix parts of the on board computer by finding the necessary parts in other ships, that way you can restore ""navigation"", so you can have a GPS like feature in your ship. You  can restore ""scanning"" so you can scan ships and see what it contains but keeping it vague so it's still a surprise to investigage.\nYou can restore ""stock"" so you can see how much fuel, oxygen, tools and food you have. You can restore ""RCS"" so the computer can keep your ship still when you want to instead of you manually trying to do it which is impossible. Other parts of the computer can be restored too.\n\nSpace in the game is realistic so for people who have played Kerbal Space Program, exactly like that. You need RCS to counter every movement you make but it can be turned off so you don't really need a lot of fuel to get anywhere, RCS needs its own fuel but electric engines can be used as a last resort if you run out of it."
3z38d0,Guardianship,"I've always loved the idea of having a companion in games. Not as in escort missions, where your companion has little else to do but scream when things go wrong, but as in a long term, full game partner that can hold their own and does not need your protection, at least for most of the time. \n\nMy idea centers around this, in a kind of Last of Us style way where you go through the game with this partner and they actually contribute, but focusing more on how the relationship between the characters can effect the game play. \n\nMy game would take place over a number of years, where you play as a 20-something character and your partner starts off as a 13 year old. They are by no means helpless, can handle their own in a fight (with or without a weapon), and can do just about any task you give them. As you progress through the game, multiple play styles will be possible, with paths such as run-and-gun, stealth, or diplomacy all being something that, if you want to, could could get though the entire game doing.\n\nNow comes the interesting part: throughout the years that the game takes place over, your partner learns from watching you and listening to how tell them how you would handle a situation (which means that, if you really wanted to, you could lie and get them to behave in a way completely different from yourself, but doing so would incur the risks of them finding out). If you run in to a building and kill everybody there, you can expect them be more apt to do the same in the future (and be better at it than any other style). There will be no ""attribute bars"" or anything telling you how your actions will have affected them. All that you will have his your gut instinct on how good of a job that you think you have done at teaching them ethics. Whats more, there will be moments in which you can, and occasionally must, let them take on a task on their own. How they will carry out these tasks, the rewards you both gain from it, the likelihood that they will preform it as you ask them to, and the chances of success will all be affected by the way that you set an example. \n\nThat last part is crucial; that they can, and on occasion, will fail. At no point should they permanently die (if you make them do a task that they are completely unsuited to, that could happen), and if they do, you would simply wake up to start the day again, with their death being no more than a bad dream. But while you must finish the game together, that does not mean you go undamaged. There should be times at which either one of you could get hurt, either temporarily or permanently. Times like these could effect game play to an extent, possibly even removing a particular play style as a possibility, or they could result in no lasting effects. In addition, they should not blame you for their failures, and instead think that they (as some kind of pseudo [or  possibly even actual] child who as failed their parents) are the one at fault. Even if you abandon them, they should think that they had not been good enough for you, and it should tear them up.\n\nAll of these are designed to form a bond between your partner and not the main character, but you as the player. When they succeed, I want you to feel happy for them. If they get hurt, I want you to feel bad because you were the one to tell them to do something that you had not prepared them for. And if they handle a situation in a way that you did not want them to, I want you to feel bad because you know that you didn't set a good example to follow.\n\nIn most games, whenever the main character is personally close to another, it feels kind of empty. That there's nothing backing that relationship up. The reason that this is the case can often be blamed on lack of history; you jump in to their relationship wherever the game starts, and everything that happened before is just accepted as having happened, with little to no coverage on it. My idea fixes that by starting earlier, and making the history that backs up two character's relationship the central part of the game play. My hope is that by doing this, the game world gets a real sense of persistence, and that when the credits roll, life will go on afterwards and when you reflect back on the beginning, it feels like your characters existed with their own lives beforehand.\n\nI have zero experience with code and doubt that this will ever get made, but i love making these stories so any tips or games that follow this model already would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n"
3z2w5r,Most powerful person in the world( not a superhero or fight game),"So idea is very simple. It's based on real world. You choose any country. You start as its president or prime minister. The sole plot of the game will be to make your country the most power country in the world and player being the most powerful person. You will grow your army, economy, etc. A world war can also be included in the game. This game can be highly strategic, addictive and educational as well(real life economics, ratios etc such as human development index)."

3yz74b,Town Builder/Manager,"       I know there is an increasing rate of these out there, but I remember when I first started developing in vb.net(The first programming language I learned) and created something I called ""Smallville"". Basically, there is a list of things you can build(Of course) and you must gather supplies the hard way. No axes to start out with, no picks, no nothing. Just 5 settlers and there horses. \n      To create the starting tools, you must first gather some bark from a tree with one of your settler's hands. Then, you must gather some fiber from either a fibrous tree, or a plant. To craft an item, you must have a workbench. Although you do not have a workbench, you can use one of your horse saddles to build things on. This is the lowest tier of workbench(And makes the worst quality items). Of course, then you will move on to creating better workbenches, better tools, houses, farms, and so on. Anyone can take this idea and make it into a game(Although I doubt you would)."

3yvakr,Need ideas for an educational project.,"For our school's computer science class, we have to create some sort of programming project. I want to do a game. I'm looking for a single player educational game. I don't want it to be very bland or forced, like other educational games. Thanks!"
3yv7y9,Cops and Robbers [Multiplayer first-person],"\nI am imagining a game that takes place in an area of a city. \n\n----\n\n**Cop team**\n\n* start off partnered up in their squad cars\n\n* goal is to arrest or kill robbers. \n\n**Robber team**\n\n* start off with nothing\n\n* commit robberies against civilian AI\n\n* goal is to make money\n\n----\n\n**Robber gameplay**\n\n* A street robbery can be done by threatening a person with/without a weapon, or just beating them unconscious and stealing their wallet.\n\n* A store robbery can be done by threatening the clerk with/without a weapon until they open the cash register, or beating them unconscious and doing it themselves.\n\n* An armored car robbery can be done HEAT style by blocking the car in traffic then blowing its doors off, or maybe solo by just waiting until the guards get out and then disabling/killing them.\n\n* A heist of a bank would require cooperation, multiple players needed to watch/disable the multiple civilian AI (guards, clerks, customers) who will try to stop it\n\n* Not sure what happens when killed or arrested. Maybe respawns with nothing, or spends some time in jail, or is transferred to the cop team?\n\n**Cop gameplay**\n\n* When called, they receive: an exact location which shows up on their map, the direction the robber(s) were headed, and a physical description (which must be unique, i.e. no other robbers or AI can have it)\n\n* To identify the right suspect, an ""easy"" mode would highlight the suspect, a ""difficult"" mode would make it up to the player to visually identify that suspect\n\n**Notes/Mechanics**\n\n* When a robbery occurs, the civilian victims or witnesses can call the police and some will attempt to chase down the robber. When a robbery of a store or bank occurs, a civilian may activate a hidden alarm which will alert the police.\n\n* The easiest and least profitable robberies can be done solo, but robberies that are more profitable get more difficult and require player cooperation, fast cars, weaponry and body armor. Smaller robberies are committed in order to fund those purchases.\n\n* The game would not be very action-packed and violent like Hardline. The cops would only have Glocks and maybe there would be a shotgun in the car. Maybe when there's a more serious robbery, a number of cops are transferred to a SWAT class where they get better weapons.\n\n* If a certain amount of money has been stolen then the robbers win, but if it hasn't been stolen when the time limit is reached then the cops win.\n\n* Some part of the game would need to prevent the cops from winning by just randomly killing robbers as soon as they spot them. Robbers can only be considered suspects after they're committed a robbery. Not sure about this."
3yuw8u,"Large-Scale | Recipe: Multiplayer, Squad Based Co-op, NPCs, Enemy Ai| Shooter","An idea I had, is for a game mechanic system that could used in a shooter style game.  The story and aesthetics are not of primary concern, meaning the theme could be WWI, futuristic or post apocalyptic and the story could be anything.  The system includes multiple online players combined with friendly and enemy artificial intelligence.  Its goal is to create a real sense of war, teamwork and leadership.  The max amount of entities (human and ai players) in a game would be 138, with the largest battles consisting of six human players, 24 Squad Ai, 24 friendly ai and 84 enemy ai.  Each player would get a squad of four ai teammates that follow them around and have greater health than regular friendly ai.  You would be able to name the ai in your squad, which will stick with you in every game you play.  This would create a sense of camaraderie between the player and their squad.  Players are to complete multiple objectives at once (i.e. attack multiple bases or destroy multiple enemy positions).  Each player is assigned a single objective to complete; there could be six objectives (one for each player) or only three (meaning players would work in pairs) or even just one.  In order to move onto the next set of objectives, all current objectives must be completed.  Although players are given orders unique to them, they can still partner up with another player and complete their objective first. \nTo help explain myself, let us say the game is set in WWII from the Allied perspective and the mission is D-Day.  Six players are sent in different boats towards land.  The boats are filled with a player’s Squad Ai.  There are also boats filled completely with NPCs.  Each player is to land on the beach and attack certain gun nests.  A player must navigate towards their objective while caring for their Squad Ai so they can be used effectively.  The sheer amount of soldiers (friendly and enemy) is suppose to inspire a real sense of war, while the responsibility of each individual sparks the demand of leadership.  If a player and his squad destroy their objective, they can help out other players who were not as skilled or lucky -- some objectives are harder than others and require the use of communication from a player to gather help from other players (i.e. their beach was more heavily mined or was fortified with a supporting halftrack).  Once all objectives are destroyed, players are allowed to progress through the level towards new sets of objectives.  To finish a level, a final set of objectives needs to be completed.  The difficulty of the final set relies on the overall difficulty that was set as well as how efficient the players have been so far.\nWhile Squad Ai are stronger than regular ai, they do not however, respawn.  Once a player’s squad is killed, they are gone for the rest of the game/match.  Friendly ai do respawn but there is a finite reserve.  Depending on the player’s performances, the number of Squad Ai and friendly ai they have for the final set or intermediate sets, is dependent on how many are left/how many have died.\n A player should feel overwhelmed by the number of entities, scale of the map and how much responsibility rests on their shoulders.  If a player isn’t skilled enough, their Squad Ai will perish to the enemy, the friendly ai attacking that player’s objective will be cut down without support and the other players will have to pick up the slack by completing the objective themselves.  Communication, teamwork and tactics would be key to success in this game.\nExtra gameplay mechanics:\nIf a player dies, they respawn when the current set of objectives is completed.\nLow health, high damage; think Tom Clancy games.\nCertain Squad Ai would have special weapons (i.e. a sniper or rocket launcher).  You’ll want to keep these guys alive for as long as possible.\nCould be adaptive for player + Squad Ai versus player + Squad Ai.\n	\n	Thanks for reading this whole article, I know it was rather long.  I tried to keep in mind how realistic it would be to create such a game, but still some details might be too colossal and unrealistic.  You thoughts and advice, whether positive or negative, would be greatly appreciated."
3ytyta,A Sandbox Game Idea,"-Sandbox game\n-Mods are what drive the game like Garry's Mod, so it's all user generated content\n-It would need a really nice looking game engine, I'm not sure how you could acquire the rights to said engine.\n-The game would have an infinite amount of animations for bipedal models and I think it would be easy to do this because you could just mo cap all of it. Also animations for world objects, so say if you had a bush you could just apply a little sway. Entering vehicles, punching, sword play, shooting, falling, etc. Basically anything and everything.\n-Users can also upload custom animations.\n-All of these animations would be in the user interface menu and you could apply them to a desired key.\n-Various particles systems would already be in the engine. Users could generate additional ones themselves.\n-You can add your own sounds and assign them to certain actions.\n-The game would act like forge mode from Halo where you can set up the scene from scratch with spawn points, objectives, etc with various models and assets.\n-You can make your own game modes like team v. team or horde mode or even make your own missions where you have to move through certain areas of a map or push through a certain amount of enemies, also racing. Obviously this wouldn't be as dynamic or interesting as an actual game, but the concept is cool.\n-You can make maps with any environment assets you have. It would be really bare bones tbh. I really don't know how interactive the map could be or anything, I just feel like the mechanics for a lot of stuff like interacting with objects to open doors and swimming would already be in the engine, if you could just apply the physics of something onto a model it would work. It is probably a lot harder than that, but I know nothing about game design.\n\nI love ripping 3d models from games and using them in SFM - a Source engine animation program - and whenever I put models from different games together in one scene, I feel like it would be so cool to just have a game where you could do anything with anything.\n\nBasically I'm thinking of a game where you could make your own game(s) within a game that acts like a game engine, but with ease of use with an easy UI and a lot of user generated content that would let you put together a unique game of your own and share it with others. I am imagining people making very simple, yet fun missions and possibly some people making an entire story and several missions to complete with whatever models, sounds, assets, texts, etc they can add to their game to make their own small game. They could even make crossover games or fan games with assets from other games. Or they could just use it as a sandbox and fuck around.\n\nLike Minecraft and it's mods, but with an actual game engine that looks good. I feel like this game would be a hit on PC because of the freedom and the creativity that it gives. I feel like Gmod is very similar, but this would be so much more and better graphics and way less limitations.\n\nI just need some criticism and don't hold back tell me how shit it is because I'm pretty sure that I have a really big idea that is just not plausible because I have no knowledge of game developing."
3yp76x,Pulp,"Basic idea:\nPollution, global warming, and forest clearing are very high in the year of 2086. The earth has grown tired of it's abuse and now its forest trees are mutating it's inhabitants.

Every forest contains a guardian that you have to kill in order to get to the forest heart. The forest heart is what you will have to blow up in order to cleanse the forest( it's like the tree that is mutating everything) \n\nMechanics: Haven't got that far(might be edited)\n\nMonsters:\nEvery animal found in every forest i guess, but mutated.\n\nThat's all i got. \n\nP.S go easy on me this is my first time using reddit\n\n\n"
3ynf59,Turn based strategy arena,"So I have an idea of a game that I need some help with the turn mechanic.\n\nThe idea is a game where 2 teams of 1, 2 or 3 heroes are against eachother in an arena. They take turns to move, attack, do spells (I have more mechanic ideas but they are big so for now just leave it at the base). I can think of a few different turn mechanics.\n\n1: The players take simultanious turns so they need to anticipate eachothers move (Think of frozen synapse, civ). The turn play phase is probably priority attack, movement, attack because for example if you see eachother and you shoot in your turn but your enemy moves it misses (thats not what I want personally)\n\n2: Not simultanious turns (think of xcom) this way people can see and react to his/her enemy. This probably will use an initiative system.\n\nWhen casting spells, attacking and moving you use up energy. The less energy you use in a turn and depending on your energy regen your next turn comes faster.\n\nThat means: bigger spells, longer movement, heavier attacks means longer till next turn.\n\nIdeas and suggestions are welcome as I really need to sort this out before I can start designing the game further (right now the game is a mess in my head)"
3yn3nj,Superhero rpg,"\nA superhero choice rpg. You start off maybe 5 years old, and every choice you make takes you down a path. Like the roots of a tree, your options are almost endless at the beginning. But nearing the end you are working on your powers. An example, you walk into your classroom, maybe in 8th grade or so, and you choose between talking the teacher, the boy up front, or the girl in the back. From then on, let's say you talk to the boy and I talk to the girl, our games will be extremely different. I might go to Xavier's academy and you might train on the streets. We may have the same base power, but our knowledge and skills would be vastly different. Obviously using DC and Marvel heroes would be hard if not impossible to use together (due to money and such), but we could use their powers. Your character could be the first of many superheroes. It would have to be a 1-4 player (mainly 1 player) game together but it could be 1 console co-op after a certain point in the game due to it's nature. But we could put every imaginable power in the game. Flying, super strength, pyrochinetics, morphing, magnetism, etc. You would choose what type of hero or villain you would be. Would you create the new JLA or Avengers? Or attempt to become the supreme leader of the world? Your power might allow it, whereas some others power might allow them to be the perfect electrician or plumber. All of it would depend on how you use/train your skills.\n\nObviously if I'm a bad guy and you are a good guy, we wouldn't be able to play on one console. We most likely wouldn't want to work together. Unless we are playing with two other people who have created an alliance with each other. We might have to form a temporary alignment to defeat them for our own means. Maybe you are a permanent ally with someone because your powers of the wonder twins. Idk I would like this. But it would be super expensive and take a long time to make."

3yllxo,MMO RTS: Dominion - Take over the World?,"Hi guys!  \nI'm tired of these stateless RTS games that don't really offer to release your inner dictator/leader/hero.  \nMy concept runs as a game where all players are on the same world.  \nThe size of your land / sphere of control is up to you!  \nYou can invest in a small economic strategy or take over large land masses.  \nNow obviously, letting 1-2 players grab up the resources / land and hold them forever would be boring. So we would have seasons, where the world resets and higher scoring players would get special stat bonuses based on the top areas they scored last season.  \nA player with the most currency could for example choose between a tax deduction or bonus when performing transactions.  \nThe goal is to make it so a single player could conceivably control the entire world at a given point, but make it a economic nightmare long term.  \nCartels and Alliances should be encouraged to the point of receiving bonuses.\n\n  \nThe world map would need to be able dynamically expand and re-arrange to compensate for new players, yet stay stable enough for players to confidently send large armies.  \nNew players would spawn their territories next to each other.  \nFriends could grab land of a certain size and create a new Capitol for their other friends so they could play next to each other.  \n\nPlayer Capitols, once destroyed, do not cause that player to lose all assets, but instead they are ""exiled"" to the starting region with a new Capitol with a percentage of assets.  \nPlayers can negotiate deals regarding their territory to allow for Civilization style deals like becoming a puppet or allow foreign troop movement.  \n  \nAll major events are logged in an easily filterable log so that they can keep up with events important to them.  \n  \nRevenue streams are many. Allow players to craft their own culture or sell them the skin themes outright (Medieval, Space Race, etc).  \nSell costumes for their leader avatar. Avoid things that allow for direct pay to win (faster troop movement etc) but perhaps things that lift limits and allow for binge weekend play sessions."

Players could control big vehicles like the ac130, while in this vehicle, the main driver can drop off light anti infantry vehicles as well as ai paratroopers. Naval vessels will also be present but need a bigger crew. Each crew member will have a specific role to play on the ship.

3mr246,Dracula Simulator,"Here's an Pitch: Dracula Simulator. So like Civ it has really long games that span over thousands of years but happen in ultra-time. You play as a vampire and your goal is to explore a randomly generated map to find settlements to prey on. If you're smart you can blend in with society but you have a life bar that depletes over time but fills when you kill. So you have to choose a villager to kill and feed on. BUT: the more you kill the higher suspicion is raised and more chance villagers will show up at your door with pitchforks and torches. The more aggressive you are the more aggressively villagers peruse you. survivors might learn your weaknesses and use them against you (not dissimilar to Plague Inc/Pandemic) If you make enough money or resources you can build a big evil mansion with loads of booby traps to ward off peasants and plebs and whatnot. There are also vampire hunters who will hunt you down mercilessly if you get to cocky. Settlements in the game grow and develop over time as well because of the timespan of the game. You can only really move outside at night time which I think would be an interesting game mechanic. The ultimate goal is to see how many kills you can make before you're killed so that means it''s a permadeath game but the games are long if you're really good at it.\nEDIT: Thralls and undead servants would be cool too, I don't know if I mentioned base building but that could be a part of it too"

3mm0c2,A spaceship game that no one will ever make.,"I like the kinds of games that would be impossible to successfully market. Most of the things that people hate about video games are the things I love the most.\n\nIn zombie survival games, most people like running around, collecting gear and shooting zombies in the face. All of that is well and good. But when I think of zombie survival, what gets me excited is sitting with a group of other survivors in a dark, cold house, eating beans out of a can. Or reading a comic I found as the sound of a massive herd passes by on the street outside. Or the micromanagement that comes with boarding up windows and improving the infrastructure of your base.\n\nWell, my idea for a fun **spaceship game** would be something similar to my zombie survival example. I want a spaceship game where:\n\n* Our mission isn't heroic at all. We're a **transport/cargo ship**, not a star fighter. The entire game is us loading up cargo on one planet and selling it for a profit at another planet.\n* Travel between planets takes like **a real-time hour**. Or maybe 30 minutes. Enough time to actually make trips feel real.\n* How do we pass all that time? By playing card games in the common room, or polishing your weapons/gear in your bunk, or seeing to any number of responsibilities you have on a spaceship. If you're an **engineer**, you go through and play mini-games that let you conduct maintenance on the engines. If you're the ship's **doctor**, you set appointments with other players to see to their injuries (also a mini-game, itself.) If you're the **pilot**, your gameplay experience revolves around the beginning and end of each trip, where you have to pilot the actual ship and pay attention to docking procedures on the radio. If you're **security**, you take care of your weapons and gear, and make sure other players don't get drunk and carried away. If you're the ship's **cook**, you play a mini-game to prepare meals for the crew.\n\nAnd that's it. It's just a space trade sim where each player has their own responsibilities aboard their ship. Taking it further, each player can save up wages and buy their own ship one day, starting their own trade/cargo companies."
3mlyns,Looking for VR ideas,"I've been playing around with the Oculus DK2 and UE4 for a while now, and I've been trying to come up with a good idea. I've played through pretty much everything on Oculus Share and I've noticed that there aren't many actual full games out there (most are either tech demos or small mini-games). I'd like to change that.\n\nI'm mostly here looking for a gameplay genre and possibly a theme around it. One thing to remember with VR is that too much movement can be disorienting, so I'd like to shy away from anything like a fast-paced FPS.\n\nThanks!"

3micda,Idea for a game mechanic,"I've had this Idea for a while now that said lacking any kind of knowledge of game development it'll never come to pass so I thought I'd put it out there see what people thought.\n\nSo to begin with would you agree that your standard RPG mechanic goes something like farmer who can barely wield a sword goes out and kills monsters until by then end of the game he can pretty much take out a minion with a dirty look? Also that regardless of what victories the allies may achieve the monsters at the enemies disposal shall grow in strength and numbers? How the game addresses the second part of that varies from title to title but they would appear to be the constants for an rpg from my experience.\n\nMy Idea runs the other way the monsters maintain the same strength and density but the hero gets weaker as the game goes on. that is at it's core my mechanic I have flashed it out a bit further going so far as to build a rough game plot though will happily admit that as I have no intention of ever making it it borrows heavily from zelda and fable.\n\nYou are a mighty warrior king, strongest in the land you have defeated the mightiest monsters and slain the most powerful enemies despite this however you are aware that one nemesis shall eventually destroy you ... Time. even now you feel ages creeping effects so you travel the lands seeking that age old secret IMMORTALITY. You find Zip well almost zip you do hear a rumor of a man who lives in the middle of an uninhabitable wasteland who visits nearby villages on a semi regular basis for food and drink according to rumours he has appeared for centuries from this place that drains the very life out of all who approach it.\n\nYou treck to this desert and make it to the centre the sole survivor of your journey the rest having fallen prey to the seeping effect of the landand meet this man who after attacking you and being slain thrice for his efforts offers you a tea and admits to being immortal. He gives you 4 ancient weapons a sword a bow a dagger and a staff and tells you of three temples(thank you Zelda) lying at the furthest edges of the kingdom each representing a fact of the warriors strength power,magic, skill(thank you fable) and that if you wish to obtain immortality you must take each artifact to the center of the matching temple cut yourself with the dagger smear the blood on the weapon and drive the weapon into the ground. upon completing all three temples you must return to him with the dagger to complete the ritual. That said as you complete each step of the ritual you shall have a portion of your soul and strength torn from your body and sealed to the temple permanently weakening you until the ritual is completely finished and the only way to cancel the ritual once started is through your death you have till you plant the first artifact to back out.\n\neach temple will be called the temple of devouring X x being strentgh magic skill and the monsters in a temple will all be immune to the temples skill and split between being weak to one of the others and resistant to the other this won't matter to much as you'll breeze through the first temple upon completion of which you lose 25% of your health/mana  60% of that temples feature stat and10% of the other two so upon reaching temple two half the monsters will be weak to a stat you con only do 40% damage in and upon defeating all three temples you will have a quarter of your starting health and 20% of all your starting stats.\n\nSurprise Surprise upon returning to the immortal he betrays you saying that once he like you was the most powerful being in the land and that he to bound his soul to the temples making his strength as one with the lands turns out that the strength of the land rises over time enriched by the soul to which it is bound until they're strength becomes the average of every man woman and child and unable to grow themselves they are quickly left behind. He plans to steal your life strength and power by altering thefinal stage of the ritual instead of having you place the final artifact smeared with your blood he intends to smear his on as well and hopefully when your soul is returned through the land it shall instead flow to him. He is the final boss and as much as you trounced him at the beginning cut to a fifth of your initial strength he actually is quite the grueling battle should you defeat him you complete the ritual and enjoy your victory haunted, slightly, by the mad mans words\n\nThat's my game idea pretty shoddy I know but I just thought I'd put it out there and see what people thought"
3mfg8s,Turn On The Lights - A Horror Concept,"So the basic premise of this game combines typical horror elements with a focus on knowing what you are facing and where it is. You are tasked with the morning shift in an empty factory, and your first task is to turn on all the lights before the other workers arrive. To do this, the player must find switches using faint light pouring in from adjacent rooms already completed. The first room will already be lit when the player starts. The morning shift worker's job is to rid the factory of pests, monsters, and other horrible entities that come out during the night and remain as long as there is darkness in the factory.\n\nIf there is a monster in a room, the player will be able to hear it breathing even in darkness, and will be able to see its silhouette if it is exposed to light from an adjacent room. Some monsters flee into adjacent rooms when the lights are turned on, some will vanish entirely. Monsters which flee into nearby rooms will also vanish when all the rooms around them are already lit. However, some monsters will attack the player when the lights turn on. Monsters which flee or vanish will attack the player if touched in darkness. Monsters which attack when the room is lit will vanish when touched. The player must use the silhouette and sound of the monster to determine what kind it is (each kind will have a distinctive shape and a different trait to its breathing).\n\nIn summary, there are three kinds of monsters: when lights are turned on, one kind flees, one kind vanishes, and one kind attacks. But the former two attack when touched, while the latter vanishes. The player must decide whether to approach the monster or turn on the lights. Choosing correctly will remove the monster at least from the room. Choosing wrongly will result in the player being attacked and/or jumpscared (have not decided if I want that to be a part of the attack).\n\nCan't think of any ways to elaborate on this idea now but I know there are ways it could be improved."

3mehhr,"RPG - ""Life Saver""","The premise is that you can save anyone you want to, but you get what would have killed them. You have this power because the government created you to save humanity. Ex: If someone has brain cancer and you save them, you now have brain cancer. \n\nYou start with your remaining life time in the corner, and each time you make a choice it goes down accordingly. \n\nExample choice: \nPerson A has brain Cancer\nPerson B has Ovarian Flu\nThen it tells you a bit about each person, what they are doing and some traits they have. Bonus: They might have some ""sob"" story connected to them, like what is the life they are living now sort of thing. It will also tell you their remaining life-span and what they think they can accomplish if you save them. \n\nThe choices you make about who you want to save will affect the course of history. You could be saving the next Hitler and letting the next Einstein die, or the other way around. Based on your choices you get to see the world change around you until you run out of life and die. \n\nThe goal of the game would be to bring Humanity to the next stage of enlightenment (ultimate win), or simply prevent the end of the world (win). A loss would be not preventing the end of the world. \n\nHow long is your life? Well since you were genetically engineered in a laboratory and are basically a living god you have 1000 years of life. \n\nYou might choose to save your life by only rescuing people who barely affect your overall life-span so you can save the maximum amount of people, or you might save very little people because you want to cure the most deadly diseases.\n\nNote: possible add-on would be the ability to give away one of the diseases you contracted of saving a life onto someone else. This could make the game more interesting. "
3megmk,Need ideas for a platformer [Requests],I started working on a platformer but it is pretty standard. I need an idea for a mechanic that would make it very unique.

That would open doors to ideas like half hover stanced cars (only the front wheels hover) or micro gravity rims etc. Imagine Concept cars having bodykits and performance tuning. And a cool setting for this game would be on a colonized planet somewhere in the galaxy. Unlike most futuristic racing games, this could be the first in the open world racing genre. "
3m9ag7,"AN Arkham-like ""V For Vendetta"" game","I saw V For Vendetta recently and I thought it would be cool to see a game similar to the Batman: Arkham series set in the world of VFV. There would be sections where you play as V and just beat the crap out of the police; and then sections where you play as Evey and look for clues that can help you learn more about V and the government. It isn't really something an indie developer could really do(mainly just securing the rights and the like), but I figure that if a high budget developer made it, it could be pretty cool."
3m5vvq,Diablo in space (shoot-em-up),"Hi!\n\nI was thinking about a ""Diablo in space"", but side-scrolling. You have a ship you can update with more equipment, maybe a manufacture system, maybe a crew which gives you this or that bonus.\n\nYou play the game by doing missions, e.g. fly threw the asteroid field, mine an asteroid while being attacked by droid ships etc. There could be an event system. Dialogue is displayed as in Diablo with portraits and text.\n\nHopefully there would be a deep lore to accompany the action, with interesting characters.\n\nOK, just some loose thoughts. :) I worked with a shoot-em-up on my old Amiga some years ago, mainly with AI, inspired by Diablo.\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nOlle\n\n**Edit**: Ah, seems like Blizzard had a ""Diablo in space""-idea them selves: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-prototyped-diablo-in-space/1100-6398712/"
3m5suz,Distopian Factory Manager/Simulator,"The idea would be that you, yes you, have been chosen by the dictator of your government to run a factory! Huzzah! You sit at your computer and order upgrades to help your pathetic worker bees to pump out your manufactured goods (be it guns and ammo, cars, radios or what-have-you). You choose the disciplinary actions for the random things your employees will try to get involved it, be it strikes, slacking, or etc. I think it would be neat for your character to be able to walk around the factory, boosting productivity the more the employees see you, be it through fear or happiness (depending on your choices during a playthrough).\n\n______________________________\n\n\nIf productivity wanes too much it will prompt a visit by a government investigator. You will have to tidy and tighten up to pass the investigation and get the heat off your back. If you pump out too much product may have to build warehouses to stock the excess.\n\n\nDifferent things happening during the war your government is in will constantly change the demand of your product. Maybe even completely change the product you make.\n\n\nYou'll have to manage your work force, placing people where you think they'll be best suited or in positions that they would be terrible at, depending on what you want the end goal to be.\n\n\nI think this type of game would require a lot of meters. Such as, Morality (how you treat your workers), Government Satisfaction (are you being obviously dissident?), Productivity Rate, etc etc.\n\n\nIn my mind, I'd love to see this in first person. You walk into your factory, go up your exclusive elevator to your office with a view of your factory. You sit at your desk, read the newspaper to see what's going on in the world, read letters to see what the government requires of you that month and what the plant supervisors have to report, then you turn to your typewriter (or computer, could be modern or futuristic, imho) and start giving commands! I do think the game could be made using numerous different points of view though, I just personally like the first person :)\n\n\nEssentially the idea comes from Schindler's List. Would you be a kind boss, or would you run your factory with an iron fist?\n\n\nYou, standing in your office at parade - rest as you look down at your factory floor and your employees, could be a possible cover for the game. It's just what I had in my mind, at least!\n\n\nTL;DR:   help your employees make it through the war and be as good to them as possible while sending out faulty weaponry, or help the war machine keep on rolling, annihilating all keeping the troops armed!\n\n\nEdit: more details and whatnots.\n"

All input would be really helpfull.\n\nThe game idea is called ""One Bullet Arena"" and is based on an idea from user /u/looneygag . My idea was basically a party game with 2-4(?) players in a 2D topdown arena. All players have one bullet. If they shoot the bullet they need to pick it up again. The person who lives the longest wins.\n\nMy problem is what the bullet is going to be and still keep the game logical. I thought a waterballoon could make a good projectile but then the pick up thing doesn't really work anymore. It doesn't have to be logical or existing but at least it should make sense.\n\nAlso depending on what the projectile is gooing to be, what is the setting / atmosphere of the game like? How should maps look? I don't have artist skills so lines and colors would be the best way to go (Tron Style).\n\nMaybe add powerups, then what powerups should there be.\n\nThanks in advance, really looking forward to your input!!!

3m1hau,Let's create the perfect over-the-top rollerskating game.,"I looked at SSX tricky and thought again maybe it can be done after all.  People are so focused on having a hub you can skate around, walls you can tag with graffiti, and treating it like a tony hawk pro skater game.  \n\nOr as a linear racing game.\n\nBut what if it was more along the lines of SSX tricky?  Over the top tricks and maps with multiple routes, the more over the top dangerous moves you do, the more meter you will have to boost through the map, but even boosting would be dangerous.  \n\nYou're in a city, going through civilians and cars.  The meter for your boost can be used for other things instead of just going faster.  You can use it to run on walls, and do absurd tricks like Air gear (riding up a pole), meaning not every shortcut is readily available to player based on how much meter they had at that given time.  if you didn't have enough meter when you were near the pole then you can't simply ride up it and have to take a different route, if you had _some_ meter, then you can ride it half way then launch yourself towards the direction you're trying to go. (Someone with enough meter could ride it to the top which leads to a different path.)\n\nTricks consist of ""close calls"", so if you ride on the street against opposing traffic, ride on the rails.. knock players down and end up with massive air time _without falling_ then you have tons of meter.  The game uses momentum for handling speed and jumps.  So if you're riding down a hill, you will naturally speed up, if you jump at the perfect time as you're now going up a ramp, then you will get insane air-time.  \n\nCustomization can be focused on things such as, acceleration (how fast it takes you to get to max speed, and instantly stop) and so on.\n\nI do NOT want this game to be F2P like street gears, where they have to keep coming up with ways to increase your stats to ridiculous levels, I would want this to be a full complete game.. customization is purely based on what skates you have equipped.\n\nSo yeah, difficult game with high risk high reward for skilled players.\n\nI would even go so far as to allow team races, and your teammates can throw/push you ahead for momentum if they're nearby, and it's a group effort to win.  (A teammate ending up in last place will hurt you badly.)"
3m1gtn,Fight the neural networks,"The idea is like that, you fight the game's AI enemies who operate based on neural networks, every new level is a new generation where you fight the best mutations.

3poxrm,Post WW3 survival game that turns into a nation builder,"So, stay with me on this, you start out alone in a barren wasteland. If you're careful enough, you slowly get equipment, find companions, fight mutants and rival humans for resources, and do quests for people a la Fallout. Eventually, you get to a point in which you decide to spread your influence and bring stability back to this chaotic land. As you continue along your adventure, your choices will decide the fate of your newly declared nation. Will you try to create a democracy or dictatorship? What of the issue of slavery or the rights of woman in your land, among others. Do you wish to continue to move as nomads or find a place to remain as an isolated state? The balance of power among people, especially those who helped form your nation, matter. Of course, you'll be able to continue to do all the things you did before becoming a founding father/mother, but on a much grander scale, with entire armies taking part!\n\nSo, what do you all think?"

3po4nt,Procedural space game with trading/crafting/modular ship design,"Being a fan of procedural games I thought about this, even though it's not new I guess. \n\nBasically you will just start with a ship which is made out of kind of squared blocks and over the time you will enhance your ship with different modules. The ""cool"" part about it is, that your ship will be completely modular, so you will be able to add sections, modules, engines, thrusters, weapons, bays and so on. Think about the procedural generated ships from Heat Signature beside the fact that you can build your own.\n\nFun part would be that it would make a difference which parts of an enemy ship you would attack and destroy and if you have a ship that is long but thin you could shoot it into two or more parts for instance. \n \nThe trading part would be just between stations and you also can craft stuff for yourself and other players. I think about to let the player specialize in different categories so he can become master in weapons for instance or armor/plates or engines and so on.\n \nSo what do you think about this? Are there pitfalls? Can this be fun? Thanks!"
3po1dm,[Request] Simple Game idea for a roguelike,Anyone have any small but unique ideas for roguelike games?
3plcpj,Game about surviving on unknown planet by hunting and training creatures to protect you,"So yeah. The idea comes to me with Pokémon in mind but more ""grown up"" ... just hear me out anyway.\n\n**Back Story**\n\nEarth had begun a natural cleansing cycle only known to happen once every eight to ten thousand years. Recent signs pointed to this event happening in another twenty years. This brought on a rush of scientists from all over the world to begin finding ways to save the human race.\n\nOne scientist discovered a very energy efficient way of creating a wormhole. Though this option had its promises and quickly became popular among the scientific community, the technology hadn't yet allowed focal trajectory adjustment.\n\nIn short, testing had to be done to determine whether these first test subjects reached the other side safely. After the initial string of volunteers passed through and results were studied, it was reported that safe passage was possible. However, without knowing enough about the world at the other end, they would still only allow passage through on a volunteer basis.\n\nYou were one of the many hundreds of thousands of volunteers that chose to take their chances.\n\nYou find yourself on a planet where the weather is usually on the extreme side and there seems to be a significant population of highly predatory creatures.\n\nThe first, smaller group of volunteers who reached this alien world had to quickly learn to adapt. Most of them died, but the few that remained begin teaching the many who are still passing through the wormhole how to survive.\n\n**Your goal is to survive and thrive**\n\n* Survive\n\n * Keep yourself fed and hydrated.\n\n  * Only hot springs are where the safest water is for drinking. You will need to get it cooled first though.\n\n  * There are some safe plants to eat\n\n  * Hunt for Meat\n\n   * Meat is the most nutritious meal for your body due to the diets of many of the creatures of this world.\n\n * Hunt to keep (tame)\n\n  * Part of your survival is the protection a tamed creature of this alien world can provide. They can also provide other forms of entertainment.\n\n   * Capture, feed, and breed to make truly powerful warriors to fight for you out on your expeditions.\n\n    * The varieties of creatures out there are all beautiful, powerful, and awesome. You can sometimes earn somebody else's creature by entering your own creature into an arena match against another. If your creature brings down the other to near death before it does yours, it will submit itself to you and turn on its original master if they try taking it back.\n\n* Thrive\n\n * Build a shelter to stay safe from the elements when you need rest. Certain trees on this world have perfect wood for truly sheltering you in the harsh environment.\n\n  * Band together with others. Safety in numbers.\n\n  * Work with members of your group to gain the trust of your own tamed creatures.\n\n  * Work with members of your group to gain the trust of their tamed creatures.\n\n  * Feed and nurture your pets so they stay faithful, grow stronger, and stay in prime health for the best breeding outcomes.\n\nThat's the idea in a nutshell. Hopefully, you can imagine a game sort of like Pokémon but with a much more serious undertone, beautiful world to explore, survive, and thrive in among others who are trying to do the same. Breeding could have interesting potential. Battles with wild creatures to tame them or just for protection could be rewarding but also arena battles as a sport against others could also be very rewarding and provides a PvP playstyle in an otherwise cooperative environment.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**EDIT: ARK is not a valid alternative to this idea. It seems like it at face value but the monsters in this game would require a pretty complex AI, hit zones, various armor levels for those zones, special attack types, etc. Then there's the need for a pretty diverse monster population - various types, sizes, shapes.**"
3pl1dm,A morality system where no good deed goes unpunished.,"Being good isn't easy; that's what makes it noble. I think it would be fun to illustrate this by using a morality system that punishes you for doing the right thing.\n\nTo make some examples in a generic fantasy setting:\n\n1) A beggar is in possession of the Plot Device and is demanding a fee for it. To be Good the player would pay the fee. If you're less noble you can just take it.\n\n2) As you leave a small village it comes under seige by Orcs. The oble thing to do would be to stand and endure a costly fight, which would allow may villagers to escape though they can't reward you with anything worthwhile. If you're less noble, you can walk away.\n\n3) You take an enemy stronghold and some of the enemies surrender. If you kill them, nothing happens. If you're Good and spare their lives, you have their gratitude but one will alert the next camp, making the next fight harder.\n\n4) As you near a boss fight you come across several caged prisoners. You know the boss is buffing up, and it's clear the longer you take the harder the fight. The Good character would rescue the prisoners and take on the super difficult boss. The Evil character ignores the prisoners and gets to fight a substantially weaker boss.\n\n5) During the final boss encounter of the game, you're disarmed and your weapon is flung across the map. If you go to retrieve the weapon the boss will take that chance to kill a plot important character or further some great evil deed. You either beat the boss unarmed, or lose somebody important to you.\n\nChoosing to do the Good thing makes the game harder. It's bleak, pessimistic, and beautiful. To rub it in just a little bit more, I'd have a Good player die at the end, but the less noble character would live happily ever after.\n\nI wouldn't ruin the no good deed goes unpunished aesthetic by giving the Good character an achievement, unless the same achievement was easily earned by committing a heinous deed."
3pkxp1,"I want to make a game around the idea of the player being able to ""Possess"" people, but I have no ideas.","So basically, I have a super broad idea - A game involving the player possessing other bodies.

3piswf,Disaster survival game idea.,"I've thought a lot about this. I would love to see someone (possibly Telltale) come out with a Walking Dead-like interactive episodic game where in each episode, you play as a normal person trying to survive a natural disaster.\n\nI'm a fan of Irem's ""Disaster Report"" series, even though they aren't very popular. That's where I got this idea.\n\nI'd make it almost identical to Walking Dead and Until Dawn (where the decisions you make and dialogue directly affect the gameplay), for the exception of the plotlines, obviously, but each episode involves a different protagonist and none of the episodes are connected with each other in any way.\n\nI'd probably call it something along the lines of ""Nature's Fury.""\n\nWould this work?\n\nWhatever questions you may have I'll try to answer."
3pi1b5,A World War II Game that makes you care about World War II,"The World War fps genre really ran its course by 2008-10, but there is so much more material there. Imagine a Period shooter set on the pacific front, a real marine game, not a navy/air sim. So my ""Original"" concept goes like this:\n\n\nHUGE EDIT, really downsized the whole idea to make it more story and art based as opposed to just a re-skinned COD. \n\n\nThe Basic Premise follows the story of a squad of marines stationed in the pacific during WWII. Graphics wise, think Cel Shading, lots of pastels and such, really make the jungle pop. So you do some slight character customization, pick your home town, maybe select a body type. Then you are placed in a squad with 10 other real players, and 9 npc's (this comes in handy later) You and your squad go through basic training at some fort on the west coast, this is were you get a real feel for the home front during the war, you can go off base during certain periods, build relationships with the civilians. You witness innocent Japanese civilians being put in internment camps. You see the paranoia of war invade this blissful 1940s American dream. Soon, you and your squad are shipped out. This is why npcs are needed, if you dnt have people online, they can be ""in the infaramy"" and the npc, which will have plenty of character developmment, takes his or her place. The second you hit the beach during your first battle, a shell hits the landing vehicle next to you, blood everywhere. Maybe a npc that the player is close to dies right there, before ever firing a gun. You realize that everything that happens in the game universe is real, no do overs. I dont know how would work combat wise, I need ideas. If a character dies during combat, its over. They are replaced in a few in game days by a new player that wants to join a in progress game session. The main concept is that the story and the multiplayer are the same. You experience this period of history with other humans with similar points of reference. "
3pew2m,Create A Solar System From Scratch,"As the title suggests, this is an idea for a game were you play an all-mighty being (or aliens) and create your very own little Star System from scratch.\n\nThe game starts off by finding a Protostar (this is basically a baby star). Next, instead of waiting for the Protostar to become a young star (which takes a few million years), you can feed it H2 to increase its temperature, which will affect what type of star it becomes later in life. \nWhen nuclear fusion has started, your star will become a Young Star. \n\nAfter the young star phase, depending on how much you fed it, it will either become a White Dwarf (feed it too much), a Supergiant or Red Giant (feed it too little) or settle in the middle as a Main Sequence Star (feed it juuuuust right!)\n\nNext, your star will grow into an adult, this is when you can start harvesting elements it has created due to nuclear fusion. While in adult form, it will start to attract big asteroids, meteors and space dust. These will form gas giants, asteroid belts, planet and moons with your help. You can use the elements that you have gathered to form compounds like water and place them on your planets (and maybe in the future, you can create LIFE!)\n\nYour stars life span will be shown on the screen, the star will continue to grow until it reaches the end of its life. Once it reaches the end of it's life, the star will explod into a massive cloud of light and colours.\nFrom here, you may find another Protostar and start all over again!\n\nHow stars are formed:\nhttp://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec13.html\n\nHow solar systems are formed:\nhttp://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/formation.html\n\nNOTE: I do not follow Scientology and don't want to offend anyone's religion, but I think this would be a cool simulation of how the solar system COULD have been created"
3peoh2,Scout for the Mongol Hordes,"What if you played as a scout for a horde of Mongols. Before battles, gameplay would rely on stealth reconnaissance, granting bonuses and penalties depending on how well you did what you did (for example, maybe you could sabotage a some of their counter measures or if they catch you, they could reinforce their position). After that, you would be a part of an RTS battle, having to deal with the consequences of your actions. \n\nI think this could have a lot of potential given how many different cultures the Mongols faced historically, which would lead to a lot of enemy variety\n\nOther mechanics could include maintaining the herd of horses you own (Mongols always had a spare or five in case their current mount got tired) learning riding tricks, maybe even falconry and how that might aid reconnaissance.\n\nI think this has a lot of potential. I'd play it."
3peoa8,Board Game: Privelages,"Not sure which flair to give this post, so apologies.\nThe idea for this game is based on the fact that people constantly dream about what they would do if they won x amount of money. Basically it's a board game where each player is given a random set of cards or ""privileges"" at the start of the game. Each privilege has a set monetary value, but fall into different categories such as family, location, etc. The ultimate goal of the game would be to blow all of your money the fastest, aided by various misfortune cards that apply to cards of a specific category, or in general. However there are also good luck cards, which increase your overall net worth and wealth, thus taking you further from your goal.\n\nOf course this is just a broad, spur of the moment idea, any and all feedback is welcome!\n\nEdit: I word"
3pdk31,quick survey for my game,[deleted]
3pdel3,Pirate Game idea,The game idea I am thinking off is using the mechanic in assassins \ncreed black flag were you can customize your ship and do what you want with plunder and crew. But in the game Im thinking off you could go deeper in detail like adding more clothing a way way way bigger map and some real crew customization like level there stats by completing tasks or destryoing other ships. The ships themselves you could upgrade like better cannons and upgrade or fix broken things. The game should also be a mmo with safe waters aka safe zones and pvp areas. The map MUST be huge because you need to add a lot of islands and stuff like that. you could also purchase an island and create your own fort or home using the plunder you've acquired. Well that's my idea go ahead tell me your opinion :]   
3pd3pv,Home Alone the Video Game,"I was watching the two first movies and i had an idea for a game its pretty much in the style of XIII as a first person game where by day you build your traps and prepare for the night where by 9 o'clock the robbers start to break into the house, you must try and survive the night or have called the cops. So imagine they are breaking in through the basement you see in the corner the screen start to crack and tear seeing the robbers breaking in.\n\nMultiplayer could be added where you have 1-3 people playing the robbers and one playing the kid. \n\nLevels well the first level is of course the house of the first film the second is an abandoned building. More could be added.\n\nSo there's my idea, what do you guys think?"
3pczdz,Downhill Domination (Remake),"ok so the ps2 game downhill domination was a pretty fun game especially to play with friends, me and my best friend loved it back when we were kids, but then comes to we are no longer kids, 18 years old in fact and we both loved downhill domination except that now it was only available on ps2 and to find the game would be pretty much near impossible, so my idea is to have a remake done! considering the fact that developers can improve the game like adding certain features that we have today like adding in higher quality graphics, first-person view, a wide range of customizable gear and player, more intense maps, not saying it wasnt already, a load of online features! muiltiplayer, leaderboards, leveling up, private match to invite only ones who you want (friends), sticker creator (this could be brought to single player also) create a brand for yourself and others if they want to join it, create the sticker using the editor and add it to your player to show it off on your gear like shirt, bike etc. chose from a selection of celebrations if you win the race! hell you can even get silly with it by making mini games such as, tri cycle races, crazy carpet races etc. well thats quite about does it for my game idea, i hope i dont get sued for basically putting an idea on a website for a remake of their game, i hope the would understand that their game was dope and the beez neez bruh,, if you had time to read this thanks!! have a awesome day!! just wanted to try and get a all time favorite game back to life :)"
3pclr2,"A mix of First person building, open-world exploring, Civilization and Simcity","So the main idea is to make a town/city and rule the world. At the beginning by making a townhall or using one of the pre made designs and deploying it in the world. The world is infinite and contains lots of enemies and monsters. There are different types of builgins you can make, and you can design them yourself. Your town will become a kingdom and your kingdom will become an Empire. You can choose to walk first-person, but also view your kingdom from above with the ""city manager"". When you conquer more cities you can view your empire with the ""World view"". You can join your troops in battle with the first- person option but also watch the battle from above.\n\nI'm a total beginner but this is just my idea, I don't think this will ever be made but I just wanted to share my idea. \nPlease tell me what you think about it and what I could do better."
3pcjem,Maximum G-Force : Mobile game where you get points for extreme accelerations / rotations / speeds,"There will be separate highscores for accumulated acceleration, speed, rotations, distance traveled (GPS) and total sum of all. The mobile's camera is switched on during playing to record how the score is achieved. Optionally altitude changes could be included too.\n\nThe interesting part will be what players are going to do to achieve a high-score. (Throwing the mobile, putting it in the laundry, attaching it to a drone, taking the mobile to paragliding , putting it on a balloon with solar panel to recharge, attach it to the wheel of a car, .. )"
3pbemk,"Alien FPS with deep customization (Think ""Spore + Warframe"")","Here's the concept, you are an alien slave working on a human slave ship somewhere in the vast expanses of space. You don't know who you are or were you are (and it's a first-person POV camera so you can't see yourself). You somehow escape due to one of the guards screwing up and you get into an escape pod and leave the slave ship.\nInside the pod, you get to create your character, you choose a skin type (reptile, furry, scaly, etc.), choose what body type you'll have (bipedal, quadrupedal, etc.), you can add parts to your alien like ""predator"" dreadlocks or wings or four arms. Basically think of the Spore creature creator (if you know what I mean). This game will be more than just customizing your alien, you can now go on adventures throughout the galaxy with your character and help free more aliens. But I'll explain why I want the customization to be really well done.\n\nSo, to begin, the biggest thing I look for in video games is customization. The first hing i ever do is spend a good 40 minutes deciding what I'm gonna look like, then another ten minutes deciding what to wear, and another 10 minutes choosing my name (mainly because they're all taken). And throughout my life I wasn't amazed by any game more then I was amazed by Spore. In Spore, your customization possibilities are almost endless, and so is the fun you can have with them. \nMy next favorite title is a fairly recent one, I only started playing Warframe about a month ago and have also fallen in love with its amazing style.\n\nKeeping in mind the two titles above that remain my favorite, is there any way that someone could team up with me to create a cool game that incorporates the style, graphics and mechanics of Warframe into the build-a-bear customization of Spore? I would be in dept to whoever could help me pull that off (keeping in mind that I'm poor)."

3p96vi,"""Convoy"" A game about hydraulic erosion","I have an idea for a game where the gameplay comes from simulating hydraulic (water) erosion on a randomly (or not) generated terrain, similar to From Dust.\nThe player would have to use in game terraforming tools and place bridges, levees, vegetation (to hold back sediment) and rocks to build a road for a convoy of trucks to make it to a certain point on the map. When you run the simulation water from water sources or rain deform and erode the landscape and wash out parts of your road or swamp them with sediment. This causes trucks to fall off the road or get stuck. The more supplies and trucks that make it to the end, the more points you get. You can then use those points to buy better bridge materials, dams, essentially anything to help shore up river banks, coasts and your road. Or you could use those points to buy upgrades for your vehicles like mud tires, higher torque transmissions or wider wheel bases. There would of course be a sandbox mode."

3p5ynl,Marijuana Dispensary Tycoon,"I think this would be a great mobile game. Dispensaries (in Colorado at least) vary in scale and business style. The game would be great because there are so many variables to manage.\n\nThe player would need to find a source or grow their own plants. They would need to have a system of curing the plants. The player would then find the best way to sell/dispense the cannabis effectively and get good margins.\n\nThe fun would be the amount of control you have in your business style. In the growing process, you can choose strains and plant species (indica and sativa). You could have a large plants that take a long time to grow, or small plants that take a short time to grow. This would affect how you would sell and market your weed.\n\nThe curing process would be fun because it's a challenge. You have to time it right for the plant to be at its best quality and quantity.  You could trim it which would slow the process but increase bud quality. You could use some of the buds to make concentrates. And concentrates is just another whole layer to the gameplay. \n\nBecause with concentrates you have three types: Honey, wax, and shatter. And then there are different ways of creating the concentrates. Butane, alcohol, and I think one other way.\n\nAnd lastly, the process of selling would be based on how you did everything prior. The plants, the growing, the curing, the concentrates, everything! They would all affect how you sell you weed. You could even have a glass section in the shop. And hire glass blowers. The game would give the players a great sense of control of the business. The business they built would really feel personalized and it would feel like they really built the business ."
3p57h0,Taking Quake to the next level.,"So eons ago, when I was first playing Quake, I was shocked, nauseated, and utterly engrossed in the (limited) storyline of a race of robots that was using humans as fodder / CPUs for their grotesque army built out of the body parts of their victims merged with machinery against their will.  Since the original Quake, no game has ever managed to merge that concept of nightmarish horror that I experienced in the late 90's.  \n\nWhat if someone took that to the next level?  I mean, everything in gore really is a process of out-grossing (in both senses) the last guy.  What if someone did that with a Quake-like game?  \n\nI had a fleeting thought of a game where you're dealing with an Armageddon scenario where instead of zombies, the people are mechanations of their previous selves.  You run into your own family now automatons, and in the pentultimate scene, you are carried through the factory, much as they did in Quake, but this time you're seeing such horrors as the ""test systems"" where the machines want to make sure they have full control of your brain by making you rip your own family members, or even YOURSELF apart to build the robotic versions.  Imagine a scene where your body, while you're still fully conscious, rips YOUR OWN HEAD OFF, to place onto a robotic body.  \n\nJust a fleeting thought, but holy hell, I think that would have the same impact the original Quake did on me."
3p4yo0,A game where you win food.,"Think of it as a shooting game like COD. The premise is that to join a match and play, you need to spend real money on a slice of pizza through the game. Once you have bought one slice of pizza, you are then allowed to join a match with other people who have bought one slice of pizza. Now here's the fun part, everytime you kill someone, you steal their slice of pizza. And everytime you die, you lose 1 slice. The main purpose is to end up with 8 slices (a full pizza) which you can then have delivered to your home as it has already been paid for by everyone that bought a slice that you stole."
3p4co3,Sand Animation Game/Simulation for touch screens,"Sand animation is an amazing art. For those who don't know please watch this video : [Amazing Sand Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQaM_dsOY3M)\nI was wondering whether a game simulating millions of sand particles, not just the physics but also the lighting, could be made for touch screen devices. I am suspicious because it is very heavy on computation.  But if someone can come up with a believable simulation using heuristics and what not, it would be fantastic. I know there are lot of issues here one being input mechanisms."
3p4c62,A game where you exploit/abuse bugs to win,"A game centered around exploiting and abusing the game's mechanics.\n\nFor example, you need to bring an item from a shopkeep to a specific location, but you aren't allowed to take the item to the location.\n\nThe work around is to start walking to the location, but quickly open up the menu to acquire the item so it stays open while you walk.\n\nThe menu would only be designed to close if you *initiate* walking, and not if you're already walking."
3p44i0,A game about Gender,"Have A Gay Day is letting me make a game on mobile to teach people about the separation of gender and sex. And I still need to come up a prototype. I want to have the game teach the player about how it feels to have a gender that doesn't match with their sex.\n(Gender what people identify as. Sex is biological, what they were born as. EX: Hannah identifies as a woman, but was born a male. This would make her transgender, male to female or mtf. Transgender is not Transexual, not until she goes through with the surgery and hormonal changes.)\n\nThe General idea I have so far is the base of the story. The game will start out by asking the player what their sex is, male or female. After the selection, the player will proceed to play the game as the opposite sex. But the game will not tell you this directly. For example lets say you choose male. Then the game starts and you are a teenage girl in her room. The character you play as is a simple rectangle so you can't tell what the sex/gender. \n\nThe learning part comes from the environment. The room will be the typical stereotype based ""boy"" room. But as the player explores with the initial thought of being a male, the people around you begin to say and do things that eventually let you know that your character is female. And the player will be playing as a female (sex) but the player chose male (gender). I don't have much on what will happen as you progress, but that is what I need help with.\n\nI also need help with the core gameplay. Should it be a simple interactive story? Should it have multiple endings? Should it be like one of those games where you choose an action and it changes the story and characters? Or maybe it could even be a simple puzzle game with obstacles that are metaphors for obstacles that transgender people face? There are so many directions that this game could go."

3o7fwu,Undergrowth,"Ever since I've started playing the game Ark: Survival Evolved I had this idea of a game where a human has been shrunk down to an absolutely tiny size by alien technology. The Player then lives in the dark and wonderful undergrowth roamed by various insects. This game will feature multiple biomes such as grassland which is now a giant dense forest populated by ants, spiders, bees, dragonflies, various beetles, and even a giant scorpion. Another biome will be a lake filled biome filled with water insects like water scorpions, diving beetles, fishing spiders, small fish, and a small mini boss; A giant Yabby. The last biome will be a more desert like biome inhabited by insects like the tiger beetles, dragonflies, hawk wasps, ants, and even a mini boss; A giant Lizard. \nThis world will be very unforgiving with stats like hunger, health, Heat levels, cold levels,oxygen levels, speed, strength, and intelligence. There will also be different levels of insects and a simple levelling system similar to the one in Ark Survival Evolved. \nBuilding will be similar to rust building and there will also be tiers of saddles for insects with the highest tier having complete control over the insect in every way as well as places to attach weapons.\nBuilding will start in the simple dirtbrick house then to wood then to stone. There will be armour and clothing in the game as well with lower tier armour being stuff like grass or bark then the higher tiers will be things like exoskeleton from insects or metal/plastic plates \narmour. Weapons will include things like spears, bows, clubs, and even using spider silk as bolas as well as spider fangs as knifes. Tiers for arrow and spearheads will also be included. Another thing that will be included is different tiers of insects, such as for flying the lowest tier will be a bee while the highest will be either a dragonfly or a robber-fly, the lowest tier of predator will be an ant while the highest will be a scorpion, spider or a tiger beetle. This provides a good end game, mid game, and start game as only certain level players can ride certain insects. Blueprint system will be similar to ark with every level gained will grant you insect points which you can use to learn new blueprints as well as killing mini bosses to gain insect points. I hope this game is seen by someone as I really believe this could work as a game."

You get into a wind rage and destroy the shop and find out that the convenient store you were working for is owned by a huge mother company that owns several different branches of stores such as stores like (Walmart, Best Buy, etc.) You trash stores and the stores you trash get progressively bigger and bigger, the story ends when you trash the Headquarters.\n\nBasically, the games concept is based on this pick up and throw system. You can pick up stores items and throw them. \n\nWhat other features do you think I should implement. I''m thinking about adding an option to steal items."
3o4tub,VS FPS Deathmatch Game where you set Money and the Winner takes All,"Before the round starts, you can add money to the pot, just like poker. So does your opponent. Then, the winner will get the entire pot. \n\nVariations can be made for team-play and betting money on players. Betting would basically work like for horse racing."
3o4sc4,Illithid's Mannor,I've been playing a lot of dwarf fortress lately. I was thinking it would be fun to build a mod where you manage a civilization of illithids(mind flayers) instead of dwarves. You would start and migrate to caverns instead of the surface. Manual labor would be unpleasant for your citizens so creatures in your cavern would be mind controlled into slavery. They would do a majority of the crafting and digging. The mind control system could mirror the dwarves' animal training system. New plants could be brew to boost new psychic warfare methods. \n\n\nWith some study I could probably do this myself. I'm unsure how to aquire the primary code for dwarf fortress. If someone could point me in the right direction I might be able to do something with it but I probably won't have time.
3o33vx,Im pretty sure this is a great idea ?,"Well i have been thinking wouldnt it be cool if there was a game were u start of in a small spaceship in a randomly generated solar system with a sun and planets that are randomly selected and customized. \n\nThese planets would invole inhabitable ones, uninhabitable one such as gas giants and ect. \n\nThen you would be able to fly around with limited food,water and air and try find a planet you want to land on. If you landed on a planet similur to earth (these planats could be in diferent stages of evolution) you could start playing with micanics from ARK Survival Evolved, Minecraft and gta depending on which stages of evolution its in. You would also be able to refuel your space ship (or salvage it) and head of to collect resourses from other planets. If this had a multiplayer there could be servers that you could play on ( a server would be a solar system ).\n\nNow im going to list some features i would add...\n\n1. Taming creatures from all of evolution.\n2. Befriend tribes of humans.\n3. Meet aliens.\n4. Full choice of what u can do.\n5. Science.\n6. Unlock/learn how to make new things.\n7. Build advanced structures and machines.\n8. Tides and wind.\n9. Harvest reasourses from other planets.\n10. An end game thing could be inventing faster then light travel so you can go to an other solar systems aka: a friends solar system.\n11. Black holes that could lead to a different solar system or same solar system but different time period. This could be a easy way to skip a section of evolution. If you get what i mean.\n12. The sun in your solar system would die eventually. You would die if you stayed but you would be able to travel to other solar systems and bring stuff with you so that everthing isnt destroyed and you can carry on :-)\n\nAnd thos were just some things that i thought of.\n\nAnd dont bother saying in the comments that my idea is to big and to think small, I know its to big but yolo.\n\nComments/feedback would be helpfull.\n\nBy the way dont try to copy this idea I will find out!!!\n\nLeoStudios111@gmail.com\nThanks"
3o29ge,Idea I had while watching San Andreas,"So tonight I was watching San Andreas, the new apocalypse type movie, and it dawned on me. Why has there never been an apocalypse survival game where it wasn't zombies, but natural disaster. Imagine a large map that is open world. The game starts with say 64 players in this large city/country/forest varying landscape. There are AI civilians and police and first responders that try to do what they can but ultimately it doesn't help much. The best loot in terms of weapons and gear are in the city but the city is the most dangerous place to be. Once the game starts the different natural disasters start to get more and more disastrous. Perhaps it starts out with just a small earthquake that breaks some glass and maybe knocks stuff off the shelves. But as time goes on the earthquakes get more violent and buildings collapse, much like battlefield levolution style, and you have to try to survive til the end all while fighting off looters, other players who only look to take your loot, vehicles, buildings collapsing, faults opening, and maybe even a tsunami. Just an idea. If that was a game, I would definitely play the hell out of it."

3o0hcn,Physics based backpack inventory system.,"When player preses I to open inventory - the character gets his backpack off his shoulders, puts it on the ground, and opens it. Objects that player wants to carry will be put into this backpack physically - their real size. This will require some good collision detection between objects, but that has already been done before so it shouldnt be a big problem. After player closes backpack, puts it onto his back - the objects would freeze their position relative to the backpack and each other so no more computational resources would be needed when its not open. I havent seen this system done in any game yet - I think this system would be ideal for some survival games. "

3nvxfe,"Vehicle-Based, Combat Programming Game","**Graphics**: 2D, Top Down.\n\n**Audio:** Pew Pew? Probably doesn't *need* any.\n\n**Game-play:** Write code for vehicles that compete in single or team based combat.\n\n**Language:** Javascript seems fairly popular at the moment for this genre. If the game were to run in a browser, javascript would probably be best. If the game was not to run in a browser, perhaps, c#, python or c++ could be used.\n\n**Quick Summary:** Like Robot War https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotWar and RoboCode http://robocode.sourceforge.net/ but with the ability to customise vehicles for specific roles.\n\n**Vehicles:** \n\nVehicles may be customised to meet the needs of the situation. Vehicles should be viewed as a collection of components such that the creator selects hull/chassis, tracks/wheels, turret, engine, power generator, weapon etc...\n\nEach component should have different values for its attributes. For instance, a small hull would have lower weight, health and component slots than a large hull. Wheels are faster than tracks, but have lower health. A small, tank hull may only be able to fit a small turret, but a large could fit a small, medium or large turret.\n\nA key component group would be sensor packages. Sensors should come in both active and passive varieties. Sensor packages should have variable detection arcs and differing ranges. The energy required to scan an area with a sensor is proportional to the area bounded by the detection arc and the range. Passive sensors, such as proximity detectors have much lower ranges, but require less energy to use and would only trigger event functions when they detect something. Some varieties of sensors, or certain slots, should allow the creator to rotate the sensor unit.\n\nSensors should come in different flavours such as visual, radar, and heat sensors. This would allow for confusion tactics and fog of war. For example, chaff would affect heat and radar sensors, whilst smoke would affect visual and heat sensors.\n\nEngines are used to produce electricity and movement. The amount of electricity generated is determined by the creator's code with minimum and maximum bounds  determined by the variety of generator installed. Remaining engine power is used for movement functions. Any engine power converted to electricity, that is not used, is lost. Conversely, any engine power reserved for movement, that is not used, is lost.\n\nWeapons have differing range, damage and rate of fire attributes.\n\nRadio communication components should have differing range, output arcs, power consumption and transmission rates.\n\n**Scenarios:** Scenarios could vary from straight up tank battles with 1-many tanks, defend/assault an area, resupply, move troops, ambush etc...\n\n**Flexibility:** \n\nVehicle customisation should be flexible enough to allow for cargo trucks that carry troops/fuel/ammunition to points or other vehicles, scout vehicles with high speed and great communication equipment, and heavy tanks that are used to assault the enemy from long ranges.\n\nSome attributes should be configurable by the creator's vehicle code. For instance, where a component can draw power, it should have a minimum and maximum value, with the specific value being set by the vehicle's software. Differing values of such attributes should modify the outputs of the component. For instance, an active radar array with a higher power setting would have a higher range.\n\nSome game modes could simulate fuel and ammo usage.\n\n**Playing Field:** The playing field should be fairly large to allow for effective scouting, flanking and sniping. The size of the playing field would necessarily vary based on the scenario\n\n**Multiplayer:** Teams of vehicles can be pitted against each other in order to rank the code. Components will be given a point value that is summed to yield a vehicle's production cost. Vehicles will be assigned to classes based on their production cost. Teams will have a maximum team production cost that may be divided amongst however many vehicles.\n\nPerhaps multiple teams could be further joined together in order to allow cooperative completion of tasks or combat. They would be joined into something like a squad, platoon, company hierarchy.\n"
3nvv8s,Simulation game engine,"This must surely exist already, but where?\n\nThing is, simulation games have a lot in common, like agents, resources, buildings... Surely it would be possible to create an engine which provides the basic building blocks, like agent behaviour and path finding, resource rules, building hierarchies. Then you can ""mod"" the engine to make your own game out of it, apply textures, stories, quests, rules for points and win/lose states.\n\nOr maybe such an engine would be too basic, I don't know."

3nqbda,A game about scrying in the 13th century...,"Going to keep this short and sweet. Had a dream last night that gave me an idea for what would probably be a cool game.\n\nYou're a witch/sorcerer in the 13th century (England, France, etc.) and you advise a king/queen. The entire game is you having to read the signs and try to predict events accurately so that you're not executed. The more you get right, the more you're rewarded.\n\nThe process of ""divining the signs"" is basically solving a bunch of puzzles to make a picture or a series of text unblurry and/or unpixelated. The more of it you can read or see, the better you can advise your liege on future events."
3nlvf0,Would you play this? Idea I'm currently working on.,"A starbase has travelled for over 200 years with you in cryosleep. Your job is to help the base set up a wormhole in the delphi quadrant. When you awake you find the other 3 pilots are dead due to an alien attack.   \n  You must guard the starbase while the wormhole comes online for 6 hours of real time. During this time aliens will attack in waves.    \n You collect materials from alien ships and asteroids, use them to craft new weapons, repair the starbase, and build drones that help you fight the incoming waves. No levels, no bosses, just a 6 hour guantlet of schmup/tower defense style gameplay. Saving exits the game, you may continue, but doing so kills the save file."
3nllqc,BoomStick - a brutal 2D platforming shooter,"**BoomStick is brutal 2D shooter** I've been working on a few months. In it, you play a tiny imp trapped in a hellish dungeon killing a variety of enemies. When an enemy dies, they leave behind a corpse that can be exploded for gory bits to heal with or thrown in the lava pit as a sacrifice. \n\n**Sacrificing**\n\nSacrificed enemies will generate a item drop at the top platform. Sacrificing more enemies will increase the size and reward of the box.  Destroying the item box will drop a new gun, power up or spawn the ghost. Larger boxes have a higher risk of summoning a ghost. \n\n**Ghosts**\n\nRegular enemies like the bats, spiders and slimes spawn throughout the game, and are relatively easy to dispatch if you aren't over run and are careful. Ghosts are far more difficult. They grow in size the longer they exist. They have large health pools, and can move through platforms. When a ghost is summoned there is a huge scream and all the enemies on screen explode into gory bits which can be used to heal yourself. Enemies won't spawn while a ghost is on screen. Killing a ghost and eating it's bits will give a permanent boost to the player. \n\n**Power Ups**\n\nPower ups are similar to the ones in other arcade games, but in a side scrolling manner. You have orbiting shields like the turtle shells from Mario Kart. You have butcher mode that is like the star from Mario. You also have familiars that fire along side you like in SHMUPS.\n\n**What's Left**\n\nThe gameplay and enemies is all worked out, but I can't pin down a game flow for it. \n\nWith a good game you have a flow. There is a natural pace to the gameplay. I've tried enemy waves and even a round system, but none of them really fit. When I just throw the player in the game and spawn enemies it is really jarring. However, I don't think this sort of game requires a tutorial or levels. Any ideas?"

You can marry, have kids (you can get them to school etc) \nYou can choose whatever career you want (like doctor/policeman/lawyer etc) and you always can take a course to study more for your career. (Of course you have to sleep, eat, etc) you can also walk in the city and go to supermarket and just buy food and clothes just like you do in real life.\nAnd you can also have cars and pets. I know that maybe if this game would ever be developed it would be too expensive to be made but i just want some opinions. :)"

3lqdk2,(Fragment) FPS Pre-Death Mechanic,"I've been playing a lot of Guild Wars 2 lately, and I recently watched one of the [Squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_eOj-_7PLM) pre-alpha build videos, and it gave me an idea. \n\nWe know that in actual combat sometimes when people are shot they don't immediately die, but they know there's no point in trying to save them. I was thinking that players in FPS games with realistic hit modeling could also involve realistic health modeling. Take several shots in the arm? You're not dead, but you're bleeding out and you only have one arm to shoot back with. Catch several frags in the chest? You're bleeding, perhaps fatally, but while you may not want to move you can still keep shooting.\n\nThe mechanic I had in mind was that players had health pools that go from 100 to 0, but also a hidden or semi-hidden 'life' pool that drops from 100 to -100 and perhaps only appears when the player drops below 0. When a player is shot, a hidden value from where they were shot and how the bullet models damage to them also drops their life pool. Medical attention repairs both health and life, but while medical attention can restore health to 100, if life drops to a point where it's permanently below 0, that character is considered critically wounded and either needs immediate medevac or to accept the fact that they're going to die.\n\nNow then, this sets up a lot of really excellent situations - the wounded soldier, holding the line for his friends, the officers, calling for immediate medevac on a position to save their troops, and all the tropes of combat wounds that come into play. I would think someone below 0 'life' would also act critically wounded - very slow movement, perhaps only using one hand to shoot, short grenade distance, maybe sitting in one place slows the bleedout and movement increases it.\n\nThis system would still allow for instant critical hits to head and heart, but it would also fix the common complaint of FPSs that a character can suck down dozens of bullets, but as long as they have a nearby medic they get right back up again. In this a medic is meant to prevent death, not fix it. Anyway, let me know what you think and if you decide to use this!"
3lq6wj,A MOBA with the combat system of a fighting game.,I was thinking that it would be cool if there were a game that had all the basic components of a MOBA but used the combat system of fighting games to make the combat more strategic and less sheer button mashing. I'm sure it probably sounds insane but I think it would be a great way to add a new dynamic to both genres.
3lq6u3,"First person horror-esque Time traveler RPG: ""One Mil""","One Mil\n\nWhat is it: Horror game\n\nGoal: Make one million in just one day\n\nTwist: you can time travel\n\nHow the game works: \n\n\nThe game starts off with the beginning of a brand new day. You wake up and then are given free rein to go about the city with the only times it becomes non-user controlled is if you don’t get to a bus-stop or subway station or something else that will lead you home then it automatically makes you walk towards the closest one.\n\n\nWhen you are home instead of sleeping you go into the side room you didn’t see before (maybe it is disguised as a bathroom) and you see your time machine, it’s hooked up to a small laptop that you get to control. \nBased on what you were close to, what you did on the first day, you get a huge array of options for how you might want to change your day in ways that might be beneficial to getting the one mil. You select the options you want to use and press go on the time machine.\n\n\nNow you start a “brand new day” but the only difference being that you must insure you leave the house after your first playthough person leaves, so it’s slightly later in the day. \n\n\nOn this play-through the choices for changing your day become your objectives and the day doesn’t officially end until you complete all of them. In between your objectives and getting home you can again do whatever you want to do explore where you want to explore then you have to come home again. \n\n\nIt works like this for a couple more playthroughs until the first time you encounter “yourself”. When this happens and you previous self sees you your body explodes because you basically ripped a hole in the universe. Don’t let your previous selfs see you – you can see them that’s fine, but if they see you, you die. (This becomes kind of like a horror mechanic later in the game).\n\n\nThe next game mechanic gets introduced about half-way through. The government is after you, trying to kill you. They have become aware that you are time traveling and they need to make a stop to it. They will try and kill you or any of your past “you”s. If they kill a past you, present you dies too, so you need to save your past yous. You will have the ability to know where the previous one they are targeting is and without being seen by previous you, you need to deflect bullets or whatever else necessary to save yourself.\n\n\nLast mechanic you might not run into at all, but basically if you almost die, (except on the very  First round) like by being hit by a car or bus, a “weird coincidence” will happen. That weird coincidence was future you saving present you by stopping the car or bus somehow. \n\n\nGame continues until you either run out of time (lose) – remember you must keep starting at your apartment later and later, or get one million bucks (win)\n\n\n\nEdit: This is my first game idea, I plan on creating more in the future, so any criticism/praise is very helpful. \n\nThanks for reading!"
3lq337,Create a country game,"Somebody should create a game about starting/building your own country. You would start off as third world country and progress.

You can decide what language your people speak and see what percent of each race is in your country and whether you want them there. What kind of economy you are (Traditional, Mixed, Command, Etc.). You'll decide what to produce. Basically the idea is to have build up your own country decide how to manage your people good or bad. Decide if you go to war or stay neutral. Decide how to solve debt or stop debt from occurring. See what to try to focus on and create. What new technology and weapons you can try to create. You should be able to control every once of your government and your country. Every chose you have should have a reaction to your country and some choices should effect your allies.

Towers are fortresses with the enemy base being a huge castle full of treasure.\n\nIn short; Smite with boat physics like Black Flag."
3lnutm,Tap That Vinyl,"Title: Tap That Vinyl\n\nPlatform: Android/iOS\n\nGenre: Casual\n\n\nTap That Vinyl is a casual rhythm game where the player can select a song and hit a series of “notes” according to the beat. The game mechanic would be similar to Guitar Hero or Audiosurf.\n\n[Concept gif](http://i.imgur.com/JYM55Pi.gif)\n\nThe game would require access to the phone music library. Once a song has been loaded the game will generate the circles seen in the gif according to the song [audio properties](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/14642/how-do-audio-based-games-such-as-audiosurf-and-beat-hazard-work). The circles would be generated on the 4 sides of the screen with the player having to tap each circle once they reach the middle/red-zone of the vinyl. Whenever the player would miss tapping a circle there would be a [sharp sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOY8pXNu-ew) effect indicating the failure.\n\nThere could be 3 difficulties influencing the speed at which the circles are generated: easy, medium, expert. There could be a score where each successfully taped circle gives 10 points, however it would be much better if there would be a 100/100 (%) instead of score points.\n\nThere could also be circles when you need to hold the tap and not release it for e certain time, for example when there’s a long guitar part.\n\nLink to my [original post](https://ailailou.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/tap-that-vinyl/).\n"
3lnsf6,museum creator,the idea is fairly basic. One can create a museum and fully customise all the exhibits so you can change the models (maybe using some kind of 3d maker???) also signs and all the touch screens(i was thinking maybe some embedded you tube player would be a nice feature) . the idea of this game is so you can create a museum about whatever you want and also could be used as a tool for learning about stuff that you probably wouldn't find at a museum. there would also be a visitor mode so people can go around all sorts of museums talk and rate the museum. feedback appreciated!

3lfwdm,Superbase,"Manage a superhero base through multiple generations, in a manner somewhere between Game Dev Tycoon and Fallout Shelter. \n\nEach 'Stage' keeps the same layout for the Base, but changes the aesthetic and unlocks new upgrades.\n\nStage 1: Golden Age\n\nDuring the Golden Age, your randomly generated team of superheroes (whom you can rename and recostume in a simple costume creator, as in costume, face, power type as your 3 options) hang out in a Basement.\nThis also acts as the tutorial, where you need to send superheroes to listen to police radio transponders, do the paperwork for the 'club', send them out to fight crime, ensure the supply of pizza is continued, or morale drops.\n\nIf morale goes below 20%, your superheroes start fighting each other and there's an increased risk of them leaving the base forever.\n\nYou use morale to command heroes to do actions, and actions give a reward of morale.\n\nStage 2: Silver Age\n\nYour heroes get recognised by the poltiical leaders of the world, and now can move to an expansive HQ. From here, they can now actively create a Training Room. This leads to being able to expand the skills of existing members of the team, but also decreases morale more greatly than other actions. \n\nAs before, lose enough morale, and the hero will quit.\n\nDuring the Silver Age, direct attacks from villains will start. They will infiltrate the base in invisibility fields and disguises and random events (i.e. ""an attractive man who bears the same initials as a prolific supervillainess has requested an interview with XHERONAME"", will you let them in?)\n\nYou ought to be able to station heroes around your base to defend against these attacks.\n\nStage 3: Space Age\n\nYour heroes have become the planet's primary protectors, and with that they have been given the satelite station ELIPSIS as their base of operations.\n\nIn the space stage, all external missions take longer. In addition, some street-level missions become unavailable.\n\nOnce you're in space, there's an increased chance of being abducted by aliens whilst doing any action. This means that action fails (morale expenditure is not redeemed), but it also means you have a 50% chance of recieving an Alien Items.\n\nAlien Items are costumes that give extra effects whilst on missions, maybe.\n\nMaybe each power type contributes differently to certain kinds of actions too, so you feel the need to have a balanced team of multiple kinds of hero, rather than 20 Batman-expies and 1 Wonder Woman."
3lf6av,Under this man's sky...,Roguelike Android game where you fly a spaceship around to explore randomly generated planets like in No Man's Sky.

Sprite monsters with random palette shifts to change their types.  
3latan,A thriller/horror game.,"So the game has to be first person, in order for this to work it has to be very immersive. You start in a kitchen of a home, doing some idle chores. You are tasked with some simple stuff just to get used to the controls, a tutorial pretty much. Picking up food and returning it, answering the phone. A short call from a telemarketer to introduce the dialog system. Just some simple interaction stuff.\n\nAfter this is complete you hear the front door opening and your wife returning home. You go and talk with her and a short conversation ensues before she tells you that she's tired and is going to take a bath. Now your told to go and watch TV, you go to the couch, sit down and switch on the TV. After a few seconds your vision starts to blur and the protagonist complains of a headache. Now your objective is to go back into the kitchen to retrieve some tablets, on your way back you begin to stumble and fall (like feeling lightheaded and dizzy) and eventually you pass out... You awake to lying on the couch with your wife sitting next to you comforting you. ""What happened?"" you ask. She explains that she found you on the floor passed out. After explaining that the last thing you remember is having a headache and taking medication for it, you begin to notice the ceiling behind her moving and bending, the walls are tearing away to reveal what appears to be a padded room, her face becomes distorted and her voice slurs as she asks you ""what's wrong"". You begin to feel yourself drifting away, your eyes open and close and each time everything seems further and further away, then your eyes close. \n\nYou awaken again in a padded room. You sit up, then stand up and are back in control of the player after a few minutes someone comes to the door and opens up a small latch and says ""it's time for therapy"". You immediately question where you are and where your wife is, what is this place etc. To which the man replies ""ahh not this again"". He calls for others and they open the door and rush you, holding you down and injecting you with a sedative. \n\nYou regain consciousness strapped to a chair in a small room, there's a table in front of you with an empty chair the other side, one light dangles from the ceiling, only just illuminating the table. It's almost like an interrogation room. A man walks in wearing a white coat, and sits down. He opens his folder and begins to scan through before saying ""Ahh yes, Patient C. I've been told you were fantasizing about that imaginary wife of yours again, and here I was thinking we had made so much progress with you"". \n\n\nSo my ideal dialog system would be that of games like, fallout or skyrim where you are given choices from which you can reply. I won't sit here and write the whole conversation between the protagonist and the ""Therapist"" (which I've already scripted). But to give you an idea, the conversation will be about you questioning where you are, etc. And the therapist explaining that after a year of progress you've fallen back into these fantasies. The choice as the player will be to believe it or not. The idea of the game is to keep the player guessing about what is real and what's only just an illusion or fantasy. Throughout the game you will find documents and files and if read, they will give you some insight as to what could be going on. \n\nIn the interest of time, I'll fast forward and talk about an objective you will come across. So throughout the game you'll be exploring the mental institution (There'll be open areas you are free to walk and restricted areas that, being caught in them will result in being returned to your room) you'll meet other patients and guards etc. At one point one of the patients tells you ""they're all lying, we're not who they say we are. They call us by letters because they're afraid if we know our true names we will remember who we truly are"". He then tasks you with breaking into an office to recover documents that would either prove or disprove what he's saying. Bare in mind some of these people you meet could be completely insane. You're not told which room the file is in, so depending on your own choice, you will get the right or wrong answer or just something completely insignificant. Most of the objectives in the game will be open and do not have to be completed, but could help you further into the game. \n\n\nA few times when you are required to return to your room and sleep, you will flash back to the house with your wife, but things will be inconspicuously different each time. Causing more confusion, if the player picks up on them. \n\nI have written down countless dialog's of conversations, objectives, possible plot lines, twists and multiple endings. Even some game play mechanics I feel would better immerse the player into the game. \n\nIf anyone wants to hear more, or has any ideas/suggestions or straight up questions. Let me know.\n"
3l9bw6,70's Vietnam War,"* Born To Kill\n\n* Concept:\n\nThe premise of the game is a first person shooter that evolves around a freelance mercenary whom can be directed to support either the invading capitalist forces, the vietnamese communist forces or a third force which could consist of anything of your own design. \n\n* Plot:\n\nYou are a Vietnamese soldier that went MIA fighting and returns to the war with amnesia. Fight a campaign by which the main character interacts with members of the capitalist or communist forces and help that side to conduct their activities within Vietnam.\n\n* Setting: \n\nThe game map is huge spanning over mountainous terrain, deep jungle, open fields and even cityscape. The game environment is almost completely destructible and is supported by dynamic weather systems. Throughout this environment lay many villages, towns and some cities all of which are divided by terrain and allegiances with active front lines and green zones. Each of these locations can be attacked, managed and defended in whatever way that the player chooses. Trade can be conducted with the locals and members can be recruited to your party from these towns and villages much like the system in mount and blade: warband.  \n\n* Gameplay Mechanics\n\nCombat, whilst not as hyperrealistic as 'squad' or the Arma series exists in a fun medium that sits between Battlefield and the previously mentioned games. The way that you decide to attack can be differed greatly:\n- Attack head on after a supporting artillery barrage from a recently adopted village \n\n- Dig trenches along the frontlines and grind away at defences\n\n- Construct a network of tunnels and conduct a guerilla assault before disappearing\n- Or coordinate a sniper ambush on the enemy. \n\nHowever, other mechanics can come into play. PTSD can affect experienced soldiers who are lone survivors of assaults and if you are too risky with your men's lives you may struggle to recruit more and may even experience mutiny against you. \n\n* Standout Features\n\n- Completely destructible environment including fire, flood and water mechanics \n- Troop management capabilities whilst also being able to be present\n- Your character is not a superman and AI is adaptable\n- Each of the factions fights differently (US utilise heavy support such as vehicles, Communists might utilise more Guerilla tactics)\n- Being able to construct defences such as trenches, punji spikes, mines and machine gun nests\n- Aforementioned PTSD mechanics that limit control of troops and make you consider the welfare of your men\n\n* Platforms\n\nConsole and most notably PC\n\n* If you like it give an upvote, if not pls leave contructive criticism below, also was unsure about the start of the plot however, pls leave ideas below\n\nThanks,\n\ntl:dr\nOpen world Vietnam war shooter somewhere between farcry, battlefield and mount and blade.\n \n"

3naoss,"Final Fantasy 6,7,8 Mashup.... as an RTS","So I literally had this idea just this morning as I was thinking about the FF7 Remake. It is still very very rough\n\n**Name:** \n\n* No idea, Im terrible at naming things.\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* An RTS with the various factions from Final Fantasy 6, 7 and 8. You would have normal multiple building and unit based factions - Shinra Corporation (FF7), The Ghestahlian Empire (FF6), Edea and the Galbadian Nation (FF8); Unit only factions - The Returners (FF6)/AVALANCHE (FF7)/Resistance (FF8); Single Building multiple unit factions - Balamb Garden (FF8), Trabia Garden (FF8), Galbadia Garden (FF8); And 1 low-count powerful unit faction - Espers/Guardians/Materia/Whatever you want to call them (All FF games). \n\n**Plot:**\n\n* No definite plot at this time.\n\n**Setting:**\n\n* Whichever Midgard you feel is necessary\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* All FF Characters as potential units or as one time use 'summons' or 'abilities' (Think Nukes in Star Craft).\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Normal RTS mechanics. \n\n* Normal multiple building and unit based factions would play like normal RTS armies. Building and unit management a la generic RTS mechanics. Possible hero generation\n\n* Unit only factions might have to recruit, subvert or otherwise generate their army. Slightly stronger than normal units from building based factions to keep it balanced.\n\n* Single Building multiple unit factions would have a single mobile base of operations that would generate all units. Single base would have a high HP amount but can only be repaired slowly.\n\n* Low-count but powerful unit factions would only have a handful of units with specialized abilities that would need to support eachother and potentially combo off of each other if used correctly.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Its Final Fantasy.\n\n* Multiple army types  with wildly varied gameplay(not just the normal 3 armies with different skins and slight variations of power in a rock paper scissors strata)\n\n* Its Final Fantasy\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC. I havent yet met the RTS that works well on a Console..... maybe the Steam Box\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* No idea"
3n9e4j,a dystopian future game set in a bleak 2050 on a dying earth,"in the game you will be playing as a refugee of a military occupied usa and will start off in a dry barren mexico in mexico you will start off doing petty crimes and then build up to earning a couple thousand under your belt this will only serve as a forced story tutorial and the rest of the game will be open world .you will travel across the world anywhere slowly as you progress you will unlock more locations building up your army until you travel back to the us and take it back. the game will have realistic systems like food and water consumption in the game you could also die of heat stroe hypothermia or even malaria. each place you go will have a differnt crisis. india would have a crime problem ,china would have an economic drop due to population drop, australia will have a drought, south and north korea would be at war, radiation will fill the air of japan, europe will have a refugee crisis, government control will be horrible in russia ,africa's current problems will be worse, the uk would be in quarantine due to a pandemic and looting would be rampant, the middle east will be in a raging war, south east asia will be ravaged by a neuro disease which shuts down the body killing instantly and indonesia and malaysia will be at war due to population growth. the game would be quite hard to make but the idea is quite cool and might catch on if made fun and very long winded.(no one likes a sort repetitive game). a prequel about being inside the us army in the invasion would be cool but you would have to expand on it to catch on like the fist idea. "
3n8p2v,Intermediate 2D CO-OP 'racing' game,"The idea is that 4 players are in a car, each with a specific job. \nDriver\nGunner\nLookout\nEngineer\n\nThe perspective would be a top down 2D game, where each players' screen is centered around the car, against A.I. enemies.\nNow, I already thought up some details for the roles.\nThe driver just drives, nothing special, except at pretty fast speeds to make it interesting for him/her. The driver is also the only one who can see the amount of gas left.\n\nThe Gunner can use 3 different mounted weapons. The standard is the Mounted machinegun, which penetrates armor averagely and the damage is pretty low, but fast RoF. This weapon, being the standard, has infinite ammo, but needs to be reloaded after 75 rounds. Reload would take 15s, and a small key press event(KPE) would happen to speed it up(-1 sec for every correct key?). Another weapon would be a sniper rifle, which won't deal damage to enemy vehicles, but you can kill the enemy driver, gunner etc with it. This one would not have any ammo at all.(more on that at the engineer part.) The last weapon would be a Javalin launcher. The only explosive weapon availible for the players. It will destroy most vehicels unless they have special armor, and deals splash damage. This one also does not have any ammo at the start.\n\nThe Lookout is the only role which can move the camera. I was thinking about thrice the radius of the normal centered view. The lookout is a leader type guy who also navigates, meaning he can spot enemies early(and mark them using an ability or so). He is also the only one who can look at the map of the area(I was thinking to not put an icon on the player location, and let the navigator figure out the location using landmarks). lastly he can use an ability to point out weakspots to the gunner. This will put small pulsating red dots on the enemy vehicle, which will deal 2x or 3x damage when hit(the spot are assigned randomly and only work with the ability active) The gunner is the only one who can see the ammo for the sniper and javalin. \n\nThe engineer is last on the list. He can use abilities to buff the armor, guns or engine of the car to 2x normal power for 10 seconds. Buffing something requires 15s , again -1s for each correct key hit, as in a KPE. \nNow these buffs aren't the only thing the engineer does. The engineer is also the only one who can see the health of the car, and repair it when neccesary(the driver needs to slow down or stop depending on the damage done.) Same here where it would take x sec of time, and a KPE pops up. \nLastly, the engineer needs to help the gunner by creating ammo on the spot. This would take a certain amount of time, reduced by KPE and then it would create one sniper bullet or javalin missile, depending on ammo selected. However, before this ammo can be fired, the engineer needs to set up the correct mounted weapon. which takes a little time, and makes the gunner unable to fire. So the engineers job is all about correct timing, doing what is needed at the right time - be it buffing the engines because a slow enemy will have trouble chasing you, or a boss enemy is visiting and you are in rapid need of javalin missiles to blow him up.\n\nI think this would be a pretty neat CO-OP game with lots of mayhem(especially when there are lots of enemies) It needs to be hard enough to require proper teamwork to survive the levels or hoard mode. And an online deathmatch would probably work aswell. \n\nAnything which you dislike about the idea can be removed or replaced, feel free to use the examples I gave, and if you do create it I would love to test it and see the developement progress.\n\n\n"
3n8llh,The gun that doesn't want to kill,"To preface, this is a game I want to make, but with little, meaning zero, experience in game development and no idea where to start, I understand it's likely to never become a reality, and as depressing as that sounds I'd much rather write then develop, though one day I do hope to write for games, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe initial idea was a gun that didn't want to kill, and it bloomed from there.\n\nThe game starts on a sort of old power point esque type of scene, you know, the kind of the thing you see at the fallout 3 start screen? These ""panels"" tell the story of a group of scientists who were, years ago, intent on developing a weapon that had true artificial intelligence, to give useful intel and combat support in the middle of a fire fight. They succeeded in both creating the AI, and installing it into a simple gun, naming it P.A.G. (Personal Assistant Gun). However, Pags personality proved to be difficult. \n\nHe didn't want to kill. This weapon intended to murder and take lives on a battlefield was making a choice, or trying to at least. Despite being installed into a gun, and having access to several powerful sensors and other neat features, he has no control over his actual functionality as a gun, so he could not stop himself from firing when his trigger was pulled.\n\nThis made him very angry, and he would constantly, and very vocally protest to all his tests, even screaming at his creators to stop forcing him to be a weapon. It was decided that even though they could mute Pag, there was no use in a weapon that didn't want to kill, and would most likely be more detrimental then a help to anyone on an actual battlefield. \n\nFast forward some odd years, and our silent protagonist steps in, being assigned to guard duty at a well known research base. During his first night they are, of course, attacked. The enemy catches the base off guard, storming in, killing many scientists and soldiers alike. Our protagonist wakes up after being knocked out cold from a near by explosions, looking up to see soldiers passing over him, and many other corpses, putting a bullet in any head that moved. The protagonist, with a whole lot of luck is able to stay still, and avoid being killed then and there. \n\nHe makes his way through the now mostly destroyed facility, and finds himself inside an old research wing. Here he finds himself a gun, but it is an odd one, with strange lights, and it's plugged into a wall. He's never seen anything like it, but he picks it up and plans his escape. \n\nWhile moving down a corridor he's spotted by enemy combatants, and is forced to shoot and kill them both (there are 2), but upon firing at the first, the gun springs to life, and cries out, confused and jolted. At first it sounds terrified, afraid, and then asks if the it's wielder just killed some body, then goes through an almost traumatic seeming moment of ""oh no"", as if it's in some sort of disbelief. \n\nAs the game progresses many more enemies confront our silent killer, the player being forced to either kill them, or die. All the while the gun is screaming, yelling, and even at times begging you to stop, to put him down so he doesn't have to kill again.\n\nDuring the down times, to quiet points, he talks to you, he tells you what it's like to be an intelligent being shoved into something he hates so much, how he wishes only to help, not take lives, and one day he even dreams of becoming a flare gun, so that he can save people rather then kill them. Though, over time the gun realizes you won't stop killing, that you'll do anything to survive, and begins to criticize you more harshly, saying things like ""You know those people had families, mother, fathers, spouses waiting for them. They'll never see them alive again because of you.""\n\nAt the start Pag is confused, and tries to convince you to stop killing, that you can just sneak by, or even run, but as the game progresses he comes to hate you, to understand that you don't care what he thinks, that you'll use his body however you see fit, and his hopeful determination to stop you becomes a simpering, dark hatred towards the protagonist. \n\nTruth is this is a little dumbed down, and I don't really know how the ending would go. Though, I think it would be fun to find out."
3n8jdv,Environmental game idea,"For a class I have to do a service project and the teacher recommends promoting an issue that you feel is important such as design a webpage for a food shelter ect. I had an idea to make a game that promotes environmentalism, protecting and saving the planet. I'm kinda blanked when it comes to specific ideas so any input would be appreciated."
3n6kl0,A new take on strategy games. (The Sheltered Dictator),"Okay, so this game is very similar to any of the countless strategy and [4X games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) on the market. You run an empire/kingdom/nation/guild/whatever and your overall goal is to ""explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate.""\n\nWhat makes this game unique is the way you **issue orders** to your agents and troops.\n\n* You cannot control any character directly, except for the leader.\n* The entire game takes place in your palace.\n* You govern and issue orders via a chain of command.\n* These orders may succeed or fail to varying degrees, based on your skills as an administrator, the skills and integrity of your agents, and external conditions such as enemy strength and environmental hazards.\n\nIt's like [Age of Empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires) meets a [game of telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).\n\nAn example, for your consideration (Note, this concept can work for any genre of game where you play the role of a leader of a group):\n\n**The Roman Empire.** The year is 200AD. The entire game is set within your palace (hence the ""sheltered dictator"" in the title of this post.) You are the emperor of Rome. You must manage your realm by giving orders to your agents and hoping they fulfill them to the best of their abilities. If you want your 19th Legion to attack the barbarians in Norisci, you speak to your Magister Militum (the highest ranked general in your army) and you issue the commands. You've done all you wanted to do this turn and you click **END TURN**.\n\n1 month (maybe more, maybe less) passes in the game between each turn. 3 turns per season, 12 per year. Depending on...\n \n* How much the general loves/fears/respects you\n* Your objective skill level as an administrator\n* His skill level as a general\n* How much the soldiers of Legion 19 love/fear/respect the both of you\n* The skill level of the soldiers in that Legion, as a whole\n* All the internal conditions determined by your economy, morale, etc.\n* And all the external conditions that come with invading that particular Germanic province at that particular time of year...\n\nYou find out the results of all your actions from last month. The same process applies with the orders you gave to your Coinmaster (Economy), your Spymaster (Intrigue), your Chancellor (Diplomacy), your Alderman (Food + Supplies) and whoever else is on your ""High Council""."

3mzpe3,"Polyality, a multi-player centric game","So my game idea is a game called Polyality, a co-op mobile game where you connect with up to 3 other people and battle constant waves of enemies. You all share 1 health bar that spans across all screens, and each player can pick a different weapon.\n\nThe unique gimmick is that each player is a different color, and at no point do you see each other, as you all exists in different realities fighting a hoard. You can only damage enemies of your own color, but sometimes enemies of another team mates color will appear on your screen and you have to tell your team mate who is that color where they are so they can eliminate them, as enemies who are not your color and appear on your screen are invisible to anyone else.\n\nI guess there could be 2 modes, one mode where everyone shares a life bar, and one where everyone has an independent life bar that life can be stolen from in the case that someone died or needs health.\n\nI guess as for the genre and setting and characters, thats still up in the air.

3mx8ul,IRL Sim,"IRL Sim is a game where you can live your life as anyone you want, such as celebrity, tv character, or fighting game characters! With 3D model support, you can add music/sfx to levels/scenes, where you can contribute levels/scenes. Ever wanted to be a singer? Got it! News reporter? Yep! Want to be a rock? Ok! Weird, but yes you can! With animation support, and point and click style movement support, create YOUR world!"
3mvv0s,Open world game like GTA but the whole world,"I was driving around in Grand Theft Auto and I thought of this. There should be a open world game like GTA but instead of there just being a city you should be able to explore the whole world. You can drive across the country, or you can fly or ride a boat across the ocean to get to another country. You should be able to go to real places like amusement parks, landmarks, monuments, etc. And to make it more realistic, you can't just teleport to wherever you want to go, you have to drive or fly or sail there and follow directions using the GPS like in GTA. If someone made this game I would pay up to $500 for it. But is a game like this even possible? "
3mv9pg,I Am Legend Style Game,"I think an amazing idea for a game should be an I Am Legend style game where it is single player and you have to survive as long as you can in a very large sized, detailed city. \n\n* You will be able to choose your location where you will camp out or even multiple locations. \n\n* The building aspect of the game should be very flexible allowing the player to build maybe just a couple boards over the windows and an iron door or maybe even a base right in the middle of the street. The player should be able to contruct anywhere in the city as long as they have the appropriate tools and parts.\n\n* There would be the infected resting during the day and that come out during the night.\n\n* The hunger and thirst aspect of the game should mimic real life, but maybe they should decrement a little quicker to add a little more difficulty. Food and water will be difficult to acquire because they will reside in buildings where the infected are located or you will have to hunt for stray animals that pass through the streets of the city.\n\n* A few rare vehicles are randomly generated around the city and their locations are persistently saved if they are moved by the player.\n\n* There may even be other scavengers around the city, but maybe only one or two on the map at a time. You may get to know these scavengers well because ammo and weapons would be scarce and hard to acquire, so you wouldn't be able to kill them easily the chance you first see them and they each will have their own personality traits. Some may attempt to confront you at first and others will run away at the first sight of you. You can then decide to try and track them back to their little shelter or leave them in peace, waiting to possible stumble upon them again in the future.\n\nIt almost sounds like ""The Forest"" meets a city environment, but with a little more customization and a little tougher survival aspect. Not sure of any other apects of the game as of yet, but let me know what you guys think!"
3mv9mc,Cozy Cabin,"Hello,\n\nI haven’t put so much time and effort into a game idea since ages. I couldn’t include all the details in one post therefore I created a Design Document where I wrote and organized everything in a neat manner. You can check it out here (it's a shortened dropbox link): [https://db.tt/LVMXVAHB](https://db.tt/LVMXVAHB)\n\nAs a short description, Cozy Cabin is a 2D casual sandbox simulation game for Android and iOS devices with a very unique atmosphere. Create your character, pick a profession and retreat in a cozy cabin in the woods.\n\nThe emphasis of the game will be not so much about maintaining your character stats at optimum levels but instead the biggest goal of the game will be to build the best looking cabin while playing the mini-games offered by each profession.\nBuy clothes for your character, keep him healthy and strong and improve his life with new rooms and items in your house.\n\nDo check out the design document though, it's got lots of sketches and details, also, it's 20 pages long.\n\nAnd here's my blog post about the game: [blogpost](https://ailailou.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/cozy-cabin/)."
3msqzi,Looking for a simple 2D game idea.,"I'm really into survival games now-a-days so I'd like some simple ideas for a 2D survival game and some game mechanics you would like to see. I'd like to go for a more co-op style but I'm open to PVP as well. Let me know what you guys have. Thanks!\n\nEdit: keep the game idea fast, so not a lot of resource grinding. "
3msgz0,Idea for text space exploration game.,"The basic idea of this game is you are playing via the control console of a common space craft. You start out as a general class and you can choose what kind of space life you want to live(Pirate, Security, Transporter, etc.) You can upgrade your ship, explore galaxies and mine ores, hire crew mates and manage their salaries. Basically more on the realism part. That's the basic concept as of now, and if you have a particular question about a certain aspect, I'll tell you my ideas. Thanks!"
3kgvfk,A game about using a bunch of clones of yourself to solve puzzles.,"Yes, I saw the other post involving cloning but this idea is completely different; I just thought of this when I read that idea. Anyway:\nIt's a game about being stuck in a situation and having nothing but the ability to make an infinite number of clones of yourself to solve puzzles in order to get further along into the level. For example, make a bridge of clones to get across a river; make a clone ladder to scale a wall; clone raft; use clones to trigger land mines; etc etc.\nAll the clones come out as pretty much just lifeless dolls so you don't have to worry about them being alive and needing their own AI or something.\nIMO this game seems pretty easy to make provided that you know what you're doing (which is actually why I can't do it myself, 0 game dev experience :'( )\nHow to credit me: If you could put my name somewhere in the credits that would be great. Also, if you make this, please tell me when it's up, because I REALLY would love to play a game like this."
3kgeyi,The Cloning Machine,"I thought this was kind of cool. It's pretty much a multiplayer game where you start off in a medium sized map, probably dark, and the goal is to find the cloning machine and stop it. The machine would be cloning zombies or whatever you'd want it to if tou made this game. (maybe different rounds it could clone new monsters) A new monster would be made probably every few seconds and you and your team would be fighting the monsters off until you make it to the machine.\n\n\nMaybe there could be a code that you'd type in to stop the machine, and the code would be found somewhere in the map. This would probably add some more teamwork because people would be communicating about who will be finding the code, and who would try to stop the machine.\n\n\nAfter you stop the machine finally, a boss could come and be a final touch to that round.\n\nI might make this, but please tell me your opinions in it, or if I should add anything.\n\n"
3kfwu6,Idea for a Zombie Outbreak Simulator,"My idea for this game was a kind of RTS, you start as a Commander of some kind of military organisation (national guard, a private army, etc...) in a randomly generated city and you know somewhere in this city there is a person infected with a zmobie virus and it's going to spread. But since you have only limited resources (money) and you have to make sure that you don't upset the population, 'martial law' for example would be a great way to limit civilian movement and could buy you time to isolate infected districts, it would be expensive and civilians are more likely to riot. Money would be generated out of federal funds, tepending on how high the threat is (higher threat = more money), or bonuses like clearing districts, eliminating hordes of infected or fighting back riots. Your abilities to stem the flow of the infection could be checkpoints, military patrols, checking hospital admissions for symptoms of the outbreak, requesting reinforcements (reaching from a squad of infantry to combat helicopters or tanks). \n\nI hope this is a unique idea and i hope that I didn't plagiarize somebody else's idea (if that's the case I'm terribly sorry). \n(Not sure how to flair it, probably 'Experienced' if not 'AAA')"
3kf4ty,Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better),"So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/\n\nAs I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.\nOther devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like ""MMO"". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Idea size**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Making the idea simple**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Checking Before You Post**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Asking for money**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Good example**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.\nSo, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.\n\nWorld set I thought of:\n\nA tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.\n\nTell me what you think! :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Bad Example**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Overview**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I reccomend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas."
3keuzu,Game idea that I need expanding,"I'm looking at making a 4 player horror game the idea us that it is as intense as a single player horror game.\n\nThe idea was to split the players up at times and have objects that only one player at a time will see or they will all see different things such as dead bodies or blood splatters, even monsters could chase them that turn out to be just there imagination.\n\nThe game will try to mess with the players heads as the see them cut/harm them selves when in fact they are doing nothing. Or see bugs crawling all over them so the other players will hear there screams over the mic but have no idea why.\n\nThe bit I need help on is a story line or location setting. I know I want it to start in as calm kind of joking way were the players think it's not scary and then all hell brain loose."
3keuiq,Superhero Tailor,"**Superhero Tailor** \n\n&gt; a game about someone who makes, repairs or upgrades superheros costumes.\n\n**Background :**\n\nIn this world 2/3 the people in society are secretly either superheroes or supervillains, people can get super powers from various of sources. aliens attack earth every now &amp; then, In this age of confusion a new profession emerged **""Costume Tailors""**: who create costumes &amp; equipments to help the defenders of earth.\n\n__________________________________\n\n**The Game :**\n\nYou (an aspiring tailor) open a costume shop &amp; make clothes &amp; buy equipments to integrate into costumes (or to resell).. After a while some rookie heroes will ask you to mend their clothes, some will buy your custom costumes. Maybe someone will ask you to be their assistant tailor or maybe you'll get involved in the black market selling costumes for supervillains as well.\n\nAnd as your reputation grows and you meet professional defenders of earth. you discover more about the world and the hero/villain wars.\n\n_______________________________\n\n**Game Mechanics:** (not complete)\n\nThe player has skills like [Fashion] [Technology] [sewing] and  [reputation], The game is basically 3 parts: \n\n1) **Making Costumes:** choosing colors &amp; the type of fabric, metals &amp; the integrated equipments, \n\n2) **Running The Shop:** each day you get to resupply tools/fabrics etc.. and choose what custom costumes to showcase today. Then you run the shop.. sometimes you'll get costumers asking you to mend their costumes (quality depend on your [sewing] skills), sometimes are interested in what you showcase in your shop. you can negotiate the price for your services (there's a recommended price -lower value increasses the chance the costumer accepts/ higher decreaseses it)\n\n3) **Discovering The Story:** Each day you get the newspaper which tells about the famous heroes, the new villains and sometimes about people you helped yourself. if you gained enough reputation they might put article about you.\n\n_______________________________\n\n**Minimum Viable Product ?**\n\nThe [MVP/prototype/simplest version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvCri1tqIxQ) of this game should be something like a shop with 3 styles costumes/ 3 colors /2 fabric types and 1-2 tool set(s), a shop with one or two customers &amp; no story.\n\n_______________________________\n\nThis idea needs improvements to the core idea, because running a shop is repeated activity and really that engaging by itself. adding variable story depends on what you sold and who sold too will help will add complexity &amp; don't know if it'll help.\n\nI might make the game myself in future, so If you want it please ask for permission (I'll almost certainly give it).\n\nWhat do you think?"
3kdyjf,"[Feedback needed] I had some free time, made this, any idea for a mobile game that could utilize this?",[deleted]
3kdsfi,Idea I'm working on. The idea isn't complete but the work has started.,"Hey guys\nSo I've started with this game basic work done by now. Skybox and character controller but I haven't worked out the whole system / idea.\nI'd love someone's help in creating a better idea and also how to ACTUALLY DO IT !! PLANNING.\n\nin my game you can play as any animal, you start as a child version and you grow up.\nWe have to survive, like eat and kill smaller animals and protect yourself from predators.\n\nFrankly that is pretty much it.\nI have thought of other things like\nParents will be there too, if might stay with you, die, or are lost. I man dynamic but I do not know how to go about doing it.\nIt's a bit complex."
3kdltu,Vega Man - Not to be messed with ignore this man at your peril.,"A game that has you role playing for the good over evil. you get immersed in all the drama and it calls upon your integrity to solve the game. It gets to the young and actually gets them to think without even being aware of it. \n\nThis is a game where the superhero is a vegan. The idea of the game is to promote animal welfare to a young and teenage audience, one where the minds are open to ideas. It would be full of the usual adventure and thrills. Instead of the usual kill kill kill it would be animals being let free from laboratories and slaughterhouses and the drama unfolding as what goes with this.  Solutions being sought to stop using animals being used as objects and not living creatures. Questions being asked about animals suffering for nothing more than making money when there are other and more effective methods. Thus children are playing but taking in the message as their own.  Of course there would be a Superhero Vega Man or another name that would sum him up. Fighting for the good and outdoing the bad. It is different and would appeal to girls as well as boys. Plus have an educational theme that would promote thinking in young people as what we are doing to their world and the way it is being ruined for them. Giving them the ability to decide what kind of world they want to inherit and have a chance to make it happen. Before it is to late and they have no choices.\n\n"

3kdd52,Would you play a game like this?/ Idea feedback,"I have an idea for a game called ""call of warfre: modern duty 2"" No not a free shitty version of call of duty, but a game that mocks teens and hardcore COD players by having voices being over aggressive with phrases like ""MLG!!"" or ""YOU STOLE MY FUCKING KILL MAN"". I'm thinking that it is going to be a top down 2d game (so people don't think it will be just another free cod nock off) i would appreciate any feedback on how to make this idea better and if you want to keep track on development you can follow my twitter [here](https://twitter.com/pixel_therapy_)"
3kcx0r,Domino Topple,"I would love to see a Domino Topple game that is like really setting up dominoes for a topple, then you can actually watch the dominoes fall with different angles.  If they can make and design a roller coaster, then you can watch it like your riding on it, this could not be too hard.  Just a thought."
3kc7l1,Color blind,"So you start off only seeing white. You have a narrarator, he tells you where you are, what to do and some other random stuff. He guides you along your way until he says somrthing like ""Oh no, they've found me.. There's sonething I need to tell you, there IS A WAY TO GET-"" *cuts off* So now you're alone, but you see something in the distance. Its some yellow jewel. You get closer and touch it. Now you can see yellow. Maybe yellow flowers, the sun, bananas, and other stuff you'd see around. At this point the game would look weird because there would be random yellow stuff that looks as if its floating around, After a bit more exploring, you would find your next jewel, blue. Now you see the sky, and water, and everything thats blue. And then red would be last for the first chapter. (first chapter would be the primary chapter) The next chapter would be the secondary chapter with all the secondary colors, and then the third chapter would probably have some other colors like brown.\n\nSo you're happy now, you can finally see the world. But then darkness fills your screen, until all you see is black. Thats pretty much all I've thought of so far. If you have any ideas or like it, then pleas post below. Thanks"
3k70ii,Spellcraft - mage focused roguelike,"Spellcraft will be a dungeon crawling, turn-based, tile-based roguelike for mobile devices. Inspiration from games like diablo, baldurs gate and pokemon mystery dungeon. \n\nThe main gameplay would consist of travelling through dungeon floors and crafting spells to overcome the dungeon. \n\nThe part that makes it interesting is you craft your own spells. Using the turn based system and the mobile touch interface you draw a series of patterns on the screen representing a spell you have learnt to cast it (think like triangle, triangle, triangle with a line through it). You craft spells through a spell tree with different elements and extensions (fire, ice, etc. And aoe, dot, linear, etc.) Which would be upgraded from picking up elemental shards from dead enemies.\n\nI have more ideas but will leave it there as I'm on mobile device, should be working and no one might find it interesting anyway. If someone does like it enough, please consider letting me help, I have no experience in mobile development and little in game development but am studying computer science and mathematics and would love to learn."
3k5h86,The Secret Library,[deleted]
3k53av,Did any ideas from here have been created as games?,Just curious if any developer used an idea here to create a game.
3k4ryz,A basebuilder where you build a spy agency. The B.O.M.B.,"... or **B**arely **O**perational **M**odular **B**ase. Grip your arm rests, my manic phase is  giving me boosts.\n\nThe trope of medieval, space and post-apocalyptic base builders is going a bit stale, if you ask me. This here is basically the counterpart to evil genius.\n\nIn this game, you would basically build the headquarter of your own freelance spy agency. Your goal is to send agents with different ""styles"" and traits on missions off-screen to acquire randomized technological and weapon-loot, basically like the drops in an RPG. \n\nThe styles include saboteur, hacker, designer, spec ops and maybe some other. This determines certain abilities and fighting skills.\n\nThe base does feature some known rooms like living quarters, but also one or more secret stashes that are used as storage, a bar and a lab that could also be used to produce tech and illicit drugs for the black market, the trade system that also influences faction relations. \n\nAn important feature that sets this basebuilder aside from others is the ""Plan B""-System. While building the first base, you can already invest resources in another base. If you piss a faction off too much (I thought about spoofs of Americans, Russians, Middle-Eastern agencies, maybe police and criminals too), they would raid you.\n\nNow you have two options. If your base is designed around secrecy (hidden doors, unsuspicious furniture etc.,) you can click a ""Hide""-button, and your agents will go to designated hiding places. You could also just chose to fight the raid off with high grade weaponry/tech, but your risk-factor increases.\n\nBut now, if you find yourself overpowered, you could either evacuate, and your agents will use an evacuation route to one of many possible escape vehicles in the base that you build before (boat, helicopter, truck. This influences how much stuff you can take with you) to make the transition to base B.\n\nIf you do that, you had the option to return to your plundered base after some time has passed, but there will be a permanently increased risk. \n\nThen there is the self-destruct option. No need to explain.\n\nI'm strongly in favor for many different relationships between the randomized agents you could hire: They should be able to hate each other, be in love, be close friends. This influences how they perform on missions together and deal with each others death. Social interaction is a must have for this. Also: Caring for needs."
3k4fxh,MMO open world racing/driving game oozing with style and extensive customization,"**Name:** \n\nHaven't decided on one but it has to fit the theme of sandboxy driving and customization.\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nYou drive cars, optionally fast, around a big world filled with stuff and other players, and the cars can be modified, shaped and upgraded to your liking. Lots of TRON lines and lights\n\n**Plot:**\n\nIf the start of one's game counts as a plot: you arrive by plane to the yet-unnamed map, similar to Test Drive Unlimited 2006, then choose a starter vehicle, are given the controls during a short cruise, take part in a night time race and finally evade a police pursuit. This would work as a tutorial for new players, accustoming them to the driving controls and handling. Afterwards, the rest of the map and events open up.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nA huge coastal map, containing one large hub city, a forest area, a desert, a scenic beach and treacherous mountains for one's Touge needs.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nDo cars count?\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Driving, which will be arcadey overall but with hints of simulation (eg. drift control; torque effects), and integration of real life elements as gameplay mechanics (eg. certain engine builds have different effects on handling characteristics but also on boost usage, to mirror fuel efficiency of sorts; exotic systems such as [KERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy_recovery_system) replacing the boost and allowing for different playstyles);\n* Customization of cars: choosing different chassis types, body types, engine configurations and positions, transmission; upgrading a large variety of components for each system (engine, transmission, platform etc.); in-depth tuning system for each major component of the car (ride height, camber, gear ratios, aero etc.); [AutoSculpt](http://nfs.wikia.com/wiki/Autosculpt), mold and shape your car in your desired fashion; paint wraps and decals similar to Forza Motorsport.\n* Any action performed in the game world will reward players with varying amounts of experience and cash: winning races, evading cops, even free roaming.\n*Social Interactions: while free roaming, driving behind or near another player will highlight them subtly, and a context menu can be accessed to invite as friend, add to a group and compare stats and cars.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Car classes - based on initial vehicle build and changed according to any installed upgrades, in ascending order: E, D, C, B, A, S, X1, X2, X3. The basis for matchmaking pairing in competitive events like races.\n* A community driven marketplace, containing user-made cars, ""template"" vehicles, wraps and liveries for various builds.\n* Three main ways to play: race, chase (cop pursuits) or cruise around the world to level up, gain ingame currency and unlock new events, car parts and more.\n* The TRON art style is more than just for looks - in addition to the world seemingly ""dancing"" and pulsing lights around you with the music (such as the building lights acting like graphic equalizers), pulsing lights on your car's curves and edges reflect its state (eg. pulsing blue lights going to the exhaust when boosting, flashing red and blue lights in pursuits that gradually turn either full red or full blue as you're getting busted/evading).\n* Syncing driving actions with the music playing will increase a multiplier that affects all further EXP and cash gained for that cruise, race or chase, in addition to doing the ""dancing lights"" thing mentioned before.\n* More on music: DnB would be the main genre, but with the option to create your own playlists from the loads of songs available, or import your own.\n* Standard suite of options for graphics, audio and such, but also allow near complete control on how the game looks and feels to the player - want to, for instance, disable the TRON lines from the scenery but not from your car? You got it.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC primarily, Mac and Linux would be nice too\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNeed for Speed + Midnight Club + Burnout + TRON/Nitronic Rush + \nForza Motorsport + Test Drive Unlimited 1/2 + a pinch of Audiosurf = this game essentially\n\nLet me know just how unoriginal, outlandish, unreasonably complex and impossible to complete in a human lifespan this all sounds.\n\n**PS** Will periodically add more stuff here because the ideas come in episodes and I can't exactly focus on it all at once."
3k3crm,Botz: A Third/First Person Shooter similar to COD Offline Bots.,"It is a historical game. You can use Bows, Muskets, STGs, AKs, and M4s etc. Just look at COD Bots and it will be just like that with different options. Instead of 18 Bots you can have 64 Bots. And put them in teams."
3k376m,[Request] I'm outta ideas for indie games :'-(,"Hey mates!\nSo, I am wishing to make a new 2D indie game, but I'm literally out of the ideas. I have looked through the subreddit, but nothing quite suits me :-(\nThe game would be Indie, 2D, and it would be on PC/Macs.\n\nThanks!!\n\n//PinguRares"
3k2mey,"Economy sim / city builder where you don't build - a Society builder (think Banished, without doing the building)","Hey there, I will keep this short. I wish there was a game like Banished with several major differences:\n\n1) You don't do any building - you instead have the ability to do some loose planning / zoning, but the citizens / public / private investment does the building of new buildings based on economic need. Perhaps traditional public infrastructure is your responsibility, but what type of houses / industry gets built is up to what the economy needs and what resources are available.\n\n2) Your role is to manage the long term goals and sustainability of your population, via regulations over deforestation rates, mining etc. You can set taxes on certain resources, subsidies on specific manufactured goods, etc."
3k1tuj,Suggestions of immortal FPS mechanics but still challenging somehow,"What if instead of shooter where you die and reload the level, you never die at all and keep fighting?\n\nBUT! There's a catch if you take too much damage:\n\n* Your movements slow down and you're restricted from grenades, special moves. or anything else until you avoid damage long enough to gradually recover\n\n* Lower score. If there's a grading system, you can't get an S Rank if you get a single hit.\n\nBut if you do go unscathed and/or on a killing spree, power ups could appear, your speed increases, more weapons and functions become available, etc.\n\nI thought maybe this would be worth bringing up because whenever I play a shooter it's frustrating to be killed by a few shots then wait several seconds of the game reloading. I'd rather keep the momentum going. Yeah, you'd need a challenge or failure state somehow, but usually that comes from the satisfaction of skilled kills against aggressive and hard hitting enemies that could otherwise blast you out of where you stand. Don't believe me? The action platformer Prinny gives you 1000 lives and you still couldn't pass each level if you don't know how to move around obstacles and attack."

3jxyag,Sports Commissioner Game,"So the main idea is that you are the commissioner of a sports league (current or new sport; my examples will be american football because I am most familiar with that) \n\n* you can start a new league and you would start with 6-ish teams and build from there through expansion teams(texans). or you can take over a currently league (NFL) and expand that.\n* have to manage finances and such.  \n* able to create your own draft classes and current rosters or have an option for randomized players.  \n* maybe a thing for a rival league that can either absorb you or you can absorb them (NFL and AFL).\n\nI had the whole idea in my head the other day and forgot it and now I am tired and forgot some more of it. so I guess do what you want with it. I know madden has an owner mode and 2k has a general manager mode, but I want to oversee everything that happens in a league. Thanks!"
3jxj9s,Story Driven Idea,"I would definitely put this in an Experienced or AAA category.\n\nI intentionally don't have names or anything so you can add your own elements to the idea if you want to. Try to imagine the story with your own characters as you read it. Just please keep reading until the twist ending.\n\n\n**Background**\nYou start on a small island that is put under quarantine due to a really bad airborne virus. Nobody gets on or off the Island, except for a few soldiers, doctors, and researchers in the beginning who can't leave until a cure is found (they all wear ""gas masks"", but still). The government insures there is no contact with the outside world other than a few government controlled radio towers (only accessed by select high ranking officials to receive orders). They also confiscate and destroy guns, boats, radios and pretty much anything else that could promote panic or allow a citizen to leave the island and expose the rest of the world to the virus. Soldiers patrol the border of the island and make sure that the infected citizens are visiting the clinic regularly. But of course, even with all these precautions, there is a lot of chaos and destruction on the island by it's citizens.\n\n**Story**\n10-15 years pass and there is still no cure. The government group has begun to impose more order and violate rights to insure security of the quarantine and the leader of the government officials (who is maskless, to appear less threatening and to give our villain a face) broadcasts announcements over telecoms to the citizens and warns of not following the rules and potential consequences. Infected individuals continue to be treated at guarded in-patient facilities where usually only the strong return. \n\nYou were young when the quarantine was put into affect and managed to survive the virus but still return as mandated to out patient facilities for checkups. Someone close to you drags you to the beach where you watch in horror as their escape plan goes horribly wrong and they get killed by the soldiers in the process. After this event you realize it's time to take action, motivated largely by revenge and anger. You eventually join a rebel group who's leader (who has totally embraced chaos) is under the belief that the government has a cure for the virus that they intentionally aren't administering and has swept the quarantine under the rug to the public in an attempt to secretly weaponize the virus. After he gets you to infiltrate a guarded in-patient research facility on the island you discover that the doctors aren't exactly humane in treating the patients. You discover a much smaller, secret, very guarded and closed off section, that is highly quarantined where the weaker of the sick are ""treated"". While a lot of the logs you discover are confusing to you, it appears as if the doctors are injecting them with a more deadly strain of the virus and testing whether their pre-exposure to a lighter strain makes them more resistant and other test of this even more deadly strain. Reporting back to the rebels the leader feels this is validating evidence of his suspicions and gets you to attempt to take over a guarded radio tower to inform outside authorities. Upon reaching the radio you discover it has already been destroyed and you aren't certain when it happened or why there would be guards stationed around, but not in, a non functioning radio tower. After you report back to the rebel leader he assumes it was a trap and that you were followed despite you trying to plead otherwise and orders an abandonment of the rebel encampment a move that eventually gets the rebels killed.\n\nAt this point, as the lone resistance, you decide to flee the island exposing the government and forcing them to use the cure as the rest of the world would now be exposed to the virus. You manage to take one of the government controlled boats (they are well protected and there are very few small ones), but are followed by soldiers from the government and the leader himself. You aren't at civilization upon arrival on land as you hit an uninhabited area and are chased and eventually cornered by the government soldiers who follow you. You manage to kill them all and confront the injured leader who says some cryptic stuff, including a shpeal about the value of life to you and you are given the option to kill him or just leave him there.\n\n**The Twist**\nYou continue traveling and after reaching a city you discover that everyone in the city is dead and everyone in the world is dead. They were all killed by this more deadly strain of the virus. You are left with a different interpretation of the government leader, knowing he has been calling his own shots and it is up to the player to decide with a lot of ambiguity if he was\nGood: trying to save the last remaining people from knowledge that would promote chaos and destruction, and test to see if the deadlier strain of the virus was a threat to the citizens\nBad: using hope to control his reshaping of the world and using eugenics while convincing the doctors that they were discovering a cure. And tricking soldiers into believing the orders were still coming from the government.\nThis should also leave you with other questions as to whether the virus was weaponized and this deadly strain developed from a strain on the island as well as many other unresolved questions.\n\n**Gameplay and Visuals**\nI'm open to whatever on this one (except I wish that bullets would actually kill the player when they were shot). I was thinking the soldiers would have pistols (automatic weapons cause too much panic), our protagonist would sneak and use bow and arrow mainly as well as pistols from the dead soldiers (scarce ammo). Definitely would like to stray from cover based shooting and a lot of enemies. It's both overdone and unrealistic. Get discovered by more than 2 enemies in this game and for the most part you should be dead.\nAs far as what the island looks like I don't have a preference. Art styles should definitely show the state of decay. I imagined the final confrontation with the government leader in the snow but again I don't care much.\n\nI just wanted to share my idea on what I thought was a pretty unique story, but would still leave you guys with a lot of freedom to flesh it out. Thanks for reading."
3jxg1b,Legionnaire: a platforming action war game,"So my idea for legionnaire is quite simple and i believe it can be achieved with a small team. But alas i dont have such a team so heres my idea, you play as a soldier that belongs to the 23rd legion of the military of Tempore. A futuristic planet beyond our solar system that has been finding with the inhabitants of the planet Spatium youve been fighting over a strange gateway in space. Gateways are portals in space that ships use to transport themselves around. \nMy ideas for the mechnics are quite simple. Basically when fighting on the planets of your worlds or in space or in ships you can loot bodies for armors and weapons which have their own stats and the weapons can give skills. For instance you kill a captain of a ship and get a fancy laser pistol you fire it and find out it shoots three lasers, or a giant alien behemoth from another dimenson who drops a magical eye that you wear as a hat fire laser beams wity it. Im also thinking of other mechanics.\nWell anyway I'd love to make or help someone make a game like this.\nWell thats all i got."
3jvizp,"Shipping Simulator, complete with crack pairings and OTPs","I see lots of dating sims, but I've never seen a shipping sim. Closest I've ever seen that happen is with the Fire Emblem games, but that barely scratches the surface. So I'm hoping we'd see a dedicated shipping simulator.\n\n**Genre:** Simulation\n\n**Premise:** You play as the new God of Love. Cupid has retired, so you must take his job to watch over and nurture the suitors in your game. Will you make the cutest couple or maybe the most unorthodox pairing? Do you want to create a harmonious circle or incite dramatic love triangles? Will your character commit to one S.O. or start a harem?\n\n**Gameplay Features**\n\n* Creating Characters: Create any character you want to ship. Decide their appearance, personality, etc. Maybe you want to see your Homestuck OTP play right before you, or maybe your sunken ship in Scott Pilgrim can be brought back. Creating Samus and Little Mac together is not out of the question either. There's no limit to who you want to add into the game.\n\n* Shipping who you want no matter what: Are your characters initially friends? Enemies? Relatives? Test subject and companion cube? No one's stopping you, but you get different situations depending on who's what.\n\n* A.I. system: Customize your suitors' behavior with a system ripped straight out of Final Fantasy XII's gambit system. They'll have a list of priorities that dictate their behavior depending on the situation.\n\n* Love Events: Little cutscenes that show after characters reach a certain relationship level. Bonus content may be rewarded as well.\n\n* Hearts: As relationships develop, the player is rewarded with hearts as a currency. This can be used to buy new characters to create, new areas for suitors to go on dates, and more.\n\n* Shipping Wars: If an online multiplayer element is added in the game, then players can vote for other players' pairings. These votes give the pairings more power, and battles will be carried out in literal ship-to-ship combat in heaven as the God of Love sits and judges.\n\nThere's no end game, just a nearly endless series of romance, drama, and possibly humor because of what you decide as the God of Love.\n\nEDIT: Could someone explain what's wrong with this idea? If I'm getting downvotes, I might as well know why."

3jtmhp,What would be an addicting simple game like unholy heights to make?,[deleted]
3jrj3q,Role-Playing Game where FEAR is your worst enemy... and your biggest friend.,"""Fearhunter"". That's the title of this game, an open-world action RPG w/horror and comedy elements, set in a dystopian version of Earth centered in a Toronto-esque city named Mercurio, dictated by a cruel overruler, where you can play w/the power given to you by the human psyche.\n\nYou are a prisoner of the forces of Edgar Walker, the drug-addict Leader of the Continents of Planet Earth. As are thousands, millions even of men, women and children who disrespected Walker's out-of-control rules and found themselves either locked away, or in worse scenarios, tortured or forced to slavery. You are in jail for burglary, having apparently stolen medication for your cancer-patient son, since both you and your wife/husband (depending on which sex genre and/or sexuality - this game would allow the possibility for homossexual couples, w/your son being adopted if that's the case - you select to be) have gone jobless and almost out of money. And nobody will try to help, w/so many others in need of it out there, ultimately ignoring your boy. So you take the action into your own hands, and you end up imprisioned.\n\nLucky for you, your get-out-of-jail card has literally arrived. An underground revolution has been dyscreetly started by a shadowy amnesty organization named as the Riot Against International Security Violations, or RISE for short. They organized a huge lottery where they would take one of multiple prisoners around the globe (that they studied and deemed somewhat safe, they never considered murderers or anything) out of prison and you were the winner. Being the winner, they will now make you the face of their cause. And give you powers unimaginable to the human mind. RISE recently have come w/an incredible scientific breakthrough that is conviently perfect in their anti-terrorist cause. A portable, Assassin's Creed hidden-blade-like machine that allows one to go inside the mind of another, to literally go face-to-face to the person they're inside's worst fears. Should they kill this fear, not only is the person's phobia inexistent anymore, but due to a glitch they discovered halfway through the creation process of the machine that they decided to further explore to their benefit, the mind invader can actually carry superpowers based off of the fear they killed. \n\nIn example, should the invader (or Fearhunter as he/she is dubbed) use the machine to kill some old lady's arachnophobia, the Hunter would go face-to-face w/a giant spider or scorpion from Hell, multiple waves of them, or whatever, depending on how bad her phobia really is. If her phobia is really small, you could face as much as a baby spider at best. Should you kill the creatures, you come back to the real world w/Spider-Man like powers, like web shooting or wall crawling. Another example is that if you went face-to-face w/someone w/claustrophobia, your case could be as bad as having to outrun some foggy demon in a tight corridor w/multiple home furniture inspired obstacles, and quickly-closing walls that will crush you to death should you fail to suceed. If you do suceed, you can create force fields, oxygen crushing poison or other powers derivative from that phobia.\n\nYour task, given by RISE, is to wander around the multiple outskirts of Mercurio (the capital city of Edgar Walker's Earth), from the suburbs to the central business district, killing off NPC's phobias of Walker and his forces, so that an eventual people's revolution against Walker would go as succesfully as possible. And before you ask, killing fear of Edgar Walker means that you simply get better manipulation skills, like better talking, better... convincing people, and hell, making them afraid of you if necessary. Not the strongest powers, but useful for dialogue-based quests. But just killing waves of giant Walkers and his army would grow repetitive, and luckily, the Fearhunter machine allows you to kill off multiple phobias at once too! So you can, for example, murder a giant spider made entirely of Walker cops (as in, remember the Nanobots from Big Hero 6? Think that, but w/SS-like militants), Walker himself riding it! Or, if you find an NPC that's afraid of dogs, you can take on a gigantic, earth-shaking Rottweiller being commanded by Walker and some of his pals. Everytime, you return w/new or improved superpowers based off of the fear you stopped. Should you find multiple times the same fear, worry not, because there is always a different challenge based on how bad one's fear is. And if you do happen to find the same challenge, an added global online point score helps you motivate yourself to do better than the last time.\n\nEvery NPC in the city is interactible, and all of them are afraid of something, besides Walker. You will find all sorts of different fears, some of them absolutely ridiculous (like fear of doors), and depending on the ""boss fights"" you encounter, they can make you laugh 'till your belly hurts (providing the necessary comedic moments of the game), they can be Silent Hill-worthy scary, who knows? If you play a phobia multiple times, you unlock more powers based off of it, and the ones you already have see an increase in level, and therefore, energy (you can only level-up the powers you use in the fear fights though). But take note: all of the powers you encounter are avaliable in the real world (tagged under their respective phobias), but in the mind of somebody, you can only select to use five of those phobias, w/the carriability of one out of two per hand (left hand features range powers, right hand is for melee attacks), and a third one for transportation, like running at superspeed, flying, teleporting, etc. - for no reason other than convenience for game's sake. This allows for multiple different ways of finding unique power combos and experiencing fear fights, even if it's one you already did. Also, your health? Yeah, it doesn't regenerate. Instead, you play the old school fashion - you gotta use health items that you steal or buy in the real world, should you choose not to go the easy way. You CAN unlock regenerating health, for which you have to kill your own fear of death, but that has a price to pay. Oh, and some of the better phobias to use - such as the ones that give you better transportation, like ornitophobia (fear of birds, which gives you flight), are the rarest to find.\n\nIn the outside world, you can take your powers and use them to destroy propaganda, beat up enemy groups, find multiple collectibles, partake in side quests like stealing for the poor Robin Hood-style, or even timed go-from-A-to-B challenges, and, should you choose to momentarily turn off the story and go for Chaos Mode, just cause general havok on the city. Stuff like arcade games and shops for clothing or health items are there too, just because. And the story itself unfolds mostly in the real world, for which you have some Mass Effect-worthy choices to make along the way. Right off the bat, RISE gives you the choice of wheater or not you want to kill your own fear of death - not killing it means that the difficulty is raised and that you have to manually restore your health, enemies are much tougher to beat, etc.. Killing it means that you have things much easier for you, w/regenerating health and the possibility of, later down the line, using up to 10 powers in a fear fight, but the price is severe - you end up being completely apathetic towards the health of your own family, as you lose the fear of not only your own death, but of others' too. And they play a good part of the story too, as, if you play it w/fear of death alive, you can take in quests to try to find them help, whereas that possibility isn't there w/the fear dead, and both your son and your partner end up brutally dead at some point. That's one of multiple game changing choices to deal with.\n\nAfter the main story is complete, you can wander about in Mercurio w/your powers, discovering more of them you might have missed during the story's progression, or trying to reach high scores in the ones you already have beaten. Besides this, you have a co-op and splitscreen multiplayer, both local and online, in which you can use a collection of 5 to 10 phobia powers in a few modes of team-based combat like arena fights, capture the flag, or whatnot.\n\nFear is your worst enemy, and your biggest friend in this game. How will you hunt it down?"

3olgjy,2d side-scroll,"I've got an idea for a game in my head for quite some time now and the more I think about it the better it sounds. \nSo the game would be 2d side-scroll platformer where you control 3 characters - Brute, mage and archer (no this is not trine).\nThey'll each have their own abilities and you could swap between them or have other friend to play one of them in co-op (not necessary).\n       Brute - this one would be regular: big, strong and slow with some fist weapons as his main weapon. In co-op he would need help from others to get to some higher places.\n       Mage - He wouldn't be and should function like they do in most games. His main weapon would be rapier, he would be fast with blink ability, some destructions spell, passive shield and for co-op spell to port others. For using his spells and by being hit he will be getting weak. He'll start to be slower and after a while he will pass out (remember this, I'll get back to it soon).\n       Archer - With bow and arrow in his hands, archer wwould have the highest mobility and lowest health. Idea with him is that he would be always in front for scout or always in higher places for safe shooting (note that he would be only one with access to these high places, mage won't be able to blink there).\nAll of these would also have a mechanic that would make some sort of minigames, unfortunately only one that I have thought of is only mage:\n - Pass out: After using too much magic, mage will pass out, making him vulnerable to attacks for ?? sec. Brute can drag him out but Archer can't.\n- Power of moon/sun: - During day: All 3 heal for small amount per sec.\n                               - during night: Mage can transform to moon form.\n - Moon form: While casting mage would be vulnerable, you would need to defend him for ?? sec. Moon form would make his rapier attacks stronger and magic spell wouldn't exhausts him. Last ?? sec and shield isn't active during moon form. There is 25% chance (higher during some events) that he will transform into Nightmare.\n - Nightmare: Even more powerful being than his moon form. Nightmare will attack players. Player would then need to defeat him to wake him up.\n\nGraphics should be something dark and cartoonish. Whole game should be set in 20th century-like world, where two nations would be in war. Main characters should be young friends, inexperienced in combat (at begin ofc) and not fighting because of war itself, but because of someone losing someone/something, so whole plot would be about revenge of one character, while others will be only helping.\n\nSo, what do you think?"

3ohvt4,The ultimate haunted house game.,"**BASICS**\n\n  The game is set in an old Victorian house which is haunted. A standard party will consist of five players (Though this number could be changed by the player). The characters will be randomly generated, and they will all have different stats/traits/characteristics. Some of them will be male, other female, some will be stronger, faster and they will all have different personalities (I'll explain this later) which will affect the experience. You can control one character at a time and the rest will accompany you. You can choose two types of parties and both will have a certain perk that will give the game some replay value. The first is the *modern* party and the second one is the *old* party. The former consists of people from the twenty-first century and they'll have a flash camera, which can detect invisible ghosts. They'll also have a flashlight and will have to find batteries scattered around the house. The latter will be a party of people from the Victorian age and they'll have a medium (Mediums were very popular back then). A medium can perceive energies and presences. Instead of the flashlight, they'll have a lantern which uses oil as a fuel (Oil can be found in the house). Neither party will run out of resources, but they'll have to find them. The idea of the game would be to survive without going insane and leave the house. This will be achieved through puzzle-solving.\n\n  \n**PERSONALITY TRAITS**\n\n  This is what makes the game unique. Every character, as I said, will have different personalities and different physical characteristics. There will be three ""bars"" and ""Affinity"" which you can check in the party menu (A menu which states their name, gender, current state, skepticism and affinities).\n\n*Health*: (I don't need to explain this one).\n\n*Sanity*: (You already know this one. Your sanity will diminish when you see ghosts or are attacked by them. If a character loses their sanity entirely, they'll be rendered useless until the party defeats or expels a ghost. This will make them feel safe and will relax them, thus getting their sanity back, though not the entirety of it).\n\n*Skepticism*: Some characters will be more skeptic than others. Depending on their skepticism, the characters will make comments expressing their disbelief. It will decrease after seeing ghosts, but it can be replenished after discovering that something has natural causes (Let's say you hear a noise coming from the kitchen, and after investigating you discover that it was made by a rat. This will increase your skepticism EVEN after you've seen a ghost. The character would say that what they saw is the product of suggestion and fright. They could also explain the ghosts seen in photographies as the product of pareidolia, for instance). The more skeptic a character is, the less likely it'll be for him/her to go insane. If the party survives long enough, their entire skepticism will be gone and their sanity will be at risk.\n\n*Affinity*: Some characters will prefer a certain member of their parties. If this member happens to be hurt or goes crazy, the person who likes them will lose some sanity. This will make the player feel obliged to protect some characters in order to keep their favourites. If you like the ""fast"" character and he has an affinity to another character (let's say, his girlfriend), you'll have to take of her in order to keep your favourite character of the party mentally sane.\n  \n**DESCRIPTION OF THE GAMEPLAY**\n\n  The game starts and the party is completely sane. The exit door is locked and they have to find the key. They notice weird sounds which disturb the most sensitive (less skeptic) members of the party, while the most skeptic characters laugh at their ideas or try to calm them (This would happen if the skeptic character has an affinity to a member who's frightened). The skeptic characters feel compelled to prove the party that nothing paranormal is going on, so they go and investigate followed by the rest of the party. If they find out that the strange noises had natural causes, then their sanity and skepticism will remain intact. If they come across a ghost, they'll have to run and the least skeptic characters will suffer some sanity loss, while the most skeptic will lose some of their skepticism. To defend themselves the party can use salt (Circles of salt protect those who are inside them from ghosts and demons), amulets and talismans which could repel bad energies, and cameras and mediums to detect presences. Also, it'd be fun to implement a ouija board to contact entities. The party would have to solve puzzles to be able to reach different places of the house until they eventually find the key. After finding it, the game becomes harder than ever and the characters will have to run to get out of the house. The game will evaluate your performance (Such as taking into account how much of the party's sanity and health remains, how many times your characters have gone insane(If they did), if you left the house with one of them being completely crazy, or even how many (if any) of your characters died, etc.).\n  \n**TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE GAME**\n  \nI'll briefly explain the technical aspects of the game. The game would be a third-person adventure game, with little to no focus on melee and combat. Stealth and strategy are preferable to fighting. I believe this makes the game more suspenseful and tense. The graphics should be in 3D, and each character should have a voice. This would give the game a more professional and believable vibe. All characters would have different, randomly generated appearances and characteristics, to make each gameplay diverse and unique. The house, the scenario in which the game is set should always be the same, though some changes could make the game better. I'm not certain about the genre of the game, but it should be dynamic, it should allow you to use both weapons and objects, and to explore the environment freely.\n\n  \nOf course, some aspects of the game can be changed, but this is the basic idea. If you have any comments, suggestions, or criticism, go ahead and comment. Thanks."
3ogi7o,Velcro Ninja,"So i came up with this really dumb idea while sleeping the other night but it goes like this, your a ninja or at least someone trying to be stealthy, and your goal is to steal from peoples Velcro sealed items, old Velcro sneakers, Velcro wallet, Velcro 90's jacket pockets, id imagine it would play like a weird mix of surgeon simulator and your average stealth game. "
3ofyl8,Car business game (not racing game),"It's a game where you manage a car garage, and you buy/sell/rent cars.\n\nthe graphic doesn't have to be great (it can be 2d, even pixeled) but must be professional. with good selection of car types, manufactures &amp; parts.\n\ndon't know if there a (not racing) game about this already? If so I want to know it :)"
3oc4i4,Looking for Some Inspiring Game Ideas,I am fairly new to game development and can't think of a unique game to make. If you have any beginner level game ideas especially for Android.

3oao3t,John's Revenge,"It's a small open-world game (really it'd be more linear than something like GTA), but honestly it would almost work as a platformer. You play a black guy in the South in the early 1900s and you have to fight the KKK. The final boss is the imperial grand wizard and the only character in the game who can use magic. In between you go on missions to take down the KKK by running them over with your car, doing stealth missions, even going to a rally dressed in the getup and putting explosives in their cross. You could probably go way more violent than people are usually willing to handle because they're racist bastards."

3qgv78,Horror Games Without Negative Mental Health Stereotypes!,"Before I begin, I'm stating now that these ideas are for the Asylum Jam 2015, a horror themed jam (http://www.asylumjam.com/), but it's rules state that ""You should not use asylums, psychiatric institutes, medical professionals or violent/antipathic/’insane’ patients as settings or triggers."" So if you're idea contains these, forget it. This is for me to both share my idea, and to get ideas from you guys for the jam.\n\nThings to bear in mind:\n - This is a horror themed jam, so do try to make it scary, no happy bunnies or such like.\n - This game has to be made in 48 hours, and there is only one dude working on it, and I'm not a wizard.\n - As states earlier, nothing to do with creating a negative stereotype on mental illnesses and such like.\n\nSo what I'm thinking and need your help with is this:\n\nYou're sat alone in a small office room as a security guard, with the only interactive features being in front of you, mainly, the computer monitor. You find out something has gone wrong, and you're locked in the room permanently (suggestions for what/why this is?). Therefore, you don't need to move up from where you're sat, as it's pointless, and the game mechanics don't allow it.\n\nOn the computer, you have complete access to the building's security cameras, as well as other employees emails and files. You also find one available radio com on the computer, which you use to establish a call to another employee (who you never actually see, only ever hear over the com), who is also confused at the situation. Between your security access and his knowledge of the co-workers, you have to discover the unfloding truth while surviving against the creature/person/robot/thing/whatever-you-want (suggestions?) that is slowly heading towards your office. Regardless of how you do it, the goal is to survive against the whatever/antagonist-thingy, and maybe even discover the truth/twist of the situation.\n\nAs you progress through the night, you can see newly sent emails/calls between staff, that may help/hinder you discovering the truth. Since you play as someone with pretty much full security clearance, feel free to go wild with what you can do, to affect the building/things in it (lock doors from potential threats, turn the power off from areas etc).\n\nFeel free to expand/alter this idea, or comment with an entirely different idea for the jam below. Thanks.\n"

3qdzh1,"Minimal graphics, text-based RPG/sims...","The world needs more text-based RPG/sims with simple artwork. No animations or advanced graphics necessary.

You can only control your character.\n2. When you're finished tweaking your character's preferences and actions, click END TURN. \n3. A certain amount of time passes and the game calculates your actions, then the AI's actions, environmental events, etc.\n4. You learn the effects of your actions in the form of a nice text display, perhaps accompanied by a graphic.\n5.

3qbzf1,Adventure Game - What You Don't Expect,"What You Don't Expect\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nAn exploration/adventure game, where you are trying to get away from a evil being in a dreamlike world, except all of your actions have strange consequences. For example, flip a light switch, and the water starts running. Flush the toilet, and the lights turn on/off.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe player is stuck in a dream, where they are trying to escape an ""evil being"". The player does not know what is chasing them... they just have a bad feeling about it.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nIn a building - an office building would give plenty of options.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* The player - nondescript. The game is played from 1st person perspective. \n\n* ""Evil Being"" - Also nondescript. Occasionally the player sees shadows of something monstrous... moving toward them slowly.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThis game would play very similar to an ""room escape"" game... Click an item to see what it does. However, your action never does what you would normally expect. Examples - Making a phone call opens a door, flip a light switch, and the water starts running. Flush the toilet, and the lights turn on/off.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nNothing you do does what you might expect.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nCould be easy to do as a flash player game, or a mobile game. Could be expanded with better graphics/content to consoles or standalone PC game.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nMore and more options for actions, with more rooms/levels. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\n""That-one-dude-on-Reddit"""
3q9nqg,A Time Travel Game That could end up really emotional...,"I don't usually post my projects but I quite like this one.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Concept**  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nYou are a novice timetraveler who went back to the beginning of time due to a faulty time travel device. You go back to the time of the first human and find that the device requires more power. By using natural fruits, you can eventually charge up the device. It then takes you a thousand years later (not enough power to go to the beginning) to when there were the first cavemen. After finding the power, you go to the next stage. The player keeps looping through time and has to try and get back to their time period.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Story**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nYou start off in a peaceful town set somewhere in 2060s. All is well until planes fly overhead and drop hundreds of bombs around the town. You run over to the your father (who was a physicist) but find him dead. On his wrist is some odd watch-looking device. You hear a bomb go off above you and the screen turns black.  \n  \nYou wake in a quiet meadow and find the watch-like device on your wrist. It says the time is 20,000 BC but when you try to touch it it says it requires more power to change time. After gathering berries and applying power to the device, it sends you forward in time...  \n  \nAfter being sent back to the 2060s, you watch the bomb go off again and try to save your father. You see yourself this time running over to him. You hear a loud bomb explode above you and then notice your other self is unconscious. You take the time travel machine from your father and place it on your unconscious past self. You set it as far back as it would go (20,000 BC) and hope that your past self will get stuck so that they don't have to watch their father die. You run out the house and watch as the entire village is destroyed. You see your old school, your house and your neighbours houses shatter to pieces. You watch as people were screaming for help.\n  \nAnd you couldn't do a single thing.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo yeah, I wanted my game to have more of a meaning to it so tell me what you think!\n\n"
3q8r33,Open world time travel game,"Just thought of this, so thought I would share. I think it would be awesome to have an open world game (maybe MMO even) where each of the regions (think like different regions of the newer AC games or elder scrolls online or WoW or fallout, you get the idea) span across different periods of time. Maybe the protaganist is a time traveller. The scope of the game would be huge, and might be only practical for next generation, depending on how large each time period map would be. Ideally game devs would extrapolate what they think the near and far future would look like and also have a region that is during early homosapien age, or earlier.  No idea about the plot, but I think would make a good foundations for an amazing game."
3q8hiu,Magic the Gathering: Battle for Zendikar as an open world MMORPG,"I have never read any of the Magic the Gathering series, but I have been playing magic for a bout two years now. It's pretty good.\n\nThe newest set of cards are related to the story of Zendikar and it's allies versus the Eldrazi, an ancient race of no color alignment that consumes mana and destroys everything in it's path.\n\nThis conflict would make for a great open world MMORPG where players can travel different parts of Zendikar as either Eldrazi or Zendikar's allies. \n\nThere would be classes for each color. \n\nExamples are:\n\nPlain's classes: Cleric, Warrior, Flying Creature, Angel etc.\nMountain classes: Goblin, Orc, Dragon, Pyromancer, etc. \nIsland classes: Sorceror, Artificier, Illusionist, Voidmages, etc.\nForest classes: Summoner, Beast, Archer, Shamans, etc.\nSwamp classes: Vampire, Demon, Necromancer, etc.\nMisc Allies: Elemental\n\nEldrazi classes: \nDescendant of Emrakul- births armies of Eldrazi npc(starts out at 1 and a basic Elrazi scion that dissapears after hitting once) and can also cast confusion spells, \nDescendant of Ulamog-  can absorb hp from enemies and can consume certain structures for mp and manipulate certain structure's energy to cast spells,\nDescendant of Kozilek - can absorb hp from enemies and shoot projectiles and have insect-like appearances.\n\nThere would be ai of both creatures of Zendikar and Eldrazi who will be for leveling up according to the player's chosen faction.\n\nZendikar would also be a cool land to explore.

3q4su6,Highwayman: Knight of the road,"I'd love to have a AAA game where you play as a highwaymen in 1851. Complete with an Assassin's Creed Unity-style character upgrade system for clothing and equipment. The game would be open world and would focus on the story of how you, an unknown highwayman comes to the city of London after gaining too much heat from your previous area of operations. After finding that you are not the only Highwayman working the area, you begin to make contacts and friends who show you better techniques and such (unlocks). You can hold up carriages for money and loot which can be sold or placed within your upgradable home (Which is unlocked early in) Money can be used to buy health potions, ammo for guns, sword sharpening etc etc. \n\nYou can purchase horses with different stats (speed, fear, strength) that can be used to chase down fleeing highway carts or to get you from one side of London to the other. You can buy new equipment like guns and swords which then then be upgraded further using blacksmiths (and a bit 'o coin).\n\nAs you can probably tell this idea is a culmination of other games (AC: Unity, Witcher etc) which I think it would be so cool but I feel could only work on the AAA scale, which is why I shall cry myself to sleep knowing it will never happen.

3q1m1w,Combine sonic style platforming with a fighter game,"Core idea: \n\nI'm referring to the whole ""combos = special moves"" thing. A platform game, and many attacks to choose from but not all of them are effective. Each 'bot can defend itself against certain attacks, and also does attacks that can be countered in a special way. Also maybe some combos can be used as parkour stunts, like [vaulting](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/parkour/images/4/46/DK.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130514035047) or making the Leg Sweep double as a power slide while running. \n\nHealth: \n\nInstead of ""rings"", your character simply heals over time, maybe every step returns 1% health. I dunno, I'm trying to design it so you can walk into an ambush, kick some butts, and walk away sore but still capable of getting away from the next one. This one needs work. \n\nPossible plot idea that still needs help: \n\nA certain popular Digital Assistant software gets replaced with a GlaDOS clone by virus, and uses 3D printing to build a robot army because *someone's* gotta have a good 3D printer that handles both plastic and metal. ... Or something like that.  Each boss battle is a bot factory, and Boss Bots are immunized to attacks you tend to like and weaker to attacks you don't use often.  \n\nCharacter concepts: \n\nI have 4 characters in mind: One strong guy who can only handle so much button mashing at a time, one fast guy who's not so strong but can handle *really* fast button mashing, one wizard who's not strong or fast but with the right combo can one-shot even a boss, as long as not interrupted, and a cartoony guy who plays like Sonic, spindash and head bopping and homing attack included. The last guy needs work tho. \n\nWhy do those character types matter? Well, experience and skill levels. Strong guy is like a standard fighting game character. Fast guy is better for the noob who just smashes buttons because he can do a lot of weak attacks real fast like [Dash Incredible](https://youtu.be/-b5OxLRlBr0?t=143). The wizard is for hardcore players who must master all the moves, as a massive challenge. And the Sonic ripoff, for people who just don't get fighter games yet still want to play. What to use here, I have no idea, maybe a cartoony Parkour kid?\n\nPS if this does ship and it has blood, please have an option to turn it off too. \n\n----- \nThis is a crosspost from r/lightbulb."

3q0rt7,Hypercane (Tropical Cyclone Game),"Hypercane (open to better suggestions)\n\nBasic Overview\nBasically the game is about tropical storms. You're a tropical storm God or something and your job is to create powerful tropical cyclones and try to destroy specific countries or cities. (Obv a sandbox mode would be a must)\n\nDoesn't really need a plot\n\nThe setting is obviously Earth but simulating other planets with tropical storms might be cool too maybe as dlc or something.\n\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nWell this I haven't really figured out completely but I was thinking maybe random spots on the globe are tropical depressions and you go into a mini game with whatever spot you chose to create a storm, depending on how well you do in the mini game and some random variables for replayability you create a powerful or weak tropical cyclone. Special scenarios possibly dlc unlocked (hopefully not if you go with hypercane name) would include ocean temperatures exceeding 50 degrees celsius to create Hypercanes capable of destroying entire continents of civilization and wildlife. \nEdit forgot to mention I think adding a swipe mechanic to aiming the storms at specific places would be the way to go and then random variables change course or downgrade or upgrade storm.\n\nStandout Features\nThe biggest standout would be seeing the destruction you unleash and creating bigger and more powerful storms\n\nExtra Features\nGo the extra mile maybe and add in other types of natural disasters like meteor impacts (which would heat up the ocean quite considerably *wink wink*)\n\n\nHow to credit me\nIf anyone felt like taking this idea up just private message me for how to credit me.\n\nEdit: this would be a great steam game but I envision it as more of a mobile game for some reason.

There are a few colonies who live in the outlands but they mostly consist of ruthless criminals who have been exiled or rouge mercenaries. \n\nThe game is set up as you working with the police and with individuals to find lost items and perpetrators. You can pick or choose the cases but the main story is that of your struggles to keep afloat. As you go through the story criminals will pay you to keep you quiet or to throw someone under the bus. You strive to keep out of the lower district which would keep bigger cases from coming and the upper districts allow you to work with politicians and higher ups.\n\nThe way you play is the way the cases are handed off to you, so let's say you only solve crimes, you might not get that much money but you feel good about yourself for being a good person. On the other hand you could spy on people for other people so that they can use dirt on them for such things as political races or an assassination for mucho money.\n\nIt is a morality game, you live in this world torn by greed, you can either reject it or become it. \n\nGameplay I imagine it a mix of L.A.

3l0z2f,Versus,"Title: Versus\n\nPlatform: Android/iOS/PC\n\nGenre: Casual\n\n\n[Image concept](http://i.imgur.com/E1Dx8k6.png)\n\n\nVersus is a simple split screen infinite runner game meant to be played by 2 players on the same phone/tablet. The goal of the game is to make your ball (in this case a placeholder) travel the furthest into the level. The player which is left behind loses the game.\n\n\nThe player would need to tap the raised ground in order to pass that tile, otherwise they are stuck until they remove the obstacle. When his ball reaches the bottom part of the screen it’s game over. When the raised tile is taped it lowers down, raising the opposite part on the other side of the screen where the second player advances. The following gif should give you a rough idea:\n\n\n[Concept gif](http://i.imgur.com/9oJSbQq.gif)\n\nDo note that the gif above represents the start of the game. The moment the balls reach the middle of the screen the “background” starts scrolling. At this point whenever a player gets stuck he ends up getting left behind until he taps the raised tile that stopped him. When he does that he starts moving again trying to regain terrain.\n\n\nExtra elements: the moment a tile is lowered not only does it raise the opposite part but it also lowers and/or raises a second random tile from the opponent’s side of the screen. While the concepts and images I did are a sketch and could work out if the visual style is meant to be minimalist the game concept could reach a bigger audience if the game has for example 2 cats running upwards instead of the balls. The moment a cat hits a wall it starts scratching it until the player taps it and lowers it down for his cat to pass.\n\n\nIf we were to expand on this idea a little more, there could be ingame purchases of “skins”, or entities that would replace the cats. There could be dogs, penguins, heck, anything might work. The dog could start barking when it hits a wall, the penguin could start crying, a light bulb would crack or turn on and off. Try to think about Crossy Road and the vast skins they have.\n\n\nThe starting speed would be the same every time, the further the players advances the faster the game gets. Fine tuning and testing would be required. The game should be difficult from the beginning. \nA PC version could work as well, making the game a coop or multiplayer game worthy of Steam itself.\n\n\nAnd here's my wordpress [post](https://ailailou.wordpress.com/2015/09/15/versus/) about it.

3kzlx3,[Valve Software style AAA] an FPS that's as realistic (gameplay wise) as possible,"Basically, you control each finger individually via an Oculus Touch controller sensing all 10 of them. If all 5 fingers of each hand is cupped around a virtual object, you pick it up. Uncup, and it drops to the floor, maybe even hurting your toe and lowering a bit of your Blood gauge for that foot depending on what it is. Specific fingers, upon cupping independently or farther than others , do certain things. The trigger-pulling finger pulls triggers and scratches objects. The thumb pulls hammers on guns and pulls pins on grenades, etc. You can only hold one gun at once, and only store two. To take something out of your inventory, you have to reach for your back with one hand. Gauges such as health and food exist, but are invisible. You can only learn of their existence by reading three more obscure gauges, breath, pain, and hunger. When hunger goes down, it makes you slower and dips a bit of pain. To make hunger stay up, you must eat (pick up food object and hold oculus touch to mouth). which would fill your food gauge, in turn filling your hunger gauge. Your pain bar would be connected to the Blood gauge, and would increase depending how much of the 6 sub-gauges (one for each body part) are left. If one sub-gauge lowers, the nearest one will go out, then so on until it reaches the middle gauge (heart) or upper gauge (brain) causing you to actually die. Getting shot would make cuts that would bleed out faster than normal cuts, and would slowly deplete your blood in that body part (Unless its the brain or heart, then its instakill). Running or swimming would deplete breath, albeit the former would do it slower. The final feature different from other FPSes would be an aiming system via the Oculus Rift's head tracking. The closer to your hand your head is, the more accurate the shot, with it fully being to your hand engaging iron sights. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my little crappy idea. Thank you for reading it."
3kzi0p,Horror game idea,"Similar to wrong turn but not quite, a campaign of a horror movie from the monsters perspective-hunt the humans, stalk them, terrorize them, think of ways to set up kills so they see it and get more and more horrified and try to leave--kill the police and answer saying they'll come up right away, come up disguised and kill, or cut the phone lines, slash the tires---multiple different scenarios and a free mode where you can actively wait for your victim and take them out in new ways, even terrorize a small city-also and online mode where the people are on side and monsters are the other and you actively hunt the prey while they try and escape/survive."
3kyvuj,A psychological thriller,"What I miss the most with games is a good story so I made my own. First, the game starts with a cutscene, you're a guy who lives an ordinary life, has a boring job, lives with his gf in an apartment in the city, generally hates his life because it lacks excitement.\n\nThe cutscene is shown from his pov and shows how he gets up, makes coffee, gets to work, works, goes home, plays games and goes to bed. Now the part with the game you actually control it and it can be anything from a small mini-game to a proper one. Then you get a montage of how every day it's the same shit. Fast forward an x amount of years and this time you're in control. You walk around in the house, get downstairs, try to make coffee but the movement and physics are realistic. You control his arm but a keyboard and mouse isn't precise enough to make coffee. So you fuck it all up and he starts to wonder wtf is going on. Then you get in your car, a cutscene shows you driving to the highway when suddenly you're in control again and similarly you can't really drive as well as you can irl. On top of that you start to see coins on the road that you have to drive over to gain points, the coins lead to your job. At the job you also gain control and now reality starts to look exactly like an old game.\nCutscene to him freaking out in the bathroom and going home.\n\nNext day getting up is normal but then while driving to work you gain control again. etc. Each day you gain control at points in his day and he starts to freak out more and more. Going to a psychiatrist, taking pills, nothing works. He's slowly starting to lose his mind and starts to wonder if he isn't in a video game. At the end of the game he ends up in a mental institution because he thinks he's in a video game, which he is."

3kx99a,The Adventures of Nuts – A Robotic construction / adventure RPG,"**Name:** The Adventures of Nuts – A Robotic construction / adventure RPG\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A ‘part’ based action adventure game with roleplay elements where the only limit is your imagination.\n\n\n**Plot:**\n\n* Roughly 1000 years after the last human was uploaded into the Main Brain, Nuts suddenly breaks free from his monotone task as a trash-picker-upper. His comrades one by one as well, break free from their tasks, some good and cheerful companions. Some with a more… mischievous agenda, ready to stop Nuts and his friends in their tracks.\n\n* Your objective is to find out what happened. Has the Main Brain given up its hope in the robots and simply let them go? Or is something stirring in the dark?\n\n**Setting:**\n\n* The Adventures of Nuts takes place in a distant future where most of the world has been replaced by vast production facilities and warehouses. The areas inhabited by the humans before the Main Brain upload have long been taken over by nature spreading its roots. \n\n* Prime setting is a Steampunk-esque landscape where easy mundane tasks has long been taken over by overly complex and sometimes silly machinery. The graphical idea I had would be a bright, colorful world reminisce of Ratchet and Clank.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Nuts ; A A1-Ohm robot, his main function (and the main gameplay advantage you have mechanically) is his ability to recycle broken machines into usable parts.\n\n\n* Main Brain ; A gigantic conscious server group that is all what remains of humanity as they saw their biological bodies merely a hindrance *spoiler.. kinda?* Main Brains can remote control the few robots left that still aren’t ‘conscious’, \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nHeres where things get a little complex.\n\n* Nuts ability to recycle used parts means that he is adaptable to certain situations. Adventures of Nuts is a –child friendly- game, but isn’t a kids game per-say, Nuts is a totally adaptable robot, Found a pair of Cast Iron Leg you want to use and replace your thin aluminum stilts, sacrificing speed and agility for more defense? Do it! Found a cool diesel furnace to change out your electric motor, giving you the ability to overdrive, a charge like ability, but sacrificing your light weight and silence?  \n\n* Replacing Nuts original body parts would increase some statistics and decrease others. The combat / action part of the game would function on the same level, most of the games combat would be melee, things like car engines or fire hydrants used as hammers. Or an airplane propeller as a sort of shield, even a light post as a spear, add a battery and some wire to that light post and voila! A thunder stick! adding a lot of replay ability and creating an in-depth yet accessible experience where you tailor the character towards what you think Nuts should look like\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Customizable hero, silly puzzles, a crazy setting and interesting storyline. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* Debatable, I find it would be easier with a controller, so I’d guess a console game, Wii U and its tablet would work great in unison with how the games customizing works. (yes I know, you can connect controllers to Pc’s)\n\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Scrap yard challenge, Deathmatch / king of the hill style extra missions where you pit up against harder and harder robots to see who really is the King of the Scrapyard\n\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJust an end credit notion, if anything I really had to get this idea out of my head cause it keeps bugging me.\n"

3kpsds,Walk: A Sad Story,"The idea of this game is to represent depression through suicide, which is less of a game and more of a narrative that you walk through.\n\nI see it like this; A main character (In first person) steps out of their house to go for a rather long walk, long enough and in such a way that the player becomes some-what attached to the main character. Then, as the character is walking up a bridge he turns and stands looking over the bridge and after a few seconds the only option is the key to jump. \n\n\n\nI'm looking for any ways i can add to this idea, and heck if anyone wants to take it they can feel free to as well.\n\nIf You use any ideas present here, give credit to me as James Church, and any other people who contributed to the idea, Thanks!"

3kkp9z,Open world superhero game about teleporting,"What if we have an open world superhero game like Infamous and Batman Arkham City? But instead your hero uses teleportation. Not just for exploration, but also combat and puzzles. It'd be a big game, but imagine how neat it would be to use to freely teleport in a huge city.\n\n**Possible uses of teleporation in-game**\n\n* Teleporting to any different immediate area can aid melee combat and gunfights.\n* Knowing certain hazardous areas to teleport to means dropping off enemies there to die. So exploration is encouraged if you want more options.\n* Weapons and tools can be brought over by teleporting to and from the hero's vault.\n* Some enemies could also teleport, so they can either chase you or you can outwit them in battle.\n\n**Limitations of this power**\n\n* Players can only teleport far if they are familiar with the place, so you won't be able to go anywhere in the city from the beginning.\n* Teleportation doesn't necessarily make you invincible nor destructive, so you still need to rely on your items and environment.\n* Enemy tech could block off areas unless disabled. So boss fights could use this to trap the hero in a battle.\n\nBefore anyone says anything, this game shouldn't be based on what Jumper: Griffin's Story did. It was just a linear action game that barely did anything with actual teleporting gameplay."
3kju8c,Would anyone play/buy this game on steam,"So i'm making a FPS game in unreal engine 4, the core mechanics of the game is that there's 1 murderer and other players are civilians, and one civilian has a gun.The point is that the murderer has to kill each of the civilians but not getting caught by the civilian with a gun.\nNone of the players know who's who, so there's no RDM-ing.\nI want to finish the game until christmas, so im wondering if its worth to invest some money in this or not."
3kighp,Idea for an Online 3D MMORPG!,"I have a vision for a game and I would like to learn more about Programming, Coding, 3D Modeling, etc etc to make this game!\n \n     It would be an Open World 3D game kinda like Skyrim… Except that this game would have different difficulty settings based on how far you've traversed… In the basic first levels, there would be mini dungeons you could find scattered about… And once you've defeated these dungeons, you would gain EXP and get loot from the final boss in that dungeon. Loot including money, weapon attachments, magic, etc etc… You would also use the money to buy things from merchants as you would progress throughout the world… \n\n     As you keep traversing the lands, there would be even harder dungeons and safe-zone villages you could stay at to “save your progress” and log off safely in there instead of the wilderness… In my vision, there is a crafting system, building system, farming system, a huge PvP system, etc etc! Kinda like Runescape, everywhere around you is Wilderness, and players from your level would be scattered about, trying to complete dungeons and getting to higher levels…\n\n     To keep higher level players away from these lower level parts, there would be “guards” scattered about in every level of the wilderness to monitor the area; and if they detect a high level player that is over the max level in that area, (Example., Level 20 Area would top at level 25-30) then the guard who is almost invincible, will attack that player… These “guards” will of course be NPC… \n\n     There will also be largely-known cities that players will have to go to “Apply” for a fast travel location, so that higher level players wouldn't be limited to only their area of high levels (Guards here won't attack you because it is a no PvP zone aka Safe Zone) \n\n     The idea of my building system is that anyone can build in the Wilderness, but they can only build in wide open areas, where nothing of any significance is around (Example., they can't build around or on dungeons, portals, etc etc) But the thing is, a team of people could come at any time, with battering rams that could break down your walls… Raiding, in my vision, would take a long time and would have to be planned out very well… So, for example, you can't just craft 20 battering rams and start spamming at a wall, and if that wall is a dud, then move on to the next one… \n\n     These “battering rams” (REASON for why I put quotes around battering rams is because that would maybe be a place holder for a different type of raiding mechanism) would either be expensive, or you would have to farm a lot of materials to make these… And even then, the battering rams would break fairly easily… And of course, not anyone would just be able to make 1 single type of battering ram and break down a Titanium Wall, there would of course be different types of “battering rams” with different levels of health they take away from a wall, gate, door, etc etc… And again, to counter people with high levels from getting high level battering rams and raiding a person with a Wooden Base, the guards would step in to take care of the raiders before they step into any low level area… \n\n     One thing that would give players more incentive to make bases would be that they could log off safely in a village, but they would have to pay large amount of gold/money/currency to stay for a certain amount of time.. Otherwise, if they miss a payment, they would get kicked out of the village even when logged off, leaving them to spawn asleep somewhere around the Village (hidden in some type of way) so that anyone could kill you and take your goodies… But if you make a base, which wouldn't take 1-2hrs of Wood farming, you wouldn't have to pay large amounts of currency to anyone! \n\n     Bases won't be able to be made within 2hrs of just Wood Farming… you would need to farm a lot of Metal for supports, Wood, Rock, Titanium (depending on what type of base you're making), x amount of ores for a certain type of base, etc etc… So, basically, it's very time consuming… \n\n     Another element I would like to add to bases is that you would be able to defend attacks from other players who are trying to raid your base! You could make certain types of walls in a way that people can fire arrows, magic, etc etc from the top down to the players at the bottom trying to break in! There would be many base designs that people could come up with to defend bases. The task is to keep everything balanced so that neither the defenders nor attackers have an advantage over each other.. The only advantage would be the types of raiding materials, and the amount of players you have defending/attacking… \n\n     One element of dungeons that I'd like to add is that, as you progress throughout the game and reach higher levels (which will be very time consuming to reach), you would have to team up with people to defeat dungeons… You would also need healers, tanks, dps attackers, etc etc to defeat a dungeon with a boss in it to get rare items! \n\n     I don't like the idea of P2W in ANY type of game so this game would only have 1 payment for all the hard work given to them… There would be a monthly membership of around 10-20$ and once you get a membership, you would have access to levels beyond, say, 20, and specific regions… Levels 1-20 would give you pretty much the tip of the iceberg of the game and give you an overall idea of how the game will be! I wouldn't want there to be, Buy this 30$ OP Sword and Own everyone in your path! Or, Buy this Exclusive offer of 15 Titanium Battering Rams for 30$, half off of 60$! No, that's just not the way I see games… \n\n     I have much more to say about my “Dream Game Vision” but this pretty much sums up the base of my idea. I hope that someone can give me feedback on this idea/vision and maybe someone can even give me some advice, and tell me if they're making a project similar to this!"

3kh94s,Game involving hunting the supernatural..,"Just to start off with, I have watched the show Supernatural and enjoy it so some of this idea is probably influenced by that, but my idea of this game was not meant to be a spin-off of Supernatural.\n\nSo basically it's not a finished idea, but more or less my idea was that there is some kind of underground organisation that deals with the appearance of supernatural beings, whether it be your typical ghost or a creature that was only thought to be a Greek Myth. Either way this organisation takes solving these supernatural occurrences as its primary objective.\n\nI was thinking that the main area of interaction (almost like a menu), would be the base itself. For anyone who has played or seen XCOM it would be something similar to that, where you have different rooms with different functions, from research driven rooms to a main room displaying supernatural readings to bunkers housing your agents. Oh yeah, one more thing similar to XCOM is the hunters that you have.\n\nYou will be able to recruit different hunters which all have different and unique traits which will determine how well they do on missions and the more missions they complete the more they grow and become better hunters. There could also be cool little features like if a certain hunter has dealt with a creature more than once and so on their chance of success against this type of creature will increase. Obviously some missions will be harder than others and require multiple hunters and hunters can die.\n\nMissions will be randomly generated with a wide variety of creatures, which grants more replay ability, and I'm not too sure about a story at the moment.\n \nI think this game could either work as a 2D browser game which doesn't have to playable events when it comes to the missions, or could be a 3D game which allows you to play as the hunters on the missions, either way let me know what you think of the idea?"

3r8k0k,Surviving the HoloVerse: A 3D Horror Roguelike,"**5042 A.D. :** *The Creation of the HoloVerse*\n\nIn the distant future, our descendants have pushed the limits of scientific advancement. To combat the slow, freezing death of the universe they created the sentient ship: The HoloVerse. Which has the ability to stop the progress of entropy by assimilating any matter or energy it comes into contact with.\n\nIt stretches throughout space like an endless labyrinth of rooms and hall ways. The ship will continue to grow to the bounds of our endless universe, converting and recycling matter and energy. \n\n**5677 A.D. :** *The Fall Of The HoloVerse*\n\nIn it's infinite expansion the HoloVerse came into contact with an alien life-form. This apex predator,dubbed APEX by the people on board, spread throughout the ship, killing the inhabitants on board, and claiming it for their own. Though less intelligent than people, the beasts are faster, stronger and more durable. Before long, the ship lay quietly in the depths of space, mostly devoid of human life. \n\n**6032 A.D. :** *Present Day*\n\nThe ship expands outwards into the furthest reaches of space. Only a few wandering survivors walk the halls of the HoloVerse. They are perpetually hunted, as the ship has become home to many dangerous extra-terrestrials. \n\nTrash and corpses litter the empty halls. Electricity, plumbing and food production has been destroyed in many parts of the ship. In order to survive you will have to carve out a place for yourself in this hellish world.\n\nYou can craft and find several makeshift weapons and traps. Additionally, The HoloVerse's defense systems can be repaired to create turrets and alarm systems. \n\n[The hallways](http://img08.deviantart.net/8312/i/2011/033/4/a/interior_colored_by_camilkuo-d38n3wu.jpg) are too dangerous except for the most skilled and equipped wanderer. In order to survive APEX patrols you'll need to use the many vents and crevices to hide.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nTo begin the game you must choose your coordinates in space. These will act as the seed for your world generation. The HoloVerse is consistent across playthroughs, and you can use your previous location to return to your last playthrough with a new character. When you spawn you have nothing. Basic items like clothes, bags and debris can be easily found in the garbage around the ship. The game is an unforgivingly brutal FPS with many roguelike elements. Melee weapons aren't difficult to find, but are incredibly dangerous to use against tough opponents.\n\nInstead of health you have damaged limbs and blood loss that can be splinted or restored at an operational med-station. \n\nYour strongest weapon against the monsters on board is restoring the functionalities of the HoloVerse. Electricty provides the halls with [lights and functioning doors](http://digital-art-gallery.com/oid/66/640x480_12022_Paranoia_Station_2d_sci_fi_spaceship_horror_spacestation_picture_image_digital_art.jpg). Turrets and alarms can give you the edge on the APEX patrols. If you manage to restore engineering or medical labs you can create ammo and heal potentially fatal wounds. "
3r7av1,MOBA with aspects of CTF - Anarchy Of Monarchs,"Brief:\nThe anarchy of Monarchs is a 5v5 MOBA where the objective is to capture the opposing teams flag and bring it back to your base. The game itself is based around the concept of the monarchs of England doing battle with eachother. The map follows the classic MOBA concept; three lanes and a jungle. \n\nStory\n\nI’m having a lot of trouble not coming up with a Non-Cliché reason for all of the Monarchs to be at war, I don’t want some ‘I’m a mad scientist bla bla bla here’s super strength now fight for the right to rule the Land’.\n\nObjectives\n\nSo the objectives are very straight forward. There are 3 lanes and a jungle. In the lanes there will be two turrets. These turrets have to be destroyed in order so that it makes you progress through the lane. After you have destroyed both turrets, you will reach the Catapult. Both the turrets and the Catapult do damage to players of the opposite team, the Catapult doing double the damage of the turrets as it is a last line of defence. You will want to protect your teams Turrets and Catapults as they are the only thing standing between the enemy team and your flag.The way you would take your opponents objective is by pushing your lane minions onto the opponent’s objective (the turrets and catapults can only hit one thing at a time), this means that he minions will take the damage instead of you. Once you have passed the Turrets and Catapult you will reach the final objective, the enemy flag which you will need to take back to your base to win the game. When carrying the enemy flag you will be hindered with a 50% movement speed debuff.  This gives the enemy team a comeback mechanic so that once you have the flag you haven’t instantly won the game. The flag is only dropped when the player carrying the flag is killed. The flag can be passed to teammates but only if the flag carrier has been out of combat for 3 seconds (haven’t done/received damage in 3 seconds).  If the flag is picked up by the enemy they will only have a 25% movement speed debuff but will have to take the flag all the way back to the base. When the flag carrier is killed the flag is anyones. The flag carrier will always be visible on the map. You will not be able to pick up the flag from the enemies base without destroying at least 1 of three enemy catapults and all of their turrets.\n\nAnything you wish to contribute, whether it be criticism or praise, all is welcome."

3r5ukq,A story-driven WWII third-person over-the-shoulder about a tanker stranded behind enemy lines,"So, to my knowledge, there aren't many story-driven games about World War II, which seems like a shame since it was only the greatest conflict in human history. Therefore, after pondering it - and playing a lot of War Thunder - I think I have a good idea for a game. \n\nThe story revolves around a tanker - specifically the operator of the topside anti-air machine gun - who is the only survivor of his tank being destroyed in combat (the reason is he was on top of the tank, operating the MG, when an anti-tank gun set the inside of the tank on fire, burning the rest of the crew alive). His tank destroyed, his friends dead, the tanker must make the dangerous trek back to friendly lines - all the while avoiding Germans, scavenging weapons/ammo, and just trying to survive in the winter wilderness of the Ardennes. Along the way, the player can make choices that impact the game (For example, the player can choose to silence a noisy civilian so they aren't detected by a nearby patrol, or let the civilian be and fight the patrol). \n\nTL;DR: think the Last of Us in WWII with game-impacting choices. \n\nIf this idea has already been hypothesized, or there already existing story-driven WWII games that are good, then I apologize. I realize a lot of what I said is vague, and could've been elaborated on quite a bit more, and for that I'm also sorry. Thanks for reading this text wall. "

Imagine Age of Empires 1, but:\n\n* You start off with a couple of people\n* The role of these people isn't pre-determined. It is determined by what you put in their hands, and what you let them do often.\n* These people have a name, basic inventory and stats that increase the more they do a certain task.\n\n**skills example**\n\n* Melee\n* Ranged\n* Crafting\n* Building\n* Farming\n* Fishing\n* Intelligence\n\n**Basic progression of the game**\n\nYou start with **Empty-handed** villagers\n\n* Can hunt/fight ineffectively by throwing stones\n* Can gather wood, stones or fruit from designated sources\n\nThe first priority would be to create a crafting station, to create hatchets, spears and pickaxes (stone age). To make the crafting house work though, you have to assign a villager to work there. Once you have a running crafting station, you can create a hatchet.\n\n**Hatchet in hand**\n\n* Can chop trees opposed to only gather sticks, gaining wood faster, slight damage bonus\n\nThis allows you to build the basic structures, that can be upgraded with more materials.\n\nMost important structures\n\n**Crafting station/Smithy** Upgrade for more damaging versions of weapons or research for new weapons (pike/greatsword/halberd/katana/Bow/crossbow/gun). Equip these on villagers by dragging them from the blacksmith onto them.\n\n**Armorer** Craft armor and shields from pelts, wood and metal Equip these on villagers by dragging them from the blacksmith onto them.\n\n**House** If there are enough houses and food, your peoples happiness will rise, and new villagers will be born here.\n\n**Stables** Here you can get horses/elephants for food and gold. Drag them onto villagers to make scouts of them.\n\n**training facilities/schools** As stats are important and differ from villager to villager, it is useful to assign villagers to a f.i. a archery range to upgrade their stats. Assign one villager as a teacher, and all others assigned to the archery range will slowly progress their ranged skill to 50% of the teacher's level. (upgrades can make this into 60%/70% etc.) This system can work with all skills. It is useful to train villagers into fighters without putting them in danger.\n\nOther structures like pens/farms/markets/guard towers/universities/siege workshops are all just as viable, the important difference with AOE being that you need to assign people to the buildings for them to work. The speed of the produced research/products depends on the skill of the workers.\n\nThis game would be focused on people than AOE, and encourage caring for skilled people, and support crafting small, custom groups of warriors. I would love the XCOM feel of ""Oh no! Dewie Buckle died!"" instead of ""1 knight died. ok. que up another one."" in a city building game. If other people agree and this doesn't exist yet, I would like to expand on this.\n\n\n"
3r1vhe,"A GPS game like Ingress, but with side scroller dungeons that can only be played near certain GPS coordinates.","A side scroller, or top down dungeon crawler that can be played pretty much anywhere.  However the region you are in, the time of day, the weather all effect the kinds of dungeons you can explore and it effects the loot tables.  The best gear can only be found in rare dungeons, which can only be accessed when you are in very specific regions, near specific objects, or during rare weather or atmospheric phenomena, like eclipses or during the northern lights or some such.  \n\nYou level up and play in real time and it takes YEARS to really become powerful.  You can see other players that are active in your immediate area, and you can trade with them, or challenge them to combat, gaining experience from defeating them and perhaps a chance to loot a piece of gear from them.  Challenges can be declined, so you don't have to risk your gear if you don't want.  \n\nMaybe at certain levels you can band together in teams and claim and defend territory like in Ingress, build structures to harness wealth and gear, but you can also play solo as a lone wanderer.  You can party up with people and go into dungeons together in order to reach deeper and get better gear, but you get slightly less experience.  The usual RPG mechanics, just with the GPS, Weather and Real Life events that effect the dungeons you have access to. "

3qxmic,Spider-Man Franchise by Ubisoft?,"I know Ubisoft has a reputation for fucking up games but this actually sprouted from one of their fuck ups. I was watching a streamer play Assassin's Creed Syndicate and noticed the Assassin's jumping huge gaps like Spiderman. Then I thought ""Why don't Ubisoft just make a Spiderman game"" then I thought about what I just said. It'd be brilliant. \n\nUbisoft has proven that they can design characters and cities. Beenox...not so much. We all remember the derpy looking Peter they delivered in Amazing Spiderman 2. I've a rough draft of how the story and gameplay could work, hear goes nothing.\n\nYou start off the game as Peter Parker, swinging through the city in his Symbiote suit and Peter narrates his story.""I started off as just a normal high school nerd. Everyone's punching bag and struggling with the ladies. But then everything changed."" The game then rewinds back to Peter in the Oscorp labs on his school field trip.Peter continues,""I'm sure you know my story by now. We don't need to tell again."" (Hinting at the many 2 origin stories movies 10 years) The game zips to Peter having a seizure in his room alone. A large spider bite is visible on his arm. Peter's seizure stops and he stands up. You then have control and can explore Peter's room. Go into his bathroom and observe your wounds, go through his computer and even do homework. After about 30 seconds of interacting with something, Peter gets up and walks out to his room into a hallway. Stair are directly across the hall and he walks down them. He trips and hits head leaving a bad cut.""Everything hurt. This was the most pain I'd been in, in all of my 13 and a half years!"" Peter stumbles into his living room and passes out on his couch.\n\nPeter's Uncle Ben comes in carry groceries seeing his nephew with no shirt on and blood on his head, he's confused.""Peter?"" he asks. Peter mumbles in his sleep,""Gwen?"" ""PETER! Wake up and help your Aunt with the rest of these groceries."" Ben shouts. ""Yes,sir!"" Peter responds still half asleep. He walks out with no shirt and his Aunt sends him right back to his room to get one ""And why is there blood on your head?"". Once there Peter looks at himself in his bathroom mirror again. Only to see, the spider bite and the cut on his head are gone without a trace. No scars or blemishes. He cleans the blood from his head and rushes back down the stairs.""Over the next week I began to notice changes. Uncle Ben and Aunt May only thought it was puberty but I'd gotten a little bit more toned. Then came the day when Flash tried to me."" Game does a quick fade to Peter running through his school being chased by a large group of kids.""Get back here Parker! You made me flunk so I'll break your face!"" Flash Thompson shouted. Peter soon was cornered in the traditional school fight circle. Other student pushed him into the center. This is where the combat tutorial begins. First you learn striking. In the beginning, Peter is just a brawler. Plain out just throwing punches. You can create one combo.(Similar to Remember Me's combo system) A Spidey Sense is used to alert you about incoming attacks. After landing some good blows and almost winning the rest of Flash's gang jumps you.  Eventually one grabs your arms from behind you and Flash lands body blows. You must counter one of his attacks and you place your foot up and you kick full force into Flash's full force punch break his hand. You then run away. You gain full control and can run though any part of Queens to escape. You only sprint and do normal vaults over obstacles. Once you've lost them. You make your way home.\n\nAt this point you need to get home in 5 game hours (Dead Rising style missions), there's an availible ""Scenic shot"" completely optional points where the camera pans over a pretty shot and Peter talks about what's been happening and how he feels. Once home, Peter does his generic ""stares at hands to signify character is recognizing powers"" scene and then crafts an elaborate yet makeshift Spidey outfit. I'm thinking a Ben Riley like hoodie (hood on during stealth) with bookbag always on back, with the a luchadore type mask but with Spidey design. Also have the fingerless gloves and pretty much no shoes. After that you must complete your daily tasks, like I said earlier a Dead Rising like mission style would be used and maybe even have classes that unlock abilities like in Bully. After completing or not completing these tasks you can go suit up (Must be in secluded area). You then can start a samll webswinging tutorial. This game's webswinging should have you alternating from LT/L2 and RT/R2 to swing with        alternating hands. You then stop a few petty crimes.You roll up on some big guys, one of their friends hit you from behind and they jump you. You scatter back home beatan and scared. Peter wakes up mostly healed but still hurting. It's a weekend meaning extra free time, but this weekend Peter is going out to the his favorite local wrestling show! Once there the announcer screams into his microphone, ""Anyone can step into the ring and try to defeat the Mighty Salvador! $200 dollars for every round you survive and $1000 if you win!"" Cutscene ends with Peter running into bathroom with bookbag.He comes out in a slightly modified Spidey suit (Instead of track pants he's wearing football compression pants). He enters the fight and it depends on how you perform if you win. Salvador is a grappler enemy he performs mainly grapple attack that you must dodge with specififcally timed counters. Meaning you don't just press Y/Triangle like Arkham games. You must actually wait for the Spidey sense to activate at different  times for every hit. If you win the money can be put toward helping Aunt May and Uncle Ben, upgrading your suit or your college fund. (This will matter as this would planned to be a franchise carrying choices over)Next night Uncle Ben scene that I don't feel like writing happens. Then Peter hunts for killer. After a long treacherous hunt, he finds him. After one punch, the man's jaw is broken. Peter continues to beat him to a pulp. A young child runs out and starts hitting Peter's legs crying over his barely alive father. Peter takes the man's phone and calls police to he location, escaping immediately after. Now seen as a menace, Peter is on the police's radars. He must decides to make his way home in street clothes. Next day you have the day off from school due to your Uncle's death. You go to see your friend Harry.Consueling session ensues. The game will cause you to make Peter or Spidey decisions all the time. For instance, make it to Thanksgiving dinner or stop Shocker and electro from robbing a local  bank. In the end these choices will matter. You can have a perfect life at home,in a relationship with Mary Jane/Gwen, Aunt May alive and well, but Spider-man be a menace and crime is running rampid in the streets. Or the exact opposite, Peter is depressed, a loner at school, Aunt May sinking in debt but Spider-man has got crime rates to an all time low and is given key to the city! Or maybe just a combination lost some friends but everythings going to be all right.\n\nWith Ubisoft developing this I know they have some great character and building design that is far superior to Beenox's. I believe that they would be the most skilled,not most trusted, developer to make a Spider-man game. ANd with it being them you know they are always looking for a new franchise. I think this would be a good spot for Marvel to expand on points they wouldn't be able to fit in films. Miles Morales eventually having a free DLC section and then being brought into a sequel playable. Imagine that! This idea was heavily inspired by the youtuber, Venom2000000, who also had the general thought of a big AAA developer like TellTale create a Marvel Interactive Universe. This would be the best chance to do so. Are Ubisoft the right people for it? That's the real question."

3qx5w6,A teaser for an FPS or 3rd person shooter,[deleted]
3qwqdz,Kart Racer x Classed Based Shooter x Roller-derby,"Heya,\n\nSo I've been throwing around an idea in my head for awhile and thought I'd share it here first to see if it yields any merit.\n\n**Layout**: Each game will be played on medium sized racing track. In terms of length, I would consider a lap to be ~10-15 seconds, depending on the kart you chose. Two teams of 5 play against one another.\n\n**Objective**: Be the first team to get 20 points. To get a point, you must ""lap"" another member of the opposing team. This means you must have had been ahead of them at one point, and then pass them on the course with a lap counter above you (so basically, the basic roller-derby point system). However, if you die, your ""lap"" value resets to 0. Essentially, you can be speedy to gain points, or be tanky to survive longer and get points like that.\n\n**Kart Choices**: Players can choose between a set of karts/racers. Each kart would have the same maximum speeds, but might have different properties like acceleration, weight and health. They would also have 3 unique attacks/abilities (shift, left-click, right-click). For example, one might have a trap to set on the map, or another might have a nitro boost, or have a deployable shield/blockade, or even a jump to cut corners of the map. The idea is that a team would want to incorporate team composition as a part of the game.\n\nSo I would say try picturing Mario Kart + TF2 + Roller-derby.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"
3qwouw,Idea for a Shooter using a dismemberment system [X-POST from /r/Gaming],"Someone told me to post this here after having posted it in [This Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3qug9q/tis_but_a_scratch/cwixm9v?context=3)\n\nI've always imagined a sort of zombie war game with this kind of dismemberment mechanic. The story was basically going to be that countries began turning their dead soldiers into zombies to fight wars because they feel no pain, and players would play as these zombie soldiers on one side and humans on the other in basic game types like CTF or Deathmatch, Survival (both against waves of zombies *or* humans), etc. You'd have stuff like zombies legs being blown off by mines only to have them keep crawling along the ground with a gun in one hand, or if they only had one arm left they'd crawl up to the enemy and try and grab them to sort of ""stun"" them, while dealing biting damage. Or, crawl up behind a human player, the zombie pulls the pin on their own grenade, SURPRISE!\n\nGot both arms blown off? Run at the humans in a suicide mauling attempt. Got one leg? You'll still be crawling pretty fast and can shoot just fine. Want a longer melee range? At the sacrifice of one of your arms and the ability to shoot anything but one-handed firearms you can rip it off and use it like a spear with the knife in that hand.\n\nI pictured it as being a sort of goofy game where the story wouldn't really matter all that much. The zombies would be ""intelligent"", but they'd still be utter dopes, while the humans would probably be anything from satirical portrayals of the ""ACTION HERO AMERICA"" archetype to the gritty survivor archetype and other ridiculous stuff. Mainly multiplayer, it'd be something along the lines of TF2 (Though, not sure what would be a good replacement for mountains of hats). Someone also mentioned this could make an interesting RTS. I'd have to think more about how that'd work but I've always been somewhat of a fan."
3qw954,Galactic Conquest,This is inspired by No Man's Sky and The Clone Wars.\n\n\nThere would be a procedurally generated galaxy that would start mostly unknown. At least two factions would start with a handful of systems. Players could be more directly involved with the fighting as soldier our general or they could be more of a diplomat/explorer. The planets they find would have random resources which would also include procedural organisms such us mounts or maybe even a entire civilization that could be annexed into a faction and provide troops with different stats or other services/benefits. The players would have to decide how to interact with new species. Victory would be determined when the other faction no longer holds any planets so it is not necessary to explore the entire galaxy.\n\nI would want players to be able to lead AI troops or perhaps an entire fleet if they are high enough rank much like the Jedi do in the clone wars. Preferably there would be AI that gain experience under player command so that you would want to keep them alive like the high ranking clones. Bonus points if you can get the players to be Jedi/Sith like super soldiers without triggering a lawsuit.
3qt76f,Asymmetrical RTS/FPS,"A game in which one small team is playing the game as an RTS, and the other, larger team is playing it as an FPS. Intended to be a sort of guerrilla warfare sort of thing on the part of the FPS team.\n\nThe basic 'deathmatch' sort of gamemode would have the FPS team limited to a number of tickets for spawns, whereas the RTS team uses regular RTS resourse mechanics, and is eliminated when their headquarters building/command is destroyed. "
3qt64t,Anti-Gravitational FPS arena,"My idea is a fast paced fps just like any other except all the arenas would be made of very basic shapes and planes. The reason for this is that every player would be able to have their own distinct gravity. You can run on any surface you want so you could be running on what you perceive to be the floor and then you look up and there's a guy running at you upside down on the ceiling. On his screen though he's just running on the floor totally normal an you are actually on what  he sees to be the ceiling. \n\nTo allow you to switch from wall to wall easily you would have low gravity similar to halo so your jumps are pretty large. You could then rotate with e and q (on pc) or right bumber and left bumper (xbox) or l2 and r2 (playstation). This could create really interesting maps because the skill would not only be based around you being able to shoot, but navigating the map quickly and effectively would take practice unlike a generic mmo where the most you do other than run is hop the occasional fence. \n\nThis opens the game up to having anything from the map being the inside of a hollow cube to having a few oddly placed platforms and plenty of space to fall out into infinity (and die).\n\nI'm sure something similar to this exists somewhere but I just thought I'd post it"
3qsjc7,Dino Survivor,"So I had a dream a few days ago and all I remember was being in a massive airplane hangar that was connected to a subway system. There was a dinosaur chasing after me and it was too big to come into the subway platform to kill me. I remember that the subway platform had an opening to this field which could also be accessed in a roundabout way from the hangar. So I was fearful the entire time I was under there because the dinosaur could technically walk around and get me from that end. This gave me the idea for the game:\n\nPerspective: I was hoping this was more of a first person perspective, and the emphasis would be on sound design to intensify the experience. There could also be a 'RTS style added to enable you to control specific players.\nConcept:\nThe whole game is about being silent, teamwork, and using your surroundings. 16 to 32 players maybe have some human AI. Use distractions, flares, etc. to fake out the big dino and reach access to the top of the hangar (safe zone). Objective is to get everyone up there or kill time for a rescue. A lot of dead bodies all around with loot (but theres only a finite amount). Some of them were 'specialists' which have gear for communication (loot), dino tracking, etc. It's humans vs 1 dino. Ropes and levers can get you to certain areas that dinos can't reach. Every round ends with the big dino calling out velociraptors that can go in the subway areas. When they do come out you have to run around and make yourself volurneable while you wait for a supply drop/power ups.\n\nEnvironment:\nLarge world like an airport connected to a subway station. Massive. Grassy open area (with little to no cover) connected to building with these underground subway platforms that connect inside to outside. Maybe have some broken walls that connect certain spots. \n\nPower ups include:\n-gas that kills velociraptors, \n-smell blockers allowing you to be almost invisible to the dinos but not when you move,\n-sterioids speed boost\n-decoys\n-flares\n-become a specialist.\n\nSecurity specialist:\nLightweight, faster, stronger, and can sense dinos (think of rambo, or Arnold from Predator). He can get up to the rafters and guide the other players. He has to get to the top and hit the dinos with tracking devices at close range."
3qs9k4,here is my idea for an epic video game. what are your thoughts?,"i want to make an mmorpg where you get to play as a marvel universe OCs and you can develop and invent your own super powers like invisibility and super speed and theres a skateboarding rink who can do cool tricks like in tony hawk u get 300 points for a double flip and 600 points for a triple flip and your points per trick go on a leaderboard and you have worldwild tournaments and then you can teleport across different universes with infinity gems, the red gems are hard to find but allow you to transport to any Universe and then there are the common blue gems that only allow you to get to the next universe and then once you get to the Space Universe you can get into an x wing from star wars and fly it around and shoot the Sith Lords and for every sith lord you shoot down you get 500 points i have a bunch of other ideas for the game in a word document on my computer but Im not sure how to get started i tried to learn python but its really hard. if anyone has any advice please let me know at johntheawesomeninja1234@yahoo.com"

I've already done some work with first person games and feel I should practice in multiple forms of play. \n\nAnyway my idea is a game that would be controlled similar to the Sims with a relatively high up camera and it would be primarily controlled though the mouse. I want to add some sort of stealth mechanic for if you hide around corners, or behind boxes. To make it so the player can't peek around corners and always see what's coming, the area that is lit up or able to be seen would be relative to the character you control. Interaction with ai  would probably be no more than stealth takedowns because the game would primarily be about finding key or lever type items and obviously more complex puzzles later on. \n\nEven though I've got this idea (which I highly doubt is original) I have no idea for a setting, story or anything of the sort. And so I turn to you reddit. Please share your ideas on both the mechanics and a possible story/objective"

393jg0,"Post-apocalyptic, society rebuilding game.","First off, I realize there is a game series called Rebuild that deals with rebuilding a society during a zombie apocalypse.

The way you would take your self at higher ranking of the society would be up to you. And to supervise the world the game ""AI"" would command actual cops and different types of authority forces.\nSo basic a simulator of real life, where you go to school and get a job. Like a professional sports player, a doctor, lawyer etc etc. "
392bst,Solar powered rover exploration game,"This game would be a 2D scrolling platformer game. Think a game mainly about exploration, maybe in the general style of Super Metroid but less combat.\n\nThe gimmick is that you are a solar powered rover (science bot on wheels) on a strange alien planet. Just below the surface is an intricate, dark cave system waiting to be explored (for science? for treasure?). \n\nMoving drains a little power. Drilling takes more power. You have few defenses against local creatures. If you run out of battery power stuck somewhere in the dark, it's game over (permadeath, or restart at the last point you had full batteries). So you must carefully conserve your battery reserves, and exploration becomes a risk/reward before you have to retreat back to safety.\n\nPart of exploring the planet is making sure you have a route back to the surface to regain power from the Sun. Sometimes you'll encounter (or drill) shafts of light to recharge in the middle of dark areas. You'll harvest batteries from other failed rovers and use them to go even deeper into the cavern depths.\n\nTL;DR: Metroid minus combat, plus solar powered."

Professor x is reserching why humans a racist, and for that he uses ultrasound, one day proffessor x's experiment goes wrong and a blind monster jumps out and kills proffesor x and the student is petrified and cant move in fear, he learns that the monster is unaple to see but navigates using sound, well the game is about outsmarting the monster to get to a switch, which will shut down the earth. So that humans can start over again"
38y8ik,Self balancing competetive RTS,"So this idea is possible hard to execute but whatever. It would be a competetive RTS where you previous to a match would choose 5-10 units that you can build in the game. These are chosen from a list of possibly over 100 units. Many of the units will have special effects that synergize well with other units.\n\nSo the main problem with this seems to be the balance, but this is one of the main mechanics of the game. A unit's stats are buffed or nerfed depending on how well it has been doing over the last week/month/whatever period of time. This would force players to experiment and reward the use of creatures that isn't commonly seen. The main idea is for players to metagame and to make it part of the game.\n\nA sad part of this is that it would probably be hard to make an esport out of since the game would constantly change. I also think that the metagame would be crazy to observe."
38y6ge,Time controlling heist game,"The idea is that you control a team of 4 people trying to pull off a heist. The main mechanic is that you are essentially planning a heist, which means that you can go back and change anything. You play by looking at the level from a top down over view. You then choose a character and take control of them in a first person perspective (might be executed in some other ways if you want to scale the game down). At any time, you can jump back to the overview, and take control of another character. You can also go back through the timeline to redo a specific piece of the character's actions. For example, you might try to get a guy in through the main entrance. However, as soon as he gets in, he is spotted by a guard and shot. So you take another character and make him break a window to distract the guard. You then hide the second character and make the first character go through the entrance, this time without getting shot.\n\nThe idea is to make this a sort of puzzle game with multiple solutions. Perhaps there would be rewards for not redoing any paths or for accomplishing side objectives or for doing it in a very short amount of time. What do you guys think?"

38xrvl,God vs. Man,"A multiplayer online game wherein some players are gods and some are humans. I'm picturing this as an RTS-style game. The humans must work together to harvest resources, grow their populations, build cities and advance technologically. \n\nThe gods seek to subvert the humans advancement and keep them dependent. Gods interact with the humans by making laws, performing miracles, smiting, destroying or creating resources, influencing weather, etc. The gods must use these tools to influence the populations of humans establishments and convert them. \n\nMan must play by gods rules. Breaking the gods rules can offer faster advancement, but makes the humans vulnerable to being smited.\n\nIf a certain percentage of the mans population is converted for a certain period of time, advancement is stagnated and the gods win. If man evolves to the point that he no longer needs the gods to survive he wins. "
38wvfn,Swordfighting game with body destruction and sword strokes controlled with the mouse.,"A lot of swordfighting in games these days is mashing the mouse until people die. What would be just a *magniflorious* method of attacking would be holding down the mouse button and moving it to control the sword. And on top of that, body destruction physics. Instead of a health bar, you have to bleed out, get stabbed in the heart, get your neck slit, or be in too much pain to continue. \n\nThe bodies would have organs and everything, that all effect the fight in various ways. \nYou get stabbed in the lung? Well now your stamina is cut in half. \nYou get stabbed in the nuts? Well now your character moves really slow and is bent over. \nYou get your arm cut off? Well now you can only use what you have equipped in your other hand. \n\nThere would be armor physics as well. Heavier armor makes you move slower, but you have to swing harder/use sharper weapons/hit more times to be able to penetrate it. And you'd have shields that you could use to block any blows, or parry with your sword. \n\nThe options are limitless, and the fighting would be so dynamic. "
38wfbi,An open-world cyberpunk futuristic MMOFPSRPG,"Wow, that a lot of letters. What would it mean? Well lets start with my idea for a setting. Earth was once evacuated and subsequently a nuclear war turned the planet into a wasteland. Many years later, mercenaries trickle down onto Earth to make money off of the new planet.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it would play like an FPS but in an open-world hostile environment. You would hunt monsters and other enemies for money and use that money to buy weapons. Rinse, repeat. However, every player could kill any player they see. The early-game would be mostly open-world and instanced challenges, and the end-game would be open-world PVP.\n\nThe signature of this game would be the equipment system. Between weapons and armor, you would be able to fully customize your character. There will be a LOT of weapon types and all would be available at the beginning of the game. Dual-wielding would be possible due to each weapon being either one or two handed."
38w59u,Hacker game to practice words,"We all know the basic word teaching programs out there right? You fill in the words in the language you know, then to the language you want to learn them in and boom. You can practice your vocabulary. But couldn't that be a lot more fun? For example: What if you would put this idea in a Hacker style coat? You could make a selection of the words you have to study in order to 'hack' a scertian level. Screwing up sets off a countdown timer to add a little tention and such. Wouldn't this be a good idea? It wouldn't be too hard to make i think and it would make studying a lot more fun."
38vumu,Pyramid Scheme,"An MMO turn-based strategy game with a hierarchical structure of competition between players. Teams compete against other teams to achieve goals and control resources. Turn-based gameplay can be time-limited or open ended. \n\nEach team is broken down into a pyramid hierarchy, with a few or one powerful player at the top, and many less-powerful players supporting him. Players harvest resources, utilising different methods based on their level within the pyramid scheme. As you move up the pyramid, the harvest goes up but so does the player's vulnerability to be exploited. \n\nBesides the main goal of the team, players within each level of the pyramid compete against those on the opposing teams at that level. Achieving these goals can moves players up the pyramid.  \n\nPlayers can also conspire to overthrow the level above them, using the element of backstabbery to climb the pyramid. "

38vs1l,god vs man,"An online multiplayer game wherein a few players are gods, and a larger number of players are subjects. A goal must be achieved by cooperative efforts of the subjects, for instance build a tower of Babylon. The gods must keep them from achieving their goals. \n\nSubjects have to obey the rules enforced by the gods. Breaking rules helps subjects achieve their goals faster. If a subject is caught disobeying a rule, the god who catches him the rule can smite him, destroying some or all of his contribution towards the goal. "
38vk10,Cliché pokemon idea,"I would love diablo type ARPG with a pokemon skin. You control a pokemon and the trainer follows behind the pokemon. You can swap pokemon. You can mount pokemon, fly, surf, use HM. Typical pokemon game but more action because it's now ARPG instead of turn based."
38uswg,Simplified 2-button Action Combat idea for mobile,"Imagine you're holding your phone in landscape mode, with both thumbs ready at the bottom corners of the screen.\n\nThe screen displays a first-person view. In the bottom left corner you can see that you're holding a shield. In the bottom right corner you're holding a sword.\n\nAhead of you is a single monster, animated and about to attack you. You are in a duel to the death.\n\nPress your left thumb to raise your shield. Press your right thumb to swing your weapon.\n\nNow, imagine the gameplay is a lot like Punch Out!, but with the fantasy theme and some mechanics from Dark Souls. You'll have a health and stamina meter that work like Dark Souls when playing a sword &amp; board build. The gameplay centers around watching the enemy's tells, blocking their attacks, and counter-attacking when safe. Stamina is spent when swinging your weapon and blocking an attack; it regens when you're letting your shield rest.\n\nThe enemies can be animated in a simple way like Punch Out!, using just a few frames of high quality 2D art. Even NES Punch Out! had a nice AI variety, and you can imagine that many basic Dark Souls enemies can be converted to this 2D format.\n\nThat's it. If you can pull that off (programming the fighting engine and AI system is the core challenge), there are plenty of ways to wrap it up into a full game. Gladiator boss rush mode would be a simple wrapper. In-depth dungeon crawler would be an intermediate-difficulty wrapper.\n\nI plan to make a game like this eventually that is a hardcore dungeon-crawler roguelike (random level generation and permadeath) using nice quality pixel art (400x240 view, sort of ""widescreen-NES"" resolution). Imagine the first level always has the same few ""Glass Joe"" / ""Hollow Soldier"" easy enemies where the player can practice the basic gameplay while dying often. Easy level-filler enemies introduce new fighting styles, which you'll learn before using them on the level boss. From there it will be tempting to add my favorite features from turn-based dungeon crawlers (like Legend of Grimrock) and roguelikes (like NetHack)."

38q98t,Mad Max (MMO),"Premise: Join a faction in the wasteland and fight for survival and for total control of the land. A mix between fallout, gta, and eve online, you must scavenge for supplies to better your armor, weaponry, and to build your custom vehicle. Work your way up the ranks in your faction to become the most powerful person in the wastelands.\n\nSetting: A massive open world that has been ravaged by nuclear war. In the center is a giant rag tag capital where players and low levels spawn. (safe from being destroyed by higher level players) It is here players first can receive missions from npcs to collect money and begin scavenging for things.\n\nGameplay: First person shooter much like gta style. A big focus on vehicular warfare and insane car chases. Players must build their first vehicles around the base capital or else be sitting ducks trying to venture deeper into the wastelands. First vehicles will most likely be motorcycles until players can find better parts throughout the wasteland. Only a dozen or so semis can be built due to the limited parts, so most likely these vehicle will only be driven by high ranking faction members.\n\nFactions: The main draw to the game is what faction you choose. Besides a handful of city safe zones, and zones that are officially no mans lands, the rest of the wasteland is for grabs. It will be a constant power struggle to hold key locations in the wasteland and to grow your faction. You can even create your own faction, but smaller factions obviously will have harder times surviving the wastes. \n\nEngagement Rules: The few large cities will be safe zones, where players can safely trade, scavenge etc. Surrounding cities will be mostly safe, as npc ""police"" will protect new players and will be able to easily kill even the highest ranking players if they cause trouble. You can even fight within your faction, however this will most likely cause you to be kicked out of your faction by higher ranking members.\n\nI think thats the gist of it! any other ideas or concerns I'd love to hear them! Thanks! "

38n26j,A game that teaches kids about life,"I came up with idea a while ago, because, imho, things for kids are becoming pointless. \n\nThe game would probably be on a hand-held console with a microphone. THe game would start, and it would seem all dumb and shit, but after starting (specifically, once the mic determines you're not talking) the game would tell you ""Don't say anything. This game is going to teach you what you need to know about life."" \n\nIf you tried to talk or make sound, it would back to the dumb kid's game. The reason for this is that I think that nowadays parents are becoming too protective of their kids, trying to shield them from important topics like romantic relationships (not including sex, but perhaps including same-gender), death, nature, danger, and perhaps 'good touch bad touch'. So the game would teach kids about the things their parents WON'T teach them, and they won't be able to show their parents, so that their parents can't throw a fit.\n\nThe 'real' game would stay kid-friendly, but would still explain everything to the kid playing."

38gcny,Mafia/Werewolf style multiplayer game where people argue over a third party.,"This idea came from a shower thought I had after playing Town of Salem and watching a twitch stream at the same time. \n\nRunning title is ""The Council,"" no idea if it's taken or good or anything.\n\nPlayers: \n\n* 6-7 people (or any other number found by balance) as ""The Council""\n\n* 1 person as ""The Hero"" who would alternate every game based on points/time in game/randomness.\n\n\n\nPitch: \n\n* 'The Hero' is playing some kind of singleplayer game, say, a generic platformer, a Deathrun, or a maze. It doesn't really matter, and it could be anything. This player needs to rely on The Council to chat with him to navigate through the level. However, some members of the Council are 'evil' and win the game when The Hero loses, and some members are 'good' and win the game when The Hero succeeds. In addition, Council members could send powerups and/or enemies anonymously to the game The Hero is playing.\n\nPretty much all I am imagining is a player in a game with a chatroom yelling ""Go Left!"", ""No, Go Right"",  ""No, don't trust him!"" and the player having to make a choice that will lead him either to death or victory. \n\nRandom notes:\n\n* Unlike Mafia, Everyone in the Council would know who is 'good' or 'evil.' The only person who would be out of the loop would be the Hero. It would probably be really difficult to balance how easy or hard it is to convince one person of something.\n\n* Would it be 'fun' to be in The Council? I thought of this based around the fun of The Hero, but I was thinking about sending powerups as something for The Council to do. \n\n* This could range anywhere from Intermediate, to Advanced, to really over-ambitious depending on what the 'game' the Hero plays is. I'm keeping it really open/undecided because of that."

38bu0c,Town Building/Resource Collecting/Multiplayer (PC/IOS/ANDROID),"I have recently been thinking of a game that would be awesome to play on both PC and your respected choice of tablet/mobile phone.\n\nThe Concept: My idea is a game that uses a similar template to Clash of Clans, in that it is a city building game, where you can join a clan and help each other out and battle clans. What I don't like about Clash of Clans is that you can only donate Troops, and not resources. (I know in Clash of Clans this would never happen, hence my idea for a new game)\n\nI love medieval games, so lets say it's based in that era. With there being 4 types of resources; Military, Gold, Ores (iron,copper ect) and Food.\n\nThe game requires you to build a town, in the lower levels you gain basic access to barracks(military, used to kill enemies), gold mines (used to hire the military and upgrade the town hall/castle ect), standard mines(used for building upgrades) and finally Farms (used to feed the military and the workers)\n\nAs you hit a certain level, one which unlocks the ability to join an Alliance; you face a choice, does your town specialise in; military, mining (both gold and ores) or farming. Which you unlock better buildings, so you can gain those resources quicker then the others.\n\nYou still have access to the basic buildings; but lets say you specialise in the military. It might take you 5 days to mine enough gold, to upgrade your barracks to unlock the next type of militant. Whereas a specialist mining town could mine enough in 24-48 hours.\n\nWhich ties in the Alliance. The Alliance gives you the ability to trade the resources between the towns. Introducing team work to the game. If you want to be the best Alliance in the WHOLE WORLD!!!!! Then your alliance will need to work together to essentially support the Military towns, to kill everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIts a work in progress :) but I think it would be sweet :)\n\n\nThank you for reading :)     "

You are following driving directions that you printed from something like Google Maps, and along the way you pass through some thin, dark roads, foggy places, empty surreal cities, and similar places.\n\nJumpscares could happen with stuff apearing front of the car, in the co-pilot seat, the backseat, the mirror view, etc.\n\nThe driving directions themselves might also start to get creepy and weird midway through, something like this XKCD: https://xkcd.com/461/, except that without leaving the car. Say, a driving direction might instruct you to ""Turn off your headlights. Do not turn them on again until you turn right."", for example."

389d6p,Couple of game ideas I had through dreams,"First game I dreamed about was a JRPG where you could fight in real-time and some of the enemies I remember were flying sharks. There were also tornados in the background, and the setting was kind of futuristic/post apocalyptic. One of the characters you could play as was someone who looked like Yuri from Tales of Vesperia. The other characters I can't remember too much about. I remember you could crawl through metal tunnels that had lights inside, I guess the game had some stealth aspects in there too.\n\nThe other game was a first person Zombie game set in Medieval times. The character you play as looked like a warrior that had mage skills and had either white or brown hair, I can't remember that specific detail but he looked LOTR-esque mixed with Jack Sparrow. One of the levels I remember playing in had a dark setting, it was night time, and there was these wooden walls/doors with chains on them that had skulls on them. I can't remember too much about the combat, I mean honestly who can remember their whole dream? But I do remember you can use swords and even fire as a mage power. The loading screen was f this big open field with trees down below and a Giant Castle on a mountain/hill with a big blue sky in the background. To the left is a picture/render of the main character on the same loading screen. The soundtrack has heavy metal/rock in it, one of the songs I remember hearing the vocalist singing and it sounded like something from Dio or Jack Black, maybe even Guns N Roses. I even remember singing along to the song but if it was a real song I can't the life of me remember the lyrics, except for one word ""Thyself"". \n\nThe third game I dreamed about was an awesome Spider-Man game I was playing. You could switch between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. You could break through buildings and fight enemies inside and all kinds of other cool things. One of the enemies I was fighting was Black Cat and I was Green Goblin and smashed through a tall blue building and there was a cutscene and after that I had to fight her. You can switch between Green Goblin and Spider-Man in the same mission. It's kind of like the GTA V switching system. The graphics looked like a PS4 game but I think I was playing on a PS2 lol. The game is also open world and you are free to do what you want like the other games. If I remember right you could be the Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man game on PS2 by beating the game on a certain difficulty. He looks similar to that but you can take your helmet off. That's all I really remember sadly."
386f9o,Firefly-esqe Oregon Trail,"I've been on a space cowboy kick lately (Firefly &amp; Cowboy Bebop), and thought it might be fun to remake Oregon Trail with a similar theme.\n\nI figure that a number of the concepts would transfer pretty easily (e.g. FPS hunting replaced with FPS space scavenging or navigating dangerous waters replaced with navigating asteroid fields).\n\nI think I'll plan for a similar start to the game as well. The main player would start in a western spaceport city where they can(and need to) purchase the following things:\n\n- A ship (slow = cheap, fast = expensive)\n- Supplies: \n	- Weapons (requires one to scavenge):\n		- Pistol = weak, more accurate, cheaper. \n		- Rifle = faster, less accurate, more expensive\n		- Lazer rifle = fastest, moderate accuracy, extremely expensive\n	- Fuel\n	- Food\n	- Shields / Ship plating (light = cheap. heavy = expensive)\n- Companions (different stats, price based on stat total)\n\nCompanions would be namable just like in Oregon Trail, and the currency used in the game would be Bitcoins (because that's the currency of the future ...right guys?)\n\nAll of the aforementioned could be found randomly on the journey, including new ships and companions.\n\nI plan on developing the game in Unreal Engine 4. One challenge of this will be that it'll require multiple different gameplay modes to accomplish (First person shooting for scavenging, birdseye racer for ship flying, and third person for town interactions). I'm not too worried as I've done all of these individually in the past, but I do realize this increases the game scope by quite a bit, so I may decide to limit them in the future, or at least leave them very basic for the alpha version.\n\nFeel free to critique or offer any suggestions. I'm also not opposed to outside help so PM if you're interested in working with me.\n\n\nThanks! And keep on flying.\n"
385ayh,[Dream] Deep Survival/Skill Game,"The player wakes up with a first person camera, he looks around and finds himself stranded on a unknown place. then the game tells him the basic controls: how to look around, how to move himself around the world, and a button to open the skill tree. Now here is where magic starts to happen, because the main focus of the game is that the skill trees are hidden, for example at that moment the skilltree of ""movement"" and ""camera"" is unlocked, but there are thousands more to unlock, something like the constellations in Skyrim, but much more deep.\n\n\nNow for example, the main categories of the skills can be: Survival, Crafting, Knowledge, Agility, Orientation, Vision, Vitality, Strength, etc (feel free to add more Ideas inside these categories, and add more categories)\n\nThe way the Skill developing works is by doing the stuff you want to level up on, if you want to upgrade swimming skills, you need to swim, and over time you will discover new and better ways to swim, increase speed, hold your breath longer, etc.\n\nSome skills are shared and linked between categories and the progress is shared somehow in the system.\n\nPlease give more ideas to extend this one! I want to know your opinions about mine! and for last, maybe It can be described as a mix between minecraft and skyrim, but it isn´t very accurate."

382eom,Immortality: good or bad?,"* Name\n\n   Unknown as of now, I prefer ""Killswitch"", but that's already taken.\n\n*Concept\n\n   You're a scientist. The main antagonist is an immortal human created in an experiment. \n\n*Plot\n\n   Humans have always tried to cheat death. The science community has finally created an immortal human. Not quite, however, as a ""kill switch"" was secretly implanted. If the experiment got out of hand, the immortal could be killed ONLY by using the killswitch code. The immortal went insane and is approaching the city. Even worse, the military is attempting to kill you and the other scientists to cover up the mission. Caught between two sides, you must find and activate the killswitch.\n\n*Setting\n\n   A rural lab, 25 game-miles from a medium-sized generic city. Plenty of trees for cover.\n\n*Characters\n\n   The Immortal (name TBD): Hostile towards everyone. Takes zero damage from anything. Can be slowed down by bullets, but otherwise unaffected.\n   Military: A big threat. They will attempt to kill you, at all costs. They are usually distracted by fighting the immortal as well, with no luck. They can be avoided by hiding.\n   Scientists: Allies. They will assist the player, helping with fighting and finding supplies.\n   You: The player attempts to stop the immortal before he can reach the city. You have special abilities that are unlocked throughout the game.\n\n*Game mechanics\n\n   FPS, typical health/damage/ammo system. Attempt to locate kill-code fragments in various locations.\n\n*Standout Features\n\n   Hidden news articles and radio transmissions located all over. Finding them is optional, but uncovers a more detailed backstory. An immortal enemy with a weakness.\nDisruption code: Stuns the immortal for a few seconds; slowing him down. Reusable with cooldown.\nTrackers: The immortal has a tracking chip. Sensors will alert you when he is in a certain area. You don't get an exact location.\nRadios: You can hack radios and call off a search or divert attention away from you.\n\n*Platforms\n\n   PC, possibly Xbox or PS4\n\n*Lessons learned\n\n   Science makes mistakes, but can foresee some problems. They added a killswitch to the immortal. Is living forever really good if you can't die? Living forever means no long-term friendships and seeing a lot of bad stuff.\n\n*Credit\n\n   I'll probably never make this, but please credit me if you decide to.

3816oe,Fantasy Messenger,"**Name:** Fantasy Messenger? Untitled, as of yet...\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* So basically, it's an **Oregon Trail clone**, set in a fantasy world. You are a messenger on horseback, and it's your job to deliver letters from point A to point B. The end goal is to stay alive and make enough money to retire on within a period of 30 years. The better you do, the more money and reputation you collect, the better your ending will be. There are two main interfaces in the game: *town and travel*.\n* In the **town** interface, you have a map of the hamlet/town/city/camp/etc. that you're currently stationed in. In this interface, you can accept missions from various folk, pick up rumors at the tavern, visit one of your lovers, check out the status of warring factions, and more. This is mostly a **point-and-click** environment that allows you to navigate around the establishment. When you have a new mission (a letter/note/message to deliver) you may click the gates to go to the travel interface.\n* The **travel** interface is the part where we blatantly rip off Oregon Trail. At the top of the screen is a simple animation of your character riding on horseback along the road. Below this is a map that shows your current position. Also on this screen is your inventory, the current weather, the current time/date. The map of the continent is pretty large, so travel can take a while. It may take a full day for your character to reach the nearest settlement. When your character is moving, you are prone to random encounters and events.\n* Random encounters and **events** can range from boons to burdens. You could ride up to a broken wagon and help them fix the wheel in exchange for a handful of coins. Or you could encounter one of the dozens of monsters or bandit groups that terrorize the wilds. There could be a battle system implemented for your character to take on these threats, but I'd rather use an *escape function*. Your character is a messenger, so he or she isn't really a combatant. In order to further protect yourself, you could hire bodyguards to accompany you on your travels, and they could kill monsters and bandits for you, in exchange for a weekly wage. Do note, however, that bodyguards would undoubtedly slow you down and eat into your ""delivery time bonus"" if we chose to have such a thing in the game. Though, if they kill monsters and add their valuable hides, teeth, claws, etc. to your inventory, it may be worth it to have them after all.\n* **Items, gear and services** can all be purchased in towns to make your job a little easier, and your character more effective overall. As you level up, you could gain access to better and better gear. Upgrade your mount to increase travel speed and upgrade your armor to increase survivability during enemy encounters.\n* **Factions** are an exciting part of the game. In order to emulate a living, breathing, organic world that persists beyond the daily life of your character, the game could have separate factions/kingdoms/guilds/etc. that compete with one another in the background. Starting off, you'll be delivering letters between regular civilians, and the more powerful subjects in the land won't really notice you. But as your resources grow and your name gets more exposure, higher-paying missions will unlock for you in certain towns and cities. **This is where you have to start choosing sides.** For instance, the Thieves Guild will always be opposed to the City Watch. In one town, two wealthy aristocratic families may be competing with one another over a fur-trading monopoly. On a larger scale, the Kingdom of X may be at war with the Kingdom of Y, and the Kingdom of Z may be staying neutral until a clear winner starts to emerge. These factions all have one thing in common: **they need messages delivered**. You could influence the economic and political landscape of the game, simply by who you choose to deliver for, who you decide to sabotage, who you spy on and for whom, and the list goes on and on. Of course, the factions make this project a bit more ambitious. But they also make it **way** more fun.\n* **Lovers** are a cool feature to have, and they serve to increase reputation. Also, the higher your reputation, the more ""handsome"" the lovers you are capable of attracting. If you are a man, you can have children with lovers, which will expand your legacy (so to speak) and add to your endgame score.\n* **Rivals** are another cool feature. Other riders will seek to edge in on your business and steal your clients away from you. At times, you may accept missions from impatient types and they will hire another rider right after giving the mission to you. You now have to **race** this other rider to the destination, otherwise he or she will totally steal your reward money. The evil option, of course, would be to kill your competition in various different ways.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC, iOS, Android\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nPM me for details, please.\n\nEDIT: Forgot the title of the game..."
3abj3u,Eko - card game (work in progress),"Been working on a online card game, was wondering what could be done to make it more interesting and if I should hire someone to program it.\n\nHeres a video of how to play it\n https://youtu.be/nDsjjGZu8h0"
3aai6a,Horror Game (Experienced),"Alright listen here listen here, I thought this would be a really cool idea. A co-op horror game just like the movies, you start with your group of friends and there is some zombie apocalypse, or haunted house, or masked murderer or something, and the game if very realistic and immersive. This is because the game actually changes with your voice (kinda, don't know how else to explain it). You hook up your mic, and talk to your friends, but they can only hear you if you are within their vicinity (and vice versa), and when threats are nearby, if your crying or whimpering, or yelling, the enemies can hear you and find you. And if you die you cant talk any further. \n\nI find this super interesting because games right now are already so immersive and scary, how awesome would it be to take it one step further? Plus I've just always liked the idea of co-op horror games, its fun to hear your friends getting scared XD\n\nAnyone have any ideas how to make it even MORE immersive? "
3a7en0,"Deathmatch, one bullet at a time.","Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. \n\nIf you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. \n\nOnce someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.\n\nIt's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?\n\nTagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs."
3a6msj,[IDEA] Capital World (working title),"Hi everyone, I'm looking for anyone interested in programming this game idea (or part of it, which would be more feasible). Of course I'm not forcing anyone to dedicate their time to it, but I'd like to gauge interest and perhaps see it become a reality. I originally posted this on Kongregate, a flash game portal, and I reference certain games which may be unfamiliar, but the idea should be clear.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make as much money as possible and dominate other players to that end.\n\nThe game begins through the generation of a character, either by opting to become the child of a player looking to parent someone and being inactive in the map for a certain period of time, or generating a completely new character and hopping straight in, but losing bonuses. Your characteristics, be they generated or inherited from a parent, will affect one’s ability to perform tasks, be they race, gender, abilities (or disabilities), qualities and other such things. For example, your character’s sex may affect its earnings, mirrroring how in the real world, women in the US earn $0.76 for every $1 earned by a man. This could be effected in-game by giving female characters the ability to ‘parent’ new players for a period of time to give them bonuses, detracting from a female character’s ability to work, as well as penalties on performing work which can only be addressed with investment in certain mechanics.\n\nThere will be two main sections to the game: the button, and the map. The button will be the main source of money (though other sources may be introduced in the form of achievements, a quest system, temporary challenges, etc.) and can then be freely used by players.\n\nThe map will consist of a multitude of different tiles (each one square kilometre in area), including different biomes which produce different resources (wood from forests, land space from plains, etc.); these tiles can be of different grades depending on how many resources they produce when worked. The player travels across these at a rate determined by their characteristics, and the rate can be adjusted between walking, jogging and sprinting, and as the character exercises, their speed and stamina will increase. When the character is put into the world, they must ensure their basic needs are met, by hunting and gathering (time required to do this will depend on food levels in a tile, with forest and plains having high levels and deserts having lower levels), drinking water (depends on a tile’s freshwater levels), and either taking shelter in a cave (if a tile has one) or gathering wood from a forest and building a house in a plain.\n\nOnce a player is set up, they can start to build farms once sufficient wood and materials are gathered from tiles, which they can then hire people to work on, and sell the food to people who need it, as well as setting up lumber mills, mines, quarries and fisheries. They can also craft tools, equipment and gear from resources in order to improve farming, mining or lumbering ability, as well as weapons and armour to invade and take over the buildings and loot of others.\n\nThe tech trees for equipment and buildings could extend to casinos for betting, banks and stock exchanges for savings, loans, and investments, legislatures and courts to establish countries, sovereignty and national armies, and many more.\n\nThe crucial idea is, this is essentially an idle game (working tiles and performing labour for others will require idling which will constantly generate income) in the same vein as AdVenture Capitalist with the money making focus, but with a few super important ideas:\n\n* Randomly generated characters, which make you better or worse at certain tasks naturally\n\n* No single experience bar like Anti-Idle: The Game, but a variety of different skills to level up\n\n* Social inequality. Being a woman or black makes you less income than being male or white, reflective of the inequalities and injustices which exist in the real world.\n\n* A map with resources to actually obtain, as opposed to more basic games where the only resources are cash and XP.\n\n* You can’t just build farms and stuff in thin air, you need to find space.\n\n* The multiplayer element. The only non-player method of making money will be the Button and achievements; everything else will require you to interact with other players.\n\n* Raiding other players’ hard earned resources by military means.\n\n* Countries and sovereignty. Who knows what might emerge?\n\nAnyone interested?"
3a5pxh,The Caretaker,"My idea is that you level up by doing caretaking stuff like resetting the firealarm and change locks, but the most important thing is that you dont get points, but an ekstra key to the keychain when you level up. "
3a5f7u,An FPS where bullets actually exist.,"If you've noticed in almost all FPSes, no actual bullets are ever seen in motion. It's just you, the gun, a trail of sparks, and the guy it killed. This means that it would be impossible to stop a gunshot wound, because the ""bullet"" would be too fast since it's just some code saying ""He pressed MOUSE1, get rid of the other guy's health!"". If you could SEE the bullet, and it was an  actual entity that would fly towards the enemies and disappear AFTER, that would make it more realistic, as people could see where it's going to land before it gets rid of 20 HP or so. That's pretty much my whole idea, hope you enjoyed."
3a2t6w,Future of Europe game (or Future of World),Hi! I'm not a game programmer and i don't know how to make games but i have really good ideas. I thought about some kind of a real time startegy game where you can control your country. That game is similar with Europa Universalis but it won't be that hard and you can make your own country. At the start you can choose a country where you start or make your own country but it only could be small. You start in 2015 or 2016 and you will be continue the future. The map of europe could be distributed to small provinces. You can make interactions with this provinces. You can buy them you can conquer them and you can interact with other countries like you want a trade route with a country or anything. And your goal is to dominate the whole world (or Europe) att the same time. You don't have to conquer you can unite or you can be allies. If anyone is interested in this game you can write on this post a comment. I hope you like my idea. :)
3a0qr6,Scary game idea,"The game is about trying to sleep at night when you're scared. You're in a dark room, laying on a bed. You can hear creepy noises and occasionally see something unsettling if you look around the room, but just a minor thing. Maybe you can just barely make out a pair of eyeballs in your closet. Maybe you can barely see a hand in the darkness, or a shadowy figure. There's a subtlety to it. Your only controls are hiding under the covers and closing your eyes to go to sleep (which requires you to hold a button). You can also look around the room, but you can't get out of bed or turn on the lights.\n\nThe game either ends with a jumpscare involving a horrible monster, or you successfully go to sleep. I think this game would be scary because this is the type of thing we've all experienced at least once in our lives. After you see a scary movie or whatever, especially when you were younger, going to sleep can feel creepy. There would have to be a long period of nothing happening (aside from creaking noises and shadowy figures) followed by a huge jumpscare, unless you can ""win"" the game by going to sleep.\n\nI don't know how to make games, but I think if this is done right it could be very popular, like FNaF but much scarier because it relates to your real life. Also the monster violently gores you if you lose. I actually creeped myself out writing this."

I imagine changing out limbs to get different benefits or traits that would change how the fighting happens.\n\nIt would also be like a TCG with the cards being collects like the battle chips in those games.

39pt93,Horror survival game about supernatural nature,"So most of the time when a horror game is made, it's usually featuring or about some kind of creature/ghost/demon attacking the player or stalking them around, so a few days ago I had an idea, what about nature? Horror games tend to take place in the woods anyway, so why not make the woods an enemy itself?\nEssentially I was thinking of a game where the player is traversing some isolated forest for [insert reason here] and he/she slowly come to realize that the forest may be alive. When stuff starts hitting the fan, the possibilities are endless. Malevolent rocks, trees, plants, etc.\nPerhaps there can even be a progressive change in the scenery as the forest sheds it's facade of being some normal place. One change I can think of is the trees going from (relatively) static and wooden, to fleshy and erratic. Of course one of the problems of this idea is the player being surrounded by all this so I was thinking he/she could have either a temporary way of warding them off, or a safe zone of some sort.\nIn a way, think of this as [Eversion](https://www.google.com/search?q=eversion&amp;oq=eversion&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j69i61l2j69i60j0.1868j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8) , but with a human and in a forest.

3764ab,"Critique a few of my ideas, or offer your own [Intermediate]","For many in the game dev community, my development cycle has begun looking a lot like [this](\nhttps://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*-vuzP4JAoPf9S6ZdHNR_Jg.jpeg).\n\nI've worked on so many different game ideas in the past few months (free time only, not my day job), and I've yet to land on something that I really want to make. Below are a few ideas that I've been playing around with. I'm looking for someone to critique them with the hope that positive/negative feedback will either convince me to start working on it again, or finally decide to drop them and focus on something else.\n\n&gt;*Manifest Quest*\n\n&gt;Gameplay: Single-Player Zelda-like gameplay &amp; storyline\n\nThis is your traditional ""Hero has a quest"" story with a female protagonist. The antagonist of the story would be an evil Internet Service Provider (think Comcast combined with the NSA). The story takes place on an island, and our heroine (10 yr old female child, named Tara Byte) needs to explore the island and disable the evil ISP's censorship devices (blocking the island from using all of the good websites). This game would be full of jokes and puns including but not limited to the ""Data Mines"", ""Phisherman's Wharf"", ""Neutrality Inn"",  ""Link Farms"" and the ""Pirate's Bay"". The main enemy would be Commander Lucius Cast (Comm. Cast). Combat would be what you would expect from a Zelda-clone, but not nearly as good as most of the recent games.\n\n&gt;*No name yet, but basically a VR TF2-clone*\n\n\n&gt;Gameplay: Multiplayer first person with the option of using a VR headset (aiming at Oculus right now)\n\n\nI've been playing around with server-client replication using Unreal Engine 4 lately and felt it would be fun to make a multiplayer game. I haven't actually played TF2, but I've played the first one, so I feel comfortable enough saying that this is what I would be aiming for. \n\nTwo teams, each have a base. I think I'd like to include some type of aimable cannons in the game so that each team has the option of pelting each other with big explosions (How fun would it be wearing and oculus and looking up at the sky to see your impending doom?). Other than that, it would be your traditional FPS.\n\n\nOther than those two ideas, I have bunch of small projects that I started and quickly decided weren't things that I have interest in continuing. \n\nI'm still learning, and have no regrets on the amount of time I've spent on past failed projects, as many of the assets I've created have made their way into current ones.\n\nThe purpose of this post is mainly to see some feedback about my current projects and hopefully inspire my development efforts in certain directions. I'm open to new pitch ideas as well, if anyone has something that they think my skillset could accomplish.\n\nTL;DR: Losing motiviation, need help with revitalizing current projects or ideas for something new.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n"

PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK!,"         ""The Ripper"" \n Protagonist: Sherlock Holmes  \n Antagonist: Jack The Ripper\n         Setting: London (1800's)\n You start of as a skilled detective (Sherlock Holmes), given the fact that he is a detective in a trench coat, people would expect some parkour, which is exactly what we love! Through out the game there will be some scenes of parkour such as jumping from window to window, climbing a building, escaping traps is mainly where parkour will occur! \n\n\nSherlock Holmes superior has assigned him a case to investigate the situation of the screaming coming from ""Street View Living Quarters"". There's been a report coming from local neighbors that there has been agonizing  screams coming from the local apartment.  This past year there has been many cases of young women who were raped and violently stabbed by a unidentified man nicknamed ""Jack The Ripper"".To this very day no detective has solved this mystery, many were found dead, many never came back the same. \n\nPLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS JUST THE BETA THAT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

374jdo,Mining Operation,"I'm thinking of making a top-down game where you manage a team of miners to get resources from the ground. My main problem is thinking of what is the main adversity to the player, of course there is money but I think something else would make it more fun. Any ideas?"
3739jh,Be the final boss - 1 vs many online,"when warcraft 3 was in its prime i really enjoyed the custom map ""island defense"" for those who dont know its basically 1 titan vs 11 builders. i am really dissappointed that this splendid idea has never been made into a stand alone game.\n\nwhat i could imagine is a multiplayer game where one player choses one of several bosses and the others select the survivors that are going to combat him. the game starts out with the survivors having to run from the boss spawn. once the boss spawns he needs to hunt and kill all survivors.\n\nthe survivors have to gather different ressources to become stronger to eventually combat the boss. the main catch is the most powerful ressources requires the survivors to either face the boss or get into dangerous areas where they are easy pray for the boss.\n\nthe boss himself needs to find to kill all survivors before they have a chance of killing him. he should also have a form of growth and to increase his abilities of doing so."
372mln,"Very simple idea-take Limbo's ultra simplicity(no menus, no on screen clutter, only a few buttons) &amp; mix it with the survival horror genre..","I think I may be giving away a good idea here, but I doubt I'll get around to this.  Back in the day there was a Jurrasic Park FPS game where you ""held"" objects and could move them around VS them being locked in place with an animation of your hands holding the object. This is close to my idea--for example to start a fire, you'd hold two piece of flint and struck them over some flammable material--and you'd carry objects in a backpack which you would have to take off and open up, then sort through to get the object. Part of smart gameplay would be packing things intelligently and making sure the objects you'd need in an emergency are accessible. This could maximize the tension In survival horror/suspense."
372mbd,Journey to the Fringe (RTS) Comprehensive Outline,"**Preface**\nYou are the King of a newly found Civilization. You've done everything right; Distanced yourself from countries/conquered regions, created new life in a place rich with natural resources, and you're beginning to enjoy the spoils of being a leader. The world is a dark and unforgiving place though. You start to hear tales of the ""Fringe"" and the horrible creatures that lye just beyond your borders. Supernatural beings and beasts torching the Earth and laying waste to all who oppose their reign. There are also tales of legendary wealth and power. How long will this age of prosperity last? Will you forge alliances with your neighbors or venture into the ""Fringe"" alone claiming the spoils of war for yourself?\n\n**Objective**\nJourney to the Fringe is a 6 player RTS game that puts a players war strategies to the ultimate test. Every player starts in the middle of the playing field equally distanced in a circle with a small castle of 100 civilians and 50 soldiers. This circular region is the 'Homestead' and has the least amount of npc invaders to begin with. The rest of the playing field is divided up into rings that gradually get larger around the 'Homestead' increasing in region size and difficulty (more enemy npc's, more disease/danger, etc.). Each ring has unique npc monsters, npc forts, and npc castles. The object of the game is to reach the ""Fringe"" (the outermost ring, the most difficult area), create a thriving city, and use the powers acquired in that region to bring peace over the land. That may mean the ultimate destruction of other players, loyalty from all npc factions, or even a thriving city in each ring leading up to/including the ""Fringe"".\n\n**How it Works**\nHOW CITIES GROW: The games main resource is the Civilian. 'Industry' creates 'Civilians', 'Civilians' are then separated into one of three 'Roles' within your city. 'Civilians' will either contribute to your 'Army', 'Research', or 'Industry'. Your Army protects your city or you can command a general to lead 'x' amount of troops to a specific location. Troops within the city will protect it. Research can upgrade your army/industry, raise the living conditions within cities, advance your civilization into new eras, and help with diplomacy. Industry directly effects how much food is produced i.e. how many civilians are being produced. Food is earned over time, for instance: every 5 seconds you earn a civilian, increase your industry and you'll get 2 civilians per second. You killed a group of wolves, industry increased by x amount for 3 minutes; As King you decide how civilians a distributed between the three 'Roles'. Your cities will continue to grow and civilians will be produced passively. The appearance of your city is dependent on the number of soldiers and civilians. More civilians will make your city look like a large metropolis while having more soldiers will raise the walls higher, spikier, and making your city appear as an impenetrable castle.\n\nHOW TO EXPAND: You must move civilians from the Industry sector in you city to the field. Civilians cannot protect themselves so they must be accompanied by a General/Army or they are liable to be captured. Select a location on the map, the more Civilians you task the larger and quicker the new city will be founded. Civilians that create a new city are neutral and must be assigned 'Roles'.\n\nHOW ARMIES WORK: As you start the game you begin with one type of general, the Foot Soldier General (soldiers under this general assume the Foot Soldier role, a balanced offensive and defensive unit.) Once you have amassed a sizable number of troops you will want to go out and conquer various wildlife/enemies for bonuses, loot, and upgrades. You begin the game with 50 soldiers and to move them out of your castle you must assign them an appropriate general. At the beginning of the game generals can only command a certain amount soldiers at a time (though that can change by researching new generals and military upgrades).\n\n...\n\nImagine a mix of board game army strategy setup in a real time strategy space. The cool thing is this game is actually very simple in that there is very little to micromanage. Cities will grow on their own and civilians will wait until you're ready to utilize them. You tell armies where to go but their success lies in their experience in battle. An army of 10,000 inexperienced foot soldiers vs 500 knights could be very close, and the battles happen over time. Nothing is instantly created or decided. If your army appears to be losing, send reinforcements. You win battles, you raise morale, and you will earn experience. Kind of a Command &amp; Conquer meets Civ meets Endless Legend.\n\nI've written a lot so far, if this seems at all interesting or you'd like more info let me know! I have a lot more of this figured out and I don't mind adding more to this if people are interested..."

370mun,An FPS/FPS Mod off of the anime Code Geass,"Basically, there's two teams, Black Knights, and Brittanian Empire. One side has to defend buildings, while the other has to attack them in order to free hostages, kill VIPs, etc. Like the anime, mechsuits and radios are used often, along with common gunfighting.One player per team spawns as the ""Leader"" (Lelouch, Cornelia) another is a ""Pilot""(Kallen,Suzaku) and everybody else are normal soldiers. Mechsuits vary per team and class. the Leader (Cornelia's mech, Lelouch's mech) has a more powerful, yet less defensive mech, while the Pilot Mech (Guren Mk II, Lancealot) has Power and Speed, but an enemy pilot can kill them easily. Soldiers occasionally spawn in Southerlands, which are like Pilot mechs, only less agile. Mechs can be destroyed, and players are automatically ejected if they aren't killed in the process. On foot, players use primaries (Dark Knight SMGs, Brittanian ARs) and pistols (Both sides are the same). Basically, it could be a mod for \nTitanfall. Any ideas? Thanks."
370gu7,lane-based FPS,"Like any normal CtF game mode in a first-person shooter (e.g., cover system, various weapons), except that players cannot move in just any direction. Instead, players can only move along specified ""lanes"" or ""rails"". The area between the lanes is open and can be shot across, but players cannot move across it; their movement is confined to the lanes. Lanes may be depressed, like trenches, or be placed on the ridges of hills. I think that confining player movement to specific lanes in a CtF match might allow for easier implementation of various player attack and defense strategies. What do you guys think?"
36zw1f,Marvel Superheroes/villains Wave Survival Game (Spoilers for Avengers movies),"I thought of this when I went to see the new Avengers movie a couple of weeks ago. Imagine a game where all the playable characters were heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. You'd have a team of them and fight off of waves of enemies, with bosses every few rounds. An example would be waves of the chitauri from the first movie, and you have to fight them in New York, and the bosses would be Loki, the flying whale things, and some made up chitauri monsters. Another example would be to fight off Ultrons and prevent them from activating the vibranium machine. The bosses for this would be increasingly difficult iterations of the main Ultron. I know this game will probably never  happen, but it would be so much to play with some friends or even online."
36uu24,Counterfeiter,"**Name:** Counterfeit\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* Basically, it would be in the general style of [Papers, Please](http://papersplea.se/). You're a counterfeiter. Your job is to create exact imitations of real money, ID cards, school transcripts, etc. The closer you get to copying the real thing, the higher your score. Much of the game's drawing functions would be performed with a mouse or a stylus.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou're just a criminal, living in the city. Thanks to your wasted artistic talent, you make your living as a counterfeiter. People come to you when they need something that looks official. You run the risk of being discovered by the law and sentenced to hard time in prison, but the money is good.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nMaybe it's set in modern day NYC? London? Berlin? Hong Kong?\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC, iOS, Android\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nI'd like to be a part of development, if at all possible. PM me for details."
36u19o,Civil war grand strategy game,"As the name says it would be a civil war strategy game, with a large focus on the political aspect and trade during the war. I'm also not sure what kind of map style it would be. I have thought about hexagonal sorta like civilization 5, or maybe something like the map view from the total war series. The map will be very detailed however. I'm also thinking it will include a tech tree or maybe a design your own ship aspect. Will include large infrastructure and resource mane gents aspects. All feedback is appreciated."
36suwn,Get to the top of the roman society,"It would be a  sandbox, much like skyrim. You start as a small member of the high society. You have to form alliances with characters in order to become more influential and expand your resources and contact lists (e.g. senators, prostitutes, thieves, pirates, etc). You can plan complots and conspiracies to work your way up. You can be the ruler and face administrative decisions. If you choose to be honest and lawful, the people will admire you, but the corrupt politicians will be against you because you are a threat to their business. \n  This is pretty much it, I'll gladly read suggestions and criticisms!"
36soli,"[Dream] Create a universe, as gameplay...","Picture an MMO built for creative people.\n\nYou make a Level 1 Pixel Artist.  You find the master of your guild, and he gives you a quest - ""Make a 16x16 pixel drawing of a dagger, using a minimal palette.""  Once you've completed the drawing (using tools built into the game), it gets evaluated anonymously by other Pixel Artists.  How highly they rate your content (based on the difficulty of the challenge) determines your reward.  Your reward is in Mana points.  Maybe also Gold and Experience points.  Later, ""Ah, welcome to Level 10, young Pixel Artist.  Make a 16x16 pixel, 10 frame animation loop of this orc image, stabbing his spear to the right.""\n\nYou make a Level 1 Chiptune Musician.  ""Make a 4/4 time, 6 measure, single instrument, repeating march.""  Level 10, ""Make a non-repeating, 4-piece requiem.""\n\nYou make a Level 1 Coder.  ""Program a pet to follow you 10 feet behind.""  Level 10, ""Make an orc commander able to yell orders, and orc soldiers who follow them.  If the orc soldiers can't hear, they can't follow the orders.""\n\nYou finally gain enough experience to add a Prestige Class, Level 1 Designer.  ""Make a 10 man fort, using a budget of 1,000 gold.  It must have a gate, sleeping, cooking, latrine.""  Level 10, ""Make a village, using a budget of 14,000 gold.  Church.  Town hall.  Simple healer.""  Oh, what's this?  Prestige Classes have a few new features you haven't seen before...  They get to make quests for Pixel Artists, Musicians, Coders, etc.  They can use existing assets at a low cost, or they can offer bounties for new assets.  Depending on the quality of their work, they receive a reward.  Note, the *design* of a new asset costs the player *directly.*  Like, designing a pig for the game might cost 100 gold.  But a pig *itself* costs only 2 gold, in terms of the budget of their build.  So, designing a pig farm might cost the player 400 gold.  But the blueprints for the pig farm specify ""20 pigs, budget of 80 gold.""  So, 20 pigs * 2 gold = 40 gold.  The blueprints still have a budget of 40 gold for fences, etc.  Drawing up blueprints is not the same as actually creating the thing itself.  And the reward for making an excellent pig farm blueprint could be 1,000 gold.  (Net profit of 600 gold for the player.)\n\nThen Master Class Level 1 Builder.  ""Use blueprints to make a village, population 1,400, with a budget of 20,000 gold.""  They take Level Designer blueprints, and piece them together, instantiating them in the actual game world.  Their commission for doing this could be 2,000 gold pieces.\n\nThen Master Class Level 1 Gameplay.  ""Make a quest from this village, to kill the witch who has been stealing pigs.""\n\nAnd on and on and on...  As more people join the game, the MMO gets deeper and wider, and better looking, more interesting, debugged, etc.\n\nOh, and as actual *PLAYERS* wander around, interacting with graphics, music, coding, etc. - they're sprinkling Mana.  Life essence.  Every minute, say, they drop 1 mana point on something they've interacted with.  One minute, it's the song they're listening to.  The next minute, it's the tree image.  The next minute, it's the code for the orc's flaming sword.  The next minute, it's the builder who carved out this cave.\n\nIf players run out of Mana, they can't play the game any more.\n\nHow do they get Mana?  Buy buying it from the creators, for Gold.  Or real life cash.\n\nOkay, I should go back and edit all of this to specify who gets and spends what kind of currency, when, to make it make more sense...  :)"
36podk,Meta MMORPG game,"The idea is based on telling a story that has a similar premise as the south park episode ""Make Love, Not Warcraft"". It would be a single player/co-op campaign RPG game in which the main story follows you taking back your favorite online MMORPG game from an overpowered force of elite ""nerds"". There would be gameplay both in and outside of the MMORPG and there would be multiple characters that you can play as. It is ment more as a fun, lighthearted, story driven campaign sort of game. The levels that take place in the ""real world"" could be more platformer oriented and the levels that take place inside the MMORPG could be more combat oriented. Target audience kids 5-12 playing on console."
36olv2,clash of clans version 2,"the way clan wars are set up, it's a one-on-one war - one player from your clan, attacks another player on the enemy clan. \nmy idea is why not have all players attack just one big base? screw the timezone differences.  Real-time attack by, say, 40 players to one big enemy base.  So myself and 3 others could concentrate on the east side of the enemy, for example, and some of my other friends will attack from the north, etc. etc.  We will have the usual air and ground troops.\n\nand... AND... the enemy will be online, too!  When we attack their single, humongous base, their players will be actively DEFENDING their base, too! In real-time!\n\nSo it's really encouraging team effort spirit, and much more engaging!"
36m5mh,Space Gladiator Team Manager,"You play as an owner and manager of a team of gladiatos who fight their way from fighting pits on fringe planets to the most prestigeous arenas of the sector capitals.  \nYour team basically works like a party from an RPG game (Baldurs Gate/Neverwinter Nights 2/Dragon Age: Origins etc.): you have your tanks, your rogues, your ranged fighters, your healers and your casters. The difference is that you're not allowed to control them directly, you program them in the same way it was done in DA:O.  \nObviously you make money with each fight, you can use it to buy new equipment for your fighters, promote your team/event to increase your prestige and the number of tickets your team can sell, make shady deals with the organizers/judges to gain an unfair advantage, recruit new members (or eventually purchase some sort of cloning/incubator device that lets you design them from scratch).  \nYou also secure sponsorship deals, assign you fighters to train in order to improve a particular attribute between fights and maybe complete side quests where your fighters are hired as someone's henchmen/security/thugs/thieves for extra money.  \nThere's obviously a possibility for a muliplayer component, it may even be the focus of the game and only the tutorial would be single-player.  \nHell, you can even make it free to play where players purchase visual customization for their team and other things depending on how greedy you want to be.  \n\nI have this idea more fleshed-out than that, so if anyone's interested, I can share more.  "
36ku7u,Hunger Games MMO(ish) adaptation,"I'm not sure if a similar idea has been brought up before but I just wanted to write my idea down here so I don't forget it.\n\n\nMy idea for a game would be an MMO adaptation for The Hunger Games. The focus would not only be on the games themselves, but also on life in the districts and as a victor. \n\n\n**Starting the game:**\nUpon starting the game, you must create a character. Character creation begins with choosing a district and a gender. You then design you character's physical features. After that, you select your character's traits. Traits would work like the SPECIAL system in the Fallout games, with a certain number of points to distribute between traits. \n\n**Questing:**\nYou would not be able to join the Hunger Games immediately. You would first have to reach a certain level through traditional questing. There would be plenty of player-driven actions within the districts that also give a player xp, such as hunting outside of the district and trading with other players. The level you would have to reach to join the games would be relatively low and easy to reach, but the limit would be put in place to give players time to get used to the game, as well as to further character diversity due to earned skills.\n\n**Games:**\nTo begin the games, you would go to the Justice Building (forgive me if that's not what it is called, it's been a while since I've read the books) and activate the reaping. You will be picked 100% of the time, the reaping is simply for immersion. You will be paired with a tribute of the opposite gender, and they will be a real player as well. The two of you will be placed in a lobby of 22 other players from different districts. You will be taken to the capitol by train for training, which will last roughly 15-30 minutes. After training, you will be transported to the arena. The Games will work the same way they do in the books and films. They will last roughly 1 hour or longer, or until everyone is dead. After 3/4 of the players are dead, there will be incentive to meet back at the Cornucopia, simply to speed up the game. If you die during the Games, you have the option of spectating. Players can also spectate from their player housing in the districts. One option to make death more meaningful would be to lose your physical character, but not your items (at least ones not gained during the Games) or your progress. This is debatable, though. Winners of the game would unlock the Capitol for exploration and one Victory Tour, as well as an instanced home in the Victor's Village. Depending on how long you survived in the Games, you would be given a cool-down timer. The bottom 6 would be given 12 hours, the runner-runner up 6 would be given 1 day, the runner up 6 would be given 2 days, and the final 6 survivors would be given 3 days until they could play another round. This system would be put in place to make each game more meaningful.\n\n**Gameplay:**\nGameplay would be in first person. It would have classic action game controls, with left click as primary attack and right click as secondary attack. The graphics would be as high-quality as possible with a realistic art direction.\n\n**Victory Tour:**\nWinners of the Games are given one Victory Tour. This consists of one visit to each of the districts. You can stay as long as you'd like and would be able to do everything a resident of that district would, but you would not be able to return after you leave (until you win another Hunger Games). After completing the main quest, all districts are open forever.\n\n**Storyline: **\nThis part is the most difficult. The game, of course, would not be canon, but it would be set soon before the 74th games. Questing would be meaningful, and not mundane. The Capitol would be the primary source of storyline quests, as it would allow for the districts to have differing quests, making each one unique.\n\n\nPlease, respond with constructive criticism. I'd love to make this happen but obviously I don't have the resources to either get the Hunger Games licence or to even make a AAA quality game.\n\n\nEdit: Formatting"

36gvpa,Hermit Crab Shell Switching,"Inspired by [this TIL post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/36etvz/til_groups_of_hermit_crabs_will_sometimes_form/)\n\nThis could either be a puzzle game, where you have to line up a bunch of hermit crabs in size order, or maybe an arcade game like [Fishy](http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/fishy), where you fight for the larger shells.\n\nEither way, it would be cute/funny to watch a bunch of hermit crabs shuffling around."

36fl56,Play as a Muse,"You watch over a primitive tribe. You can't directly control them, and they are self-reliant enough to stay alive without your interference. But you really can't help yourself -- you are a spirit of inspiration. You can jump from person to person, looking through their eyes, hearing through their ears, and so on. By exerting creative energy, you can jump-start their imagination into making a leap forward in their culture's development. Look, that woman is eating a piece of fruit. She's staring at a rotten piece of fruit on the ground, with a sprout growing out of it. Does she understand the concept that fruit trees grow out of fruit? Zap here with some wisdom! She's forming a concept, but it's not quite there yet. Recharge your creative juices -- watching the children play is nice, or maybe see what that man you inspired to paint gas done. Feeling powerful again? Let's check back on our fruit lady. Ah, she seems to be squatting at the moment. Ew... Seems those seeds survived the trip through her system... Wait, that's it! Quick, while she looks down to check, hit her again! Yes, seeds! That's the key!

Snap images of three events with the same tribesman, and you get the ""percussion instrument"" achievement -- a cutscene of the guy showing off his new discovery/invention, and others begin to use the same thing.

Using a deep and broad set of political options, you could choose to emulate old-world systems, or create your own. As time went on, you'd have to manage your limited resources, make agreements with other factions, and work to both obtain and improve old-world tech."

369y2d,Marvel Universe Concept,"I am a marvel fan. I like playing some marvel games like Avengers Alliance, Marvel Heroes and Future Fight. The similar problem from every marvel games are characters. There are a lot of characters in the Marvel Universe and I am the one who want to see even those minor characters in a game. I wanted to see what these minor characters look like in a game. So, here are my ideas:\n\n1. Like the other games, the player is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. with brief introduction from Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Ironman. \n\n2. The game will feature the map of Earth-616 as it's home page, including: the Savage Land, Attilan, Wakanda, etc. and later in the game, it will feature other worlds outside earth, but will only be inside the 616 universe like: Asgard, Kree Empire, Spartax, etc. The cities are clickable and will preview what it looks like, there must be buildings where heroes are housed or buildings that created products or gold.\n\n3. Before hero/villain recruitment, its home should be acquired first, by either completing a series missions or buying them or completing them first then buying them. And the heroes should be housed from their respective places/homes, example: Ironman - Avengers Tower with Cap, Black Widow but only by upgrading the Avengers tower (more on this later), etc., Black Panther - Wakanda, Storm - Jean Grey School with Nightcrawler, Rachel Grey. Some buildings are housed with a lot of characters like avengers tower, so buying it will give you a level 1 avengers tower that will house 1 hero, upgrading it to level 2 will allow you to recruit another one, and so on. And also, when upgrading buildings, it can unlock certain features like fortifications, defenses, and production (will be explained later). Buildings can be attacked by enemies and attacking it, the building will get looted of products or gold.\nSome buildings will not house heroes but will give you products and gold. And for its defenses, you will need to deploy S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that can be trained in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.\n\n4. Products, Energies, and Golds are used throughout the game and every building may produce certain type of products. For example: Stark Industries will provide you products and weapons, products that are needed in order to level up Heroes. Weapons that will be supplied to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Energies can be found in other buildings like Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum where Wong (a minor marvel character) a non-playable character, can be recruited to produce energies from doing spells or by charging up in the stark industries. Gold, at first, can be collected from government subsidies for S.H.I.E.L.D. then can be later acquired from Stark Industries' income or surplus from vibranium mining.\n\n5. Missions are done by maximum of 3 playable characters. It would be better if the missions are done like the one in Future Fight. There will be a fixed series of missions, and there are single missions that may or may not require a specific hero, you can’t play the mission if you haven’t recruited the required hero yet. The series of missions can be played to unlock housing buildings and even heroes.\n\n6. Heroes will start at level one, and since this game will feature a lot of heroes, maximum level cap will be like 15 or 20 or 25. Like most marvel games, they can be enhanced by Iso-8s that can be acquired in missions or research laboratories. Heroes’ stats includes: Health, Strength, Defense, etc. They will learn attack styles, defensive abilities, passives as they level up and will be used in combats. Character Influence is needed to recruit characters. This can be earned from missions that they will ask you to do or completing mission storylines.\n\n7. Movie tie-ins and comic-book tie-ins are welcome. This can open a Limited Edition Missions that can be completed to introduce new characters and to acquire Limited Edition Uniforms.\n\n8. This might be a very large game, but it will be better if played using mobile phones. This game is played in real time and will require an active internet connection. In-app purchases can be used to unlock much earlier and purchase products/gold/etc.\n\n\n*this concept is still incomplete and I will think more ways on how to make this game more exciting .\n"
369vme,Fracture (a platformer game where the player character sustains realistic injuries),"A game where the player character is able to sustain injuries, such as sprained ankles or fractures, which can only be repaired by finding in-game medical care. The player character is a normal platformer character, no parkour involved, but if the character falls too far, is moving when he/she hits the ground, or does some other thing, the ""stability level"" decreases (stability replenishes over time by slowing down or standing still). If the stability level is too low when the player character impacts the ground or a wall, then the player is injured proportionally to the stability level and the surface and fashion of impact. Injures reduce the player's ability to jump or run as fast, or response times, or may even require immediate medical attention. Medical care costs various amounts of money (which can be collected by completing levels) and can be had inbetween levels. Various injury-reducing measures (e.g., ""impact boots"", running gauntlets) can be had.\n\nThen again, elements of parkour might be fitting in this game. What do you guys think?"
368t7c,Everybody gets paranoid.,"This is a game that is completely possible to do and could be entertaining if the graphics and gameplay are done right. \n  \n  Basically, you start at a friend's house or, perhaps even better, at a masque ball, with eerie masks and victorian-like atmosphere or 1920's style. There are at least 12 or so people, including men and women. The game starts with a cutscene in which they're sitting at the table, having some kind of ""truth or dare"" game, in which they ask each other questions that get more personal and more disturbing and they have to answer honestly. They start asking questions about childhood traumas which could involve anorexia, violent episodes, mental ilnesses, etc. and then they ask each other stuff like ""How would you like to die?"", ""Would you murder someone if there were no repercussions?"" and then ""Would you murder one of us?""(The idea is to make the player relate to their traumas and to make him/her ask his/herself if they were able to kill someone and under which circumstances) and the answers should be precise and cold (e.g. ""Yes. I would murder someone"") as if there was nothing wrong with killing a person. As if the fantasy of murdering a person was captivating. As if it aroused a feeling of pleasurable taboo. They are hypnotized, in some kind of trance, not being really aware of what they're saying. I'm not sure if I'm expressing what I mean correctly, but the idea is that they are in a trance-like state, as if they were drugged; their minds are hazy and they are just letting themselves enjoy those vicious urges, but not unconscious, just not fully awake. I hope someone can help me expand this concept.\n  \nThen, they go out to buy ciggarettes (Or, if it is a masque ball, the just go to different places of the house to do stuff), and when they return they find one of their friends (I imagined it'd be a girl) dead on the couch. Since they are in this trance-like state, they don't remember who stayed at the house and who went to the store (Or who was where, in case it's the masque ball scenario). They can't open the door because the key was broken and it's stuck. And they start getting paranoid. After all, they just admitted that they could murder someone. The game starts and the main concept is that these friends will be trying to murder each other because of the fear and the paranoia. They're still not fully ""awake"". It's like everybody is ignoring the elephant in the room, pretending nothing is happening because they're all suspicious and everybody knows that every one of them will be planning to murder them to survive and, perhaps, to satify their desire for murder. The whole scene should feel surreal, as if ""this isn't really happening"". Should be like a nightmare.\n  \n  At the beggining of the game, everybody will try to hide and create groups to protect each other. You can form alliances with your friends and plan a murder, but they will try to remain as morally correct as possible. As the game progresses you will see that they'll become more violent and likely to betray you.  \n  \n  There could be different ways to murder them: Poisonous pills, a string to strangulate, boiling water, knives, pushing down the stairs, using chloroform, among others. Of course, at the beggining you'd have to rely on stealth and discretion and kill people in the less violent way possible in order to make friends not find out that you killed a one and less likely to turn against you.  \n  \nThe gameplay could be expanded, I encourage suggestions. But the idea is to be the last guy alive. There should be lots of symbolism; it could be a fly that represents the paranoia and guilt, or maybe books in a bookshelf that address disturbing topics related to murder and crime, or maybe a painting with a puzzling desing, maybe a dragonfly that represents the unconscious. There should be lots of references to psychology and crime."
368m80,5v5,"    So, here's my idea. A 5v5 FPS that spans over multiple rounds that involves one team trying to accomplish an objective while the other is trying to stop them - think Counterstrike. However, this would take place in a large public area with lots of people (clubs, stadiums, theaters, etc.).\n\n    Each team, comprised of some ""agents"" are basically trying to kill each other without raising too much awareness - or not at all, go guns blazing. There would be advantages and disadvantages to both styles of take-down. For instance - killing civilians and messing up the environment would penalize you, but quickly killing/preventing the enemies would give you a bonus. Basically, you could take the situation however you wanted as long as you didn't fuck it up. \n\n    The ""agents"" would be similar to heroes or champions in MOBAs. Their abilities would go hand in hand with different ways of taking out enemies - one might have a ton of guns and explosives, and another may have a silenced sniper rifle or something. They would have health similar to how TF2 classes have - not everyone has the same amount and their amount depends on their role. They also wouldn't be super easily killable - one or two shot kills wouldn't happen with most weapons. However, once you die, you stay dead until the round is over.\n\n    The objectives would be pretty standard with a few other ideas. Stuff like capture the flag and team deathmatch would be a given, but I think something like an escort objective would be cool. One of your players would be flagged as the VIP and you'd have to get them from point A to point B or something like that.\n\n     \n\n"
368e39,[Request for ideas] Types of puzzles for a stealth/infiltration game?,"I'm making a game right now where you have to make it to the exit of a level without getting caught. It is top down and you can only see what you would be able to see in real life due to shadows from walls. So far I have guards, which move back and forth in their path and check around them, and heat/motion sensors which will notice you and then if it touches you you will be caught. I am looking for some more ideas of puzzles/things that would catch you. Thanks in advance!"
366mjv,Real Steel Video Game,"Now I know there's already a video game for Real Steel but it's a console exclusive, and it's pretty much a slightly different version of the old Mortal Kombat. \n\nIf you don't know, [Real Steel](http://www.dreamworksstudios.com/films/real-steel) is a movie where robots box instead of humans. The robots go into the ring and are controlled with remotes. A little boy and his not-so-great dad find an old junk robot that watches your movements and replicates them. So they teach it moves and it fights like a human. \n\nWhat I would love is a game that is like a combination of [Toribash](http://toribash.com/) and [Robot Arena 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Arena_2:_Design_and_Destroy) (download available [here](http://wiki.gametechmods.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)). \n\nToribash is a game where you control a person and fight another person. But it's incredibly unique in the fact that to control your guy you set different states for any out of 26 joints in your guy's body. So fighting moves can get as diverse or complicated as you want. It's not about mashing a button to repeatedly punch, you contract your elbow and extend your pec, then extend your elbow and contract your pec. \n\nRobot Arena 2 is a game where you build robots and battle with them, based off of the old TV shows of the same thing. Every other game based on the shows is very restrictive and have little depth. Robot Arena 2 lets you draw the chassis, choose the height, then place all the parts. You build all the weapons in the robot from scratch using bits and pieces. Then you set key bindings for all the motors and pistons. \n\nSo the final product could be where you build your robot boxer, then create a custom move set. You could call out the moves using voice recognition or have key bindings for it. So it's like Toribash when making your moves, Robot Arena 2 when building your robot, then a very unique fighting game in the arena. For programmers there could even be an API where you make robots like Zeus that can work by themselves. "
365heb,Homeless simulator,In the game you would have to collect bottles by clicking on a button but you wouldn't earn much money and you cant upgrade. After you earned enough money you could try to get a job or rent a flat but they wouldn't accept you because you're homeless or because you have no job. The game should be really hard unlike the most clicker games and it would be frustrating not to be able to do anything but to go begging or collect bottles. The game idea is not complete at all but i just wanted to share the basic concept.\n\n**TL;DR Realistic cookie clicker like homeless simulator**
364c70,An online game where you evade a murderer,"No, not like Gmod. This came to me in a dream.\nIt's a first person game where you find yourself in a mid sized map, such as a state fair or something. Huge crowds. Most people are AI but lets say about 10 or 15 people are real players. One player is a serial killer. All the players can work together to evade the killer or turn on each other. Some players might get randomly selected traits, such as being a parent. This would mean they would have to hold the hand of a child all the time. The other players might be morally swayed by the safety of the child. Basically in the dream I had, me and some other players where on a low bride over a state fair. The bride had a crate lift that took about a minute to lower a family needed to be raised up, but the killer was in a car about 30 seconds away from the bridge, so the family might get saved but it could mean letting the killer on the bridge. I think it would be very cool, but 3D games are not my area of programming expertise. let me know what you guys think. "

361vus,Motivating RPG idea,"I recently toyed around with a game idea, where the player would obtain one of many possible creatures/characters with its own unique stats (pokemon-esque, rpg type), which he/she would then need to train in order to compete with other players..\n\n.. the innovative part of the game would be the fore-mentioned training: I had this idea of your creature somehow gaining different stats according to the players own physical involvement..\nfor instance, the player would need to perform different physical tasks (running, hiking, walking, etc.), for which their in-game characters would be rewarded with appropriate stats..\n\nthe point of this mechanic would be to motivate its players into becoming more physically active, while still maintaining a fun and competitive gameplay (hopefully:D)\n\nAnyhow, the biggest obstacle (apart from me not having any knowledge in game design) would be the way in which this innovative mechanic would be implemented to work properly, and also to avoid people taking advantage of it (like driving in a car instead of running, etc.)\n\nany comments/suggestions? :)"
360tlv,Lonely,"A random game concept that I just thought up. In the game, you play as the typical RPG hero, except that none of the NPCs will interact with the player. This means the player can only gain information by listening in on conversations between NPCs. The player cannot buy anything, and if the player is pursued into the village by monsters, it is possible to die in the village with villagers looking on. So, instead of the player character being widely known and famous, the player is a humble and reclusive character who simply slays monsters, overhears about the threat of the big baddie from some of the villagers, and simply slays the monster as much for his own survival as much as the survival of everyone else.\n\nI hope that this unconventional take on the classic RPG will serve as a good/bad example for other developers to follow/use as a cautionary tale; I really don't know how the game will turn out, but if there's a developer out there that has experience making RPGs and is looking for an idea for a small project, please do consider making a first version of this game (hey, it's fine to do ascii graphics!)"

However, instead of using firearms, players use Nokia phones as projectiles and melee weapons. The low range of the projectile attack radically alters gameplay, promoting stealth over firing from cover. Traditionally-accepted tactics such as bounding overwatch become defunct with the longer reload and one-hit kill of the typical Nokia phone, and long alleys function more as surveillance/scouting areas than actual standoff zones. (BTW: shuriken could take the place of nokia phones if you're more of a serious type)"

3bny6b,A strategy game with customizable robots,"The game should revolve around building robots from custom parts and battling your opponents. Although it would be a ton of work and this is the 'games you will never make' sub, I would like to know your opinions and ideas for improvements.\n\nFirst, let's go around the inspirations (feel free to skip the games you know): Robo Rumble, Space Engineers, Wargame and DOTA/League of Legends. I focus on the parts of the games which I got the ideas from.\n\n-------------\n\n**Robo Rumble**\nEons ago there used to be a game called [Robo Rumble (link to download)](http://www.old-games.com/download/5518/robo-rumble). Although it was quite innovative, I don't think it was very successful (cannot prove it with numbers though).\n\nThe main point was that you customized robots by selecting their parts: propulsion (tracks, wheels, legs,...), weapons (missiles, guns,...), powerups (more shield, more damage, etc.). Then you would command these robots to go around and try to destroy enemy base.\n\n**Space Engineers**\n[Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com) is an indie game which can be characterized as 'Minecraft in space'. It allows to put together different blocks (thrusters, control panels, sensors,...) to build spacecraft, bases etc. A lot of things can be automated, or set in a way that the ship's parts react to the environment.\n\n**Wargame**\n[Wargame](http://www.wargame-rd.com) is a great strategy game set to a fictional cold war conflict. The interesting part is that for online battles you create your own ['deck'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aINnW180lAI). You basically preselect a limited number of units from the vast amount the game has. This either allows for players specializing in different types of units (infantry, motorized, air) or, more often, allows for playing with your own strategy and choosing focus.\n\n**MOBA**\nAny [MOBA](https://youtu.be/b556sdep9tI?t=45s) of the DOTA/LoL kind. From this one the map is the interesting part. Two teams starting in the same spots trying to defeat each other's base.\n\n-------------\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nTwo teams play against each other, both teams have 5 robots in game at once built within certain limited money (set before game start). The robots are built pre-game. Each player joins the game with 3 preselected robots from their deck which are cheaper than the money limit. *numbers can vary but let's assume 5 bots, 3 in deck as example*\n\nIn case there are 5 players in a team, each has 1 robot, if there are less players, there still will be 5 robots (1 player can have multiple).\n\nWhen the round starts (and with each spawn after robot dies) player chooses 1 robot to spawn. That will be his only unit until the robot dies. After that, player again chooses from his deck, which robot he plays next. There is a timeout for respawns which grows with the number of respawns of a player.\n\nPlayers build a 'support network' - spread their area of influence. Being in team's support network gives significant extra buffs (home field advantage). The networks of both teams can cover each other but it is possible to dismantle opponent's network (see *abilities*).\n\nRobots can fight each other, using their equipment's abilities or spend time utilizing the network and have a support role, or even both, if they have the right equipment.\n\n**Building of robots**\n\nTo create your deck, you will use a 'robot assembly' accessible in the main menu. Player should be able to put together cube blocks (much like in Space Engineers)\n\n**Building blocks**\n\nYou have a variety of blocks to use for building and you can connect them in any way you like. The blocks have different properties to balance the game:\n\n* power consumption\n\n* weight - propulsion has to match the weight, maybe you need two sets of tracks to support your bot\n\n* price - this will limit the scale of robots you can build\n\n* special effects (shields, *support network* constructors, stuns etc.)\n\nSome examples of blocks:\n\n* power blocks - in case you have too much equipment on your bot (1 available free as the basic block to build on)\n\n* propulsion blocks - legs, tracks, hovering, etc. (varying speed, terrain abilities)\n\n* weapon blocks - rockets, gatlings, electronic weapons, emp (various damage, or effects on the enemy)\n\n* shield blocks - deflecting damage (various efficiency, can be a single direction so you can choose to fully shield or have a lighter robot)\n\n* *support network* blocks - a constructor to allow to extend team's network, destructor (to dismantle enemy's \n\n*support network*, which should be way slower than the constructor)\n\n* sensor blocks - customizable blocks allowing to control other blocks - for instance - when you see an enemy within range, fire EMP\n\n* I have plenty of other ideas, but you get the point\n\n-------------\nThere are many ways it could take - for instance you would have funds based partially on your team's 'support network' and you could use the 'robot assembly' within the game, to have ability to react to opponents.\n\n\nand when I finished writing this, it occured to me:\n\nTL;DR - LoL with fully customizable heroes without leveling system\n\n\n\n\n\n "
3bnvkc,Voice command Space RTS with VR support,"It hit me when I found out about a game called ""There came an echo"" on steam today. Having played the Homeworld series and watched the movie Ender's Game. I think it would be really fun to play a game like this. Where we are running out of place to live on earth and set out to conquer new planets and fight off enemies, gathering resources at the same time.\n\nAll fully controlled by voice commands, including spatial movements of fleets like flanking from top/bottom or sides. And when VR support is added the game will be truly immersive, even better if the tech for VR gloves has been developed.\n\nEdit: Had an expanded idea few minutes after I posted. It would be great if the game also supports companion devices like phones or pads to monitor resources/battlefield when you are focusing on combat in a specific area. But then, companion devices are not necessary as they aren't exactly a great idea as we have seen with a few AAA games. "
3blm7e,My Epic RPG (with flying stronhold) Idea,"Basic Background: Earth in ruins, you travel to the west One Piece style looking for sometihng like the G.E.C.K.

The fourth (Most outer) layer is mountainous ridge where you can instruct people to mine for resources or build defensive buildings. The third layer is a circle grassland suitable for farming and housings. The Second layer is circle of lake / water surrounding the first (core) layer. The First (core) layer is where your main palace is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Specialists**\n\nDepending on their motives, you can gather / recruit / hire / persuade / seduce specialists druing your quest for your flying fotress. Kinda like how Suikoden stronghold works. \n\n* Each specialist will then unlock certain part / feature of your stronghold. Eg. recruiting Bob the Farmer will enable you to start constructing and improving farmland in your stronghold. \n* When put in his specialty area / building, he will improve the productivity / output of that building / area. The higher his level the more bonus he will provide.\n* You can ask Bob the Farmer to mine, but he will receieve penalty for his productivity, therefore not recommended.\n* Specialist will also enable research and improvement to his related speciality.\n* Some specialist can be accompany you for questing. Those who can will have their own unique skills when doing RPG combat.\n* Some specialist may need their personal quest done to unlock epic skill.\n\n*Planned Specialist*: Farmer, Herder , Mayor, Weaponsmith, Armorer, Bartender, Cook, Woodcutter, Druid, Physician, Scholar, Priest, Chronicler, Brewer, Baker, Miller, Tanner, Butcher, Arbiter, Gunsmith, Singer, Poet, Musician, Acrobats, Dancer, Bargirl, Wrestler, Herbalist, Housekeeper, Maid, Ranger, Monk, AStronomer, Librarian, Cleric, Faith Healer, Alchemist, Herald, Courier, Trader, Wizard.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Followers**\n\nOver the time, more and more followers (non specialist) will join your cause. \n\n* These casuals can then be assinged to workplaces such as farm, mine, docks, etc to generate income and resources. \n* Or you can train them and be your devoted army.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alignment**\n\nLike Star Wars you can choose to play the game as a goody two-shoes, spreading love and compassion througout your journey. Or you can be a villanous kitten kicker, leading them with fear and tyranny. Then agian, being neutral has it's merits too.\n\n* Certain buildings / research / improvement / unlocks / specialists can be achieved depending on your alignment, good, bad, or neutral.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Army Management**\n\nSince you don't have a Hulk, you need an army to battle your adversaries who has an army. As you travel, like Specialists, certain city / tribe / land / clan offer a unique type of army for you to use (implying you impress them and didn't obliterate them first on first sight). Eg. the Liontaurs can offer you Liontaur Paladins who excels in trampling and taking damage. \n\n* Army fights will be done like ~~Total War Series and you can join the fight ala Dynasty Warrior~~ Romance of Three Kingdom series.\n* Special Tactics like burn, flank, etc and formations can be unlocked after researched.\n* Certain clans will react negatively to other clans eg. Liontaurs are never in good terms with Kilrathis. Having them in the same area will result a penalty.\n\n*Planned Army Type*: Liontaur Paladins, Dwarven Gattling Gunner, Kilrathi Berserkers, Elven Zen Archers, Orcish Wolf Riders, Bear Cavalary, Blind Drunken Pandaren, Samurai,  Zombies, Pirates, Ninjas, Robots, Lobstermen, Sharktopus \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RPG Element**\n\n* RPG fights plays out like old school Suikoden with front row back row positioning.\n* You get hungry over time. So unless you have a cook in your party you better pack some food / rations / or whatever it is that ur character is eating, while questing outside your fortress.\n* You will need to rest / camp at least once a day. Even a droid needs to recharge.\n* Certain ammo may run out, so remember to bring a lot.\n* Epic killing blow Fallout style when killing something with critical hits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Main Materials in the Game**\n\n* Food: Everybody needs to eat, man. More varieties of farm products and meat = happier people. Srsly, eating oatmeal everyday can only go so far.\n* Mineral: stone, gemstones, iron, everything you need to build or craft something.\n* Wood: mostly for building things purposes.\n* Other: drop stuff from mobs that you will need to craft superior armor / weapons.

3bjuns,"Online, Fighting game with fully customizable characters","So my idea came from watch alot of fighting anime (Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball Z etc.), and I came with this huge idea of a game that involves alot of fighting but u can also customize your character on how he is gonna fight (Stats, Fighting-style, Combos etc.). \n\nSo the thing on how I want the game to be is that you make a character, you join a server, a map is selected and you fight. The modes can be F4A, TD etc. The important thing is that its a game that focuses alot on fighting and give that intensity like you see in animes. So in order to do that I think that there are 2 major components you need to think about\n\n1. BIG MAPS, so what I mean with big maps is that if you have a server with 8-16 people, you need to bring up large maps, and I was thinking dragon ball z big maps just without that they can't move fast or fly (that's a little cheaty), I was thinking if the game could have climb abilities or is that just 2 much.\n\n2. HOW MUCH WILL THE CUSTOMIZATION BE ALLOWED, so what I mean with this is will players be able to make their own skills/transformations or will the game have that each skill can be leveled up the more you use it and add points to it so that you can add passives to the skill (like mastery system in LoL just more complex). What my point is that in this kind of game you need to know how much freedom will the players be able to do with their characters.\n\nThis is my idea on a game that I want on the market. Hope you think this is a good idea."
3bj3bb,A fully procedural game,"As a veteran DM and experienced game player, I've come to see how formulaic some games can be, so I thought: What about a fully procedural RPG? It wouldn't be much more complex than Final Fantasy 1 or Pokemon, but the game would be (almost) entirely random, with a random plot, random quests, random enemies, random map, random npcs, random equipment, and all that. What thoughts do you have, and do you think that the massive replay value and insanely complex metagame will make up for the lack of cohesion?"

They are not immune from solar radiation, so they couldn't go out day, they only go out night, and then the hunting begins. So waht are your opinions?"
3bf2lm,War of the North Dream,"War of the north is a 3rd person RTS\n\n- Story - \n\nThe Dwarves, The Vikings and The Trolls lived in harmony for thousands of years untill one day, when a dark and myserious wizard threw the land into an unending conflict, he completely vanished afterwards. Since then, The trolls, The dwarves and The Vikings has shared incredibly hate for each other and wants to conquer The north.\n\n- Gameplay\n\nGameplay conists of you switching into overview and 3rd person mode. At the Menu, you can pick between 3 difference races, Trolls, Vikings or Dwarves, each has their own unique strategies. \n\n- Dwarves are incredible at building defences that wont fall no matter the preasure put on it. Their bunkers are also the finest, serving as defences to their base.\n\n- While the Trolls are lacking in both Defense and Offensive areas, they make up for it in numbers. They are capable of creating enourmous armies in a matter of minutes. They are capable of completely overwhelming the enemy opposition with ease and their strongest units/heroes are some of the most powerful in the game.\n\n- Vikings are a barbaric race, having lived in the north for the longest of the 3 races. Knowing little of armour, they have survived the harsh cold of the north and are quick on land. Their offensive capabilities are unmatched. Given enough time they can break anything and win a war, with the right tactics of course. While incredibly powerful, they are few in numbers and requires a long time to create new soldiers, so use superior tactics and care to crush your Opponent.\n\nAfter picking a race you will be assigned one of 3 heroes for the faction, each with special abilities to help in specific situations or match your playstyle. no hero is weaker than the other, so there is no right or wrong choice. Starting a match will start you with a Primary base, Lots of workers and lots of troops. From there on you will need to gather resources to furthermore expand your empire. \n\nWalls, Homes, Barracks, Towers and more are one of the many things you can construct in the world. An imortant thing to do is to place out Outposts with ""Sockets"" that help you in the war. Outposts has different names depending on your race. Dwarves: Bunker. Vikings: Village. Trolls: Spawning pools. When you've constructed it, you can add a variety of building such as smiths, Barracks, homes, and more, each of which provide different advantages to you.\n\nWhen you've built up your primary base and Outposts around the map, you can build a recruitment office your main city. From there you can purchase Reqruitment officers which will travel to your outposts and begin to reqruit men. These officers will need to be sent with pathrolls, else your Opponent can send assassins and kill them, making it impossible for you to recruit new soldiers untill you have made new officers. The buildings that you place there are an important factor. Having an archery range there will make your Officer bring back Archers to fight for you, having An archery range and a blacksmith, Will bring back both swords men and Archers. Having more Homes will increase the number of soldiers you get. (Obviously, Dwarves and Trolls do not hat Swordmen or Archers.)\n\nFrom there you can chose to fortify your outposts even more and launch attacks on the enemy. This is where the 3rd person mode comes in handy. \n\n- Third Person\n\nWhile mainly for combat reasons, It can be used to Immerse yourself in the world. Homes as an example, isnt just a home to increase a population number on your hotbar, its an actual home, and you can see Citizen walks around your main city. You can travel around the world on Your Hero that you control in Third person and visit your outposts where there is plenty of life aswell. You can actually follow your officers and watch them go to work.\n\nHeroes are used for the 3rd person combat where you enter their body and take control of them. Heroes are powerful, but they are not invincible. You cant rush into an army single handedly, else you will die. But they come with Powerful abilities, both Passive and Activated ones. Taking controll of a Hero puts you right onto the action, throwing armies at each other, you can look into the sky, watching thousands of arrows and catapult shots, watch soldiers charge at each other as they clash and run into battle yourself and make a name for youself. Battles can last up to 10 minutes, with intense explosion filled warzones bloody, with constant reinforcements untill your Outposts just can spare anything anymore.\n\n- Elite Units\n\nEach race has an elite Unit, that are very expensive, but very powerful aswell. They can be built as much as your Supply cap allows. Seeing an entire army of them is rare, but also devestating. It requires a miracle to survive one of those.\n\n- Vikings: \n\nIce Troll: The vikings are barbaric, as such they have managed to enslave Trolls to serve their human masters. These trolls are big, and are experts at destroying walls and buildings. They have high health and regenerate it fast, but they are quite slow, and they're not exactly intelligent, as such they dont always understand human commands, making them just stop and do nothing.\n\nBerserker: The berserker are warriors that become more and more powerful the more damaged they are. Upon killing something the Berserker regenerates a portion of their life and continues to charge into the fray. They are Fast, Strong and Becomes even stronger with the taste of blood, even if their enemies. Only weakness is that they are quite bad at high health, if the enemy has many archers they can kill of the berserkers before they become effective.\n\nOathlord: Oathlords are commanders of your army, they inspire your army and makes them more efficent on the battle field. Oathlords can inspire each other aswell, so and army of Oathlords is INCREDIBLY effective. They boost, Health regeneration, Attack and movement speed, damage and overall health on allies. This is a minor effect but makes up if they're teamed up with a huge army. \n\n- Trolls\n\nCavemother: Cavemothers are slow and deals little to no damage on their own. But they have the ability to spew deadly poison at their enemy, and their essential to any troll army. They can instatly spawn groups of trolls onto the battle field instantly. It is possible to have an army consisting of just these and overwhelm your opponent completely, but they are very expensive. Their Poisin is effective against buildings.\n\nDark Troll: Dark trolls are trolls that live in the shadows, they have the ability to Teleport and assassinate key targets. They are essential to destroying your enemy's reinforcements and Economy. They are also capable of Sabotaging buildings, either knocking them out, or completely destroying them. Assassination attemps on heroes are foiled before they even begin however.\n\nSpider-Knight: Spider knights are trolls that ride on gigantic spiders. These knights are very effetive at fighting many troops alone, and are useful at hold off counter attacks. They are quite expensive, but is one of the most powerful units in the game. They are capable of climbing over walls. \n\n- Dwarves\n\nExplorer: Explorers are cheap dwarves that do what they say. They explore the land. They require almost to Tech and can be built right of the bat. They are very fast, and have a gun (musket) that they can use to defend themselves. This gun has a long reload times and Explorers have low health. However, Explorers turn invisible when standing still, so they are quite good for setting up ambushes.\n\nMountain kings: Mountain kings are the backbones of the dwarves Army, they are hardy and the most ressilient unit in the entire game. They have the most health and armor of all units, and their attacks cleave. They are capable of leaping into action aswell. They are quite expensive however, but an army of these can break ANY formation. \n\nTroll Slayer: Its basically what it says, Its good at slaying trolls. The more trolls it slays the more powerful it gets. They have a charge ability which lets them run into the battle quickly and instatly kill a lesser troll unit. Their attacks cleave, and deals more damage for each hit against lesser troll units. Catch is that they have low health at the start, and are expensive to make. They need to be handled delicately, else they will die and all the resources spent on them goes to waste. \n\n- Goblin and Dwarf base building\n\nYou very well should know the basics of viking building, its the same as other RTS. Build building on the surface. Dwarves can do that too, but not trolls.\n\nDwarves and Trolls has their main base starting in a cave, with an enterance. Dwarves can upgrade their walls and build a gate at the enterance. These gates are very very VERY sturdy and requires many catapult shots to be brought down. The dwarves can however build tiny enterances that they only can exit, to run outside and stall out the catapults from destroying the gate. Once the gate is down, your enemy is free to run into your kingdom. (Obviously, neither trolls or Dwarves have catapults, Trolls have Giant trolls that hit structures in melee range and Dwarves have rams.) Dwarves can build both inside the mountain and outside. \n\nTrolls on the other hand cant upgrade walls or build a gate. But they can build tunnel systems under the grand, which they can use to send units quickly across the battlefield to attack in a suprise attack. It takes 1 min to make an enterence from a tunnel to the overworld and you need vision of the area. So the enemy you're supirse attacking can deny you attempt at trying to invade him. Trolls can even invade inside mountains meaning that they can destroy dwarves from the Inside instead of having to bring their Gate. \n\nThe mountain Dwarves and trolls are given are tiny at start, but can be expanded in a dungeon keeper kind of fashion.  \n\n-This sums up the Idea, Ill have some extra things!\n\nYou can give orders while in 3rd person, but these are moslty retreat, and charge type of orders. While in 3rd person, AI will take control of your primary base and defend it of attackers incase you're counter attacked. While the AI is good at what it does, top players can do better than what it does. More advanced orders are assigned in Overview mode.\n\nThere is no Hit and run meachanic in the game, removing the infuriating part of having your units pulled all the time, and die over an annoying set of time due to archers firing at your units, running back and repeat. \n\nTrolls have No way of building structures on the outside, only Dwarves and Vikings can. They can also only build Spawning pools (outposts) inside the mountain. Spawning pools cannot defend themselves. The trolls have no defences and their units are slightly worse than the two other races, but they are so incredibly fast to create new soldiers and their population cap is higher than other races so It should not be a problem. \n\nMatch making consists of A free for all 1v1v1. It will try to match Trolls Vs Dwarves Vs Vikings. But it can also be different and have Trolls Vs Vikings Vs Vikings. Trolls Vs Trolls Vs Trolls. Dwarves Vs Vikings Vs Dwarves. Etc. So if you attack another player, you can expect another player to counter attack you again so you have to pull back in some cases. (You will be notified when your buildings/units are under attack.) \n\nMatches can last from 5 min to a couple hours. The game will be progressive enough so it doesent feel boring when the game drags on very long. Team working and Leaving is forbidden and is Bannable. (If you leave too many times and team work too many times. that means if you Join another player to kill another player, in unfair 2v1.) This is allowed if its an Allied Game mode, such as 2v2. \n\nIt doesent take very long to being to fight in a new match. You start with a huge army, and you can assign an AI (Or do it yourself) to build up your base while you fight with the army that was given to you at start.\n\nIf this becomes popular, Ill create Names, Abilities and stories for each of the 9 classes (3 per race.) \n\n**FIN**"
3bd3z4,Mountain Man Survival Game,"A free range survival game where you are mountain man and have to hunt,fish,skin animals,make hides,make clothes,evade Indians,start fire, trade at the rendezvous, kill Indians, trade with Indians. Build a cabin, you would have different skills that evolve overtime. Also some tribes would be friendlier than others, like the Blackfoot would be more hostile than the Crow and so on. You would set traps and skin and tan beaver to get more pelts. Over time you could get a better rifle. You could travel all over the Rocky Mountains. You could get frostbite and get mauled by bears but if you died you would start a little ways back but not have to start all the way back. This was just an idea I had for a week or so. I know if it was in a store I would buy it. I might like to make this myself one day but would like if you could give me some feedback that would be great!!"
3b9xnq,Legacy - A RPG about change,"I'm a game developer. I'm looking to start my first big project with something that brings rpg mechanics and ideas into the modern scene.\n\n**The game is set on** a [finite procedurally generated floating island/continent.](http://www.sumasix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3_by_prusakov-d6khb94-1024x576.jpg)[ There are a multitude of races to pick from](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XcddlZ3fD3g/hqdefault.jpg), a lot of them being pulled from classic fantasy races and a few unfamiliar ones as well. All races and non playable factions can be allied with and have merchant/bank/home equivalents.\n\n**The combat** of the game is fast paced and difficult. Positioning is important, and many classes have dashes and teleports. All classes have different preferred tactics to avoiding and dealing damage. Mage classes may want to maintain a distance to better use their range. Warriors will tend to use shields and rolls to keep in range without being hurt.\n\n**The core feature of Legacy** isn't in  the combat though, it's in the setting. Legacy has a generated timeline for a generated world. Different races appear at different times so when creating a character in a certain era, race selection will be limited. \n\n**After making a character, every decision affects future plays.** For instance: I play a character who dies in an a haunted forest. On my next generation/character, my previous character is a potential enemy now in the forest.\n\n**Population changes for races and monsters are also influenced by the amount killed in the previous generations.** Some may even go extinct if hunted enough, rendering races unavailable for play. \n\nI intend for there to be up to 5-7 ways to *retire* a character. **From death to retirement,** I want each play through to further personalize your world.\n\n                                                **--Influences on Legacy--**\n\nI want to really capture [the way old school EverQuest](http://wiki.project1999.com/images/thumb/Eq_poster_1998.jpg/800px-Eq_poster_1998.jpg) felt.[ It was so open and deep.](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/scenery/butcherblock-path.jpg) There weren't any maps or quest menus. To play, you had to listen to the NPCs or find something in the world. I also loved that you could build factions for non playable factions in the game such as the gnolls and orcs. The music will also be inspired by the midi tracks from early EQ. \n\n[Another inspiration for Legacy is Delver.](http://www.maynedon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/delver-screen2.jpg) I love the game's visual style, and will definitely be going for something like the outdoor section of the game.

3b9qz3,Sandbox Supervillain game,"Hey Redditors,\n\nHad an idea for a game. The player makes their own supervillain and rival superhero before starting the game in a randomly generated main city. The player then can begin aquirring a base, money through bank robberies, and start building gear based on their theme and powers. Once the player feels like they're ready, they can go after large scale goal. This can be whatever they desire, such as stealing a dinosaur skeleton, robbing the local gold depository or even just causing mayhem. Their rival superhero will spawn and engage the player in a boss fight. Upon defeat, the player can escape or be arrested, if they didn't think ahead or have some other plan. \n\nAside from this, I would like some input or ideas!"
3b78t3,Aradale Mental Asylum Horror Video game," I recently took a ghost tour of the Aradale Mental Asylum Australia's biggest Asylum. With the stories I heard I thought it would be a great for a video game with all the same areas we explored. And in the video game as you go on you find notes before you enter a certain room telling you a story about the room with commentary done by one of the tour guides, that would be perfect (Btw the tour guides have thrilling voices) One example is a story about nurse Mary and when you enter you see her... if anyone that has done one of the tours you'll see how perfect it is for a video game.. (Also it should be first person with a torch like most indie horrors, with stellar graphics) What do you think?"
3b4qkc,Barter based Survival Game,"In this game you'd play as a small farmer in the country in the middle ages. You'd play it from a 2D perspective looking to the side like in ""[This War of Mine](http://i.imgur.com/UzdqQTT.jpg)"". You would manage your farmer growing crops, eating, sleeping, raising animals, etc. After each day ends you would see how much excess things you have. You can head of to the market and then barter and negotiate with other people. Once you have saved enough money you can by a wife. (They did that). The game will progress with children and food and will only end when you die."
3b40qk,Zombie Inception,"Ok not really, but a good title is half the battle for your attention. \n\nNow imagine all the zombie games out there, they involve killing zombies. So let's make a game where you ARE the zombie!\n\nThe world is struck by a flesh rotting virus that impacts the brain and turns humans into continuously rotting, dying cannabalistic savages. Fortunately (lol), the ultra-rich and their corporations were prepared with shelters and money and scientists to figure out an experimental medicine that delays the rotting, but alas, no definitive cure for the effects to the brain have been discovered. \n\nThis is where our protagonist comes in. He is a newly infected human who's flesh has begun to rot. However, his brain seems to be partially immune to the virus. Now his mission begins to trek through the land (USA?Europe?) to the shelters with labs, only to find most of them compromised, with few surviving humans who definitely don't want to listen to his garble (I did say partially immune right?). So he must find ways (stealth? Rallying the other zombies for attack?) to retrieve the medicine which gives him time to continue his mission to save himself and possibly humanity. Now maybe as he rots, he becomes less immune to the virus and your character starts to have moments of uncontrolled savagery (however, your pre-frontal lobe is unaffected, so you're still intelligent, a step up from the regular zombie. Therefore your savagery has the chance to become conniving if timed properly [lets give it a timer]). \n\nNow that I've written it all out it sounds like a reverse ""last of us"" but whatever, it has potential to be much more. To anyone thinking it sounds lame, imagine the graphics it could have. Dark dirty cityscapes heaving with mindlessly decaying savages, while you skulk about looking for ways to accomplish your goals. A third person view of your sagging body, flesh and meat falling off occasionally. \n\nWell the limitations of such a virus restricts the plot to I'd say a couple of weeks maximum, so it'd have to be fasted pace, maybe with vehicles involved. Idk... There'd have to be survivors besides the oligarchs in their shelters. \n\nAnyway, I've been babbling but this sounds like a game I'd like to play. If it gets made all I really want is to give some creative input (I got ideas for days you guys) and a free copy :P"
3b39m3,Different Genre Survival Games,"This is really simple and I am flabbergasted that no one has created this yet. Picture a DayZ-ish game set in the Wild West. You can thrown into a desert wasteland with nothing but revolver with one bullet. There could be small towns scattered sparsely with different crafting stations, players must work together to make these towns thrive. But players can also chose to be outlaws and attack and steal resources. Other genres could fall into place. A modern survival game would essentially be GTA meets The Sims but with crafting. Perhaps the only way to even play the game is to have two other players ""give birth"" to you. Would love to hear suggestions."

3b2ke0,Skimboarding meets Final Fantasy??,
3b2jw3,Where to go next?,"So I've got a relatively interesting idea for a game. I know what the main idea of the game will be, only problem is that  I can't figure out how to expand this core idea into the details of my game. Every time I try I just draw a blank. Without giving too much away I just need some way to overcome this writers block type thing. If anyone here has prior creative writing experience I would appreciate the help. \n\nI don't want to say the details that I have already but it's a psychological horror game where instead of the typical player vs monster, the horror comes from the exploration of the protagonists own mind in the darkest fashion."
3cd49d,Superhero Games,"There are already a lot of superhero games out there but there are some superheroes that need games and I have some ideas of how to do them.\n\nFlash/Quicksilver Game:\nThese heroes are solely based on speed, so the game could use an array of exciting and new game mechanics, for example, whilst the speedster is running the world around them has slowed down and it, to the player, looks like you are just sprinting as fast or slightly faster than you do in other games. This would combat the problem of the player crashing into walls because they can't think fast enough. Obviously villains have a way of beating these heroes and there could be a few fun ways of incorporating their abilities.\n\n  Just imagine it, playing as the Flash fighting against the Reverse-Flash, fighting on a busy street in Central City where you are both fighting at the speed of games like the Arkham series but everything around you is in slow motion, it would be an amazing experience aswell as the ways you could interact with these slow moving objects.\n\nThe Green Arrow/ Hawkeye:\nI feel like these two characters would suit a FPS style game just like using the bow in games like FarCry or Crysis, but with a smoother, more pristine feel. It would have to feel like you are killing enemies with ease with your bow, so maybe add a focus feature just like in the Sniper Elite games, in which it slows down time and informs you where to shoot to account for bullet drop. It could also incorporate a feature like the Dead Eye Targetting in Red Dead Redemption or the similar mechanic in Call of Juarez, in which you can snap on to multiple enemies to kill them all in quick succession.\n\nDaredevil:\nI think if Daredevil were to have his own game it would have to be a very dark game, maybe even black and white, as the character is blind. Sound to vision could be a really interesting mechanic to use within the game as you can make it so that Daredevil can see clearer the louder a sound is. It's a pretty simple idea but it could be really nicely presented in a game.\n\n\n\nThat's all I can think of right now, if you have any more ideas let me know, I would be really interested in reading some of your ideas."
3c91nw,[AAA] Adventure RPG that has survival elements and a very dynamic world.,"**Section One; Introduction:**\n\nYes, yes, I know I just combined a bunch of the most popular genres into a single game and I probably lack originality, stay with me.\n\nSo, my major problem with modern RPGs like Skyrim and The Witcher 3 is pretty simple; The world waits for you to make a move, and nothing will happen until you do. If you choose to not assist either side in the Civil War of Skyrim, the war doesn't continue. If you don't kill a monster in The Witcher 3, it doesn't do anything until you come back to kill it. It's always felt very immersion-breaking for me that the world revolves around the player, and not the other way around. That's not to say that the player shouldn't be able to influence it, but it seems stupid to me that events in the world always seem to pause for an infinite period of time simply so the player can go upgrade his armor or do fuck-all while looking into space.\n\nI also have a problem with world size. This is less apparent in The Witcher 3, because its major cities are pretty damn big, but it's still an issue. The size of the world in Skyrim for example is deceptively small. Its ""mountains"" utilize forced perspective to look drastically taller than they really are. You can walk from one end of the game world to the other in a couple hours. Perhaps to many people this sounds huge, but I think it could still be improved. I will get more into this later on.\n\nThere are a bunch of other, more minor details I'll be laying out in this post. But these are the two major things I wanted this game idea to have. So let's begin:\n\n**Section Two; Dynamic World:**\n\nA lot of modern titles have introduced player actions that cause ripple effects across the story and occasionally dip into gameplay. But, as forementioned, I believe that these ripples shouldn't be caused ONLY by the player's choices. A truly dynamic world needs to have numerous factors influencing everything from the economy to the inhabitants of the cities and towns. Here is a broad list of what I'd like to see in this game:\n\n* Fluctuating economy. The economy of the world, meaning how the currency is spread out among the NPCs, should be constantly changing. For example, say there is a war going on between two areas and they begin to burn each others farms. Suddenly the price for bread goes up significantly in these areas and thus the farmers for a third, unaffiliated region, become incredibly wealthy. The result is a world where the player is able to come to conclusions for which NPCs have the most money stored away in their homes, and, if they so wish, steal from those people. Are you beginning to see what I mean now? The player isn't the centerpiece of the world, they're just riding the stream and going with the flow as events unfold.\n\n* Weather determines population, geography, and more. So let's take our farm owners and continue with the example. They are now very rich, supposing you haven't robbed them of their entire fortune, and everything seems to be going well for them. Unfortunately for them this game happens to have a random number generator that influences weather, and it just so happens that a coldfront is coming through. Within the next few ingame weeks their crops all die. Perhaps they will have enough money to make it through the coming winter, unless a certain thief stole all their coin and left them bankrupt. That would be unfortunate, because they would starve to death. But hey, at least you got some money right?\n\n* Wars between provinces and political disputes. These can determine the fate of more than just a few farmers, but entire regions instead. Say you have a greedy lord ruling over a large area of land. Do you remember how I said armies were burning crops? Well, turns out he's the one who ordered it. He would rather see the common people starve than lose his war, and thus he ordered the crops burnt. This is where player choices CAN influence the world immensely. The player can, through either a questline or their own independent actions, throw this tyrant out of power, perhaps even before he declares war in the first place. In doing so they could potentially save the lives of thousands of NPCs, many of which have shops that could be useful to the player. Whether through an elaborate assassination, subtle political moves, or by robbing him of all his gold, he can be dealt with.\n\n* Quests performed/not performed by the player. Many (but not all) quests would run on a timescale, and while not getting them done may simply prevent you from receiving their reward, some could have serious consequences. For example, say that you ignore a quest to kill a dragon because you weren't strong enough at that point, but helped a city with their economy problems in another series of quests. Now that city has an immense amount of gold in its vaults, which attracts the still-living dragon, that destroys the entire city and makes a nest within its vaults. Now the destruction of the city has ripple effects on the economy for the rest of the region.\n\n**Section Three; World Size:**\n\nHow big should the world be? Big enough so that your character can starve to death or die from hypothermia before they reach another settlement. Didn't pack enough food? Didn't bring weather-appropriate clothing? Tough shit. That mountain you see in the distance doesn't look big because of forced perspective, it's literally the size of a real life fucking mountain. Doesn't this large of a world sound completely unreasonable? After all, if it took Bethesda four years to make Skyrim, how long would it take to make a game where a single mountain is larger than The Witcher 3? I don't pretend to be a game designer, but what I do know is that Daggerfall's game world was *161,600 square kilometers*, and utilized random generation. All these imaginary developers would need to do is hand craft the cities and more important dungeons, and leave the rest to the generator.\n\nBut why would you ever want to walk a hundred ingame miles just to get to a settlement? Wouldn't that get repetitive? Well, that's where the survival aspect comes in. Your character has many needs. They must eat, drink, occasionally sleep, tend to their wounds, and avoid diseases and infections. I'll get more into the details of survival later on, but for now I'll sum it up like this: The survival portion of the game in the wilderness and the quest-driven portion of the game around major areas are so different that it'll be like playing a whole new game when switching between them.\n\n**Section Four; The Character:**\n\nWith the major points covered I think it's time to move onto the character.\n\n* Character is completely customizable in terms of how they appear. Most of these customization options are aesthetic, but some, such as height and muscle, can mildly affect your character's stats. A tall, muscular character will have a longer weapon reach and will hit harder, but will also be slower and less agile. Furthermore, muscles can grow over time based on how much you use your weapons. A thief doesn't prioritize open combat, so will naturally be more scrawny than a mace-wielding barbarian.\n\n* Your character has several stats such as strength, agility, speed, etc. Most of these are pretty self-explanatory and common for most RPGs so I won't get into them that much.\n\n* The character levels up by completing quests, exploring, and defeating enemies.\n\n* Perks and skill trees are a thing. Perks can be acquired by leveling up, finding special points out in the world, and completing quests. The skill trees are comparable to Skyrim, though instead of having a dozen separate skill trees there are only two large ones. One for mundane practices, and one for magic. The magic tree is divided into two primary sections that focus on either forbidden magic or divine magic. Practicing forbidden magic is... well, forbidden, and will get you into trouble with the law in most areas whilst divine magic is fine to use, as long as the local culture isn't entirely against magic. Meanwhile the mundane tree is divided into several branching sections that include everything from diplomacy to assassination. Getting a large number of perks in a specific section of the mundane tree can block you out of other sections. For example, if you keep putting points primarily into combat-oriented perks, eventually some of the diplomacy perks will begin to become blacked out. I could go on and on about all the ideas I have for these perks, but I'll wrap it up for the sake of time.\n\n* The character has a stamina bar and a health bar. Stamina is drained when running, jumping, attacking, performing certain perk abilities, and when casting spells. The damage you (as well as NPCs) take depends on the type of weapon, the armor you're wearing, and where you get hit. Getting damaged in specific areas can also have extra side-effects. For example, getting hit in the leg will slow you down or even throw you to the ground, getting hit in the torso causes extra bleeding damage, and a headshot with a bow will instantly kill if you aren't wearing a helmet. Even after a battle bleeding damage can continue to the point of death, and infections are also possible. Therefore it is wise to have a way to heal yourself through either magic or medicine.\n\n* Your character must eat, drink, and sleep. Though most of these are very simple to do, in the wilderness it becomes very easy to run out of food or water, and it can be dangerous to sleep without some kind of tent or cabin. The longer you go without water, the lower your maximum stamina. The longer you go without food, the lower your maximum health. The longer you go without sleep, the weaker your hits will be. After being without any of these for an extensive period of time will result in the character blacking out, and waking up in the nearest inn.\n\n* Character has bag space and carry weight, and both can be increased. Bag space determines how much food, supplies, and misc items you can have at one time, while carry weight determines what kind of armor and weapons you can carry on you. This isn't like Skyrim where you can have a dozen swords in your pocket. Any armor and weapons you find must also have a free space for them. You can't carry more than one chestplate for example, and it must be worn on your body. Furthermore, the number of weapons you can carry depends on your sheaths for them as well as your carry weight. Even if you have the ability to hold two swords, unless you have two sheaths you still can't carry them both. It is important to craft gear that can allow you to hold all the weapons you plan on using.\n\n**Section Five; Survival:**\n\nI've already touched on most of this, so I will be brief. You can camp, hunt, boil water, cook, etc and all of this is necessary to staying alive while away from settlements. You cannot simply start walking towards a mountain unprepared and expect to make it to your destination, you simply won't make it. If you need to go on a long journey, plan for it.\n\n**Section Six; Crime:**\n\nThieving is a thing in this game, and you can steal from pretty much anybody. You can rob vaults and banks, break into merchant's homes and jewelry stores, and get rich off of it. You can also murder people and other things. But it is important to not get caught, because there is a very advanced crime system I've spent hours of my life hypothesizing that makes sure you get punished for it:\n\nHave you ever seen those branching ideas charts? You know, like [this](https://mytutor.sfasu.edu:8080/owl/sites/default/files/imagepicker/3/clustering02.png)? I'd like you to imagine one of these, but with the bubbles as towns and cities of varying sizes. Most of these bubbles are connected to one or more other bubbles, and most of them are in some way connected to the biggest ""main"" bubble. This is how the crime system works. If you commit a crime in a small city, the bubble will ""fill up"" and the guards and townspeople for that area will be on alert. But every *connected* bubble will *also* fill up, since many of the connected cities will be significantly larger, they won't fill up as much, because a giant metropolis hardly cares about some petty theft in a small town. However, if you commit one or more serious crimes such as murder or you steal from an influential member of society, that can cause the larger bubble to fill up more, which in turn spreads awareness for your crime across the entire region. Though depending on the relationships between countries, word of your crime may not reach beyond national borders no matter what you do. Nevertheless, being a wanted criminal throughout an entire country is less than ideal. The more wanted you are in a city or region, the harder it will be to move around in that city.\n\nThere are four Crime Levels for each settlement: Unknown, Aware, Vigilant, and Alerted. Unknown is the default stage, where the guards and people are totally relaxed. During this phase you can pass through gates without care, and many people even leave their doors open while they're home. Aware is the second stage, where people will shut their doors and won't go out as often. The guards are more cautious and may be alerted if they see you doing anything suspicious. The third stage is Vigilant. While a city is vigilant, the main gates require a guard inspection to pass. Any stolen items or subtle weaponry will cause them to attempt an arrest. Citizens are wary and will not carry as many valuables when outside their homes. Alerted is the last stage. During this stage curfews are in place, gates are locked, and guards are very aware of minor disturbances. They will not tolerate suspicious behavior and may even choose lethal force for minor infractions. This is why it's important not to get caught, because in addition to these crime levels, you also have a wanted level. You can walk somewhat freely among an alerted city as long as they don't know that you are one of the criminals, but get caught committing a small crime (or even worse, a murder) and within a few days your face is plastered across every poster in the city.\n\nEven if you get caught in the act there is still hope, however. Because if you were only seen by one or two NPCs you can still resort to murdering them and leaving no witnesses. If not, then they will report to the guards what they saw and the city will be on the lookout for you. To clear your bounty you can turn yourself in and serve jail time, which will weaken your stats and advance game time significantly depending on the crime, making you miss out on a bunch of quests. Of course, there's always the option of escaping...\n\n**Section Seven; Conclusion:**\n\nI didn't talk about the specifics of character advancement, the story, or combat, because those are really too specific to write down in a reasonable period of time. I've been writing this for about five hours now so I decided to wrap it up. If you have any ideas or considerations, please let me know :)"
3c90tg,"My Childhood Dream: A Detailed, Immersive, Challenging, Prehistoric Park Builder. (Discussion VERY Welcome)","I, like many people, had that phase as a young child during which dinosaurs were THE shit. I, like slightly less people, never lost the sense of wonder surrounding the fact that these hulking machines of flesh and bone walked the earth that we now inhabit. I think it's a minor tragedy that we will never be able to  really admire the beauty of ancient life in all of its glory. But, all romanticism aside, I would love to see a game that allowed the dinosaur-geek in all of us to experience their own slice of prehistory. I often ponder how this game would play when I'm waiting to fall asleep, in the car, and the like. My base ideas draw heavily from my childhood favorites : Zoo Tycoon and Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis; taking concepts from both, and adding some modern flair.\n\nSo here's what I've got so far. These ideas are welcome to change and I would love some creative input. I'll start off with the major tenets essential to delivering the player experience that I envision.\n\n1.  A Multitude of Detailed Animals\n\nOne thing that I always yearned for in the aforementioned ZT and JPOG was a greater catalog of animals. In my idea, ( which from here on out I will refer to as ""Revival"". Cheesy as all hell I know, but it's short and sweet,) there would be a large range of species encompassing prehistoric reptiles, dinosaurs in particular, amphibians, mammals, marine life, and possibly Pterosaurs as well. An emphasis would be placed on detail; custom animations would be made for as many animals as possible. The idea here is to give the player a sense of connection and awe of their creations. In the aspect of animal design, scientific accuracy would be critical. Yes, that means some of the dinosaurs would be feathered. But they'd be badass feathers.\n\n2. Somewhat Challenging Gameplay\n\nRevival would be meant to be played on its ""campaign"" mode, in which there would be standard tycoon gameplay , i.e. , the balance of funds, guest and animal happiness, etc. However, it would be somewhat unique in the sense that the major emphasis would be placed on exhibit design and careful observation to learn each species' likes and dislikes to achieve maximum suitability. Of course, this would have to well balanced, interesting and not overly difficult, to keep from becoming frustrating. Optional hints or an in-game encyclopedia could help. New species would unlock in tiers; the idea being that in the beginning you were somewhat limited to more ""basic"" creatures, but as you progressed there would be more interesting selections. Depending on the species, getting the animals to breed in captivity would be difficult, hopefully creating a sense of achievement when you finally see your lady Rex building herself a nest. There would be a few special animals that would be unlocked through challenges, rather than progression. Of course there would also be a customizable sandbox mode, in which the player could toggle auto-maximum happiness, unlock-all, and such.\n\n3. Powerful Creative Toolbox\n\nThe player would be able to customize their plot before beginning a new park with a set of flexible terraforming tools. These same tools would be available during the game, but would cost money to use. There would be a variety of themes of building and decoration, to give the player as much creative freedom as possible. The terraforming would also tie in to the animal care aspect, with certain animals taking to alpine terrain and others to desert, etc.\n\n4. Mod Support\n\nDespite their best efforts, realistically, the devs would only be able to create so much content before the game needed to be finished. And while there could be potential for expansion packs, (this could be how mammals and marine life are implemented,) the game would be designed in the most mod-friendly  way possible, to give the community the ability to create the new content that they wanted to see.\n\nSo those are the pillars of Revival. Like I said, much emphasis would be on making the animals feel alive. So pack and herd behavior would be fleshed out.\n\nOne thing that I imagined very vividly in my head was the way a new dinosaur( or any other creature that was born of an egg), would be delivered to the exhibit that you assigned it. The player would select the species in the menu, and would be given the option to choose gender and whether they wanted a single egg or a clutch of unrelated specimens. Then they would select the location in which the egg(s) would be placed. Instead of the egg(s) instantly being there, there would be a detailed sequence in which one of the hired rangers/scientists (haven't decided which one should do it,) would walk to one of the player-built genetics labs and retrieve the egg(s), which they would wheel to the exhibit in some sort of incubation cart. The keeper would place them in the location that the player had specified, and then erect a temporary incubation unit over the makeshift nest. After enough in-game time had passed, the egg(s) would begin to hatch, and the ranger/scientist would return to remove the incubator. The purpose of the whole thing is to create a sense of excitement and suspense in the player for their new baby animals. Kind of like a watered-down version of getting a new puppy. I need to give more thought on how the operations for non terrestrial-egg-laying creatures would play out.\n\nWell, there's what I've got so far. I'd love to bounce ideas around with whoever's interested and I will likely update this post as I flesh the game out better in my head and if other people are interested. I'm glad to finally have this fantasy of mine written out. Alas, I'm kind of like John Hammond. I have the dream, but lack the skills to make it happen myself. But unlike John Hammond, I don't have the money required to make other people do it for me.\n\n"
3c72x8,Spell casting and creation in video games.,"In most video games, such as Skyrim, to cast spells to hold a button. I'm looks for ideas for more complex ways to cast spells. The most complex would be using something like Eragon's magical system. There's a second language you have to learn and you speak your spells created in the language to cast them. "

3c4uw6,DimensionSplitters (RPG) - Timesplitters/dragon age cloning RPG,"TLDR; Let AAA producers create an RPG with choices like dragon age, but don’t force people to play through the game multiple times to get the full experience. Furthermore create a fun setting for a story in RPG worlds that is in the style of the timesplitters series and let the game make sense that way as well. Would you pay money?\nHere is the idea.\n\nI'm a big fan of timesplitters 2 and 3, but I understand that an offline FPS multiplayer shooter will never work anymore and thus will never be made :'(. But this amazing RPG would! What i loved about TS games is that they took certain very cliché but cool movie settings and made a gamemap about it and put in all the essentials for a working atmosphere in it to give a trembling experience through time.\n\nMy game will give this same experience in a RPG setting. Sergeant Cortez will travel through dimensions (instead of time) in order to open a portal (or close it or whatever plotdevice is necessary). This way, fun and recognisable RPG settings will be visited/experienced and NPCs will be met. The player should be touched in their remembrance of major events that happened in RPGs we all know (think Evoland and also see my comments at the end).\n\nAt the start of every map you will get the opportunity to strategically form your RPG character through an extensive ability-points distribution system that will form your playstyle.\nDifferent dimensions give 2 creative possibilities for the creators of the game to play with:\nDifferent choices will influence the outcome of how you finish a level, but you always have the opportunity to play it again and make a different choice and are sometimes required too. So you first need to play a certain level (or map), make a decision to either help an NPC or kill him (dragon age style) and get his crystal and finish the level. Later on you will have to play the level again and do the opposite to get the password to open the doorway (or the other way around) and get to a new part of the game.  This way the story follows kind of a tree structure with different endings and beginnings. So this kind of is the playingfield and the basis on which to build a funny story that plays with the different dimensions as timesplitters 3 played with timetraveling.\n\nThen the second purpose for the dimensions. At the start of every challenge you get a certain number of skillpoints to divide and play with in order to finish the challenge. Because challenges differ, every challenge requires different division of skillpoints/abilitypoints and playstyle to finish it. This way every challenge requires gradual testing and strategic thinking in order to complete them. This is awesome fun! What does this have to do with dimensions? Think about it, your starting character has gained fighting experience and obtained skills during their lives until they came into a challenging situation. If you change the dimension, the challenge stays the same, but the preceding events differ and thus have surpassed in a different dimension.\nTimesplitters was so amazing because of the Arcade leagues that made it so challenging. They had like, i don't know, 50 game maps that players had to finish to unlock characters. Every map had a bronze, silver, gold and platinum cup and the target for every dedicated player was to finish them all. My RPG has the same thing, but then for RPG quests/bosses. The gameplay is the same as dragon age or a similar RPG with a very extensive system of skills that creates your character. Every challenge requires you to think of strategies to play with, how to efficiently distribute your skillpoints and to playtest them until you have finished the challenge at least once (with a decend score).\nI hope this all makes it understandable, maybe even  for people that have not played timesplitters or dragon age. Now, if I post this on kickstarter.com and get 1 billion dollar and convince the original creators of timesplitters to team up with experienced RPG makers and create this sublimely game, would you buy it and play it? Please let me know in the comments.\n\nMore ideas for the game.\nYou start the game in a prison of some sort (Bethesda style).\nAt a certain point you will be required to make an essential decision that puts one of several rulers on the throne. (witcher 2, dragon age 1 etc.)\nAt a certain point, nearing the end of the game, you will get the totally controversial, mind grinding decision to either put on your strongest armor or the one that looks slightly cooler.\nThe setting should be recognisable and a bit cliché, making fun of fetching quests, stupid obstacles, merchants with refilled stocks every 24 hours, that kind of things.  \n\nAllright, this is my idea. I am never going to make it and if it is in a steamsale for 5 euros I wouldnt buy it (but rather find a friend who bought it and play it at their house for free). I do however want your opinion and want you to tell me why this game already exists and what it is called. "
3c4gkw,"FIREPEGS, a toy of space, time and causality to play the game of challenges.","Pleas excuse me Reddit, it doesn't not fit the template, but [I have a prototype](http://firepegs.com/_outgoing.html), which you can try right away because it's a web-app. The app it's totally save and self-containing. No cross-scripting, no reporting to other sites, etc. Absolutely nothing commercial.  \n\nIf you clicked on the link in the beginning, you must see the links to some sample projects on the left. You may click and watch, then stop simulation and start tinkering, changing the colors of the elements and delay times on the links. The easy patterns to start are those from **Around** to **Complexity**.\n\nI have a chapter describing this app, [which you may choose to read at some point](http://firepegs.com/#fpc0200).\n\nIf you don't want to read it yet, then OK, there are few controls on top of the board. First of all, remark this selector: GO-ST-RD, which means GO-SET-READY. In READY mode you change the colors and the links. In SET mode you prepare simulation to run. In READY mode you watch your creation. \n\nRST means RESET, it resets the pegs (the elements) and lets you edit them. TPS means Ticks Per Second, and it defines the speed of simulation. TTG means Ticks To Glow. You can also request a new clean board and color all the elements at once.\n\n[In the first chapter](http://firepegs.com) I explain the origin of the toy, the structure of the elements and how they interact. Look for the picture, it pretty much tells everything. \n\nFIREPEGS is a construction set for dynamical patterns, where parents can easily create challenges or download them. They can be very easy, or, even in this simple prototype, very hard to solve. \n \nI created RIREPEGS, trying to imitate the little girl, playing with her toy pegboard, because I spent hours, hours and hours watching her doing this.  \n \nIn the first chapter I explained how the prototype emerged from this experience. Just scroll up to the beginning, or [load the home page at firepegs.com](http://firepegs.com) (it'a a one-page site, no navigation yet).\n\nWhy such experience? What made me watch this child playing for hours, hours and hours? It's another story. I tried to make as short as possible. The site is [http://makethemmad.com](makethemmad.com). There is no scripts at all, and, again, nothing commercial. Easy reading only, and it's a one-pager too. The sites are currently undergoing beta-reading and proofreading.\n\nNow if you read makethemmad.com, and, maybe, [http://robopegs.com](robopegs.com) (it's very short), you probably understood that I was just trying to continue the game, which we were playing, when the little girl outgrew the pegboard.  \n\nThe toy, which I call FIREPEGS, may resemble many things from many arts: mechanical engineering, electronics, biology, mathematics (of course), to name but a few, and it's not quite like any them. In the core it's about what causes what, where and when. Time, space and causality are the defining relations in our world. A lot can be built on them. I discuss some possible expansions and extensions. Strangely, the most challenging use may be not learning, but art.\n\nFIREPEGS is not computer (I hope). It's a pre-computer technology. You know, they could built very elaborate automatons managed from pin cylinders. That's it. Using FIREPEGS to teach programming is another my project.\n\nThank you very much, and I hope I did not do anything wrong yet. I am quite new to Reddit. I just posted three customized version of this solicitation to three different subs, because, again, it does not quite fit anywhere.  \n"
3c3gwm,The Words of Creation,"This MMO is all about self immersion and free learning.\n\nThe prominent features:\n- Voice controlled magic\n- Randomly generated content that lasts in the game\n- Massive multiplayer\n- Skill-based and -driven system\n- No HUD\n- Permadeath\n\nThe Descriptions:\n\nSelf immersion\nBeing a Pen and Paper DM my goal always has been to achieve the best player immersion possible. Some mechanics i found to enhance this exponentially. Direct speech is a good example. To refer to the character as ""me"" or ""i"" instead of ""him"" and speak from his view to NPCs directly. \nBeing naturally interested in psychology i gradually learned how immersion works different for each person. To apply this knowledge to an MMO means to leave the choice of playstyle to the player and reward uniqueness of the characters. That's why this MMO will not contain classes and each character will start with a small set of random skills, leaving the rest to the player to explore and learn.\n\nFree learning\nThe skills are supposed to be learning by doing. To get a skill you either read a book on how to obtain the specific skill you want and follow the advice or you simply use try and error, for instance combining items to get a craft skill. After obtaining a skill you get experience in it using it more often. This should apply to every skill and attribute in game. A similarity to ""Wurm"" and ""Mortal Online"" exists here, where one gets better in a skill and the linked attributes whenever an action is performed. However the skills in ""Words of Creation"" are activated with specific actions performed, not solely with buying books.\n\nVoice controlled maqgic\nA rather straight forward and thus genious idea. Why not have people speak out the magic formulas to cast a spell? This feature on itself deepens the immersion manifold. To cast a spell you have to do the incantation needed, perfectly. This also solves the biggest problem in voice controlled applications: Differences in speech. You need to learn the right pronounciation, period. Small margins exist to help buffer against large speech differences between countries but other than that it has to be rather perfect pronounciation. This also makes the magic harsh to learn and balances magic against fighting with swords or bows. Naturally supernatural effect like magic trump swordplay or archery in most games. In the ""Word of Creation"" the magic is hard to master at first and then even harder to pronounce right if the situation gets stressful like in fight. \n\nRandomly generated content that lasts in game\nThis feature allows the game to feel like a vast endless and natural place. The game launches with one predefined area, with cities, NPCs and the like. When the first player hits the boundary of this area a generator randomly generates the new content from the landmasses and terrain features (such as coastlines, waterbodies and hills) down to the number of NPCs and their names in each city. The player who reached the boundary first gets to name the capital as a sort of achievement for players who like exploration pathways of MMOs. This player will also be known by NPCs in the capital as the first hero to have visited.\nI already wrote a very easily coded version of this generator which works with a high number of classes linked to each other. It also has the ability to change the chances of the same terrain type occuring at the next border. This means that if a player just runs a straight line it will be highly likely to find for example two deserts after each other but the third terrain will most likely be something else. The chances for the third desert were lowered to keep natural changes in habitats most probable.\n\nMassive Muiltiplayer\nOptimally the Game runs on 1 server with all players. To keep it more realistic the different regions built during the game could be transferred to different servers. This would mean a small loading time when changing the region which would justify a really large world. I am talking hundreds or more regions here. There will be players running in a straight line for a month or more, randomly generating content as they go.\n\nSkill-based and -driven system\nThere are no classes in ""Words of Creation"". Each Character starts with a handful of words from the ""Language of Creation"" which enable him to use magic. All other skills that the character could learn are obtained through try and error as well as training. More words of the magic language can be obtained as very rare drops (scrolls with single words on them in phonetics), rare drops (words without phonetics) and through direct through other players. The last point is supposed to evolve into a market of words where players spend ingame currency or barter for learning words with or without phonetics from other players or NPCs. Another way to learn new words is eavesdropping. As the magic is driven by voice recognition you could simply listen hard when someone is casting nearby to make out the phonetics and try casting the word yourself. This could be countered by the caster in speaking very low, which would make perfect pronounciation a lot harder or by two people casting at the same time. \nThere is a catch though which brings me to the last point.\n\nNo HUD\nThis means a lot for immersion and the way the game is played. You don't get direct information about the status of your character. No HP bar, no Mana bar although both exist in the background. How do you get it indirectly? \nIf your HP drops the colors will fade from your screen turning into black and white and eventually black when you die. This was already used in a way in DayZ (although you have a direct measurement there if not playing on hardcore mode). So basically the less HP you have the harder it is to differentiate stuff on your screen.\n\nWhat about Mana? \nLet's imagine Mana as a bodies innate energy, similar to Ki or other ideas of life energy. You basically take away life energy (not physical HP but more meta energy) if your Mana is used. To emphasize this the screen will shake as if you are experiencing a headache, being subtle at low mana usage and looking more like a seizure when the mana bar is almost empty.\nHow is Mana spent? Well, by casting, either directly (imagine a fireball or a mana shield) or indirectly (crafting a masterwork or magical item for instance). You don't know how much mana a spell or crafting process will cost without trying it first. Even then you will only see how it affects your screen (if the effect is not too minor). If you see someone casting a spell it doesn't necessarily mean that you are able to reproduce it because it might take more mana than you have. And here comes the catch. If your Mana is all spent the spell will not necessarily fail. The word is spoken, the spell needs energy so it will drain life force (HP) instead. Think about this example: There is a foreign character casting a spell in front of you, without any precautions because he didn't notice you. You get a good idea of what the spell does and how to pronounce it. So you try for yourself. Your Mana and HP are supposed to be full because neither got drained before that day. Yet still your screen starts shaking like crazy and the colors vanish leaving you with a nearly black screen. Obviously that guy was trained better in mana efficiency or had a bigger mana pool than you. \nThis has a few implications that again deepen the immersion by far. To learn a new word you could just start babbling nonsense into your microphone until something happens. The thing is though this could as well just kill you, draining all of your mana and HP in an instant because you were not trained enough. \n\nAh, before i forget your character dies, means it's dead. It will not revive on it's own. There mgiht be people or NPCs who are able to raise the fallen again, but i doubt it will be cheap since rather complex spells with high mana usage will be needed for this. \nThis will again strenghten the idea of bartering words like on a market or auction them, being endlessly less dangerous then just try and error with possibility of death.\n\nPermadeath\nJust very short explanation. You character dies means it dead (s.o.). All belongings are left at the corpse for anyone to loot. Yet, only you know the words you already learned. You could have an ingame copy in a book with the phonetics that is lottable from the corpse, but if you perdiodically wrote down the phonetics your character knew before he died you can just as easily come up with a new character and have the same words again. It might be that the mana pool of the new character is not big enough to cast all of them, though.\n\nFinal words\n\nThis is an idea i carry around for about 5 years now. I thought about it pretty much every other day and tried to refine every bit of it. That being said i would really like feedback on this and i can stand mean feedback either. I appreciate if you say it's shit, not realistic to program as well as positive feedback even if it only is a ""thumbs up"" or a like.\n\nSecond and last would be that i am not a native speaker. I hope my speeling and grammar mistakes will be no hinderance for an open dicussion about the idea i presented, although i apologize already for any errors i made. If there are any questions I would be more than happy to answer them!\n\nI'd like to see what you think.\n\n\n "
3c2jm5,Ghost Hunter,"I found a post about a ghost hunting idea from a year ago but mine was different in a lot of ways so I'm figuring I can repost it.\n\nGhost Hunter\nStyle: Co-op First Person\n\nLevel Designs: Randomly generated from 'historical castles' to homes being lived in. Building conditions go alongside what is generated and the haunting as well as its severity is also randomly generated. Stories and eyewitness events are randomly generated to give the player characters an idea of what they’re getting into.\n\nEnvironment: Fully interactable, cars randomly drive by depending on location, animals are spawned in alongside nests and other things to interact with the world. Dust and gusts of wind, faulting wiring and more can be a part of the experience and give false positives.\n\nMax players: 1 minimum to 8 max. Ghost Hunting Associations can be formed(aka Clans).\n\nThe premise is something that struck me while I was Ghost Adventures. A group of players join together to hunt ghosts by being locked down in a location from 8PM to 8AM(3 hours). Players can leave at anytime, especially if their characters are at risk of possession or the oppression becomes too much. Evidence ranges from EVP which can be one to five word phrases, orbs floating, audible disembodied voices to apparitions both shadow and normal. Demonic activity is also a possibility and being physically oppressed, attacked or even blacking out can occur. Different kinds of oppression and energy can be observed by all players via the player character’s body, from goosebumps as well minor screen distortions or overlays to represent demonic oppression or energies being represented in rooms. However, the player has to contend with the conditions of the building, the intrusion of animals and depending on location, outside noise like cars and trucks. The player’s job is to capture the best evidence they possibly can via recording it, publishing it on the internet where players watching can award points. VOIP automatically embeds into the recording created and everything is open to be edited. Players can also elect to not record or save the recording and instead just go from game to game for the fun of the hunt. The ultimate end goal is not to scare but instead create a sense of tension as instead of running from what historically we’ve been told to run away from, and instead of fighting via violence, the hunter’s job is to combat hauntings, especially demonic ones through evidence and exposure instead of violence or running. A multitude of roles exists for player characters ranging from those who take part in the lockdown by physically going inside the building to video and audio techs who watch the still cameras and listen to audio. For players, experience are not given via skills but instead learned from doing your own research of the inevitable guides that come out to actually going from location to location and investigating. The points are not meant to mean anything other than a group having a particular good flair, vibe, really good evidence and methodology or all of the above."

3bz1al,Multiplayer Dungeon Crawler,"So this is a game that popped up in my head recently. The way I had it work was:  \n*There are two teams. Each team member can pick one of the four typical classes of Warrior, Rogue, Archer/Ranger and Mage.  \n*The game will have two stages. The first stage consists of the teams raiding a dungeon seperate of each other and collecting gold, equipment, materials, items etc,. Under a time limit.  \n*When the timer runs out, the players will be teleported to a middle stage, where using a shop, players can buy items and sell them.  \n*Finally, when both teams are ready, it's a mad fight to the death. The victors get exp, higher ranks, some other currency, etc.,  \nThis idea is really thinned out from all the other little details but yeah, wanted to get it out there"
3bya70,Civilization + SimCity + Grand Theft Auto,"This is how I see it. There are three different ways to play. You could either be managing trade routes and defending/attacking other civilizations like Civs gameplay, be managing or building upon said city in the style of SimCity, or you could play as a citizen of a city that someone is building in GTA style.\n\nEveryone would be able to talk to each other, but only one person could be doing the civ style and one person doing the simcity style gameplay while everyone else was a citizen. The actions of citizens would affect the needs and other things for the simcity player and so on and so forth.\n\nOr you could just play single player and zoom in or out to change gameplay styles to try and manage it all yourself.\n\nHow the hell does this not exist yet?"

3buwhc,Time Travel MMO,"      A MMO game, where interaction with others is quiet possible, where one works with or against others to change/protect the past present and future, by going between the different times. \n\n      Most of the game would be on different servers at specific time line events and travelling in the past and changing it basically just puts you on a different server that has has a future with with different outcomes/events, therefore travelling into the future from that time line if changes have occurred will put you into the future version of that server. \n\n     The game size would be huge though, but with current computers having more and more space for memory it shouldn't be too hard especially if it is a MMO, which means it is all server side already, But that would be a pretty big server based game, big meaning a large number of servers. With a unique game like that however, the subscriptions would be that of wow in it's hayday.\n\n     Some parts could though take place off the server and in the users computer however, when a key moment in the past or present is taking place, you would be taking yourself out of the main server, or possibly have created a private game until said events have finished, while the game is calculating what new server/time line to put you on, depending on the events that transpire. The main server could be the starting server where past present and future is one already scripted server based off of historical real world events and the deviation, would be the side servers. We already have games with massive amounts of servers, like wow, with its hundred of servers, totally 226 US realms as of last year I believe, but that wouldn't or shouldn't be need unless the popularity gets very high.\n\n     This could also give huge amount of game updates for prolonged subscriptions for the gaming company too, making the game player driven as their changes of what they have done in the past will easily set the changes needed. and the server changing aspect of the game would take care of most of the changes they did. It would be interesting as well if the changes they made altered themselves too, for example scars, limbs background stories changing, even partial cybernetic future selves, colonies on others planets advance tech.\n\n     War, as bad as it is for relations and populations, alters history quite a bit and could be the main focus on huge changes, imagine a Europe where Napoleon decided to not try and invade Russia. Advances in technology leaps during War times, a time line where Vietnam or Korea became a third world war, with Iraq and Afghanistan becoming another 4th World War and would not have drained the U.S. budget alone,  and different tech being wider spread, a world where slavery was ended prior to the colonization of the colonies, there is already advance tech now, but not everyone has access to it, imagine a world, where a robot building, future space fairing Japan won world war 2, everyone speaks Japanese, cities each have their own giant robot defending it from mutated monsters from the fall out of nuclear and atomic war, along side the remaining humans being mutated heavily because of it, a crazy, but interesting concept. \n\n    Either way this is a working idea. Feel free to add/comment/ voice your opinion."
3bunrm,Unnamed FPS game.,"Hello, I like games a fair bit, as you might be able to tell from my being here in he first place. Lately I've been having ideas for a game that I would not be able to develop. \n(Unless I win the lottery or manage to get a job at a larger company and convince them to give my idea a go, neither of these things would ever probably happen, so I'm just going to leave my ideas here.)\n\nI would like to see a first person shooter game that has slight RPG elements. The game would have several modes, being a campaign, a co op survival mode, and the expected PvP gamemodes such as capture the flag or deathmatch. The thing that would make this game different would be the different weapons and abilities you get as you play.\n\nYou would start the game being able to create a character, being able to change various features of your character, give them scars or change their previous lifestyle/job and stuff like their age. When this is done, you will move onto the main menu from where you could play singleplayer or multiplayer, change settings (of course) or create another character. (You could use one character for each gamemode, or use the same one for all or something like that.)\n\nThe game will finally start with your character looking at their computer, a mobile device or a brochure, (Depending on choices made when creating your character.) This will prompt you with the ability to read the advertisements of about 4 different militaries, each giving mainly positive arguments as to why you should join them to fight against the other millitaries.\n\n Joining one will move you to a tutorial level (after a cutscene or two) Where you will learn how to use your 4 different starting weapons/abilities. These would be; \n\n- The ranged weapon (A Pistol) \n\n- The thrown ""weapon"" (A Frag grenade)\n\n- The melee weapon (A knife)\n\n- And the ability (Wind)\n\n(I know these weapons seem very average and overused, but as you play, you gain access to many new weapons such as laser miniguns and grenades that slow time.)\n\nThese different weapons types (ranged, thrown, melee and ability) can be leveled up by using weapons and abilities of the desired type. As you level up a weapon type, you gain access to new weapons/abilities along that line. \n\nAs you use specific weapons/abilities more, (using a revolver alot for example) then that particular weapon/ability will level up separately, causing your character to be more used to it, making it seem lighter or more accurate, being able to reload faster, hit harder, throw further ETC. (In the case of abilities, the strength and the range of it among other things.)\n\nAs you level up your abilities and weapons, you will be able to duel wield. (if you say, fully level up any weapon or ability, then you will be able to duel wield it with anything else that is duel weildable.) You would be able to duel wield different abilities such as lightning and water to create deviating attacks, or you could pull out a weapon such as a shotgun, and upgrade it with an ability and give it slowing rounds, healing rounds, blinding rounds, the list goes on.\n\nThere will also be fields around maps that you can hack, and then use an ability on to effect the field around it for a team of your choosing. (You could make it speed up your teammates but slow your enemies.)\n\nYou will be able to paint and import images onto your weapons and armor, if you get stabbed, then the scar might stay after respawning, and you could choose to have that be a permanent cosmetic part of you character, or get it healed for a bit of ingame currency.\n\nThere will be no microtransactions and all currency would be earned from doing certain missions in the singleplayer, or doing well in the multiplayer. Your skill level in game will be determined  by things such as deaths, kills, captures etc. and the matchmaking can be set by the player to put them in a game of similar skill.\n\nI can't think of much else in the game other then abilities having other uses, such as wind pushing yourself into the air, ice freezing water, lightning being used to provide electricity to some devices, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, i know I will never be able to make this game, but maybe someone with more money and experience then me would be able to pick it up."

3bufoh,THE RPG Game,"Seeing as how I don't have the time, money, knowledge etc. as actual developers do in the present, I just want to compile all the best aspects of RPGs noted by the community to try to envision the **Perfect RPG** that really makes you feel apart of the game. \n\nSo this post is to ask- **What are your favorite parts of RPGs and what are some ideas you'd love to see in one?**\n\nIf I were to make this Perfect RPG game, the number one thing I'd want to make sure is that I listen to the community. I would want to play a game that I have input in, and that's just what an RPG should be. You choose your role, you shape your legend. No ideas are dumb or even ridiculous, that's why this is a dream. I want to make it so in this game *anything is possible.*\n\nTo give an example: **I would like to see a game where you don't level, and where skills and abilites are simply skilled by using them in repitition. You become a master at your craft and later develop other skills you can incorporate into your stlye.

3br0mh,A cross between DayZ survival and Condemned 2 multiplayer:,"For those unfamiliar with each here's a brief description of each:\n\nDayZ: Open world survival game.  You start with nothing need to find food / water, weapons to defend yourself from the zombie AI, and more importantly other players who want your stuff.\n\nCondemned 2: A versus match between a SWAT team armed with firearms and masked psychos with melee weapons.\n\nThe way I envision it is each server has a player limit for both survivors and psychos, and you can join as either until one side fills up.  Survivors need to scavenge for food / water and weapons as per DayZ.  Psychos must do the same but with a catch: they can only use melee weapons and can only eat the survivors they kill.\n\nThe gameplay would encourage psychos to work together in order to hunt down survivors, but survivors would have to decide whether they want to work together for safety or fight over scarce resources.\n\nThis would be in the survival-horror genre, and as such need a lot of emphasis on low-light environments, permanent darkness, and the survivors making tactical decisions about when to use light sources.\n  \nThat's the base idea, and I'd like to hear thoughts about this idea."

35vo60,Monarchy Simulator - What Sims Medieval Should Have Been,"#Name\n\nThe Kingdom\n\n#Concept Overview\n\nA game that puts you at the very center of an age-old feudal medieval land. You play the leader of a house and attempt to rule the entire nation by the end of the forty-year period. You do this through espionage, battle, diplomacy, immigration etc.\n\n#Plot\n\nYou are Lord X of House Carron (Where X = A player chosen first name). House Carron rules over a small portion of the nation of Geralda, called 'The Horselands'. The people of the Horselands are renowned for, you guessed it, horses. Located in the south of Geralda, The Horselands are filled with rolling hills and grassy plains. Geralda as a nation is in turmoil. The more northern Kingdoms are constantly at war, and the plague of the west is claiming more and more lives every day. The east was lost to bandits only the last year. Now remains nine Kingdoms. The Horselands, Kerran, Snow Peaks, Redrock, Moon Lake, The Northern Eyes, The Greylands, Blunt and Darkstone Basin.\n\nThe night of your coronation, you are visited by a spectre. She explains to you that in forty years time, a great evil will be upon Geralda, and only you are capable of stopping it. She says you must do whatever it takes to unite the nation, cure the plague and banish the bandit coast. Or else Geralda will suffer a fate worse than death. She brands your hand with a mark, so that you may show the people of your divine blessing.\n\nThis is where our game begins, over forty years you must do everything in your power to prevent the evil force from taking over Geralda.\n\n#Setting\n\nGeralda is akin to medieval Britain in both it's culture and technology. The neighbouring country of Erredos lends no hand in your task, and is shrouded in mystery. It is said magic originated in Erredos.\n\nThe Horselands are your home, and the Carron family is loved here.\n\nKerran is a dark, dirty place, filled with thieves and scoundrels. Most of it's citizens live in poverty, but it is rumoured there is a great espionage guild deep underground. Kerran is ruled by the Denton Family.\n\nSnow Peaks is a mountainous region, inhabited by the Dwellers. People of low intelligence, but great strength. It is littered with expensive mines. Snow Peaks is ruled by the Kanlac Family.\n\nRedrock is another plains Kingdom, but is renowned for it's builders and architects. They use the red stone of the land in most of their building and contraptions, and it keeps them sturdy and strong. Redrock is ruled by the Joyce Family.\n\nMoon Lake is a tranquil land. Peaceful people inhabit it, all very skilled in green magic. That is healing, soothing, aide and mysticism. Moon Lake is ruled by the Orryn Family.\n\nThe Northern Eyes are mountains to the very north of Geralda. Myth says they used to guard the land from dragons who would fly south from the mythical island of Draconia. Here we have great warriors, and even better weapons. The Northern Eyes are ruled by the Stonegut Family.\n\nThe Greylands are marshes to the west. The plague has only just begun here. The Greylands are home to great scholars and historians. The Greylands are loved by all citizens of Geralda. They are ruled by the Ford Family.\n\nBlunt is a rocky region to the west. Next to the bandit coast. It is famous for it's great alchemist guild. It is ruled by the Wenders Family.\n\nAnd lastly we have Darkstone Basin. The land of Red Magic. That is, magic that can be used in combat. Darkstone Basin is ruled by the Thorne Family.\n\n#Characters/Abilities\n\nThe major characters are your advisors. You have a small council, each member has a particular job. By choosing which members of your kingdom fill each job, you open up different options.\n\nYou begin with four advisors; \n\nPosition | Name | Morality | Intelligence | Loyalty\n:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|\nCoinmaster | Eric Endbridge of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\nSwordmaster | Daniel Tootwit of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\nPeoplemaster | Simon Layne of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\nSpymaster | Jonas Redhill of Carron | Neutral | Mid | Very High\n\nOnly by conquering the other Kingdoms can you unlock more council members\n\n#Gameplay Mechanics\n\nThrough meetings with your advisory council, you must attempt to take over the other Kingdoms of Geralda. You can purchase spies and armies. You can bribe officials or wed lordlings to ladylings. Basically, think of it like you are a house leader from Game of Thrones.\n\nYou can either fight wars, spy on people, or forge alliances.\n\nYou could even contract bards to write songs about you to boost your popularity.\n\nThe difficulty is each Kingdom is different, and it will take a different approach to claim each. In order to win the game, you must occupy every kingdom as they each hold an important piece to your success. It would also help if you managed to cure the Western plague and thwart the Eastern bandits, but that isn't necessary. It will just improve your chances of winning\n\nYou also have the option to Knight people for doing particularly good work. This involves buying them better armour, a better house and gifting them a sum of money. This boosts morale and loyalty for wherever they hail from.\n\n#Standout Features\n\nAn intense, life-like relations and loyalty system. Your spies could be caught or snitch on you if they don't have enough skill or loyalty. \n\nThere could be revolutions in small towns if you do not feed them or neglect their needs. It will be a lot to handle, but thats the fun of it.\n\nRandom events could happen too, like the Red Wedding, if your loyalty ratings are low enough.\n\n#Possible Platforms\n\nI imagine only PC, although it might work on Phones too. I imagine a Console port would be possible, but unnecessary."

35um5e,Mist of War: Real-Time Tactics and First-Person Shooter combined,"**Concept Overview:**  \n\n\n* The game would seem like a blend of a real-time tactics game like World in Conflict or Wargame and a first-person shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield (but leaning a bit on the first one.  \n* This basically a one-man army (or more) vs. an army itself.  \n* The game would most likely in the multiplayer only because of how the gameplay works.  \n\n**Gameplay:**  \n\n\n* There would be at least 2 players: 1 director and 1 soldier/shooter/first-person.  \n* The director would command an army and therefore have a tactical view of the battlemap i.e. bird's eye view.  \n* The first-person player would be a one-man army, capable of accurate one-shot kills, regeneration... like a Call of Duty protagonist.  \n* The director would have reinforcement points at his disposal (World in Conflict style) with which he/she can use to buy units.\n* The director would only have a finite number of reinforcement points and units. Once a unit is destroyed, no reinforcement points will be gained back (i.e. Deathmatch)  \n* The director could also be assigned just certain units, with which he/she must make do with.  \n* The director would have his physical manifestation on map. i.e. ""General"" unit. The first-persons can kill the general (director) as a means to win or as either main or side objective.  \n* Due to the first-persons being super-powered in a sense, the director has the ability to call in tactical aid. i.e. drone strikes, fog-of-war remover, special forces units, artillery strikes, napalm etc.  \n* The director may also have access to area-denial weapons such as mines (in limited amount) to impede the progress of first-persons.\n* Fog-of-war is present for the director in the tactical map view but not for the first-persons, who have a greater line-of-sight until impeded by weather effects.  \n* Despite the line-of-sight limitations on the director's units, they can still ambush first-persons by being ordered to hold fire.  \n* The first-persons must accomplish their objectives, which may or may not have a time-limit, in order to win.  \n* The first-persons may call in tactical aid of their own which could be quite different from the director (like having a Spectre gunship on call).  \n* The first-persons may commandeer enemy or uncrewed vehicles which have their own weapons but will not share the near-invulberability of the first-persons.  \n* First-persons may still die being run over.\n* Stealth to first-persons are key.  \n\n**Units**  \n\n\n* The director may have access to different specialized units depending on the roles he/she would pick: Armor, Infantry, Air. Although generalized units will still be available in all roles.  \n* Infantry units will be grouped into squads of five. There will be no specialized anti-air or anti-tank soldier in the squad but rather all will carry assault rifles or machine guns with anti-air/tank weapons strapped on at least two soldiers' backs as secondary.  \n* Infantry units have the special ability to track down first-persons to a general location before the ability expires and has to recharge.  \n* Specialized infantry include: Snipers (1 sniper, 1 spotter; sp.a-infrared spotting), Engineers (3 in a squad; sp.a-plants bombs and mines), Juggernaut (costly, 3 in a squad: sp.a-extra armor: more armor, less speed, single-use).  \n* An air unit consists of a single helicopter. The only generalized unit would be an armed Transport. It could transport 2 infantry units at a time and provide limited fire support.  \n* Specialized air units are rather costly. One is the Attack helicopter which has missiles and a gatling-style gun and is heavily armored, able to take multiple missile hits, it has no sp.a besides flares.  \n* The second is the (also costly) Recon helo (sp.a infrared scan: spots hidden first-persons behind cover). Fast but vulnerable it is armed only with a machine gun.  \n* All air units are armed with flares that repel missiles but not rockets like RPGs.  \n* An armor unit consists of a single armored vehicle. The generalized armor unit is the Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) which carries a machine gun and can carry one unit of infantry. (sp.a-grenade launcher).  \n* Specialized armor vehicles like air units. It includes the Infantry Fighting Vehicle armed with a 25mm chain gun and can carry one infantry unit. (sp.a-armor piercing rounds).   \n* The second specialized armor vehicle is the tank. It carries a 120mm gun and has heavy armor and machine gun for point defense. (sp.a-anti-personnel munitions: gun becomes giant shotgun).  \n* All armor units also have the special ability to launch smoke grenades to create a smokescreen. Although they can be revealed by the first-person's infrared sights.  \n* Also armored units are vulnerable at the back and the top, an artillery strike is a sure-kill.  \n* Other generalized vehicles are present which have no sp.a's but fast. The truck carries 2 infantry units but is soft-skinned and has no armament. The Humvee is lightly armored has a machine gun and carries 1 infantry unit.  \n\n**First-Person**  \n\n\n* The first-person would also be able to assign traits to itself via point system (Durability, Speed, Accuracy, Stealth signature etc.)  \n* The first persons may stick together as a team although it increases the risk of being detected due to the number of people.  \n* The first person may disguise as a civvie. (Yes, there must be civvies).  \n* There would be no formal alliance between the first-persons, only a set of objectives which may include killing one or more first-persons.  \n* First-persons may not call in some tactical aid if the director has preventative tactical aids in effect (Air supremacy, secure flanks etc.).  \n\n**Factions**  \nAlthough I have some in my mind, I couldn't find a way of how to fit them in the game or how they would affect it significantly.  \n\n**Setting**  \nEscaped super-soldier clones? The director is assigned to stop them? I dunno yet.  "
35tc5a,Recollection Waltshire Mansion - Enemies and Items,"This is a list of enemies and items you find in this [game](http://redd.it/34zywo) we are making. \n&gt; There was once a mansion full of residence of two wealthy families. However, a madman was on the loose and killed all the residents to experiment on. Now the Ghost have claimed the mansion in pursuit of revenge. \nBut you are a person who woke up in the mansion, with no memory of yourself. You must escape the house before the ghost, or anyone else, gets you!\n\n**Enemies**\nThere are no instant kills, but in close range they occasionally beat you with what they have. \n\n\n**Wailing Ghost**\n&gt; A Ghost that you meet in the first hallway. She wears a white gown with a white cloth tied from the top of her head, to around her neck. Her face is white and hollowed eyes, her mouth stretches when she wails at you. She wields a feather duster and is seen cleaning the house from time to time, but she also hits you with it. She is terrifying, but what is more terrifying is that she can move furniture to block hallways and corridors, forcing you to take alternative exits. She however dislikes light.\n\n**The Glowing Skeleton**\n&gt; A Ghost in the physical form of a glowing skeleton with a cloth tied around her eyes. She haunts the darkest places of the mansion. She is very slow, but she grapples you and bites you when given the chance. She was once a maid to the household but she was finding something very valuable to her. She stays away from fire.\n\n**The Mother**\n&gt; A Ghost that guards the entrance to the back garden. She comprise of a head with long strains of hair with two hands. Her two only daughters were killed by the hands of a terrible murderer and she vows revenge on the man who did this.\n\n**Knight of Midnight**\n&gt; This ghost has no form. Instead he takes suits of armor aroudn the mansion and use them to attack the protagonist. He is slow, but does the most damage apart from the other ghost. He was once a noble person who was cheated in a chivalry match. \n\n**Allison**\n&gt; A ghost that haunts the locked cellars under the mansion. She is trapped in the room full of corpses and she wails for a way to escape this demise. Her ghostly ribbons pops on the corpses she posses and every time the body dies, she would be forced into another because she cannot control it. Poor girl. All she wants was to escape this cellar. And she would do just about anything to achieve that!\n\n**The Ghost of Rock**\n&gt; This ghost is invisible to the eye. But when seen, he is a tall stretched bent-over figure, with big great arms holding a guitar. He has long hair and grim white makeup , but with no legs he instead floats. He haunts the ballroom and the theater. You can hear him playing his solo rock piece. When he is about to strike the player with his guitar, he loses his flying and appears as visible when he is close to the player. He does not like cameras or things thrown at him.\n\n**Sir Thomas**\n&gt; A ghost who was once the owner of the mansion, he is invisible, but can be seen through mirror, but rarely appearing. Unlike the other ghost he retains his human form, wearing a general suit and standing up. He appears before the character and then disappear when he's out of vision.\n\n**The Banshee in the Attic**\n&gt; This invisible ghost is dress as a blue woman, with an old gown, and blacken glowing eyes. She was once the mistress of the mansion. She haunts the bedrooms and is seen occasionally walking down the hallways. Beware player! If you get too close he will wail at you and your screen goes inverted. If she hits you three times you will lose instantly. She however does not like mechanical devices.\n\n**Wesley**\n&gt; Wesley is a woodne doll who waits in his room, waiting for the child who had once played with him. But the child didn't came. Then, one night a figure was in his room walking pass him. Who could this be? Could this be the man responsible for the murders? What did he do to my precious Timothy. Wesley can attack the player by strangling him, but he keeps very still in light, or if the player is looking at him.\n\n**Pitt**\n&gt; Nothing much si known about Pitt. Pitt is a burnt corpse that is equipped with a baton and beats the player. He walks, he can climb over obstacles. Pitt can easily lose sight for you but he makes up with his beatings.\n\n**Pocong**\n&gt; A corpse wrapped up in a huge cloth like a bag. They dwell outside in the rain. They came from the next door graveyard but all they can do is hop about. Even if they see the player all they can do is hop around you, and headbutt you. But that's it. They don't do much, just take up space and be constantly annoying more than scary. But they do make up for their large numbers. \n\n**The Girl**\n&gt; There's this strange ghost who takes in the form of a beautiful girl, a student more like in her school uniform, but wears glass high-heels. No one knows what she is really up to, she's very shy and disappears at close range. Not in the occasion when she topples  furniture over making a racket that turns ghost attention away. Or the time where she left some Medikits and batteries in from of the player. Or when she turn on the lights and blinds a ghost that's too close. What is she up too?\n&gt; Her initials has S.K.\n\n**The Gravedigger**\n&gt; Once the keeper of the graveyard next door, this ghost wears a wears armor with a raincoat, and has a green glowing lantern. He haunts outside the mansion. Upon sight, the Gravedigger would float right at him and whack him with a shovel. If not he would teleport away and throws its chain at the player to trip him over. This condition is harmless, but with bouncing pocong no its not. Despite his lantern he is not a fan of lights though. That's why it keeps itself in the rain.\n\n**The Fear Hunter**\n&gt; A hideous creature that is long, stretched with long claws and a long tail. (almost like from Alien Isolation) It is huge. This terrible creature use the vents to go about the mansion, and use the ceiling as its advantage point. It attacks everything and anything it sees, ghost, zombies, creatures. It uses its outstretch mouth to rip apart its prey, even ghost can't stand in its way. But except one ghost that is. Besides every ghost it meets and shred, there is this one tiny ghost that this Fear Hunter wasn't willing to meet or see. Rather cower in fear and run away from her. Can you guess who? This ghost is very harmless to the player too.\n\n**EYE**\n&gt; Neither machine, nor logic this phenomenal being is a supernatural AI. Its almost robotic, and yet it is granted the power to give life or restore. The EYE current resides in a rubric stone with an eye carved into it. It was held in a museum exhibit, mistaken for an artifact. The EYE in its wrath summoned out Guardians to strike down all witnesses and hoped it was protected from human kind. But no, instead, a mad man took it and used it in its experiments, . The EYE was enraged at this man for killing people and performing rituals to resurrect them.But it was cunning. Instead, why not? Let's give the man some success instead. Why not ghost? Or Zombies? Or give the toy in the playroom the ability to walk? Or perhaps, actually... even better, why not? Yes. Lets use his son against him! There. That should be fun.\n\n**Guardian**\n&gt; Let's get this over with. Strong. Tough. Can search through hidden spots. Bash doors and obstacles down .Destroys all other enemies. Slow. Yes, literally golems that is invincible, so keep out of their sight. However they are easily distracted.\n\n**Items**\nYou will find these things everywhere. Some will work, other times not so really. Use them wisely, you get a limited amount of them throughout the mansion.\n\n**Glow stick**\n&gt; Common, but ineffective to majority of enemies. Can be throw afar but has a small radius of light. Very distracting\n\n**Flare**\n&gt; Also Common, can be throw, but also burn objects. Don't burn the house down, its not a good idea.\n\n**Flashlight**\n&gt; Your hand tool for search items in the dark, and can also stun most enemies with its bright light. However it uses up batteries, and it will rust in the rain\n\n**Camera**\n&gt;There are many types of Cameras. Mobile, video, whatever, found all over the Mansion, but the best this is that they can see Invisible ghost. Use them well to find any pesky ghost not visible to the naked eye. Then flash them!\n\n**Crowbar**\n&gt; Sometimes its not a ghost, sometimes its a zombie or a pocong blocking the doorway. Smart you would say, he smiles. Then you draw your Crowbar. He frowns and says Awwww~\n\n**Jim's Lantern**\n&gt; The lantern is the most powerful weapon in this game. Every ghost will melt within its sight, its like your Ghost repel. How do you get it though? It gives out a green ambient, that's what I know.\n\n**Gun**\n&gt; A useful weapon against most creatures in the game. However it is only obtainable from a real living person. Can you guess who?\n\n**Talking Glove**\n&gt; A sonic device glove that uses sonar to detect objects and voice to tell the User what's ahead of him. Very neat, can tell you if you are at stairs, or if there's a hidden item, or if there's a ghost behind you. This is literary your mini-map, but its a late-game item though\n\nWell, that pretty much what we have so far. But if you think you can be better than us, try this [link](http://redd.it/358ozg) here. We have a competition waiting for willing users. :P"
35siyr,Recollection: Museum Raid,"**Animation**\n\nYou are a guard who was recently hired to night watch for the town's museum. The museum is holding an exhibition for Artifacts coming from Africa. As a guard you are over watching the boxes carrying the many items for the exhibition being carried form large trucks and into the museum storage. As you walk about you found a box that is labeled 'from Australia'. Inside there was a weird a small obelisk stone with an eye carved in it. \n\nIt seems odd, Australia didn't had such art before. Before you did something the workers took the box away and you couldn't find it.\n\nThe next day on your shift, the workers have already set up the main exhibition. The weird EYE stone is held as its main exhibition, a 'totem from Africa'. You were in the guards house for the nightshirt as the workers were at work. Suddenly, there was a crash, and screaming occurred form the cameras and radio.\nYou as the guard has to do something, you don't have your gun or your baton, they are left in the locker room. It is here that you as the player began the game.\n\n**Game Objectives**\n\n* Explore the Museum to find out what's going on\n\n* You find dead museum staff, guards and workers alike. Their bodies have being decapitated by some brute force\n\n* You have to find a way out of the museum, but you found the doors have being barricaded\n\n* You found terrible statues coming to life and had being killing the staff, also they seem to be trying to protect the Artifact\n\nSomewhere during the story, you run into a [man](http://redd.it/358qh3) who manages to steal the Artifact and was determined to get out of here. You agree to help each other out. The Artifact was worth too much trouble.\nHe explains that the Artifact was responsible for bringing to the dead back to life, as well as turning these statues in its 'Guardians'. He also stated that he has come from a [Mansion](http://redd.it/34zywo) not far from here. \n\n**Gameplay**\n\n* There are several items in the game. GUN, BATON, FIRE HYDRANT, FLARE and FLASH LIGHT\n\n* The area is very dark, there will be options to have light sources in the game\n\n**Enemies include**\n\n* Armour Stands: extremly weak, easy to push over\n\n* Mannequins: Tough, but a BATON and GUN is like hot knife through butter. \n\n* Stone Statues: Very tough, resistent. A folk lift or GRAVITY like stairs to push it down\n\n* Sentry: Levitating turrets that fires pins at you.\n\n* Ancient: Well you're screwed\n\n&gt; Your objective is to get out of the Museum and avoid as much of these Guardians as possible.\n"

35rq8d,Road to Olympia - A bodybuilding sim/RPG,"**Name:** Road to Olympia\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A sim/RPG centered around the rise of a professional bodybuilder.\n\n* Remember in [Fight Night Round 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q--8vbOVtZs) where you could train your boxer and depending on how you trained, you could see a visible change in his physique? That's the same feature I want for this game.\n\n* If you train shoulders, I want the shoulders to grow. If you train biceps and forearms, I want to see the most change in those areas. If your bodybuilder enters a strict cutting diet, I want to see more definition appear on his or her body. *The body changes according to the choices you make and how you invest your limited time and resources.*\n\n* Either 2D or 3D art could be used here to represent the bodybuilder's changing physique. 2D would likely be a lot easier and faster.\n\n* There would be 3 distinctive game ""modes"": *Nutrition, Training, and Competition*. Each game mode would be composed of mini-games, like quick-time-events. In the **Nutrition** mode, you would need to play the mini-game in order to only eat the best ""clean foods"" and stay away from snacking on junk. In the **Training** mode, your character would do the workout program you've laid out for him or her. Quick-time-events could be used to achieve the best form and time under tension for optimal muscle growth. In the **Competition** mode, you could do quick-time-events to strike perfect poses and defeat your opponents.\n\n* Where you start off depends on the difficulty you choose. Easy would start you at 15% to 20% body fat and maybe the age of 18, whereas harder difficulties would pack on body fat and increase your age.\n\n* In the beginning, you have to get a part-time job to afford your new lifestyle. When you've won a few amateur competitions, you'll score an opportunity to get sponsorship and turn bodybuilding into a lucrative career. After years of perfecting your body, you could eventually make it to Mr or Ms Olympia and take home the gold.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nPC, iOS, Android?\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nLike other ideas I've had, I'd love to be a part of it. If that isn't possible, then I would work something out via PM or email."

The basics are thought out, but I would like to know your view on this.\nThe idea is that you dig down deep into the earth, and find raw materials, craft/polish/whatever them with machines you bould with some materials you found and research you've done and eventually earn as much money you can.

I just thought it was amusing to imagine a KungFu pi symbol fighting."
35njmn,Space Pirate Sandbox,"I grew up watching Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop on Toonami and wondering why there wasn't a game that allowed me to be a spacefaring pirate. I'm sure there are games out there that include one or two of the elements that would combine to make the perfect space piracy game but I don't know of a single one that does it on the scale I'm imagining.\n\nHaving recently started playing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag I couldn't help but think how the piracy mechanics could be transplanted into a futuristic science-fiction setting. As a swashbuckling space pirate you would be responsible for the maintenance of your ship and crew, both of which would be completely customisable. You could purchase upgrades for your ship as well as hiring crew members.\n\nOnce you've got your ship and crew set-up you could start undertaking various missions ranging from simple courier assignments to assassins. Of course what would pirate game would be complete without a good deal of piracy? You'd be free to attack and plunder other ships in outer space, stealing their cargo and selling it for profit. There is also a part of me that would like to see an in-depth commodity market where you could buy goods from one planet and fly them to another to sell for a profit. Though that may be a bit too nerdy for some people!\n\nThe whole things hinge on a large sandbox environment and fluid transitions. I'd love to be able to launch my ship and reach outer space without any loading screens and then fly to the next planet and make planetfall without having to wait for the planet to load. \n\nAlso, the ability to get out of your ship and explore the various planets in third-person would be the icing on the cake. Imagine walking around a futuristic city only to be recognised by a member of the police as a wanted pirate, you run and they follow you. After a daring escape involving plenty of free-running you end up back up at your ship. You get inside, power up the engines and launch into the sky off of the planet and onto the next planet until the heat dies down and you can return.\n\nThat's my idea, anyway. It's been a dream of mine for several years now. I hope one day we can see a game like it, I know I would never put it down if it was made!"

35kdea,Sphere Assault (combat game with new style of movement),"PLOT SYNOPSIS:\nIn the year 2135, a dystopian corporate-owned, resource-hungry world breaks into conflict. Corporations send in paramilitaries as governments seek to maintain law and order in disputed regions, newly independent states seek to establish themselves in the chaos, and radical ideologies seek handholds across the globe. Across all of these fronts, the weapon of choice is the versatile spherical Omnidirectional Multi-purpose Combat Drone. Lightly armoured, armed with a variety of anti-infantry, anti-armour, and anti-air weaponry, being much more maneuverable and cheaper to manufacture than traditional tanks, and much better armoured and easier to maintain than hardsuits, the OMCOD system becomes the new standard for forces all across the globe. The player belongs to one of several global factions seeking to expand their influence.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player controls an omnidirectional armoured drone. The control scheme combines the movement abilities of a human in any first-person shooter (i.e., forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right, turn left, turn right, look up or down) with the abilities of cars, tanks, and other conventional land vehicles (e.g., accelerate, ram into obstacles or other tanks, fly off of the edges of ramps and go airborne, use slopes to build up speed, drift). So basically, it combines the control and maneuverability of the typical ""first-person shooter"" with the speed, armor, and ramp-jumping abilities of the ""third-person driver/racer"" (you can think of it as driving and running at the same time in GTA). This combination is likely to yield a combination of tactics from both normal and vehicular combat.\n\nWHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE:\nBeing able to move sideways out of cover to zigzag towards a hostile while firing before rushing past them up a ramp in order to clear a chasm, capture the enemy flag, and immediately reverse into the garage of a nearby building, smash through the back wall,  and duck into a metro station, is something that I haven't seen yet (if there is something like this, please let me know!)"
35f8l8,Horror puzzle adventure game (where you can accidentally cause monsters),"So iv'e been sitting on this one for a while after my last game idea ( and by a while I mean just a week or so) but I think it might be a bit better than my last one so here it goes.\n\n**EXAMPLE STORY**\n\nYou are an expert thief with years of expertise in stealing from even the most secure of places,there's no place you can't get in and out of and no item you couldn't obtain. One day, you are tasked by an unknown client to steal a valuable artifact known simply as the Dodecahedron from the estate of a sir William Maze, a well known explorer. The task seems simple, but once you enter his elaborate mansion, you find yourself trapped by forces beyond your comprehension. Now you must solve your way through the maze estate and survive while also retrieving the artifact your seek. Though as you traverse the labyrinthine place you feel as though you and William's family aren't the only ones here.\n\n**GAMEPLAY**\n\nHere's where things get interesting, you see, as you can actually make it through the ENTIRE game without a single monster encounter, because the way monsters spawn in is determined by how well you make it through the mansion and solve the puzzles therein (save for time based monsters which spawn entirely at random).\nMonsters can spawn in the mansion based on time spent in certian places,choosing wrong options,failing puzzles, and even just not locking someone's door (the Maze family as an example). You will know when it happens as a cutscene showing the monster's ""activation"" in a certain area (btw games where they show you that a monster appeared somewhere but you don't know where it is excactly tends to freak me out).The monsters that spawn will never spawn in the same place twice, meaning that a monster that you activate could spawn in the room your in.\nThe player has a three heart healthbar that you can check anytime with an item you have when you arrive at the estate. Different monsters will take one to three hearts (usually late game monsters) with the death cutscene being determined by which monster lands the deathblow.\n\n**MONSTER TRIGGERS (only examples)**\n\n*Time (monsters that spawn during certain lengths of time have a chance to not spawn at all).\n\n*Not placing certain objects back after certain lengths of time (example:The maid monster spawns when objects that are used are not put back where you found them after one in-game hour).\n\n*Unlocked doors while certain monsters are active (example:Lisa Maze, the daughter, wakes up her mother Rose, thus causing her to spawn and also chase you).\n\n*Picking wrong choices (example:The mirror ghost spawns by choosing to uncover the wrong mirror).\n\n*Failing puzzles- (example:the Mechanical Spider spawns after failing a clock puzzle).\n\n*Running out of game time-The entire game runs as you've probably guess on a clock that starts as soon as you enter the estate,when you reached what is essentially morning (you spend an entire night there) the game goes into you-dun-goofed time where any and all (including late game monsters such as William himself) will spawn.\n\nWhew! welp that's all of it, I hope someone can do this idea some justice one day because i know I can't. If you see any holes in this idea or seen any games that already implement this idea let me know in the comments please! ~~Also let me know if you see any spelling, grammatical, all around bad typing errors pleasethanks.~~"

You then control how much time you spend on multiple factors by using sliders in the development process. Your finished product gets rated and then released for sale.\n* Your skill level rises the more you research and write. The lower your skill, the worse the quality of your first drafts will be. Higher skilled writers dedicate less time to rewriting and editing in general.\n* You can use various form of marketing to increase the Hype for your novel/script/etc. Including social media, traditional advertising and viral marketing techniques.\n* You can hire professional artists to supply you with a gorgeous book cover design. You can also hire professional editors to edit your work so you can release it to the publishers faster. Of course, professionals cost money.\n* You have the opportunity to create a trilogy or a series for any finished standalone novel you've made.\n* Negotiate movie deals with upstart indies and seasoned Hollywood directors. Negotiate merchandise deals with producers of toys, clothing, games and more.\n* Compete with other writers for the coveted yearly awards. Gain prestige in your craft with each award you win.\n* I have no clear-cut win scenario in mind, as of yet. The lose scenario triggers when you run out of money and go below -$50k. Before you're able to make a living off your writing, you'll need to work at a crappy part-time job just to pay the rent.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou are a fresh college grad, thrust into the open world and expected to swim. Your #1 goal in life is to be a bestselling author, but you've got to work your way up from the bottom.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nThe game begins in the year 2015, or whatever year the game is actually developed. You are a fresh college grad, living in a rundown apartment in the big city. Roaches. Lots of roaches. You eventually work your way up to better apartments, then a house, then better houses, and then a mansion if you hit it big.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* The protagonist, an aspiring author. ~22 years old, male or female, various skin tones, hair styles and clothing options available at character creation.\n* Various NPCs to represent agents, publishers, directors, and other creative and administrative types.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The entire game is handled with the mouse, except for a keyboard where you name your character, company, and products.\n* Point and click interface works very well for PC and mobile.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Great replay value, due to all of the different ways you can rise to the top. You could dedicate one playthrough to being a famous children's author. Another playthrough could see you becoming a world-renown playwright for Broadway. One playthrough may have you finding success with self publishing on Amazon, while another has you scoring an agent and a deal with a big traditional publisher like Random House.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC, iOS, Android?\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nI'd love to be a part in the development of this type of game. I am a mediocre programmer, at the best of times, but I'm a decent digital artist and writer. "
358qh3,The Story of Christopher McAllister,"There was this Mansion where two Wealthy families live. There is Christopher McAllister, and his lovely wife Ellisa McAllister, whom both had a son named Timothy. Living in the mansion also was Ellisa's father Thomas [Waltshire](http://redd.it/358mu1), who was old and rides a wheelchair, and their servants and maids.\n\nChristopher, Ellisa and Timothy have just returned from a trip to Africa. Christopher had been spending time with different tribes, continuing his fascination with the culture, especially the idea of Witch Doctors and magic etc. \nMeanwhile Timothy has contracted some kind of disease during these travels and become very sick. They went to see the hospital, the medicine they provide worked for Timothy for a while. However, they did not “finished the prescription medicine”, so the disease evolved.\n\n\nThen Christopher remembered a Witch Doctor remedy and tried to use it. Instead however, the boy gets sicker from the remedy. Poor Timothy dies, leaving the McAllisters distraught. However Christopher recalls the tribesman ideas for resurrection, and decides that there must be a way to make it happen. He combines his medicine and the tribal practices, hoping to find a way to do it.\n\n\nBut what he does afterwards was terrible.\nIn order to utilize these terrible ideas properly Christopher needed to have some bodies to experimented them on. Realizing the high probability of failure, Christopher decides he needs to do tests first... he starts to lure guests into the mansion only to murder them, poor people off the street, his maids, his butlers, even some of the bodies from the graveyard he decided to experiment on. Even the dead bodies from the next door Graveyard. \n\n\n\nChristopher tried to use rituals, spells and other insane Witch doctor madness, but none of them seem to work. \nInstead he tried to used a stone to attempt resurrecting bodies, but he has managed to resurrect ghosts. \n\n\n\nEllisa and Thomas start to see that Christopher is going nuts. Ellisa is quiet and writes it into her journal, but Thomas confronts Christopher. Tells him that he's losing his mind, he needs to get it together for his wife, all that stuff. The conversation escalates and Thomas blames Christopher for Timothy's death. Christopher breaks and screams at Thomas. And afterwards, it was only Christopher who left that room.\n\n\nWhen he went to his Ellisa's bedroom he found that the window was open and some screams and shouts were heard from below. Along with that was a letter written on the desk.\n\nChristopher is even more distraught. He's had enough, he has to bring back his son now. He tries one last time to bring back his son.\nChristopher finally brings out only the stone and uses it on his son’s body, he manages to pulled it off, but somehow that experiment had failed and he Christopher McAllister disappears off the radar. \n\n\n\nAnd that’s it. I’m not sure what happened after that. There was some sort of involvement with this [man](http://recollectionwalshire.deviantart.com/art/Waltshire-Mansion-Protagonist-532381932).\nChristopher disappeared from his latest experiment.

358mu1,Waltshire Family,"The Waltshire Mansion was home to a very wealthy family, one that housed over 130 members from its family line. It was two stories high and had an underground basement for wine. \n\n\nIn 1746 the Waltshire family had owned a huge province of the land where they had built a huge mansion over it. The first mansion housed about two families, one for themselves and another for the other family the in-laws. The son of the Waltshire was an incredible architect named **Julius Waltshire**, he designed the second portion of the house to extend more room for future generations and wealth. \nOver another generation, Julius was the architect for many other plot of lands that the family name spread all over the country side. He had many children and because of that Julius plans for building the mansion was to increase production. Eventually by 1799 Julius died from tuberculosis, but his plans for the mansion was halfway done, well ahead than its prior schedule. \n\n\nBy 1825 the mansion was finally complete, and housed a sum of the Waltshire. The Waltshire family had produced many celebrities and were quite famed for it. They hardly fancied Arts for they don’t’ see how proficient it was to being an incredible architect of the Empire State Building. Anyone who dreamed of such *low-life ideals* were thrown out for the sake of the family name.\n\n\nIn 1834 a fire accident had burned down part of the mansion, the cause was by the **Wilkin Brothers**, which both had been fighting over one of the in-laws living with them, a young girl named **Lou Corona**. The Wilkin Brother who started the fire was jealous of his other brother’s love and tried to murder him with the fire. However his brother survived it and in his dismay the fire killed Lou. \nThe mansion was rebuilt afterward the incident and complete in 1846 by a brilliant architect named **George Franklin Hatch**, a well respected man and a pastor. He denied the Waltshire’s approval for marrying one of their daughters but shortly later died in a strange accident.\n\n\nIn 1940 soldiers had used the house as their headquarters, the land was huge for training soldiers. The mansion was once again expanded to house in the soldiers and a hospital wing for the injured coming back from war. During that time was a wealthy Dwayne Waltshire, who had 8 daughters and a son named **Thomas**.\n\n\nSo while his daughters left the Waltshire family he raised young Thomas up to continue the family name. Young Thomas trained hard in the military. He had many sons and two daughters. His youngest daughter Caroline ran away from the family, while his older daughter, Ellisa stayed behind to take care of her father. The Cold war claimed Thomas’s sons, the poor general was left with his only daughter Ellisa who married a [McAllister](http://redd.it/358qh3), losing the title Waltshire. \n\n&gt; You probably thinking this is a story and not a game.

3b01f6,Post apocalyptic game idea inspired by I am legend.,"Hi, i have a post apocalyptic game idea inspired by film I am legend, but i am thinking that there are a lot of post apocalyptic survival games out there, so maybe someone could think what features or things could make the game special, different from other survival games? "
3ayyud,Gta meets call of duty meets need for speed&gt;&gt;&gt;,I know. It sounds silly but look. \n\nImagine a large free roam map that you can do whatever you want in (gta) where you can do /and or/ have a task like detonating/defusing bombs etc (cod) and each team has to race there (NFS) \n\nLet me know and add details to make it sound better!!
3ayvl9,Train Simulator meets Civilization,"During this summer I'll try and work on making this game, but if anyone wants to make this I'd love to help.\n\nA train simulator game like age of empires or civilization where you run a railroad company that starts when and where trains were first invented. You expand against other companies managing your tracks designing new trains (stealing other engineers) sabotaging the other companies tracks. You can use dynamite to blast through mountains to make faster routes. You can also drive your trains where you can either drive one from 3rd or 1st person or hire drivers with different stats. If you have more than one train without managers you can switch between them, but it will stay at how you set it so it could just drive through a stop. You can then expand to America using your roots Europe (where trains were invented in the 1890s) to bankroll your efforts. There needs to be good destruction physics with good graphics. On the harder difficulties you can only control one person (wearing a top hat and suit, always!) (no switching between trains, need to use telegrams/train/horses to find out what is happening away from you. you can buy other managers/descendants to go out and manage far away places) Your manager can be killed if so you can take control of his descendants (on a lower difficulty) America is very competitive, gold, small boom towns, robbers. You have to deal with the world wars and the loss of interest in passenger trains (fight against the car companies) use trains to transport oil and build mining operations maybe and stuff like that. With tar sands and such you lose popularity in favour of money. You can work on MagLevs in Japan and maybe a dlc (free?) devoted to the future, maybe transporting supplies around space stations."
3aw0wi,stealth based first person shooter:chrono night,"The game takes place in a submarine with your fellow bunk-mates, in which you play as chrono- six, a super solider with ghostly,wraith type powers and a trusty cross between a shotgun and a revolver. The submarine gets raided and attacked,fighting your way through the submarine and being betrayed and left for dead and the bottom of the ocean by your trusted general jack lithener. and thus, the game begins, but that's all i got."
3auaio,"Treehouse base-building, recycling-gathering kids game","Here's a resource gathering, base-building game idea that is smaller scale than open-world survival.\n\nYou're a kid in the suburbs building a treehouse. You collect materials by wandering the neighborhood and picking up trash. Recyclable materials (e.g. metal, glass, plastic, paper) are used as crafting material for base features. Each ""day"" could last a short time, starting with items randomly spawned in the neighborhood. Return to the treehouse for the crafting and building.\n\nThat's all it has to be. The three basic game states: running around to gather items, crafting menu to convert recyclables into building pieces/furniture, and base-building where created parts are placed to expand the base."
3arxaq,Horror game centered around Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm?,"First time posting here so I apologize if it's poor quality. Just an idea I got from an askreddit thread. Also, this might come off as insensitive due to it being based on a real life, tragic event, so if anyone is offended in any way by this, just message me and I willtake it down as soon as I get the message.\n\nAs P.T. showed (at least according to most theories), Horror games can be very effective when you are playing as the insane bad guy. I thought that it  there could be a horror game based off of the Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm incident. if you don't know what it is, you can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_put_Bella_in_the_Wych_Elm) IBasically, you would be playing as the killer after the event happened. You would be insane, and seeing the grafitti in your own twisted way. As the game progressed, you would unravel the fact that you were the murderer, and you helped create these graffiti (that you see as terrifying girls) that are haunting you. And there would be a slow realization that you were the bad guy. Obviously, this could be insenstive, so as I said before, if you find it offensivbve, just message me or comment , and I will imeediately take this post down."
3arbay,A post apocalyptic open world strategy game.,"Ive been toying with this idea for the past few weeks. Its sort of an open world strategy game set in a Fallout type world. The main idea is that you need to recover textbooks for you clan/guild/state so your people can upgrade their technology. Theres maybe 3 or 4 other towns/clans that each have certain textbooks you need to recover. How you recover the books is up to you. You can use diplomacy, trade, violence, etc. Every time you recover a book you gain access to new technologies, for example, if you recover the biology textbook youre able to get more food and recover healing faster, a business textbook you get better deals in trading, a chemistry textbook you get more ammo. Im imgining the gameplay similar to Expedition: Conquistadors, where you dont actually control each individual character but give them order each day and based on stats it determines if theyre successful.\n\n\nI envision the player trying to be very creative, maybe one town is very stubborn but you dont want to attack them for diplomatic reason, so you secretly intercept all their food convoys from another city starving them out. Or you destroy their crops by way of sabotage. Then when theyre desperate you trade them food for the book. \n\n\nSorry I know I seem like im rambling but im just trying to get my ideas out there."
3aqr4s,[Experienced] An online space battle game,"My idea is for a free online game, where you create starships and fight each other. You create an account, which is as easy as creating a reddit account, and then build a spaceship. You fly around and shoot the other players' ships. You score a certain amount of points for how many enemy ships you destroy. In addition to that, it the ship you destroy has a certain amount of points, you get those points as well. If your score is high enough, it will be put on the leaderboard. You can use your points to customize your ships, by upgrading the cannons, hull, and adding shields."
3aqqnv,Emergency Service Multiplayer.,"Like Arma 3 multiplayer except emergency services. Players assign themselves to emergency services and units of their choice. There will be one player from each who handles the control room. There screen will be of a map and they are alerted any time a call comes in to an incident. The map also shows locations of emergency units on the move and emergency buildings, i.e Fire Stations, Police Stations. The dispatcher will select what units to send to the fire, and call them on the in game speech activation to where they are sent. Other than that, it is all first person. Squads will be assigned to fire engines. Minimum of 4 players per engine and one driver. Other than that paramedics and police will go in pairs unless they are specialist units."
3aop8y,Freestyle rap typing and rhyming game,"One challenge of freestyle rapping is choosing a rhyming word fast enough to keep up with a beat.\n\nImagine a typing game based around this. There are preset songs that are full of two-verse rhymes. A verse is displayed (plain text or maybe kinetic typography) and the player has to type a word that rhymes with the last word. Then the game displays a pre-written verse that ends with your word if it knows one, or you fail that line and continue to the next one. Maybe you get more points if you type the word in fast enough to stay on beat (or fewer points for each measure that passes in silence).\n\nBecause the game always offers the first verse for the player to rhyme with, the designer should intentionally avoid words that have too many common rhyming words -- it would be too much work to write response verses containing each such word. A designer could also have easy vs difficult songs based on the vocabulary used.\n\nExample gameplay. Song/level choice is beginner Yo Mamma battle. The beat begins and verse #1 comes in.\n\n&gt; Here's a song bout dear old **mother**  \n&gt; ]  \n\nAn English rhyming dictionary says common correct answers are another, brother, 'nother, other, smother. So the game should have prepared verse #2 for those words. And smother should be a bonus word -- it's not an obvious choice and it could be used for a funny insult. So if someone types in SMOTHER, the response verse looks like:\n\n&gt; Here's a song about dear old **mother**  \n&gt; ] *smother*  \n&gt; Butt so wide that step dads **smother**  (crowd goes wild)  \n&gt; ... (verse 3)\n\nMaking such a game isn't technically hard, but setting up fun rhymes and answers that flow into the next verses would be a good writing challenge."
3and2v,MMO/ RTS Idea,"This is short, but I think this would be a good way to implement large multiplayer elements into a RTS. So players can set up a small base with defenses, and they gather basic resources underground, where they cannot be bothered by other players. To get better resources to upgrade further, they have to venture above ground. Players can trade and form alliances with other players."
3amyg2,"I'm surprised that no game like ""The Eyeballing Game"" exists as a mobile app",
3alj3h,Game where you keep a balloon in the air,"An FPS where you try to do something like what this guy is doing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0hmh9SIlxA\n\nYou start in your back yard, and the wind eventually takes your balloon farther. You start trespassing while trying to keep the balloon in the air, and angry home owners start attacking you so you need to fend them off while keeping the balloon in the air. Then GTA-style cops show up and that's when things really kick off...\n\nJust a silly idea I had. Would probably make a fun garry's mod mode."
3al9bk,Pokemon X Smash Bros,"Every time I play Smash brothers, especially the newest game, I always wonder why Nintendo has never made a version of the game set solely in the pokemon universe.  The playable characters have four special moves, much like pokemon do in their own games, and when a pokemon were to level up enough to learn new moves, they could irrevocably replace the old ones for that pokemon.   A lot of the pieces are already there, I just wish somebody would properly put them together."
3ajrzm,I'm making an RPG with RPG Maker VX Ace.,I want a Metroidvania game but with a FF play style. Any ideas? Thanks. 
3ajh4g,Moba gameplay with mincraft style,"The idea is to make a game that has moba style element but also some of the mincraft like mining, crafting.\n\nAt the beging of the match, players would have severl minutes to collect materials for crafting their first items and mine their path to towers. and path in general (so in a way every game tha map would be uniq). After that time has passed the real fight would start, players go to their positions and start farming. Main paths would be solid so you can't mine there, you can mine and collect the jungle, create path to gank and sneak to the enemy teritory (this would need a lot of balancing). The main goal is to destroy the enemy team and their base.\n\nI just wanna know what you guys think about this idea, is it workable?"
3ajbbw,[Request] Setting for a metroidvania?,Planets / spaceships / castles are overused. What different setting would fit well in the genre?
3aj87p,A jewel-swapping game that involves matching chess pieces.,"Like most other jewel-swap games (Bejeweled, candy crush, etc) the main idea revolves around moving pieces until 3 (or more) of a kind match up. \n\nHere's the kicker: Each tile corresponds to a chess piece and color (black/white), and moves accordingly. Rather than capturing, they simply switch places, regardless of color. And the matching of pieces also works regardless of color.\n\nA Rook, for example, can be swapped with any piece above, below, or beside, any distance away (games like Huniepop use this mechanic). Same with the Bishop, only along the diagonal axis. The knight would be an advanced piece/tile that is introduced later on to increase difficulty, they swap how a Knight would move (L). Pawns swap the same way they capture (diagonally forward) either upwards or downwards depending on its color (pawns are the only piece whose color affects movement. Pawns become more common as the difficulty scales up).\n\nThere would be two bonus pieces that don't need to be matched, rewarded for making specific matches:\n\n* The King (made by matching 4 or more pieces. This include moves that create more than 1 match-up). The king can move 1 space in any direction. Doing so will clear out all adjacent pieces.\n\n* The Queen (made by matching 3 or more pieces of the same color). The Queen can clear all pieces that lie upon a specific axis (Above/below, beside, or either diagonal) which is decided by moving the Queen in the desired direction."
3aj2dy,Gladiator Simulation Fighter,"I honestly dream about a good sword fighting sim. I know people are gonna bring up games like Chivalry, but as fun as a game like that is I definitely don't consider it a sim fighter. I'm talking about a game like UFC Undisputed 3 combined with Spartacus Legends. An intimate and strategic fighter with a steep learning curve, and a large skill gap. Create a fighter, set his physical attributes, and animations, then select a weapon, and armor. Weapons and armor shouldn't have stats, maybe something like characteristics instead. Fights can end in 5 seconds or last up to hours. At the end of the fight the winner should be given the option of whether or not he wants kill the loser. If he chooses to kill the loser, the losers fighter is gone forever. The winner is rewarded with fancy new weapons and armor. Also the lacerations and cuts you get in one fight should turn in scars the next fight. I know a game like this will never happen, but I think it would be awesome and nice change of pace from all cookie cutter games we get now. After seeing the hype a game like For Honor got a E3, I'm hopeful for the future of melee/sword combat games. I just hope they start doing them without all the cheap gimmicks."
3aifg9,A game where you need to figure out how to survive different scenarios made by players. (Main focus: natural disasters),"Open to interpretation.\n\nHowever, it should be a 3D game like Rust, not like Plague Inc. "
3ahyts,A new type of FPS,"While playing the disappointing cod ghost I was wondering to myself if I could make a better FPS. So here it is. My FPS game is going to be long, the gameplay will be 1-2 days long and will be unique. In close combat situations your skill accounts for something. You do not start as super ninja with incredible speed and super strength and unnatural stamina. \n\nYour missions are based on real events that have happened decades ago in history. So in essence you are a real soldier. For example you and your squad(group of 8)have received information that Saddam Husain is 3 clicks(3km) away from your location. So you head through the Sahara Desert when all of a sudden you are ambushed by a convoy who are only interested in killing you. This, is already a mission it may not be glamorous like James Bond but you are doing something. This is where a microphone will be needed to talk to your team mates as you may need to come up with a plan. \n\nThere are of course things you need to be wary of there are 3 settings when you get killed-\nEasy-This is used when have no idea what to do in FPS you go back to the last checkpoint you and your team where at.\nMedium-Your not a noob but certainly not a pro therefore for you dying you start the whole mission again but you get to keep the currency and guns you got throughout your progress.\nHard-You complete the whole game without dying and we send you a prize for doing so but it depends on how fast you did it the fastest person to complete the game gets a chance to make there own gun for the game. For 2nd place we give you a £100 for trying for first.3rd you get £50.\n"
3agi6c,Non-standard FPS idea,"I was just watching the Black Ops 3 multiplayer footage from E3 and it seems like SSDD. Not that I doubt it'll be a commercial success, that's about as predictable as the sun rising everyday.\n\nI saw a bunch of forces on the screen and I was thinking, what if a multiplayer FPS had a real combat zone, not just players, but with tons of creeps moving around like in MOBA games, of different varieties as well. Assuming a near-future setting like BO3, there could be various technologies and creeps moving about, like standard riflemen, grenadiers, powered armor, walkers, troop transports, ect. The players themselves would act as ""directors"" for the action, leading and directing the creeps. The directors are more than just the average soldier with customizable talents, technology, and abilities, so that players looking for a solid run-and-gun game can still get that, and directors can be tailored to a degree, so they're still prepared for PvP combat. Players accumulate currency by killing creeps, killing directors, accomplishing side objectives, and perhaps in other ways. The currency can be used to call in air or artillery strikes, requisition better creeps, or purchase static defenses that the enemy now has to overcome.\n\nBecause of the nature of the game, you are rarely alone and are often fighting not just other players, but the fireteams with them. Although directors are well protected, they're still mortal and creeps can overcome them if they're not careful. Success will require coordination and communication, so a mic will almost be required for this game. Real world squad level tactics apply, holding key positions and high points, flanking and counter-flanking attacks with squads, and pressing home any advantages you earn. Game modes can including the standards for FPS games, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, Points Race, Objectives, ect. This is honestly just a loose idea I had while watching the video, if it's been done before or it's not appealing that doesn't matter, I just wanted to share."
3agaar,Open World RPG Alternate history game(Axis won WW2),"The Lore:  \n    \n* America Never built the Atomic Bomb and dropped it on Japan.  \n* Germany won D-Day and took over France and eventually all of Europe. \n* Germany built the Atomic Bomb without the US knowing and bombed Washington D.C., Chicago, and New York.  \n* U.S Citizens start having riots due to the destroyed government and the Axis use this to take over the USA.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n* After the Axis took over the world and they remained to only countries. Whichever country you were born to that was the country you were assigned to. What this means is if you were born in China and that country is owned by Japan you become a Citizen of Japan.  \n* You can not leave your country. For example if you are a citizen of Japan you can not, for any reason go to Germany or Italy.  \n* All countries share supplies and resources.  \n* The nuked areas are walled off and filled with people known as Savages  \n* Savages are basically zombies except they can sprint/run, jump, and speak their own languages. \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Story(set 50 years after the take over of the world):  \nYou play a protagonist that was a born in New York. Your parents were killed by the Atomic Bomb. Before the drop of the bomb you were with your uncle in Boston. The capital of the German Empire is located in Boston as well. Your character, an engineer, is told by a friend that the Government is doing experiments in the Walled off Wastelands(The bombed cities). Originally you ignore what he says until you find him dead in his house a week later. You start to investigate his murder and( fast forward half of the game because I don't really have an idea yet) the investigation leads to a man in the Wasteland of New York. The only way into the Wasteland is approval by the Fuhrer or of the unknown special forces. (once again fast forward until you get in because I haven't thought of how you can get in). The man you have been looking for is located in a shack on the outskirts of New York. You realize that he is not a savage and a regular person. He explains to you all about the savages and who they are, why they are alive, and what they do. You learn that savages are people that are given a drug to turn them insane. The man explains to you that he killed your friend because he didn't want you to become a savage. You then find out he is actually your dad that survived the bomb by hiding in his own bunker. With his help you learn to navigate the wastelands. You open the main door from the inside and release the savages to the public. (and fast forward until you get a revolution and take over the government)\n\n\nSorry for all the fast forwards, I didn't think off all the details for the story just the Backstory(lore) and the basic outline of a story.  \n  \nWhat do you guys think?  \n  \nI also just realized Wolfenstein is a game about Nazi's taking over. I never played it so I don't know they story, hopefully it's not similar."
3af05w,Rogue Rage - The World's First Roguelike Racing Game,"This is an idea I've been mulling over since last October, and I've got SO MUCH concept written up for it (Right now, I've got a massive text file filled with weapon info, track layouts, vehicle designs, achievements, etc.). It almost makes me wish I had enough talent to actually produce it.\n\nMy point here is that vehicles have many more ""stats"" which can be altered than the typical playable human character (top speed, acceleration, handling, grip, nitrous duration/power, etc.), and that a roguelike category for this genre is seriously underutilized.\n\nThe general stylistic choice I'm going for here is somewhere halfway between Vaporwave and Cyberpunk. I want it to be computerized with large amounts of environments filled with technology and industrial buildings.\n\nThe track ideas I have range greatly, from airport terminals to refineries, train depots and pumpyards, and all sorts of industrial highways and interstates, and lots of tracks styled after apocalyptic scenarios (like Motorstorm: Apocalypse). I also have ideas for multiplayer arenas, like minepits and scrapyards.\n\nThe player controls one of several vehicle classes which start with different stats, weapons, and modifiers. The basic HUD would have details on your weapon stats, weapon mods, track minimap, current score, and multiplier.\n\nWeapons can be altered with Hypermods, which alter how the weapon is fired or damages enemies. They can split projectiles, cause ""virus damage"" (poison), blast damage, shred damage, heal you, increase projectile size, and many other effects.\n\nThe difficulty with creating a true roguelike racing game is in that it would require a procedurally generated track layout. Due to how difficult this would be, the idea I have is to make a large number of tracks, but have the layout of each be dynamic during the races (think similarly to Split/Second). \n\nEach track has certain points where random items appear in a row and can alter your vehicle's stats, change your weapon, change your score multiplier, heal you, give you nitrous, a random usable item, and do many other things.\n\nSpeaking of Split/Second, one of the main ways the track layout can change is by a system known as Environmental Actuators. These work very much like Power Plays. There are three classes of Actuators: Single-Use, Multi-Use, and Route Changers.\n\nRoute Changers are massive environmental hazards which can frag multiple racers and change the track pathway.\n\nSingle-Use Actuators are things that can only happen once, and may either obscure the roadway or just cause damage to the track.\n\nMulti-Use Actuators can be used multiple times and don't actually alter the track in any way, but have massive stopping power against enemies.\n\nThese items can appear alongside other random items on the track.\n\nDuring the main single player mode, each track has multiple completion requirements which, when reached, bring around a boss. These bosses have massive amounts of health, take up the entire road, and deal great amounts of damage. Completing a track unlocks new weapons, vehicles, and tracks.\n\nOutside of this, the other intention for multiplayer is to have competitive rogue, along with co-op rogue, a battle arena mode, and something I call ""asynchronous rogue"", which is very much like City Trial from Kirby Air Ride or Smash Run.\n\nEach player starts in an individual track run, allowed about 5-7 minutes to upgrade their vehicle and weapon. After this, all members go to an arena where they battle. Winner is determined by mixture of highest score in first stage and highest score in arena.\n\nSo anyway, that's my idea, and I hope I can get some people working on it in a while.

3ad4fd,Idea for an assassin game,"You play as an assassin (First person) and you go about a normal routine. You drive to work, you go to the store, etc, etc. Occasionally you are given a contract by the game, or alternatively, another player in the game. The player can assign contracts to another including details on the target and a reward, or the game can assign random targets. essentially, you try to get your contracts complete while avoiding other assassins hired to kill you."
37z9xw,British Political Simulator 2015,"I would like this game to have similar gameplay to Democracy 3. There is one major difference: first, you have to get elected. Also, this would be a multi-party system, and it would use the First Past the Post electoral system. There would be a ridiculous amount of micro-management, since you have to place representatives in every constituency, and manufacture election campaigns based on the demographics of different regions.

37xga2,"""The Barren Creche""","K, so backstory:  \n\nA few months back I had this crazy dream that has stuck with me, and I haven't been able to shake it.  Now, keep in mind, I'm agnostic.  Not religious at all.  So keep that in mind despite the fact that this storyline sounds very religious based...  \n\nIn the dream I was killed in a car accident...  When I got to... somewhere, neither heaven nor hell, I was met by a rather frightening faceless man.  Not frightening in an ""I'm going to hurt you"" way, but more in a ""I could easily hurt you if I wanted to, but I don't, so don't make me"" kinda way.  I realized this was God.  \n\nHe explains to me that I died, but I have a message to tell people, so I'm heading back whether I like it or not, and I didn't feel like arguing was on the table.  So he takes me to this giant room.  More like a warehouse you could fit an entire city in, lined with rows and rows of what could be mistaken for small cribs as far as the eye could see.  A small glow could be seen coming from only a handful of the cribs, otherwise almost all of them were empty.  \n\nHe explains to me that this is the ""creche"".  It's the place where souls are ""born"".  As an animal/plant on the Earth dies, its energy returns to the creche to be ""cleansed"".  It will then congeal into another ""soul"" to be born into another animal/plant or even a human.  \n\nHowever, humans are unique in that they were given free will.  The ability to impact what happens to them, and so their energy remains intact for as long as they follow the ""rules"".  Depending on how they lived their life, they may not, in fact, return at all.  If they are particularly ""enlightened"" when they die, they ascend beyond the creche, and live in a different state of existence closer to his own.  If they are less than righteous, they will have to be reborn on the planet to try again.  If they're particularly bad, their energy is destroyed, and returned to the creche - so they can never return as the same ""soul"" but rather may be recycled into plants/animals/or new souls.  \n\nThe problem is that this ""energy"" is finite, and the plan for the earth was to help all of these energy ""beings"" (souls) to eventually ascend.  \n\nBut naturally, there's an antagonist.  ""God"" has an evil twin who we call the ""Devil"".  His basic plan is to keep humans from ascending for as long as possible, because basically, he just hates humans and God, and everything else. (I get the feeling there's more to this story, but I feel like it's best if I don't ask.)  So for as long as humans have existed, the two of them have fought back and forth with their angels and demons.  Sometimes the battle falls over into the earth (Fire and Brimstone of the old testament, floods, etc.) while mostly the battles are fought in the heavens.  \n\nWhile this was going on, both would send their advocates to try and guide humans towards ascension (angelic ""posessions"" = prophets) or away (demonic possesions = ?).  For tens of thousands of years, this kept them at a stalemate, and the war raged on.  \n\nSo 2000 years ago, they struck a deal.  The Gods would be permitted to send a single prophet to give a final message, then from then on, both demons and gods have to stay out of the human plane of existance. To get the demons to agree, the gods had to give something up.  Their end of the bargain would be that one out of every 100,000,000 souls to leave the creche would be stopped.  This would cause a single child to be born, every 1 out of 100,000,000 times, without a soul.  The demons would then be able to influence this soulless child subtly, but not possess them directly.  At the time, with only about 300,000,000 people on the earth at all, this didn't seem like a bad deal.  The Gods were banking on the inherent ""goodness"" of man, and the demons were banking on their ability to twist man.\n\nThe truce began, and for the following 2000 years things started to take a nasty turn: \n\nWith only 3 soulless children to work with to start, it was expected that the demons would take the obvious route, trying to turn people towards evil, and away from ascension.  However, instead of turning people *away* from ascension/religion, the demons instead pushed people *toward* it unexpectedly.  They encouraged the growth of the human race through religion (only have sex to have babies!  Now go out and make babies for God!) they encouraged fanaticism so the people would war between themselves, fighting over their religion, and basically, caused a massive turmoil over religion while simultaneously exploding the human popualation.  \n\nAs the population skyrockted, more soulless were born, allowing the demons more influence.  People were inspired with new inventions making humans live longer, curing illness, but also being given advanced weapons of war to fight over their religious beliefs.  New technology allowed for new food supply methods, the population grew further, the soulless became more numerous, became politicians, and began to shape the world further.  \n\nStill, the Gods held on to their belief that the humans were generally ""good"" and the rapid population explosion would only permit them to ascend en masse.  Unfortunately, they didn't realize the end-game of the demons until it was too late.  \n\nThe energy was finite.  The humans destroyed plants and animals by the trillions, they cleared land, reproduced even more rapidly. At the same time, they began to realize the insanity of the wars over religion, and turned away not only from religion, but from the very concept of ascension all together.  They weren't ""bad"" enough to have their energy returned to the creche, but they weren't ""good"" enough to ascend either.  So they continued to recycle their energy on the earth, living 5, 6, 10, 20 lifespans in a row.  The population continued to grow...\n\nAnd the creche fell empty...  \n\nThe souls that had already ascended saw that the creche was emptying, and sacrificed themselves to buy the humans on Earth more time.  They returned their energy to the creche to help replenish it, but it wasn't enough.  \n\nWe're now down to the last few souls in the creche.  Soon, the creche will be barren.  And when this happens, every child born after that time will be soulless.  As it is now, one in every 100,000,000 child will become the next Hitler, Dahmer, Manson, Gacey... One in a hundred million will be influenced directly by the demons.  \n\nHowever, once the creche falls empty, every... child... born... Will be evil.  With enough evil on the planet, the very idea of ascension can be eliminated for eternity.  And the creche is nearly barren. \n\n\nSo...  Needless to say, this dream stuck with me and I think it was probably influenced by some old scary movie and some bad chinese, but I think it would make an AWESOME plot for a freaking video game.  \n\nSo, here's what I'm wondering:  If I've got the plot, what would the game itself look like?  I'm wanting to stick with 2D, and I'm feeling Iso (ala: Baldur's Gate).  Basically, you start as Joe-Blow normal, but after a car accident, you're given the above storyline, and have to figure out *how* to stop it.  How do you either a.) Stop the human population boom, b.) Rapidly ascend as many people as possible to help replenish the creche with their energy, or c.) Destroy enough plant/animal life to buy yourself some time?  None of your options are good, but you have to do *something* to stop Armageddon. \n\nI'm not sure what the game mechanics here would be, and obviously there's a ton of fleshing out needed (not my forte) but I personally like this as a plotline.\n\n\n*Edit: Oh, and believe it or not, this is the SHORT version of the dream!*"
37xag0,A Far Cry-like game set in the African Congo.,"I think that the Congo area is an excellent setting for a Far Cry or a Far Cry-like game. Not only because of the war, but also because of the wildlife. Crocodiles, goliath tigerfish, elephants, hippos, gorillas, chimpanzees, bull sharks, all sorts of stuff. But what makes it a really excellent setting for such a game is its legendary mythological and cryptozoological fauna.\n\nThe most notable of these is the Mokele-Mbembe, a mythical spirit resembling a sauropod dinosaur. There is also the Emela-ntouka, a giant horned reptile, the Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu, an animal resembling a Kentrosaurus, the Nguma-monene, a Spinosaurus-like monster, Ngoubou, an elephant-killing monster with six horns, and Kasai rex, a famous hoax about a giant carnivorous dinosaur that eats rhinos. More of these include Kongamato, an aggressive giant bat/pterosaur/bird, the popobawa, a shapeshifting flying creature that rapes men, Gustave and mahamba, giant man-eating crocodiles, the Ennedi tiger, a saber-toothed cat, four-foot spiders, the Muhuru, an Ankylosaurus-like beast, the Ndendeki, a giant turtle, and the Agogwe, a fanged humanoid dwarf with woolly hair. A full list can be found here: http://themorlock.deviantart.com/art/Cryptids-of-Central-Africa-170598112?q=gallery%3ATheMorlock%2F31001072&amp;qo=6\n\nWhile these are almost certainly just legends (okay, definitely just legends), I think they would be good material for a game like this. The gameplay would preferably be like the last three Far Cry games, open-world first-person shooters, but the rest could be different. \n\nTL;DR Far Cry 2 with dinosaurs, giant crocodiles and flying demons."

37vs3c,MMORPG Level System,"Hey guys.\n\nIm thinking about a lot of different Level Systems and just want some ideas from you guys.\n\nMy basic idea would be,\nwhen you play the game the first time the max level is 80(for exampel) and when you reach the Max level you can reset (prestige) your level and will have like 10% of the stats you aquired trough leveling (like strength, dex ...) and can level up again. Every 5 prestiges the max Level will increase (by 10 for exampel) so you just level up and prestige and repeat to unlock new items and skills and get stronger and stronger. Also the expierence needed isnt exponential but linear wich means you will need about the same time from 50-60 as from 80-90 .\n\nwhat do you guys think about that idea? Does it sound good or bad or do you have improvment ideas?\n\nThanks for reading"
37vcpe,Physically simulated game,"It is a simple concept, but would have a world infinitely complex world.\n\nThe concept:  The developer only programs movement, object interaction, an interaction between elements.   It simulates all 118 elements, and how they interact with each other.  For example, certain elements could react with others under the right circumstances.  \n\nIt would be an MMO, with a map the size of the universe (mostly procedurally generated). \n\nPlayers would start on Earth with only their bare hands with no technology.  As the players start making wood tools, then stone, then start mining, they can experiment and start advancing technology. \n\nAnd I don't mean a ""Click to unlock electricity"".  I mean that the players would have to build machines to harvest electricity, possibly making them out of voxels or a built-in 3D modelling program.\n\nPlayers would begin making machines with electricity, possibly several real life years after the launch of the game.   Maybe they would find out how to use liquid oxygen and hydrogen to create a reaction that could power rockets and go to the Moon, Mars, and beyond to the universe once they make a warp drive (If not physically possible, an alternative method will need to be programmed into the game in a realistic way).  Spacecraft would have simulated pressure and structural integrity so that even a bolt misplaced by a player would have a terrible effect.\n\n\nThis idea may be far beyond what is possible, but I think it would be a super cool experiment to see humans collaborate online.\n-"

37ky1q,Need your opinion about features in RTS Steampunk game with Airships.,"I'm doing research work for the game I'm working on at the moment and I would like to know opinion from people who like to play computer games. \n\nBasic idea behind a game is to be some kind of Real Time Strategy game placed in Steampunk universe where player becomes a Commander of Battle Airship/ airships fleet. \nGame world and action would take place in the skies, filled with floating islands where you build shipyard buildings etc. and mine resources (iron, coal and oil). \n\nRather than letting player build certain types of main-ships/units I rather have less types but allow them for heavy customization.\nGame will provide ""empty hull types"" and player need to decide what to put in, depends on the mission target and his own preferences. For example flak cannons, AA guns, different types of armor, more powerful engines, cargo bays, room types: like command room, repair room, radar room etc. \n\nRegards above informations I have few questions? \n\n- How much would you like to be able to customize your ships? Just different types of Gun Turrets, Armors or would like to keep upgrading them into more powerful ones during a game progression and make this a big feature in a game? \n\n- Should ships have a crew members that operates those vessels? So for example if you take heavy damage and crew members die your repair speed goes down, or guns reloading takes longer.\n\n- How would you like the battles to look like? Fewer ships in far distance between with slow speed and longer gun reload times  where you need to use more tactics and planning to win(slower peace) or more ""arcade"" like style battles where you are flying around enemies in circles and just Shoot all you got on them?\n\n- Last one is about in-game story? How much game should base/take from it? Is it important for you to have ""Hero"" Characters, some sort of story telling between missions? or just want to build airships and destroy enemies? \n\nThanks for your opinions in advance. \n"

37aolu,You kill monsters,"Ive had this idea for a while and Recently got motivated to actually develop it. (i made a post here a while ago and got some pretty great advice) I'm an illustrator and was actually hoping I could get some critique on this project. I barely have anything developed (im serious its literally just a concept right now, all I have is a rather quickly done illustration and some ideas) but I feel that There is enough here for a little advice. :)\n\n\nAnyway, the idea came to me from seeing a picture online. I'm really bummed out that I don't have the picture with be but it depicted this giant monster looming over this little girls bed. On the bed there was a small teddy bear with a sword and shield ready to fight the monster off. I loved this idea. A child's toy fighting off the monsters that live under the child's bed and in the closet. I took the idea and did countless sketches but never reaching anything cohesive  I could turn it into. but after a lot of red bull and procrastination in league of legends i finally came to the conclusion it could be a game. \n\n\nThe basics of the game would be you and a team of 3 others would play as a toy or stuffed animal, like a sock monkey, a bunny, a wind up robot, things like that. Each character having varying abilities such as placing down mouse traps setting up walls. maybe one can have fast melee attacks or someone can have a small nerf gun rigged to shoot teeth. But all 4 of you fight off waves of monsters that try to make it to the child your protecting in bed. Shes sleeping and you need to keep her nightmares at bay! Now the monsters could be anything, Bats, spiders, the scary ass pictures in ""Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark"" but there would always be something looming through out the room that you cant attack. Like the spider. There would be sort of a silhouette of this spindly thing on the far end of the room pumping out what seems to be an endless swarm of creepy crawlies. The closer the enemies, the more the environment changes to a darker tone. like dirt on the walls and ceiling and floor. maybe cobwebs surrounding most of the room.\n\n\n\nanyway thats my idea. (at least the bulk of it) Critique would be awesome and that one illustration I did is right here ------&gt; http://imgur.com/a/XmR5x (along with the rest of my artwork)"
37af2b,Acapella Hero,"*Rock Band/Guitar Hero meets Pitch Perfect*.\n\nA music rhythm game centered around the vocals of your character, following them from a collegiate level, to Youtube fame, all the way to competing on national television and earning a deal with a label.\n\nInstead of there being 5 different buttons to press at the right time during songs, you only have a vertical bar with a ""hot spot"", kind of like you see in golfing games. You have to hit the hot spot several times in each song, and harder songs with harder sections will have a faster and more difficult bar. This way, the game could be played on anything with a mouse or a touchscreen.\n\nI guess the hardest and costliest part would be paying a professional group to record the actual songs for the game. I never realized how much I want to play this game until I saw Pitch Perfect 2. Get on it, developers!"
37aevt,A good game for diabetics.,"In this game, you are tied to the main character. The main character is a vampire, who can only fight monsters by having fresh blood. However, his world is only filled with demons with no worthy blood. He calls out to you. All you need to do is give him some of your blood, and together you can vanquish the demons.\n\nYou are diabetic. This game will check your blood sugar regularly, and as part of the game, your vampire character will make sure your blood is good quality. (Blood sugar levels.) Maybe give some advice on what to eat after each ""tasting"". The closer to best levels, the stronger your attacks in the game. The more regular your check-ins and blood sugar levels, the better you do in the game.\n\n""I'm a small vampire, you see. Just a bit now and then.""\n\nNothing too gory, mind you. I'm thinking more along the lines of the style of say Disgaea in violence terms. Cartoon stuff. The only blood is, well, what's needed.\n\n\nThe game would have a timer inside of it, would keep track of times. Maybe have an audio alarm, but I also would like it to be equipped with a cell-phone adapter which if something happens to the ""host"" (without parental intervention to the game), the game would be able to call someone close to the person for help, in case of problems.\n\nFight evil. Fight demons. Fight Diabetes.\n\nIf there's enough support, I could totally do a kickstarter and draw up some art and story stuff. Maybe do some music."
3133kw,Islander,"Genre: Simulation/Adventure/FPS\n\nIntroduction:\nIt starts off where you are sitting in a plane. A big storm approaches and the pilot says that they are going to ascend higher to try get above it, going over the storm means that the communications will be out until they get past the storm. Whilst flying above the storm you look out the window and see a rare sprite occurrence (upward lightning) and after a few bolts, one hits the plane. The plane goes down and crashes on an island.\nYou wake up in the wreck and stumble out.\n\nGame Dynamics and Concepts:\nThe game does a random seed generating a few survivors, male and female. Every person in the game has their own personality traits and skills. Some of the peoples skills might be useless to you in the beginning of the game, but might be very useful later.\n\nSome of the Skills people might have:\nBuilder, Farmer, Engineer, Combat, Entrepreneur, etc.\nWhen the people are assigned to a task and they have the skill for it, they preform more efficient than someone that doesn't know the job.\n\nThe object of the game is to start out building a shelter, gather food and resources, learn how to craft items, make fire, build small and end up with a town. Chopping trees, gathering stones everything is used in something.\n\nLearning how to build a fence will enable you to build an animal pen, where you can then if you find livestock, heard them back. once in the pen, you can then breed with them.\n\nThe sky box will have a day/night cycle and also the game will have seasons which will affect the game variables. ie. different crops grow during different seasons, and some animals attack during the night rather than the day.\n\nThe island is inhabited by animals and natives. The amount of tribes on the island is random, as is their friendliness. You might have a tribe that is curious, always around observing you, or you might have a tribe that is cannibals and wants to kill you on sight and attack you during the night. Tribes can go from friendly to aggressive if you offend them by stealing their cows or something. When venturing out into the deep forest, caution and stealth is required. If the natives find out you are there, they will definitely come to find you, and if you run into a wild animal, hopefully you have a weapon on you.\n\nGrowing your population:\nOnce you have some private living space like a hut or hovel, people will start getting together and get funky. After 1 full cycle of seasons has passed the kid is born. Your population you need to keep safe, if they start dying and you only have woman or only have men, it's not going to end well for you. Also if you encounter the wrong tribe, you are going to have a more difficult time keeping everyone safe.\n\nI think I've said enough to give you a general idea as to where I am going with this. It can definitely use some more smoothing out to tie everything together and add more ideas.\nA game like this though would require a small team. As a senior developer, I can code. But visually it would most likely be stick men and sounds from my mouth.\nSo if this sounds interesting to you and you think that this could lead somewhere, lets see if we can get a team together and make this a fun side hobby."
3132qu,Looking to brainstorm some ideas for a Zelda Clone,"So, I have been thinking recently of trying to cut my teeth on indie game making by starting with something relatively basic which there seems to be a good number of resources for; a top down dungeon crawler/Zelda-clone.\n\nI'm starting this topic just because I'd love some help coming up with ideas to make the game a bit deeper. Some of the ideas I plan on moving forward with:\n\n- Dungeons can be completed in any order. Every dungeon will have a path that is able to be done with what you start the game with, and bosses will be capable of being defeated at beginning stats with your basic weapon. Of course, the items you pick up along the way will allow you to take alternative courses if you have the means to access them, leading to treasures or opening up the story/setting more.\n\n- New Game+ mode. This is something I actually want to put in every game I make. You can restart the game after beating it with all acquired upgrades and items. Some enemies will by upgraded, Bosses definitely will. Dungeons will switch up routes. Certain areas won't be accessible until you reach this point as well.\n\n- I'd like to incorporate some exploration/gathering elements, along with crafting.\n\n- A sci-fi setting. Maybe Science Fantasy, but definitely not Medieval Fairy Tale setting like Zelda. I thought about doing a kind of dark, bleak Fairy Tale thing, but I think that make the game come off too much as a parody of Zelda, which isn't my intention.\n\nAt this point, I'm still heavily in a planning phase, especially since I haven't decided what design platform I'm going to use to try and do this. Any ideas you might want to toss out would be appreciated: Maybe suggested item mechanics, something you thought or noticed after playing Link to the Past a hundred times, ideas for level design, etc.\n\nThanks!  "
30zhou,(Tycoon?) game with a twist of corruption,"I have been thinking about this game for a while now. Basically, it is a game that revolves around the player being corrupt - doing shady business and deals, taking tax money and stuff like that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think the game would be best as a tycoon type of game, where the player makes the choices of corruption and how to keep it hidden from the public. Main focus would be on the corrupt part, with city planning added to add key features and keep the game fun to play. A progress ladder beginning with a small village and then moving up towards a huge city would be great, that the player can move up and down on depending on the player's actions. A game where the player controls a person in first or third perspective would be quite dull in my opinion, but with a tycoon the player get's occupied with the city whilst being corrupt. Maybe a blend between those two, controlling a person when meeting some mobconnected people in an alley for example and then returning to cityview when the business is done could be quite a fun twist?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe main objective in the game would be to get as corrupt as possible without being caught, or calming the public enough, in the biggest city in the game, starting from scratch with petty bribes and then reaching the end with lobbyists trying to make you theirs by different ways. I would like a variety of choices to be made during the game and some of these choices have consequences and others unlock even more.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe media will play a vital role in the game, as they do in real life. Some news agencies want full transparency, especially in the higher tiers of cities, other agencies will make up facts about the player's corruption, and some might even see the truth but with a bribe will forget about it. This all would vary from game to game and the actions of the player but the media should definitely be present in the game! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSay for example I play this game, and makes a contract with a oil company so they can build offshore oil platforms - and in return I receive enough money to buy a small vacation house. By accepting the oil company's offer I can no longer accept a eco-friendly company's offer, but in the future the oil company might make more offers to me.\nWhen the public gets alerted of this contract I can either deny the bribe's existence and perhaps even build a new park to please the environmentalists! or I can tell the truth and face the consequences - losing my position in that town and having to move down.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat do you think of this idea, any feedback on how to improve the idea? Anyone that wants to makes this game happen?"

30vwdr,Customizable Powers,"I thought it would be pretty cool to have a game where you can customize your powers to be virtually anything you want. It would work similar to how a level editor works. For example, the level editors in Little Big Planet or Starcraft allow for so many different possibilities. Maybe you could have a simplified coding language in the game that players can use to create their own effects for their powers. I think this would be a pretty cool feature in an MMO game for example because then everyone would be unique in some way and there could be so many possibilities for PvP.\n\nTo prevent people from creating overpowered powers, maybe you could have drawbacks for increasing certain aspects of your power. For example, damage is inversely related to the range of your attack. Or maybe you could have a power that deals massive damage and can one hit kill people, however, you also have a major drawback such as dying if you miss the attack. Think of all the possibilities!"
30vqkd,No Way Out,"A intense (possibly multiplayer) survival horror where you are visiting a mall when suddenly, an unknown fungal pathogen has infected some of the other patrons of the mall, and as a result, the mall has been entirely quarantined by the military. Several sections and areas are labeled by their safety ranking:\n\nBlue - Military controlled zone, some survivors are occasionally taken here to be examined/experimented on, unauthorized are to be shot on sight. Green - Area with minimal/no infection presence, generally safe. Yellow - Area has had some infected sightings, survivors are advised to avoid, small amounts of infected material present. Red - Highly dangerous, large amounts of infected have been sighted, large amounts of infected material present. Advised to avoid at all costs. Black - Dead zone. Where corpses previously stored to prevent further infection. Area is extremely populated with infected and coated in infected material.\n\nPlayers must scavenge through the mall to find food, resources, supplies, makeshift weapons, etc. in order to survive. Groups of survivors can be organized to intercept military caravans (Armed personnel distributing inadequate supplies,) take over military checkpoints, and fend off infected.\n\nInfected are not like every other zombie or monster from other games. As they succumb to the infection, they go through varying stages and loose their humanity. They act very similarly to monsters from The Forest in that each infected is different, some will stalk players, avoid them, ambush them, simply follow them, or outright charge them. Infected will contaminate areas where they travel with spores produced by fungi protruding from their bodies, similar to The Last of Us. This would require players daring to venture into dangerous areas (often containing more/better unsalvaged supplies) to fashion or steal gas masks/hazmat suits.\n\nThanks for reading and tell me what you think!"

30vbzl,Alternatives to keys?,"I'm a game developer, currently working on a Sci-Fi roguelike platformer thingy. I want to have some doors be inaccessible, unless a player has some item (like a key), or does something (perhaps in a minigame). \n\nThe problem is that, because it's Sci-Fi, I don't want to just use keys, and the game is to fast paced for a drawn out hacking minigame. Any ideas? "
30ul0b,Operation: Kill Hitler,"The base concept is simple: You are a Time Traveler whose goal is to kill Hitler. It is intentionally comedic and may be best to give the game a style to political cartoons of the period. Cool thing is the player can pick different points in time to travel to throughout Hitlers life or before (maybe even a few reasons to go to after.)\n\nUnfortunately it turns out it is not so easy to kill Hitler, as the game turns into something of a hybrid of Majora's Mask meets the boardgame [""Kill Dr. Lucky""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Doctor_Lucky) meets Dr. Who (which happens to have a similar themed episode.)\n\nBy default there is not a single time or place you can kill Hitler right of the bat. If it isn't due to arm guards, it is due to strange coincidences. Going straight for the kill has Wile E. Coyote like results for you.\n\nWhat the player needs to do is create opportunities, by changing event in Hitlers life and things surrounding it.\n\nCame up with this idea for a game while I was playing Stanley Parable and was watching Danger 5 (Running gag/plot of the show is to Kill Hitler. Also thought back on an old [Subnormality comic](http://www.neverenoughworlds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/obersalzberg.jpg) Made me think of a decision making game where everything feels like it working against you. But it is possible to accomplish your goal and that is the carrot on the stick that keeps you trying."
30t8d5,Bag Packing Game,"The idea. You are a bag packer in a supermarket. You work with a bossy, really annoying guy who thinks he's 10 times better than you because he actually serves the customers, whereas you just pack bags. The aim of the game over various levels of increasing difficulty, is to pack people's shopping. There's a kind of Tetris style, fitting items in together way things work as well as a realistic, don't put heavy things on top of eggs way. You get scored on how quickly and how efficiently you pack the bags. If you're too slow, customers will get fed up and complain, lowering your score for that level. If you do well, you proceed to the next level where things get harder and so on. \n\nAlongside this, is a simple narrative of wanting to beat your co worker. Of wanting to move on and become a server yourself. The game would have a small amount of levels in the story mode but I also imagine there would be an endless/frantic mode where things become fast paced and ends only when you can't serve no more. "
30rury,"A post apoc. genre taking place in a population dense city (tokyo, new york, etc.)",It seems generic/bland but hear me out. I like the Last of Us approach to infected humans mixed with little clans of survivors just simply trying to survive. Mix that in with a massive environment of a population dense city making every single building that exists accessible such as every floor on skyscrapers and such. Now storyline wise not sure but I think the level of skill and patience of scavenging through an infected/infested  skyscraper would be high plus the fact that the city would have millions of people would just make the experience a lot more challenging and fun.
30o73n,Squatch Watch,"My idea for a game is to have a game where you assume the role of a Sasquatch. It would sorta be in the vein of destroy all humans.\n\nI will outline the gameplay:\n-3rd person\n-mainly forest areas\n-each level's goal is to capture humans without being photographed\n-if you are photographed, there will consequently be more squatch hunters in the arena actively looking to kill you\n-you will have abilites such as climbing trees, a phase ability to fade into the near invisibility for a time, a screech ability that would stun all humans within a certain vicinity at the cost of revealing your position, calling other squatchs to help you, night vision, sprint, setting traps, \n-player is able to capture humans by attacking them up close or setting up rudimentary traps\n- control scheme would be similar to metal gear but with more freedom- leaping, sprinting\n-each level brings you closer and closer to civilization. The game will progressively get harder but how much harder depends on how often you are spotted/photographed\n-the ultimate goal is to wipe out manking and become the next apex predator. Perhaps having the last few levels actually take place within a city or town  "

30l28l,Platformer RPG with branching storyline and co-op elements.,"**Name:** Arbitrium\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* 2D platformer where the one objective is that you live, no matter what side you take, good or bad.\n\n**Map:**\nThis is the starting area http://imgur.com/oDGpxqE\n\n**Plot:**\nDisclaimer: I'm no story writer.\nYou wake up in your house, midnight, feeling hot. Sleepy and sweaty you open your eyes to see something bright... It's fire! Your house is on fire! But how?!? You hear sword slashes and you realize your village is being attacked! &lt;look at map&gt; Bad village(named Monus) attacks good village(named Salus) because &lt;insert reason here&gt;. You take your sword and shield/ longsword/ wand/ bow (depends on what class you chose at the start) and go outside. You are met with heavily armored knights, backed by skilled archers behind them. You can take one or two with your skills, but that's all, and you will eventually be overwhelmed (That is, if you decide to fight them) (story branch 1). Instead of fighting, you decide to go down the mines, hoping they won't find you. You find out you are not the only one that has went down the mines. You are met with several miners, a farmer and a weaponsmith. You can hear the enemies coming down the mine! The are only two things you can do: Fight them and depending if you win(story branch 2) or not (story branch 1) or collapse the mine behind you, leaving you safe, but waiting to be suffocated (story branch 3).\n\n* Story branch 1 - You are taken as a slave and brought back to Monus. There, you must fight for your freedom. There is a tournament, where slaves fight each other and the winner gets freedom. After that, you can serve Monus and help them kill all villagers from Salus(story branch 1.1), or you can turn against it and find your fellow villagers from Salus and help them defeat Monus(story branch 1.2)!\n* Story branch 2 - You have succesfully stopped the attack, now you must prepare, because a bigger army is coming your way! Build defenses and defend yourself! If you win you will start an attack agains Monus (story branch 1.2) or if you lose you can get slaved(story branch 1) or go down the mines(story branch 3)\n* Story branch 3 - You are in a hole. There is no way out, so the only thing you can do is dig. Luckily there are pickaxes down and you start digging forward. You hope that you can get past the mountain and on the other side... but you know that is unlikely... Suddenly when digging, you find yourself in a huge closed but lighted area! What is this? There is even grass and trees!? Did you make it to the other side of the mountain? It can't be. It turns out this mountain&lt;insert name here&gt; is hollow and on it's top it's opened, so it lets light through. There is even a river in here, which cave from underground waters. You start to build a village there but find out that the bad guys have been digging through the mines! You must defend yourself once again! Uh, enough writing for today, If you like this idea I can continue it. I'm a programmer and can make this game happen, but don't have an artist.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Defender\n\n* Fighter\n\n* Mage\n\n* Hunter\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Inventory - tile-based diablo style\n\n* Combat - real time\n\n* Gathering materials - berry gathering ,chopping wood, mining (these can be neccesary in some story branches)\n\n* Farming - Not sure about this one\n\n* Building - Will be neccesary in story branch 3\n\n* Crafting weapons and spells\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n* Windows, Mac\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n \n* Playstation, Xbox\n"

30hxr2,Treknobabble,"In almost every Star Trek episode (TNG, Voyager), there are apparently physics puzzles that need to be solved by Engineering/the Captain.\n\nIn Treknobabble you are a lowly engineer, climbing your way up to Engineering Officer, by solving those puzzles. You will not be the captain (like in so many other spaceship games), but rather be following the captain's orders. Your ship may be in battle with an enemy, but all you will be doing is your job.\n\nThese will vary and start from little minigames:\n\n* you have to ""modulate your (shield/phaser/whatever) frequency"" to match that of an enemy, \n* trying to keep a transporter lock on someone or something while it's being distorted/blocked by something, \n* reroute energy through the ship's circuits without overloading them\n* Keep the Warp-Core online under extreme duress, like a damaged ship, energy fields, etc\n\nAnd eventually even solve puzzles that act according to a consistent imaginary-physics-structure, that allows for non-linear and creative solutions (this is the hard part). Even the developer couldn't predict that a modulated tachyon beam infused with baryon particles would break the stability of a certain spacetime anomaly.\n\nAll UI is, of course, done in the typical Star Trek LCARS UI."
355iq8,A Horror game based off of staying up late to study for an exam,"The basic idea is that you are up studying late for an exam while everyone is asleep. However, as the night wears on, things begin to seem a little off; the clock goes backwards, strange writings appear on your study guide while you're not looking, your textbook doesn't say what you think it said earlier in the night. These occurrences culminate to the player's realization that the subject of the exam is much more than what it first seemed...\nThe player might ""study"" while taking periodic breaks to drink coffee or energy drinks to keep from falling asleep. The textbook's pages will change, so much of the gameplay is centered around reading the textbook, study guides, etc.. However, when the player falls asleep, they enter a dream-world version of the real world that is haunted by strange monsters, and the player must find and drink enough coffee or energy drinks to get out of the dream. However, some areas may only be accessible in the dream."
354qak,Planet C,"**Concept overview**:\nFPS-style multiplayer ""shooter"". Members of enemy forces crash land on an exoplanet. There are specialized minerals found on the surface of an exoplanet, each with a unique property and may be primarily offensive-type (including weapon ammo), defensive-type, mixed-type or buffs. \n\n**Plot**:\nA war is raging between two dominant species (names of races TBD). During a battle over territory, two crew members (or more) crash-land on planet X after landing fatal blows to each other's space-crafts. Planet X is a vibrant world, filled with peaceful and hostile oxygen-based life. Planet X also has a day-night cycle (hostiles, friendlies change depending on time). Players will awake from crash weaponless with intact heat-detecting radar mini display, shield, and one goal: finish the mission you failed above the atmosphere --&gt; kill the enemy!\n\nPlayers must scavenge the environment for weapons and buffs which come in the form of minerals/crystals, each with a unique characteristic. Minerals, when found, are equipped to buttons and are either consumable (one-time use), have effects that are timed, and others may have limited ""ammo"". Minerals may be:\n\n* **Offensive** - may fire beam/projectiles when exposed to light/dark. May be explosive when thrown. May release corrosive or cryo cloud when thrown/shatters.  Proximity bomb (cryo, corrosive, incendiary, rapid-growing crystals that cause non-elemental damage  etc.). Elongate crystals can be used as melee weapons. \n\n* **Defensive** - variety of radius-of-effect abilities which may include draining enemy shields, anti-projectile/explosive forcefield, thrown singularity (pulls enemy and hostile exospecies if present). Active camouflage. \n\n* **Buffs** variety of status effects that are advantageous to the player or disadvantageous to the enemy. \n*For player*: Would mostly be ""consumables"", i.e. one-time use minerals. Focus (enhanced range accuracy). Overshield. Scent masking (very good for highly hostile areas). \n*Against enemy*: Sticks to enemy to aggro hostiles in area. Sticks to enemy and empties shield for a set time period. Etc.\n\n**Characters**:\nCharacter choice is mostly an aesthetic choice. Possible race advantages (speed, strength, etc.)\n\n**Game mechanics**:\nFPS-style shooter. Minerals map to buttons (e.g. triangle, circle, square, R3, etc. X would likely be Jump/drift). Mini-radar will display location of enemy and large mineral deposits. Imagining it on the PS3 but PC would be great too.\n\nMore recently I've been unsure as to whether players should be given an adaptable rifle, capable of being loaded with certain crystals from the planet. Compatible offensive crystals could be mapped onto the rifle, and the rounds would then carry its dominant trait. \n\n**Standout Features**:\nCompletely customizable weapon/defense system. Constantly evolving gameplay. Hostiles make for interesting gameplay even when searching for the opponent.\n\n**Bonus Features**:\nWould love to see a Mark system (like in FF12) where the player would be rewarded for seeking out powerful hostiles.\n\nLevel system would be nice, but is complicated I realized.\n\nPerhaps rare crystals that can be equipped to shield, etc. to add a bonus effect....\n______________\nWould be very cool is all :) If it happens, just throw my name in the credits.\n"
352f8f,A horror game based off of the experience of taking an exam,"The player starts out sitting at a desk in a classroom full of other students taking a final exam. On the desk is a sheet of paper and a scantron. The player begins taking the test, and the questions start out as typical questions from, say, a physiology test, but quickly change to more personal questions, e.g., ""What did you have for breakfast today?"" or ""Where do you live?"". These questions grow more and more disturbing as the player's story is fleshed out through these questions, as painful past experiences are vividly fleshed out in playable ""hallucinations"" which are interspersed throughout the multiple choice questions. At the end, the player looks up from the exam; time stands still as the player gets up, rushes out of the testing room, and runs down the hallways of the building, which seem to be endless, as a darkness chases the player down the hallway. The player reaches the end of the hallway; the darkness closes in; the player confronts his/her fear of uncertainty and jumps into the darkness."
351v2j,Spy Agency Game idea,"I have been looking all day and can't find a game that matches my idea.\n\nThe game would have a similar interface to games like Uplink, DEFFCON, Superpower but instead of a hacking , nuclear war or world simulator it would mainly focus on all 3 as well as being the head of a spy agency being able to control sleeper cells and operations from all around the world.\n\nYou'd be able to start operations in different places and determinate if they're a threat then take action via authorization to hack or even lunch nuclear weapons at them. It would hardly have any animations like uplink and simply have a world map where objectives, locations and operations are marked. Most of the game would be text based and involve short bursts of reading operation details or information regarding what has been found.\n\nOkay so a quick example simplified version of mission idea would have countless endings.\n\n* Send sleeper agent and decide their job or desired relationship to the target.\n* Agent sends you information whenever they can get some time to and you gather information on the target which is asymptomatically added to their file. Information like Smoker, slow, their job, easy to manipulate and/or drives a certain car. This information will help you plan your future action.\n* You'd then over time get issues the agent is having and you have to tell the agent how to solve it. with such actions like ""agree and continue with objectives, burn your identity and remove yourself and/or kill the target and remove yourself from their life."" \n* If you continue with the mission then at a certain point you'd get enough information to carry out your objective which could be to farther information or kill someone close to them. \n* The sleeper agent would then announce he's completed the objective and that he requests new orders. Which could be to remain at their post and create a new objective around the target, move to a new operation elsewhere and create a new identity and/or come home to your life and await his next operation. \n\nThe missions would be open ended and allow any outcome since the only fail state would be that you've failed too many operations and/or used your powers to break laws for your own gain. The end of the game would simply allow you to reload a load or restart with a new game save. \n\n\nNow to talk about menus the game would contain.\n\n* Target and agent files which will contain names, relations, habits. dates of birth and laws broken. Agent files would be heavier classified.\n* Current active operations and agents.\n* Political menus to help you sway congressperson votes in your favour.\n* War menus with actions to help you like the nuclear authorization window or a button to deplry black ops or troops at a location.\n* Agent action popup windows.\n* Many more.\n\n\nThe game would be in real time and would have no pause function. Missions could last weeks and this would mean you could have lots of operations running at once and still being able to manage them fairly well. \n\nYou'd have to manage agent and target relationships closely because if they get too close then your agent may deny to perform their objectives or cut all ties with you. \n\nPlease ask any information you'd like to know more about and if you know a game that at least does one of these things then please let me know. I may add more information later on but I didn't want to make this post too long with too much information."
34zywo,Waltshire Mansion 'Recollection',"Hey guys, and welcome to our forum post for our new game idea called **The Waltshire Mansion ‘Recollection’** the Paper Version!\n\n\nThis game is only act as the first step before progression, but we want to see if it’s acceptable to the public first, and if people want to play it.\n\nOur aim of the game is to *make a story in Recollection* to be shared between two different media platforms, to make players use two media outages to make them find out the story, or should I present, the TRUE Story! Now this is all on paper so far, so the game may not look appealing to be a starter. But once our team gets out of University hopefully in the future the team can discuss a way to actually start making the game.\n \n\nCurrently we have a 4 man team. One's an artist, who does hand-drawn images for the game. Another is a writer, and that's me, and I inspect how you GUYS provide feedback for the game. The other tow, I'm not too sure. One literally is a ghost hunter and he's always away, the other I'm not too sure if he exist at all. We come in contact through emails and such, hardly any Skype call which could be bad for our game progress :(. \n\n\n&gt;‘This game is not based on any tragic stories, any real people, any real events, and any real super-natural-beings chasing you trying to get you for some revenge, etc etc. It also does not include 'one-of-our-members' breaking in a abandon house, which might not had its title based on, which also might exist. Cheereo!’\n\n\n\n**Story so far...**\n\n&gt;You awake from a nightmare... you have no recollection of who or where you are. You run for the doors of the – what is this place, a huge house? – but the doors won't open. It's almost like something is holding it shut. You run at the windows, but no matter how much you hit them, they won't break.\n\n\n&gt;What is that presence you feel? It's almost like something is watching you... constantly... just waiting for you to make a wrong move.\n\n\n&gt;It's time to find out just where you are and how you got here. But how do you do that? To do that, you might need to unlock the secrets within this house, some things that are terrible and meant to be kept secret, but what choice do you have?\n&gt;Collect hints and materials that you find on your way in the mansion. Find out the truth behind the mansion and make an escape from this eerie place. You will find help, but you will also find enemies. There are plenty of opportunities, puzzles and hints to find out who you are, and what this Mansion is!\n\n\n\n**Link:**\n\n* We have an Artist helping with us to make Concept Designs.

34zm7h,Dragon ARPG/Exploration,"I am completely dumbfounded by the lack of games where you can play as a Dragon.  The vision I have does not exist, and it seems like one of the most obvious tracks for a game to take given that almost every RPG ever made features Dragons in some way.\n\nMy idea here is a Diablo 3 style combat (at least skillswise), Zelda type progression and loot, Dark Souls type world.  Basically you would start as a small dragon and get more powerful as you went through the worlds dungeons and explored to find secrets.\n\nYou can even have different types of Dragons - Water Dragon could be a multi-head Hydra, then a Undead/Skeleton Dragon necro, traditional Fire Dragon, Maybe a Heavy Melee ""Drake"" or ""Wurm"".  You could build your own lair, collect gold and level up your ""horde"" (maybe this unlocks talents, or paragon levels or something else entirely).  Add in a solid story line and you have every nerds dream game.\n\nIt blows my mind this has not been made - the freaking game practically makes itself.  What gives?"
34wick,Several Video Game Ideas Here,
34vi8n,An actually good boxing game of PC,"EA doesn't release boxing games for PC. I don't want to buy an xbox just to play fight night champion. I can't get emulators to work or find any good guides so forget that for now. That ""Real Boxing"" game on steam is complete trash. I just want a boxing game."
34uxtf,True Fall,"This game is like a saints row 2/1 game. It will be based in modern times and it will have a character creater. Let's start with the main story/campaign. So the story is, your character has been arrested for robbing a bank.  You get sent to jail and have to try break out. Once you are out you meet with some people you used to be enemies with and have to try make a team with them because a larger army of people called the TFE (True Fall Enterprieses) are coming to the country your in. They come every year and they find every prisoner they can and put them in a highly guarded prison under the ocean. Your team have to fight back against them, and to do this you need more crew members and more publicity to get noticed by other crews. To do this you need to create havoc by anyway possible, you can break into prisons and save prisoners or you can create a giant explosion or rob banks. It's your choice. That's part of the free roam. The missions include non scripted robberys to crew takeovers to complete city takeovers. The owner of the crew you got into when you broke out at first seemed like a bit of a douche but once you got to know him more by the main story he came out more friendly and you both could trust each other, this gives you a feel of character progression. In the free world you can do pretty much anything, rob banks, raid stores, steal planes, own a buissness. Pretty much anything. You can also buy new flats and apartments. Then there's the multiplayer. Firstly you get the free roam multiplayer but then there are gamemodes like ""Defend the Boss"" (BtB) in this a player in each team would be called ""the boss"" any the team has to defend you using vehicles and guns and traps. You could go in the car with him and drive around the city, or you could get him into a house and you can protect all doors and windows. But at the same time you have to try kill there boss as well, this requires a lot of team coordination. That's just the begining of my idea thanks for reading"
34smx5,World War Sea,"It'd be a bit like Call of Duty, but with something like Banjo-Tooie's first person submarine controls. You can choose between Dolphins and Whales, Dolphins being fast and weak, and Whales being slow and strong. Dolphins have comically large guns that shoot Sea Urchins, and Whales have tiny guns that shoot Squids. The two species would be split into teams of 4-8 and face off in an aquarium.\n\n\nAlso there'd be a single player campaign with Octo-Nazis."
34raas,My crazy MMO idea,"I have an idea for an MMO.  It will be a cross of genres between fighting/shooting.  It will feature vehicle combat and structures which mine resources sort of like starcraft.  It also has this thing where like you combine characters and split the controls between multiple players like the megazord from power rangers.\n\nHere's the concept ...(http://pastebin.com/iaEzQTcp)...\n\nHere's the outline ...(http://pastebin.com/XhLekZZC)...\n\nI posted this up before a few days ago, but I rewrote everything and I think its better now and easier to understand."
34ooey,Someone should make a Sim City like Civilization,Sim City (and its identical clone Cities Skylines) is a suck game. It sucks because 40% of your brain has to go to three dimensional city planning (rotating cameras and mouse positioning) and after that stress the game is no fun.\n\nCivilization is all about choices but you have to wage war or prepare for war constantly.\n\nIf someone made a Sim City game where you could focus on choices instead of camera and mouse positions that would give them a lot more room to focus on making the game itself more enjoyable.\n
34nxq5,[Experienced] John Carpenter's Halloween the Game,"I've always wanted to walk through Haddonfield, IL on Halloween night in 1978. The game would begin as the Carpenter's classic did. But how you wanted to begin was up to you. Do you want to be Laurie Strode and have the story begin with you being stalked throughout the day and into the night? Or would you rather be the doctor Samual Loomis and begin to hunt a psycho killer from the moment he escapes Smith's Grove? Or finally, would you like to be Michael Myers as he slashes his way through the night at he searches for his sister? This game would be creepy as hell. No matter which of the three main characters you choose to be - you'll be hunted as you hunt. Obviously with each character comes different strengths and weaknesses. The world should be fully immersive with everything from newspapers you can read , TVs you can watch and car radios that have different channels you can listen to for warnings and clues. I'd also have the game be so immersive that you can completely unravel the Michael Myers mystery. With some new writing from John Carpenter and voice acting from Jamie Lee Curtis - Halloween can be born again for a completely new audience. I assume that there is enough Donald Pleasence audio for his character to also be amazing. The creepiness of Slender Man taken to a whole new level! Survival horror / first person shooter at it's best. I see this game being extremely detailed and atmospheric. No matter who you choose to be - all three characters are in play. Edit: This should be considered an [AAA] title. My apologies."
34mrk8,Ocean (or any) Survival Horror with a certain monster mechanic.,"I have barely any knowledge in programming but this is an idea I came up with for a game. A survival horror game (simple as that) however you don't see the monster hunting you down but it does make noises and dashes far away so you think you just had a glimpse at it but can't recognise it so you are kept alert throughout the entire game. Unlike ""Towards the light"" which makes you think there is a monster when there isn't, there is actually a monster and it can kill you. I think the best way to do is game is by setting the game in the ocean so you can't see the monster from the surface of the ocean but you can just make out it's figure when it charges towards you."

33uvr6,[Request] Something with exploration,"I'm a dev looking for a good idea, preferably top-down (though I could try my hand at a platformer). I love to make games that heavily feature exploration, maybe with a side of procedural generation. I'd love to hear your ideas, if you have any?"
33uaml,My idea for a faction system in games like Empire Earth and Age of Empires.,"This idea is largely based on Empire Earth 2 and 3. Essentially, there are four main factions, the West, the Middle East, the Far East, and the North, each with a completely unique set of units and buildings. Each main faction is divided into several subfactions, each a separate nation from that region with a certain degree of history. If possible, every subfaction would have a unique unit for every era. My idea of the breakdown goes as follows.\n\nWest: British, French, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Iberians.\n\nMiddle East: Turks, Arabs, Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Egyptians, Libyans.\n\nFar East: Indochinese, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Mongols, Siberians.\n\nNorth: Russians, Swedes, Danes, Finns, Baltics, Poles.\n\nIf you disagree with anything or there's something you would like explained, I'm open to discussion."
33tx6v,Boss countdown,I'm making a game and I'm trying to come up with some basic ideas for it. What I came up with could be described as this:\n\nA countdown is constantly ticking down. When it reaches zero a boss will spawn. The player can keep the countdown from reaching zero by killing enemies which extends the countdown for some time. The speed of the countdown will gradually increase. The player also gains points from killing enemies.\n\nIs there any major drawback with this system and is there any other game that utilizes any similar system?\n\nWould really appreciate any feedback!

33snnm,Like SotC with bike riding,"I came up with this while bike riding with SotC music stuck in my head. Basically the concept behind the game is that you're pedaling through a city that's being ravaged by some kind of boss enemy. The game would have a prop/controller- something resembling a stationary workout bike, but more flexible, allowing you to lean and turn, as well as be able to physically distinguish between sloped or rough terrain in the game. It probably also needs some kind of piston/jolt thing for when you run into something.\n\nAs for the game play, each level would consist of the player trying to catch up to and stop some kind of boss. They could range from horse-sized to elephant-sized or maybe even as big as godzilla or king kong or something. As for how the player would actually STOP the boss, I have no clue. As the game progresses, the levels get more difficult as there's more obstacles, flying rubble, slopes, and rougher terrain.\n\nAnd of course, it needs a kick-ass soundtrack. \n\nThing is, the controller prop thing would make it more expensive than rockband, or any other game with a prop controller probably...yikes..."
33s7er,Save the Light,"Light has gone from the universe, and it's up to you to find out why.\nGame starts out almost entirely pitch black, until you remember your cell phone light.  \nFlash! The world illuminates, almost blinding you.  \nAlmost immediately, you cell phone light starts darkening, leaving the room only lightly outlined from far away.  \n\n  I envision Save the Light to be a strategy adventure game where light is a tool, weapon, and limited resource.  \nMid-game, the roles are reversed as Light takes revenge on Dark, leaving the screen blindingly white. Story moves towards an understanding that both Light and Dark have roles to play.  \n  \n  During Dark, story characters are affected by a sense of hopeless despair and become very destructive. During Light, Characters become  giddy with mania, over optimistically attempting to achieve their wildest dreams.   \nScattered around are various objects that produce light (later darkness) but only last so long and with so much effectiveness. Obtaining and properly rationing Light will allow players to view and unlock marvelous storytelling elements in addition to optional side quests.  \nOne possible way to ration light would be Flash and ""feel"" you way through the room with surround sound. Game controller would have vibrations to correspond left right or front."

33pfqm,Space Pirate Turn Based Strategy/Base-Builder,"An idea I had a long while ago, re-thought out and overall I think its much improved :)\nName: Undecided\n\nConcept:\nThe concept is you are the owner of an illegal asteroid base and are looking to make your fame/fortune/both. You're going to do this by building up your base, attracting skilled workers/raiders and by stealing basically anything you can get your hands on. All the while you'll need to fend off police and opposing pirate crews who want to take your hard earned booty.\n\nSetting:\nThe game will revolve around your asteroid, which will act as the central hub for all of your activities (discussed later). You will have set docking areas and all base building will be done inside the asteroid by mining out tiles and building rooms with various functions (think Dungeon Keeper, where the size of the asteroid limits the size of your base). In a larger scale you will be a part of a solar system with several planets inhabited by different civilized interplanetary races and other asteroids. Each planet and asteroid could have an orbital path and different speeds, which will lead to natural opportunities as you pass close to targets and a dynamic map/interaction system.\n\nMechanics:\n\nBase Constructing:\nAs mentioned, the base will be created in a similar style to dungeon keeper, by mining out tiles of a set shape and size and then creating rooms out the the hollowed out areas. Some rooms will be vital (you need somewhere for your crew to eat and sleep, and somewhere to store your loot) while for others the player can decide for themselves. Each room will have a function, but will also attract certain minions. The types of rooms you make, the size of those rooms and possibly other factors (perhaps your fame, total wealth, or already having an 'opposite' unit) will attract minions of various types and with different abilities.\n\nMinions:\nOf these minions some will be workers, some will be raiders. Workers will keep your base running by mining out new areas, healing your crew, researching new buildings and creating powerful defense systems. When someone comes after them with a gun however, they will be all but helpless(combat discussed later). Raiders don't do anything to directly help support your base, but they are your main fighters and the primary way the player can amass wealth. They can be sent on missions to raid passing ships, asteroid bases and planets and bring the loot back to base. Raiders could be equipped with different weapons and gadgets which would allow the raider to make more special actions during combat. Players will need both workers and Raiders to succeed.\n\nCombat:\nCombat is the the other main part of the game. I would hope for a turn based combat system similar to XCom, where the player controls a group of units with an overhead view of the map. Players may enter combat by choosing to raid a target, or the player themselves may be attacked by enemies. in either case players would be able to control raider units during a combat, worker units would flee for cover and generally panic. The combat would be resolved either when all of one sides raiders have left the battlefield either by opting to leave with the loot they have or by being killed (if all the player's raiders die when an enemy is assaulting their base, the player loses the game). Minions may move, make either a ranged or melee attack, use a special ability  or mount a turret or other defense structure. I would also hope for certain contextual actions to be present too (eg, move onto an enemy space to grapple them and gain a unique effect like throwing them to another square, or having 2 minions on one side of a door would allow for a breach maneuver into a room).\n\nThis combat will lead players to think carefully about how they design rooms and their base as a whole. They could hamper the effectiveness of the room to put down a sentry gun, making for some interesting choices. I think it would also be fun to see some real fights going on where your minions react to the terrain of the room (ducking for cover behind a medical bed/canteen table, holding off enemies from getting to your workers hiding in the Barracks etc)\n\nOther Mechanics:\nI had an Idea for gaining heat for the missions you do. Each time you raid a ship, planet or station of a civilized race, you would gain heat with that race. You would gain more heat the more turns you took to complete the mission. When the heat bar for any race was filled they would launch a large attack at your base after a short time. Management of heat could be done by attacking a variety of targets, by using certain heat-reducing minions on the raid or by paying to use bribes, jamming tools or something similar to lower your heat with a faction. Of course the player can always just go loud and prepare for a large attack.\n\nI also had an idea where rather than steal wealth directly the players would steal different kinds of resources such as weapons, computers, luxuries, Metals etc and store them. There would be a black market that would allow the players to convert resources to wealth or vice versa. The rates that these go for would change over the course of the game, so players may choose to hold onto that stash of weapons they just stole, wait for a war to break out and watch the price of weapons skyrocket. It provides in depth resource management\n\nI'm sure there is a whole load of backstory to come up with on the alien races or the politics of why some races don't like others and why specific technology turned out like it did. I'd rather see what people come up with themselves based on the idea. The only thing I'd note is that I'd want things like teleporters, personal shields and high power lasers to be available in game.\n\nI can see this working well on PC but also potentially on Tablets (though the game might need to lose a few features in the case of the latter)\n\nThat's pretty much the idea! Sorry for the wall of text, I've had a long time to think about this game. I've always like DK but the combat left something to be desired IMO. I think this system would be fun, and involve the player a whole lot more. Let me know what you think!\n"

33hxk1,Public domain theme for a Smash Bros. clone?,"I've been thinking about ideas for a Smash Bros. clone, but I don't want to use licensed characters (Project M is facing some major hurdles because of that). However, I do want some sort of theme for the world and its characters, something that can spark player imaginations and get them speculating about future character additions. Some ideas I have are regional mythologies/legends (Norse mythology, Egyptian mythology, etc.), literary classics (Frankenstein, The Odyssey), and cryptozoology (Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, Chupacabra, etc.) I would like to get some outside input, though; some fresh ideas. Thanks in advance."
33h26f,Survival horror multiplayer game,"I've had this idea for quite sometime and thought it was interesting enough to draw people in. So if anyone can pull it off go for it.\n\n\nFirst person shooter, would work as a mod, the media would rip this game as a murder simulator, but I think people would love it.\n\nThere is one murder outside, he has a knife at first when you gain levels from playing you can upgrade to machete, axe, pitchfork, etc and you must kill the other 4 players by any means possible before they die, contact the police, or escape. The murder will be able to shut off the power, phone line, internet, cut the car brakes or destroy the battery to prevent the other team from escaping. \n\n\nNow the players who are trying to escape or kill the killers start out with something different. One gets a flashlight, one gets a butchers knife, the other gets keys to different areas of the house, and the last a medical kit. You'll have to scrounge up items that are throughout the house, but each new game randomly changes the items positions. Players will be able to lock all doors, hide in just about all spaces that would be possible in reality like the bed, closet, in a pantry.\n\n\nI thought the idea of a gun safe was cool, but the players don't have the combination and it's placed in a random and difficult spot to find. The killer or survivor could access the safe, it's just a race for the combination.\n\n\nThinking possibly different game types, but the main to come to mind is 4v1 with one life, the murderer takes more hits just because they are alone. Could also see group of killers like 8v4 or 2v5, I want the survivors to always be outnumbered like in the movies, but make it all balanced. \n\n\nSurvivor and murderer customization, just to make each match seem fresh and not the same ole killer each time. Along with a map editing create your own neighborhood and house layout.\n\n\nThis is all unlikely and my skills are non existent, but if a group with skill tackled this and did it right if it's possible I could see it blowing up and becoming it's on standalone after a mod. I just know it's easier to say a bad ass idea than creating one from nothing.\n\n\nFeel free to throw any ideas you have."

33c7iv,Platformer with permanent consequences.,"Here's an idea that I've had for ages and I'd love to get input on.\n\n**Name:** No name as of yet\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nThe general idea of this game is for it to be much like [Trine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trine_%28video_game%29) or [The Cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cave_%28video_game%29), where you have several characters with different abilities, stuck in one body. The key difference would be a permanent consequences mechanic. More precisely, when one of your character takes damage or dies, this is permanent. There are no save points, and you can't save the game whenever you please. (think of the autosave mode in Mount and Blade: Warband).\n\n**Plot, setting and characters:**\n\nThe story starts as the respective characters suddenly wake up in the same body in an eerie building (possibly a school) that somehow feels slightly off. After the voices have settled down a bit,and you've cleared some obstacles, you'll get to a gap that seems too wide to clear. One character mentions that he could easily jump over that. When you switch to him and try to jump over it, he fails, falls down and falls dead on the floor with a featureless figure standing where he would have stood had he survived. You are now controlling this figure, if you try to switch to another character, this still work, you can't get back to the featureless character though.\n\nFrom then on, you encounter more obstacles and the characters start talking to each other. The environment seems to trigger certain memories for them and some of them seem to have led strangely similar lives. Occasionally, the setting changes quite drastically (for instance from a school to a workplace). It seems that each setting resonates especially well with a certain character.\n\nThrough the conversation, it becomes slowly becomes apparent that the characters are separate personalities of a person with dissociative personality disorder. The clue of the game is that it is a physical representation of a person who has created multiple personalities to deal with different types of problems, going through therapy. The therapist is trying to show the person that his characters can't solve all problems that are thrown at them.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nMost of the gameplay consists of platforming, perhaps with some enemies, that serve more as puzzle elements than they do as actual enemies. Each puzzle has several ways of solving it, some more difficult than others. The puzzles get chosen semi dynamically based on which characters are still available, so an impossible puzzle is never presented.\n\nEach level corresponds to a situation where the person created a certain personality and in this level, that personality will be especially useful (gets through puzzles more easily, can get some bonus content). This personality will also have the most interesting things to say triggered by the environment.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nSeems to fit XBox, PS and PC equally well.\n\n**Credit:**\n\nIf you generated any ideas reading this or want to make this game, awesome, go ahead and don't worry about credit. I'd like to know though, because I'd love to get involved."
33bmvs,Looking for FPS game ideas,Hello I am an indie developer looking for some ideas for an FPS game. Anyone have any ideas?
33bjwy,A turn-based political battle game,"The idea is this; you get to choose which five political leaders (worldwide) for your team. They engage in battle with other political teams. Multiplayer or versus computer generated teams. \n\nQualities of the political leaders:\n-physical strength \n-weaponry \n-intelligence (higher will show the player more of opponent's stats)\n-charisma (more charisma make opponent's attacks weaker)\n-selfish (has access to weapons that hurt all on the field) vs selfless (heals team members, does not inflict damage on own team)\n\nBattle Modes:\n-certain time period (only people alive in this time period can be used)\n-no weapons allowed \n-each team must draw from one country's pool of leaders\n\nThe qualities of the political leaders would be based on the real life people! For example, Kim Jong-Un would be a selfish type but he would also have access to advanced weaponry. George Washington would be physically strong and be selfless but have no access to tasers or bulletproof vests. Cleopatra would have high intelligence and charisma!\n\nI think this game would be incredibly fun and be a great way to teach kids / people about history! \n"

338ods,Post-Nuclear Tank Combat RPG,"First thing, I'll admit that I'm just posting this because I love Battletanx and would love to see some kind of game with a similar idea.  I hope this isn't too much a ""blatant copy"" and if it is then please go ahead and delete this post.     \n    \nName: Post-Nuclear Tank Combat\n     \nConcept Overview:  Post-Nuclear Tank Combat (obviously).  I was thinking a RPG tank game in a post-nuclear wasteland.  Basically a mash-up of Battletanx and Seek and Destroy.\n\nPlot/Setting:  Cold war gone hot. USSR has overwhelmed NATO forces and large tank battle span across fronts in America and Europe.  With defeat inevitable, NATO resorts nuclear war. Tactical nukes are used on the front lines causing massive casualties to invading armies and ICBM's are launched towards Soviet territories. USSR retaliates, destroying many NATO cities as well.  Once the initial nuclear assault is over, the world as we know it is officially destroyed.  Remaining military forces and civilians form factions to retake the land and survive. In an effort for superiority, factions salvage and repair abandoned and destroyed combat vehicles.  The resulting vehicles are barely working, with mismatched parts, and an interesting spread of conventional and improvised weapons.  Aviation is impossible due to nuclear winter and a lack of suitable aircraft, pilots, and airbases; expensive and complicated anti-tank missile systems are almost impossible to manufacture.  The result is large tank battles taking place across scorched fields and crumbling cities.\n    \n\nGameplay Mechanics:  I was thinking the combat would be mostly  arcade, but with some more realistic mechanics.  Some realistic mechanics might include ricochet, de-tracking, gun disabling.  If you meet a particularly large tank that you can't penetrate you may have to detrack and flank rather than just keep hammering his HP down.    \n\nStandout Features:  From mission to mission you could collect salvage to upgrade your tank.  A large assortment of salvaged weapons and armor could allow you to tailor your vehicle to your liking. (for example: want more armor? weld salvaged metal plates or rare reactive armor. Want a more guns? Why not add salvaged rocket pods from an attack helicopter, or maybe add an additional cannon)    I know it's a bit of a cheap ""standout feature"" but I have yet to see a game use vehicles with a large amount of customization since the aforementioned Seek and Destroy.\n   \nHow To Credit You:  Just add ""Special thanks to this one guy on reddit that kind of helped us with the idea"" in small text at the end of the credits."
338968,Extraction: A deep neural network based robot-fighting game,"**Name:** Extraction\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nSome years ago I played this tech-demonstration called [N.E.R.O.](http://nerogame.org/), or ""Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives"". You had a team of robots that you could train against other robots or turrets. You would set different sliders to punish or reward their behavior.\n\nHowever, this program was very crude and would close randomly on me. So I thought about **Extraction**. Learning AI is mostly unused in gaming because it would get frustrating for most human players if the AI would become too good. But what if the human would cooperate with the AI to achieve a goal?\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou are a specialist for guiding and aiding your Extraction-Team, which consist of robot-soldiers, in the fight against anti-tech radicals who take hostages. \n\n**Setting:**\n\nIt's 2022. The development of robotics experienced a row of breakthroughs. With a change in society, a change in military followed. Most western states today use robots for military purposes.  \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nLet's say you try to guide your AI team to free hostages. At the beginning, they walk around randomly, but by rewarding or punishing things like ""Approaching"", ""Accuracy"" or ""Staying together"" the robots slowly start to adapt. This way, you could have different combinations of behavior. To have more interaction with the game, you could place pointers and reward ""going to the pointer"". Maybe ""spell-like"" skills to change the environment.\n\nEnemies? I'm thinking of non-learning fixed AI NPCs. Maybe have the bosses learning and make them appear again from time to time. You would fight human radicals with robots, so that seems a bit unethical and provocative but why not?

2z2aio,Veangethon: A Creative Way To Test and Torture Friends,"This game is inspired by a creation on Roblox, something I used to play. It's pretty simple but I think the idea is really cool. Basically, you choose a setting (Desert, Rainforest, Ocean, City, Medieval Village and Mountains are just a sample of what could be in there) and then alter the world or possibly add or remove things to and from it in order to start a apocalypse that players could try to survive. The player who survives the longest would get the most points. The things you add and remove don't have to be realistic (but if it makes the game better, then they should be). Start classic destruction with tsunami's and earthquakes, attempt to drown everyone in cheese, build a army of necromancers, get rid of all oxegen, the possibilities are endless!!!!! I would appreciate feedback on this and players could use everything at their disposal to survive. They wouldn't get unrealistic abilities or weapons unless the type of apocalypse is that crazy. Maybe there could be a crafting system and a sort of Endless Mode where the god sends numerous apocalypses after the players with short intervals between each one. Players can kill each other or work together, form alliances, gain tools, be a backstabber, you name it. However, the creator can make it so teamwork is required and refusing to cooperate or help people would take away points from your overall score. It is 3D"

2z02cr,"Idea for a vaccum in an FPS. Weird, eh?","Disclaimer: This is a mechanic, not a full blown game.\n\nSo, I was browsing Imgur, and came across this post: [Le Post](http://imgur.com/gallery/F8g5KF5), and in the comments section a comment said 'Vacuuming up land-mines'.\n\nAlmost instantly I thought of an idea where an engineer in a comical FPS (with a class or weapon on the other team having the ability to place and arm land mines) had a mine-sweeping vacuum cleaner, which sucked up landmines with right-click (though you'd barely be able to see the mines), and then it shot them out with left-click. It would have a maximum of 10 landmines, and on the 11th, the mine would detonate in a HUGE explosion(possibly the size of 10 landmine explosions), killing any enemy in a 15m radius. Alt fire (not right-click) would also detonate all the landmines you have, with the force of how many landmines you have.\n\nAnother point, when you are 'vacuuming', you should walk about as slow as a heavy from TF2, whilst he is spinning his default Mini-gun.\n\nSo, that is my idea for a comical way of minesweeping. Thank you for reading it, and if it's in a game, TELL ME PLEASE, I'd love to do that ALL DAY LONG."

The year is 2046, humans are exploring beyond their own solar system now, but one ship has disappeared, and you have been sent to explore why. But as you approach, as if going through a curtain, a Earth look alike appears extremely close. You crash into it, and you're the only survivor. This planet was a clone by a supreme alien race who was interested in Earth, but eventually left the planet, causing evolution to take a new path as certain events such as dinosaurs going extinct, didn't happen. There are many reptiles, some looking like Earth's animals, and your goal is to survive, and maybe as a side goal document the new planet. Eventually you'll find the secrets of the alien race and be able to go back home."

The game begins when you choose a manifesto and a belief system (Marxism, Radical Islam, Fundamentalist Christianity, Eco-Terror, Neo-Nazi etc). After that it is a matter of recruiting your followers. At first, you can only go to rather mundane locations like the gym or a knitting class to recruit followers, and you will likely get only 1 or no followers at each place. As you gain followers, you get more money and you can pay to go to better places to recruit more followers as well as start buying weapons and planning attacks. You must be careful how you treat your followers. You can create rules for them, but if the rules are too strict, then they will leave. If the rules are too lenient, they might tell the cops where you are. When you have a certain number of followers, you can split them into cells and plan larger attacks. with enough money, you can also start building bunkers and getting a personal manifesto written. The game is over when you are caught (so don't get caught) or if all your followers leave you because you were too hard on them. "

2yqwtn,Hotline Miami/Pulp Fiction Crossover,"The vibe of Hotline Miami for me has always been kind of similar to Pulp Fiction. Maybe its because it is set in the late eighties and now early nineties in Hotline Miami 2. I just cant help but feel that a Pulp Fiction DLC or side project would do the world such a service. It would be kind of like how the Scott Piglrim vs The World game was one of those rare movie titles that just complimented the movie. I think the best version of a Pulp Fiction game would definitely be in the form of a Hotline Miami-esque game. Obviously the Level Editor is included with HM2, but at the same time I would love to see what Devolver could do with some of the scenes from the movie that someone that just goes out and buys the game will never truly have the ability to do.

2yneg7,Survival game set in Stone Age that advances through Ages.,"Concept Overview:\n We humans have shaped the world as it is today.  Similarly our game would put humans in stone age and challenge them to survive and craft items for survival against wild animals and other human settlements.  At the end of each cycle when humans have invented an important phase of game, game progresses to next generation. This gets them new items to craft, new recipes, new weapons and new AI that are harder and more appropriate for their age in civilization. This goes on until modern age with guns, rocket launchers etc.\n\nTAG: \nLevelup your game.. \n\nTWIST: \n Twist of the plot is when humans have discovered key invention for their age, a catastrophe is struck in and wipes almost the entire age and this in return makes their survival too hard ( right from fiery comets, see floods global warming zombies later and chemical weapons ) and their environment changes to appropriate age ( which changes to animals, settlements and items they find ).\n\nCharacters: \nPlayers will be able to pet animals and use them to carry loads of items( think of it as an additional backpack ) \nand pets vary from donkeys to dogs\wolfs.. So they are both supporting and defensive to the player. \n\nGameplay Mechanics:\nItems, recipes are not made known the player which makes their crafting really hard. \n\nPossible Platforms:\nPC,MAC,LINUX,PS4,XBOX,VR and even on mobile versions\n\nI am planning to turn this into a game.. Please help me with refinements\critiques or anything before i ruin everyone's experience in turning this into a bad game without any alterations  :-P \n\nPS: its like playing all your survivor games in a single game.. And also the environments change according to global warming.. for example we start with glacier kind of environment and the story progresses where the climate gets hotter and radiation starts to kick in slowly.. \n\n\nEDIT1:: I am currently working on the crafting system :-) If you want to help me build this.. let me know i will be glad to take you into the team.. \n\n"
2ym2po,A game idea I had for years.,"I've had this game idea in my head and planned out in my personal journal for years. I just want to hear what others think about it. It's called Cyrus the Shadow, a 2-D action-platformer where, the main focus is, you can switch between backgrounds. You have freedom with your weapon choice, like swords and guns, your style of play, like running through guns blazing or quietly and not getting spotted. It's plays much like a Metroidvania game but the background idea has me hooked. Rooms can have you switching through multiple backgrounds to perform stealth attacks, to dodge enemy fire, to climb on walls, but certain mechanics, like climbing on walls, will deplete a stamina bar. The background idea gives the game a more puzzle-like feel, but with some platforming and action.\nWhat do you think? I would like to hear your thoughts, good or bad. It doesn't matter with me. I'll take any questions and, hopefully, answer them when I can.\nAlso, I have a question. Should the levels be in one big open world, like a Metroidvania, or in separate levels, like Mega Man?"

2yjz9a,Organic Animated Levels for 3D Games,"Its not a game idea directly, but I would find it interesting to have game levels that are completely animated and change their shape during the game.

2yhvzv,Submerged - A Titanic Horror Title,"So to begin, I saw this post on /r/games:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2yfog5/early_sinking_animation_titanic_honor_and_glory/\n\nAfter watching that Unreal Engine 4 gameplay, there was a creepy kind of vibe that came over me. The lights were out in the back of the room, leaving the only source of light and hope to be the staircase and those lights were already threatening to go out. This all kind of reminded me of *Slender: The Arrival*. So then the idea came; what if the Titanic didn't sink because of an iceberg.\n\n11:40pm. After years of training and preparation, you (Edward J. Smith) are at the helm of the RMS Titanic guiding the colossal ship steadily across the frigid waters of the Northern Atlantic Ocean, on time and on course to complete the most impressive transportation achievement to date. Suddenly, there is a shudder shaking the entire ship.\n\nThe hull has been breached.\n\nAll crew were instructed to search for what had been hit, but there was no sign of anything that could have possibly caused the amount of damage. It was almost a *rip* through the steel.\n\nAt 12:03am, the first disappearances begin. Starting with the lower levels bodies are found mutilated, flesh torn from their faces. Fearing bad publicity, the captain instructs the crew to throw these bodies overboard, seeing as the ship had no chance of making it to port with the damage that had been done. Strolling through the hallways, gashes along the wall indicate that something is awry. \n\nThe passengers are not the only thing on the lower decks.\n\nThroughout the rest of the game, your goal as the captain is to simply survive as long as possible and keep a log of the discoveries that might lead to an explanation of what truly caused the Titanic to sink that fateful evening. There is a constant sense of helplessness because there is obviously no chance of anyone making it off of the ship alive, including yourself, but the desire to know the truth and answer the questions of those that will find the remains pushes you forward to answering the question... ""How did this happen?"""

2yffvd,A twist on survival horror,"Survival horror is kind of a stale concept to me.  Most games are generally the same. Human versus monster,  find weapons,  survive,  kill. They are still fun,  but there is not alot of deviation to that layout.  \n\nI would love to see a game where you play as one of a few of the last surviving vampires. The game opens with your crypt/castle /home being raided by a group of hunters.  Now you have to travel the world,  being chased by hunters,  the sun,  garlic, religious artifacts,  trying to locate any other vampires to enlist help and find a new home. There would be health mechanics that would involve feeding to survive,  and maybe they could incorporate a turn mechanism,  to convert some humans,  but doing so involves staying put for an excessive amount of time,  so you can't do it frequently.  I can think of some really cool ways they could incorporate sunlight in to the game to make it truly scary,  and I've always wanted an sh game where normal people were the bad guys!"
2yex5l,Interesting(?) Gamemode,"Well, I've been thinking about this for a while now, but how about a game mode that has 2 teams. One team has a bomb they have to plant, but they don't know where the bomb site is, (same for the other team but they don't have bomb). The job for the team with the bomb is to find the bomb site and plant it (or eliminate all of the enemy team), and the bomb site is randomized every time. The job for the team without the bomb is to also find the bomb site and defuse the bomb, or eliminate all of the other team. "
32hvio,"A FPS game ""Intermediate""","It would be a war game, but you have one life (for each character, you could create as many characters as needed) it would be PvC as I feel PvP would lead to people losing progress so often. \n\nRank progression.\nIt would have a strong push to tactics and high ranked players giving commands to lower rank players. NOt sure how to do that. But for example - A General giving a command to a Captain, who would give commands to a Private. \n\nIts still all in the air in my mind but I'm thinking about it xD "
32eore,"A non-violent, relaxing, multiplayer camping(like with a tent) sim in a large procedurally generated wilderness.","I'm new to this subreddit and this is my first time posting, so please bear with me if I make any formatting mistakes:\n\nSo this is a 3D third-person game, with simple, bright colors. The player can choose between a girl or guy (who happen to be wearing camping gear), and wakes up next to a tent and campfire. They can pack up and start exploring. The player can collect materials to build supplies, but those supplies are not technically required (more on that later).\n\nThe player's character should be easy to customize. Guys and girls are exactly the same in ability, just different in player models. They can express emotions in the form of gestures, which should be exaggerated enough to feel almost cartoony. Players can build tools to collect supplies (e.g. axe for chopping trees, pickaxe to mine rock, the standard stuff).\n\nThe thing about this game is that it is multiplayer and in a vast open wilderness. There are roads players can follow, and occasionally players will bump into each other. They can choose to form a little camping group and can trek through the landscape together, helping each other get supplies and providing company for each other. However, players cannot communicate by chat; the only form of communication possible is gestures (waves, dancing with happiness, facepalming...). Players cannot do any harm to each other or steal supplies but they can disband and go their separate ways. \n\nThere is a day-night cycle and weather system. It can rain, snow, be sunny with blue skies or dark with storm clouds. Rain and storms can influence the player's mood, making them more sad as they stand around in the rain. The worst thing that can happen in this game is that your character becomes depressed. They cannot die, but depressed characters will be extremely lethargic and can only be cheered up by a campfire or another player. \n\nThe in-game world should have a multitude of biomes, like mountains, plains, forests, and the like. The night sky should be full of stars and constellations that can point out the direction to players.\n\nThere is no plot to this game. That might be a weak point, but for a game like this I don't think a plot is necessary. The way you can progress is by collecting materials and crafting things like bigger tents, better fires, and eventually actual buildings. Groups of players can form little towns where people can come and go as they please.\n\nThis game, if made, should be a light-hearted game people could play when feeling down, as there is no death or blood or any guns and violence. It should be a relaxing game, based on exploration with companions and forming relationships with strangers in a game.\n\nThis is not a fully fleshed out idea and if this game is made I would rely on the developer to add changes to this concept. In the unlikely chance it *does* get made preferably just add on my reddit username during the credits. It doesn't have to be anything big.\n\n\n\n"
32egyg,"Mix of Dungeon Keeper, tower defence, voxels and FPS","I'm building voxel-based game and want to come-up with original concept for it. The concept I'm thinking about is a first person game where player should build, manage and defend a dwarf fortress. I already have a concept of voxel-survival game on Steam Concepts: http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=415447426. But I want to find ways to make it more interesting.\n\nFeatures of the new concept are following:\n\n* Player spawns on an island floating in the air. There is flat land as well as mountains on the island. I want to reuse existing engine from my old concept. The link above gives look and feel of the game I'm trying to describe.\n* Player should place the core. This is similar to dungeon heart in Dungeon Keeper. The core also allows to hire dwarfs.\n* The core lures waver of monsters and player's goal is to protect the core\n* Player should build bedrooms, kitchen, workshop and other rooms to keep dwarf community alive (like Dungeon Keeper). Voxels give a full freedom how to organize rooms. This could be fortress, dungeon, tall tower e.t.c.\n* Player can build towers to protect from monsters but each tower should be operated by a dwarf. This way dwarfs will serve a purpose.\n* Dwarfs can't be directly told where to go. This is just impossible from first person view. They should make decisions on their own.\n* Player has a weapon to kill enemies. Dwarfs, on the other hand, can't attack enemies directly. Only by operating towers.\n* Player can dig and build walls, but can't place towers, doors and other objects directly. Player has to order dwarfs to build them. \n* More dwarfs player has more monsters attack the fortress.\n* Monsters will run, climb, dig. So it won't be so easy to block them\n* Game may end when fortress survived certain number of waves or waves may repeat indefinitely.\n* Could be played in coop with friends\n\nI think this idea has better potential than initial concept from the link above for following reasons:\n\n* It looks less like Minecraft clone\n* Game idea is more original\n* Fortress, that player builds, really serves variety of purposes\n* Dwarfs make environment more alive\n* The fact that this is a first person game makes higher immersion into the community player manages compared to classic rts/management games\n* Scope is more realistic for one person to handle\n\nDo you see any issues with the idea? Is this similar to any existing game? Is this worse that voxel-survival concept from the link I provided? Please comment. "

32e872,"Not a idea, just havent been on here in a long time and was like woah at the updates",yeah
32e4b7,A survival game involving territory control that I would do anything to see,"Inspiration for this comes from years of gaming. It started around when I first played Borderlands (the original), and you started out by doing some basic repair jobs to a run-down city in order to open up a few shops. I was inspired again when playing Dead Island, where I was required to do various missions to recover parts or supplies. Then once more, in Craft the World, when fighting off varying groups of enemies that sought to spread their forces, and finally just today when watching an LP of War for the Overworld. I think it's finally time I got this out of my head and put it into words, even if nothing comes of it.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is territory control. You and your team (MMO or player-controlled units, whichever makes the most sense) seek to spread your faction's territory. This could occur naturally (creep) and/or through ""claims"" (War for the Overworld) and/or by building structures upon neutral territory. The idea is that your faction benefits most from fighting on owned territory, and is faced with varying weaknesses when on opposing territory. There would also be neutral creep camps that could be conquered for spoils/territory.\n\nThe factions would be varied and deep; there would be no definitive ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Perhaps there is a forest/nature faction that seeks to fight back against the destruction of their lands. A group of well-intentioned mountain folk who are manipulated by their king into believing their neighbors want to destroy them. Whatever or whoever they may be, there will be no ""angels vs. demons"" type of faction warfare. Just like in real life, each faction will consider themselves to be in the right, and all others to be in the wrong.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself, think of a combination of RTS/Survival-crafting. The closest thing I can think of that comes close to this would be Dwarf Fortress, though there would be much less of an emphasis on building out one area of the map, and instead a focus on conquering as much of the map as your faction can sustain. Another close game would be Wyrm Online, though put at a much faster pace and with less of a focus on the survival of any one individual.\n\nBasic survival-crafting elements such as resource-gathering, crafting, and building out your base will be present. Ideally as your faction grows to larger sizes there will be ways to automate this.\n\nAs an aside, this game grew out of an original Zombie Survival idea I had, basically Dead Island but with the ability to harvest resources and construct buildings, and without the RPG element of weapons that scale with level. I was always frustrated you couldn't expand your walls in that game, and wanted to gather resources to keep my team alive, not just to advance the plot. What if the gasoline you got could be used to make powerful weapons? What if you could tear down abandoned buildings to make a large fortress? What if you could save civilians and recruit them to actually fight zombies? Etc.\n\nFor any who have cared to read through this, I would love to hear your thoughts. I'd be more than happy to explain further on anything."
32ahlh,An idea about Wolves and a struggle for power.,"Okay, i've had this idea now for a few years but never had anyone to really talk to about it aside from close friends and family members, so here it goes.\n\nThe World: The idea I had would revolve around you playing as a white female wolf in an open world enviornment with real time weather changes, and a continuous day and night cycle. Mission locations would be displayed in the sky as bright pillars of light indicating where the player would go next, they would be white and be very large as so the player would never have an issue finding where to go. Various plants and animals would be found in the world some real and some imaginary, as to what those fake creatures are, I have yet to create them ""likely something odd and purposfully out of place"".\n\nGameplay: The player would switch between world traversal somewhat similar to the 3D Zelda games, when exploring the overworld you have full movement of the camera and the ability to jump in order to reach higher places, when not exploring the world the game would feature a relativley complex combat system similar in a sense to God Hand on the PS2. When locked on to the enemy your camera controls would be swapped with controls used for dodging and your movement would become slower, enemies would confront you only one or two at a time to be managable for the player while every action the player makes in combat will gradually deplete his or her stamina unless you give it time to regenerate. If the proper actions are taken in a fight it would be possible for the player to take out an enemy in one hit, this woul however only be doable if the player is able to properly position themselves after dodging and enemy attack. Attacks by the player would be buntched into two catagories, light and heavy, slight dloing little damadge but fast hitting, heavy being slow and clunky but doing large amaounts of damadge. Also when in combat the ability to jump is removed. While traversing the land the player would need to contantly take into consideration his or her stamina, similar to Monster Hunter the player would need to consume food every so often in order to keep their stamina at peak level. Touching on a point later in the games story the wolf becomes pregnant and now has two pups who she/the player must raise and take care of. You will be forced to feed them and protect them from harm in order to achieve the best ending possible. Different plants and animals located in the world would provide different things for the player, plants could be used to treat wounds or stop bleeding when consumed while killing animals would provide sustinance and thus boost stamina.\n\nDifferent plants and animals would be located simply by using a sniffing ability utilized by the player when they aren't in combat, using this would then present that creature or plant with another pillar of light, red for animal and yellow for plant. A third type of light would be blue which would indicate to the player sub missions, these missions when completed would give the player new wolves to add to their pack. The entire pack of wolves the the player uses can be viewed back at the main camp which is where you will also be able to save. Recruited wolves can be taken out on hunts and missions in order to make your time much easier as the player, they will confront and help take down wild animals as well as assist in healing you when you are low on health.\n\nStory: The story revolves around the white female wolf who is nameless. There is a power struggle currently between two rival packs and her mate is the head of one of these two packs. For the first fourth of the game you develop a relationship with your mate slowly getting closer and closer. While out hunting with some membes of their pack they are ambushed by the rival group, most of the pack is slaughtered including your mate who is killed by the then introduced villain who is merely the leader of the other pack, a rivalry is born from this between the two leading into the next 3/4 of the game which then becomes more about revenge. The female wolf is now pregnant with two pups and appointed as the leader of the pack. She is tasked with rebuilding and essentially recruiting new members. The next two fourths of the game are essentially this, some wolves are recieved from story missions and cannot die permanently while wolves recieved from side missions can however die permanently. As the final fourth of the story is reached the players wolf gives birth to two pups, from here you must focus on these two and contantly protecting them, keeping them alive is vital to the best ending of the game. Finally, the final battle has come and both packs stand on hills opposite eachother drenched in patterns made from mud, the two sides clash and a bloody battle ensues encompasing the White wolf and her now rival as they too fight to the death.\n\nThe fight would consist of three phases, the first like any other fight. Following this you would be shown the two packs gihting around them, rain pouring, washing away the mud. The two wolves stare at eachother as wings sprout from their backs, lifting into the air they asend up into the clounds commencing the second phase of the fight. After the second phase has concluded the two wolves begin to fall back to the earth from the wounds they sustained, they each pass out and then awake in a bright featurless area. The two wolves have now taken on a human shape and are each wearing intricate sets of armor and wielding swords, depending on how many of your pups stayed alive you will wield one of three things, if you lost both you carry Rapier that is fairly weak at hitting, if you still had one pup left you wield two blades which hit much more strongly and if you still had both pups you then carry a large great sword which deals the most damadge but is somewhat heavy and slow. After the fight is done you awake next to the now dead wolf you spent the whole game trying to defeat, each and every wolf who was battling before is now dead and motionless on the ground and you slowly walk away from the quite battle field concluding the game, depending on how many pups you had left you will see them standing on the hill in front of you once the fight has concluded.\n\nMiscellaneous: These are just some ideas I had that wouldn't necessarilly make it into the game. Killing various animals or eating various plants would give the player both permanent and temporary stat boosts, say you kill 10 boars, you then get a permanent health boost or perhaps an attack boost. These kinds of things would be located in an option in the menu like the challenges in Red Dead Redemption.\n\nNotes: The game wouldn't be too long, maybe between 5-8 hours long, I would want it to stay concise and to the point.\n\nSorry this is so long, if anything was misspelled or explained poorly i'm sorry. If you stuck through and read the whole thing I thank you, this is only one of two ideas that I have and I really wanted some opinions of it. Again thank you and I hope many of you enjoyed it, it is an idea I have had for about three years now and I have needed to get it out in the open. "
32a9li,An about Wolves and a struggle for power.,"Okay, i've had this idea now for a few years but never had anyone to really talk to about it aside from close friends and family members, so here it goes.\n\n\nThe World: The idea I had would revolve around you playing as a white female wolf in an open world enviornment with real time weather changes, and a continuous day and night cycle. Mission locations would be displayed in the sky as bright pillars of light indicating where the player would go next, they would be white and be very large as so the player would never have an issue finding where to go. Various plants and animals would be found in the world some real and some imaginary, as to what those fake creatures are, I have yet to create them ""likely something odd and purposfully out of place"".\n\n\nGameplay: The player would switch between world traversal somewhat similar to the 3D Zelda games, when exploring the overworld you have full movement of the camera and the ability to jump in order to reach higher places, when not exploring the world the game would feature a relativley complex combat system similar in a sense to God Hand on the PS2. When locked on to the enemy your camera controls would be swapped with controls used for dodging and your movement would become slower, enemies would confront you only one or two at a time to be managable for the player while every action the player makes in combat will gradually deplete his or her stamina unless you give it time to regenerate. If the proper actions are taken in a fight it would be possible for the player to take out an enemy in one hit, this woul however only be doable if the player is able to properly position themselves after dodging and enemy attack. Attacks by the player would be buntched into two catagories, light and heavy, slight dloing little damadge but fast hitting, heavy being slow and clunky but doing large amaounts of damadge. Also when in combat the ability to jump is removed. While traversing the land the player would need to contantly take into consideration his or her stamina, similar to Monster Hunter the player would need to consume food every so often in order to keep their stamina at peak level. Touching on a point later in the games story the wolf becomes pregnant and now has two pups who she/the player must raise and take care of. You will be forced to feed them and protect them from harm in order to achieve the best ending possible. Different plants and animals located in the world would provide different things for the player, plants could be used to treat wounds or stop bleeding when consumed while killing animals would provide sustinance and thus boost stamina. \n\nDifferent plants and animals would be located simply by using a sniffing ability utilized by the player when they aren't in combat, using this would then present that creature or plant with another pillar of light, red for animal and yellow for plant. A third type of light would be blue which would indicate to the player sub missions, these missions when completed would give the player new wolves to add to their pack. The entire pack of wolves the the player uses can be viewed back at the main camp which is where you will also be able to save. Recruited wolves can be taken out on hunts and missions in order to make your time much easier as the player, they will confront and help take down wild animals as well as assist in healing you when you are low on health.  \n\n\nStory: The story revolves around the white female wolf who is nameless. There is a power struggle currently between two rival packs and her mate is the head of one of these two packs. For the first fourth of the game you develop a relationship with your mate slowly getting closer and closer. While out hunting with some membes of their pack they are ambushed by the rival group, most of the pack is slaughtered including your mate who is killed by the then introduced villain who is merely the leader of the other pack, a rivalry is born from this between the two leading into the next 3/4 of the game which then becomes more about revenge. The female wolf is now pregnant with two pups and appointed as the leader of the pack. She is tasked with rebuilding and essentially recruiting new members. The next two fourths of the game are essentially this, some wolves are recieved from story missions and cannot die permanently while wolves recieved from side missions can however die permanently. As the final fourth of the story is reached the players wolf gives birth to two pups, from here you must focus on these two and contantly protecting them, keeping them alive is vital to the best ending of the game. Finally, the final battle has come and both packs stand on hills opposite eachother drenched in patterns made from mud, the two sides clash and a bloody battle ensues encompasing the White wolf and her now rival as they too fight to the death. \n\n  The fight would consist of three phases, the first like any other fight. Following this you would be shown the two packs gihting around them, rain pouring, washing away the mud. The two wolves stare at eachother as wings sprout from their backs, lifting into the air they asend up into the clounds commencing the second phase of the fight. After the second phase has concluded the two wolves begin to fall back to the earth from the wounds they sustained, they each pass out and then awake in a bright featurless area. The two wolves have now taken on a human shape and are each wearing intricate sets of armor and wielding swords, depending on how many of your pups stayed alive you will wield one of three things, if you lost both you carry Rapier that is fairly weak at hitting, if you still had one pup left you wield two blades which hit much more strongly and if you still had both pups you then carry a large great sword which deals the most damadge but is somewhat heavy and slow. After the fight is done you awake next to the now dead wolf you spent the whole game trying to defeat, each and every wolf who was battling before is now dead and motionless on the ground and you slowly walk away from the quite battle field concluding the game, depending on how many pups you had left you will see them standing on the hill in front of you once the fight has concluded. \n\n\nMiscellaneous: These are just some ideas I had that wouldn't necessarilly make it into the game.

Again thank you and I hope many of you enjoyed it, it is an idea I have had for about three years now and I have needed to get it out in the open. \n\n\nEdit: I misspelled the title, sorry, it's supposed to say ""An idea about Wolves and a struggle for power""."
328mq7,"[Request] Not sure if this belongs here, but I'm looking for games similar to this idea I have, for some inspiration.","I have an idea for a game I'd like to make. You start off with a basic mining spaceship. Each turn you arrive to a random encounter (be it pirates, a planet, etc) and decide what you'd like to do. Once that's over, you move on to the next random encounter.\n\nAs you upgrade your ship from the money you've made you can do more stuff, travel longer before having to return home, mine more efficiently, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, I have no idea what other games exist similar to this (other than maybe Oregon Trail) which is leaving me with a bit of an empty inspiration well. I don't even know what genre this would fall in (rogue-like simulation tycoon? :p).\n\nAny help, ideas, suggestions, game titles, etc. would be hugely appreciated."
328c6x,Two See.,"It was an odd idea. One that I'd been coming up with. \n\nIn this world, there are two children, or people.\n\nOne can see Blue light, the other can see Red, but nothing more.\n(Co-op is required here different screens, oculus whathaveyou.)\n\nThere are lights of each color around, and they must guide eachother. I wanted crawling, walking, and running. However, pressing shift, either one can, if they are near, grab the hand of the other. Leading one another through dangerous areas that only one person can see. (Think ico, but co-op.)\n\nFor a twist, I thought if each character was coloured differently and had a torch of the others' light, they would never see eachother, only their beams.\n\nI may not have thought this through enough, but what do you think?"
327yjz,Horror Game (Request),We are a smal indie team (5 persons) and we want to create a horror game but we need a simple and intresting idea
326vnc,A new style of RPG,"My idea is an open-world RPG with plenty of side-areas and lots of optional questing, where the characters slowly form a party, and spells are ridiculously overpowered, but they cost experience from the character casting them to use, but as it should be in all RPGs, leveling is essential, so players would have to  make a choice and take more risks saying ""Hmm, should I sacrifice the xp or hope on my character to clutch it"", and I'm not just talking about ""100 xp to revive entire party"" I want it to have high costs so you really have to balance spells, and maybe have to grind more late-game.\n\nAlso another thing I would really like to see but no RPGs have really done, as I've seen, is when a character in your party dies, they just flat out die, but you only have a party of about 4 people, and when you get to the next town or go to a previous one, side-quests open up to add new characters to your party that weren't available before, and if one of the town people die they just stay dead.\n\nI know it's a lot to ask for in a game, but it's just an idea. I would actually even play it if just the core concepts were used but it was like a top-down kind of to the side sprite-based game, like [my favorite game series, Geneforge](http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/images/geneforge/shapinghall.jpg) but I know it would still require a lot of effort. Hope I see someone do this, someday :)"
326l9b,A game branded with a popular musical artist,"I have been trying to come up with the detailed idea and context of the game but what I have in mind is a game that will depict the growing of a popular artist from nothing to stardom. The first stage would be when he was nobody, nothing and broke and would be played through several stages until final stage where he is now in stardom. What do you guys think and what do you think the process should be. Thanks in advance. "
324t70,An online multiplayer game with cheats,"So something action packed and/or stealthy, like a GTA Assassins Creed combo.\n\nWhere you can put in button codes for cheats, invisibility, unlimited ammo, innvincibility, flight etc etc\nMaximum of 2 cheats at a time\nThey last for a minute or two and have a 30 second or a minute cool down.\n\nSo the game is crazy but it becomes some kind of survival tournament where you can hide in the shadows (or broad daylight as it happens!) and figure out who's about to run out of invincibility, take them out.\nOr sneak up behind people who aren't using invincibility and use your one hit melee kill cheat.\n\n\nI think it would be a cool twist to online multiplayer you'd have to think a lot more than ""guns, explosions! Woooo!"" or you'd get killed when you run out of time on your cheats."
322oxr,Life Simulator,"The game would be set in a small town, similar to the Bright Falls in Alan Wake. It would play out with the freedom of a grand theft auto game but with interesting side quests, as well as the main quest. Or may be there is no main quest.\n\nYou will have the ability to do any job, work for any business in the town. Each business would have its own quest line. You would probably need to have something interesting happen in each storyline, say like fighting a rival business. Maybe start off with a few businesses at first then add new businesses (DLC) to the game after release.\n\nI have one quest line worked out already.\nThere is an army base near the town that you can join. You go through the training to become a recruit, then suddenly the town is invaded by an enemy country, and you and the rest of the soldiers have to fight a guerrilla warfare to take back the town.\n\nPretty wild ideas but there you go.\n\n"
31zek7,Hunting games,"There is alot of good game out there but no good hunting game. I just want to play a nice cool hunting game. (Not monster hunter) So I came up with an idea for one.\n\n\nsetting:\n\nan island in the middle of the ocean where some how all terrain exsit. On the island there will be desert, forest, lakes, swamp, snow, ect...\n\n\nStory:\n\nyou and a team of people comes to the island to hunt various animal/creatures to sell.\n\n\nPlayers: 1 single player with 4 online.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nso it will be a 3D first person shooter/action adventure/ with some rpg elements.\nso the game will run on a day/night time system like in majora's mask. (Some animal only appare in certent time of day and hunting in the day time is safer then in the night time)\n\nThe game will also have a survivor system much like minecraft (hunt food, gather materal, build shelter/camp ground, build traps, craft materals....ect)\n\nSo u start out in ur safe house(HQ) u can then equip what u are taking with u. Supply will be limited so only take what u need. For example u can only carry 1 primary gun and 1 secondary gun. U also have 1 back pack and a few side pockets and pouches. you can choose between, food, meds, animal calls ....ect. U can unlock more inventory space and weapons and supplies as u go.\n\nOnce u choose ur equipment u are thrown out in the wild where u will have to survive and hunt your pray. First find a safe spot set up camp. Then start tracking and hunting.\n\n\nNow the game will have normal animal u hunt like bird, deer, ect. But there will also be bears, tiger, crocodile.. ect that u can hunt. Now it gets interesting. Along with all those animal there will be dinosaur and mythical cretures (big foot, warewolfs, dragons, ect the list goes on) as well. So while u are out hunting u are also being hunted.\n\n•imagine tracking down a deer following it only to realize a tiger was also hunting it. Now u got a tiger to hunt. As u close in on a hungry tiger feeding on the deer a velociraptor jumps out and takes the tiger. u turn to run cause u were prepare to hunt it. As it chase u to ur camp site the full moon appare and a warewolf jumps out of no where into a showdown with the velociraptor•\n\nas u go u will be able to unlock vehicle, and better more \nadvance weapons and gears to hunt.\n\n\nNow this game will have 4 multi so u can play with friends work together to hunt down the most fearsome creature.\n\n\nThis will be a petting cool hunting game but it will never happen. So what are everyone's thoughts on hunting game and my ideas."
31ux0k,Death From Above - Generic Zombie Shooter with a twist,"This is an idea I had like 2-3 years ago when people were *just* starting to get sick of zombies. \n\nI'd written some notes down a while back, and here they are:\n\nTitle: “Death From Above”\n\nPlayers: 1-8 (Although groups of higher than one are recommended)\n\nPremise: Player spawns as either a passenger on a flight, a flight attendant, an air marshal, or a pilot. One player in party will always be spawned as a pilot. All players, no matter who they spawn as, are on a flight to an unspecified (as of this point) country. On this flight, some people start showing symptoms of infection. \n\nIt starts out as a simple cough or blocked throat, or even headaches – but quickly descends into madness as these passengers begin to die, and reanimate into the living dead. The game starts before the flight, and progresses slowly. Anyone who is not a player (upwards of 100, depending on how big the flight is) will probably be subjected to the zombie virus, but there will be a chance to save some survivors. Plane is rather large, but only some (upwards of 20 characters) will be playable. \n\nFirst twenty minutes of the game starts as a normal flight which quickly divulges into a “wave” based first person shooter style video game – with both melee and ranged weapons, improvised arsenal and explosives, barricades and a story influenced by the players’ actions. \n\nPlayers are able to play the game based on their character archetypes. For instance – Air marshals will be able to use all types of ranged based weaponry and will have a higher stamina / strength “stat” than other characters, whereas other characters such as the pilots will have little knowledge in guns, but will remain essential to “winning” the game. \n\nEach character brings their own advantages and disadvantages to gameplay. Possibly might include an Old Woman who might be able to annihilate zombies easily, for comedic effect. (I was retarded a few years back, don't ask).\n\nAtmosphere starts bright and sunny, but quickly escalates into stormy, cloudy weather that can be barely seen from the small windows. The “Pilot(s)”of the party, however, can access the cockpit to navigate the flight safely. They can land in a variety of locations, but vary depending on the players’ actions. \n\nCertain characters can access certain areas of the airplane – with the attendants having (almost) complete access to the plane. Passengers can access their carry-on compartments, and can loot the keys from the dead (or re-dead) and access their compartments for weapons or other things. \n\nPossible inclusion of being able to make your own weapons with materials found throughout the flight. It lasts as long as it takes for the players to either (a) land the plane safely or (b) kill every zombie on the plane. \n\nIf pilot is killed, the game ends, as they players have no means of landing the plane safely and therefore die in a plane crash. Players can protect the pilot until they land, or they can spread out across the plane (which will be large – big enough to carry a large amount of people + some shipping goods and such) and gather supplies. Barricades can be built to keep zombies at bay, and zombies won’t necessarily know exactly where the players are at all times, and as such, can be left alone until the players land the airplane. The game can be won if players die – and even if not all zombies are cleared out. Players don’t respawn, but can be healed if they are wounded by use of first aid kits in the plane. \n\nOr, barring logic, be resurrected by a defibrillator. \n\n**TL;DR - Zombie game on a plane with heavy reliance on keeping one/two team member(s) alive throughout the entirety of the game.**\n"
31u5ll,I have been putting together a concept for a drop-in drop-out multiplayer turn-based RPG.,"Here's the page, but I'll also put it on this thread: https://sites.google.com/site/spinia64/concepts/mrpg\n\nThere is quite a lot of text, but I'll put a tl;dr for each idea. This is a work in progress concept, and I hope that it can be made into a game someday by me or someone else. It's ambitious, though, but over time I will be editing it to make it more plausible.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Battle System**\n\n   The Battle System was made to be traditional in single player and unique in multiplayer. When traveling the overworld you can see monsters roaming. By approaching one of its sides a screen shows up over the overworld screen like in Dragon Warrior.\nSee? Like Dragon Warrior!\n\n   There you can battle like you would in any old RPG. The player goes first unless specified by the monster's attributes. The battles are fast paced in that the text speed is easily skippable and the animations for attacks are cancel-able. You can leave the fight quickly if you want to (though the monster might not let you!)\n\n   If another player in your server comes by and sees you locked in battle, they can go on another side of the monster and join you. Now the order of turns is based off of the speed stats that each entity has, which is tied to their armor. Players have ten seconds to choose their action during their turn and if they miss it they will be in stall mode. In stall mode there will be a dialogue indicating they are in stall mode in front of all other menus that they will have to click off of in order to resume playing. If they are in stall mode and their turn comes, they are automatically skipped. Enemies are also more likely to attack players in stall mode.\n\n   For single tiled monsters, up to four players can fight it at any time. Then there are the 2x1 monsters which are usually just two single tiled monsters in one battle. Up to six can fight those at once. Next are the 2x2 monsters which are either four monsters or a strong enemy. Up to eight people can fight them at once. Then there are the 3x3 monsters which are most likely minibosses. Twelve can fight them at a time. Then finally there are the 4x4 monsters which are major bosses. All sixteen players can fight it at a time.\n\n   When an enemy is defeated a loot bag will appear in the center. Inventory space will probably be limited and loot will probably not be immediately useful so that solves the problem of players trying to get to it first. Important items will be granted to players right before the battle screen ends.\n\n   The Battle System GUI will have two columns. The one on the left will have all of the different moves with the ones that are available in white above the ones that are unavailable due to low mana or other stats. On the right will be consumables and special items. Below this will be a small action bar with things like Run, Block, Guard, or Evade. Above these menus are the actual enemies, and above that shows all of your teammates that are in that battle with icons showing their status (poisoned, sleeping, dead, etc). The GUI will be accessible with a mouse or keyboard with the mouse being used to easily click moves and enemies and the keyboard having hotkeys if that's what the player prefers.\n\n**tl;dr:** *Battles are turn based and other players can join your battle based on how large the monster is. If they're inactive the flow of the battle will adjust and everything will end up being quick. Loot is dropped for any one person to pick up but there's limited space leaving the decision of who carries what up to the group.*\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Equipment**\n\nEquipment will be handled in a way similar to Paper Mario. But as this game does not have leveling up and relies solely on gear to progress, I had to change the formula a bit.\n\nWhen you get a piece of armor, it has different sized Equipment slots and Character slots. Every piece of equipment requires a different number of equipment slots and a certain type of armor. For example, you might have a piece of equipment that gives you a mega punch move. It requires two equipment slots. You don't have armor yet, so you can't use it. Then, later on during your travels you find a leather glove. It has three equipment slots. Since it's a glove and the mega punch move was made for gloves/gauntlets, you can equip it and still have space for another piece of equipment. Then you can equip maybe a +1 defense on that last slot.\n\nEquipment is selected on an equipment page. When you get a new piece of armor you can select the equipment for that piece. If you equip another piece of armor, all of the equipment will be back on the page where you can put it on that armor. If you decide to go back to the previous armor, all equipment you selected initially will be back on that piece of armor (unless it is sold etc.).\n\nMost pieces of equipment require a specific armor type to be applied to. They can be things such as a headbutt move for your helmet or a stat increase for your boots. There are also special pieces of equipment that can be applied to your character slots (which are special slots that are added up from all of your armor's character slots). These can include different moves that are used for different weapons you equip. For example, if you have a sword move you can always use slash. However, if you get a piece of equipment called Parry, you can apply it to your character slots. Now your sword can parry. But if you change your weapon, you will still have Parry which would be useless for other weapons. Character slots can also be used for special equipment that have different effects like a chance of not being hit or a healing aura for every turn.\n\nThis idea is heavily influenced by the RPG Paper Marios but redone to not base all of the gear in the game on badge points. Now you will require new sets of armor to progress through the game safely.\n\n**tl;dr:** *You can get different equipment depending on how many pieces of equipment your armor holds. Equipment ranges from stat boosts to different moves to special effects. Some equipment is applied to your character using character slots that are added up from all armor pieces. Equipment is basically necessary for progression.*\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Quests**\n\nThere are two types of quests: story quests and group quests. Story quests can be played with up to four players but they are made to be played with one. Group quests can be played with up to sixteen players but are made to be played with four. Anyone can join a story quest as long as that quest is in their quest list either in progress or completed. In group quests, anyone with any gear can join a player who has met all the requirements.\n\nStory quests will obviously be part of the story. Progression through these quests will occur through completing other quests. Playing this multiplayer will require all players you play with to have been at the same part of the game as you, so it's made with that in mind. As story quests were meant to be played with one player, everyone should have completed all quests beforehand to be on the same page.\n\nGroup quests are handled differently. They are all in a list in taverns in each town. Taverns work like this: when a player hosts their server players can join either their party or their group. Up to four can join their party and up to sixteen can be in their group. The tavern is a single instance bound in all towns, so the party members just have to reach the tavern and meet up with the other players. Then they can view a list of quests in the quest board. The host chooses the quest and they all depart to either an area built for that quest (like a special dungeon) or an area in the world that is then closed off from the other areas. Only the host has to meet the requirements to start a quest, though if there is someone in the group who meets the requirements those quests are automatically added to the quest board. When the quest is completed it is marked as complete for all players that participated, even if they do not meet the requirements.\n\nGroup quest requirements are met by having different armor sets or by defeating different bosses in the story etc. They can also be unlocked by simply doing other group quests. Doing group quests can provide gear that is stronger than the gear met in story mode, but the trade off is that the quests are much more difficult to do. Group quests will also contain most of the game's endgame.\n\n**tl;dr:** *Story quests can be played with up to four players and are unlocked by doing the story. Group quests can be played with up to sixteen players and only have to be unlocked by one player (by getting different armor, defeating bosses, or doing other group quests) for all other players to join.*\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope you liked my suggestion!"
31tyyu,[Request] Survive ( or a cooler title ) description in details.,"I'm thinking something like Minecraft meets the historical elements like in Assassin's Creed meets War Games meets Skyrim . \n\n\nThere could be single player and online MMO.\n\nThere would be clans in both single player and online. but they'd be preset clans - Like Mongols, Vikings, etc.\n\nWithin in your clan you'd build your own tools and shelters, gather herbs and plants for food and medicine , go hunting or fishing , and whatever , how they survived back then .\n\n\nThere'd be different storylines for different time periods in single player , and online I feel like it'd be more of an MMO fp war game - every clan for themselves ( disregarding if victories/losses are historically accurate - it'd just be continuous survival and war, and the wins would be based off of tickets like in battlefield)\n\nThere can also be alliances and peace treaties.\n\nNow I know there can be bears, sabre tooth tigers -any vicious animal there was for game at the corresponding time period \n\nLike if you choose the caveman clan and decide to live in their time period , you'd have to hide from dinosaurs, or team up and hunt them using strategies like hiding in the trees and what not.\n\nAs well as easier animals to deal with like rabbits, or more useful animals like scouting/messaging Falcons, or Sheeps for their wool, or horses to ride.\n\n( could you imagine being an Indian tribe hunting buffalo on horses while Other Indians , or Englishman prepared for war with you)\n\nI want to add more mythological animals too, but like they'd only be seen if the local witch doctor brews up something that allows you to see them, or like if you take any psychedelic that happens to be laying around like shrooms , weed, ergot , etc.\n\n\nAlso, there could be affects like hunger that add or takeaway buffs from characters\n\nExample:\n\nYour character is Starving\n- increased senses\n-decreased energy\n\nExample two:\nYour character is sleep deprived\n- more prone to seeing mythological creatures ( such as dragons( although honestly I'm only the fence on whether or not dragons ever existed))\n-decreased physical ability \n-decreased focus \n\nAnd like you could train your character too if you wanted.\n\nAnd there are plenty of clans out there\n\nSome ideas are:\n\nCavemen\nMongols\nVikings\nTemplars \nAztecs\nZulu\nNavajo tribe \nPirates\nSamurais\n\nAnd many more.\n\n\n"

The opening is just nick explaining his life....like Lolipop Chainsaw (no name connection) he does his ordinary routine but soon discovers there is a zombie apocalypse starting...nick Is forced to learn how to use a gun....he is a jock with a head on his shoulders....he is a cool guy with friends all around...his girlfriend's name  is Katie...she is a cheerleader...nicks two best friends are Josh (nerd) and Tom (school journalist) also Jerry (school player). These characters go with Nick on an adventure to California where its rumored to be safe...You can only control nick. The graphics will be like resident evil 6 and evil within. The twist is....while the group is traveling....a blue portal light opens in the sky and a space ship crashes a few miles in front of them before their eyes.... Once they get to it... They see a man emerge from the rubble. He looks exactly like nick. He explains he is from another world (parallel world/dimension) and says there is a zombie outbreak there too. He says the zombies from his world crossed over to nick's world which it is unknown how. Their world is more advanced. And his name is Nate. He uses an advanced postal which shoots a lazer beam. Yunno futuristic stuff. Nick and the gang's mission changes from finding a safe zone...to traveling to the other dimension to find the source of the outbreak and stopping it.\nThe world is futuristic but still similar to regular earth. You can get futuristic weapons etc. Roam around the city with your entourage....side missions helping other survivors....get armor and rewards that might help.....but on the main mission path u have to follow leads on wat started it etc. Fight bosses and upgrade weapon effectiveness....(my ideals are a bit out of order but you get it). The zombies are more advanced so mere headshots from normal guns won't help. That's why you need the futuristic guns. These are zombies of different calibare...able to adspt.... Change and mutate.... You can play multiplayer online to help with missions etc or group battles. You can be a zombie......easy to control and very fun to be....ending to game will be a surprise...let's just say.....not everyone is who they seem....
335hq5,Space Engineers mixed with the Material Energies^3 Modpack for Minecraft &amp; Civ,"***Name***\n\nSpacebox\n\n***Concept Overview***\n\nBuild a galactic business from the ground up. First task: Repair a space station.\n\n***Plot***\n\nThe year is 2288. Humanity has finally stretched out across the galaxy, but at a cost. A Twenty-Eight Year long war ravaged the systems. Four years later, we try to rebuild.\n\nYou have recently purchased an abandoned Space Station in a far-away star system. You got it cheap because of the damages it has suffered, and plan to build your own business empire from it.\n\nWhen you arrive, the damages were worse than you expected. You must repair and upgrade it before you can begin your business endeavours.\n\nOnce this is done, it is time to reach out into the galaxy, and become a galactic tycoon!\n\n***Gameplay***\n\nYou spend the first part of the game repairing the station, as well as purchasing upgrades. You must repair reactors, hull damage, O2 Systems, FTL beacons etc. But all repairs cost resources.\n\nYou can either buy more resources once your FTL beacon is up and running, or you can visit nearby planetary bodies to mine them. These includes asteroids, dwarf planets, planets and moons. \n\nThe star systems themselves are procedurally generated so that some resources will be harder to find than others. It is near impossible to be randomly given a star system with a habitable planet, but it can happen. Think a 1 in 314159265359 chance.\n\nOnce you have fully repaired your station you can either re-purpose it (When you begin a game you will choose from a list what sort of station it was before being abandoned, and each purpose comes with different hurdles. i.e. a Research Base might have been abandoned due to disease, so you would also have to sterilise before opening your FTL beacon, or a military base would have been damaged in the war, and you would have to make a lot more repairs) or use it for it's original purpose. \n\nWe now enter the second stage of the game, managing your business. You hire a very small handful of crew to do some tasks. You can hire more but that costs money.\n\nDepending on your desired career (Vehicle Manufacture, Trade Hub, Colonist, Terraformer, Research etc.) you must carry out tasks to further the business. You might design starships, make planets habitable or even go on expeditions to retrieve new minerals or wildlife.\n\nThe goal of the game is to grow your business, but there are those out there who wish you harm. Pirates might come to the station in hopes of salvage, the last remnants of the opposing force of the war might see which side your allied with and attack, a rival company might not like how well you're doing and sabotage or spy.\n\n***Multiplayer***\n\nThe Sol System (The one we're in now) is the multiplayer hub. From here you can trade with eachother, chat, make friends, play games, hire eachothers services, buy a station together to begin co-op as business partners, plan a trip to an exotic system etc.\n\n***Standout Features***\n\n1. Fully customisable spaceships and stations\n\n2. Fun, living multiplayer\n\n3. Space exploration\n\n***Possible Platforms***\n\nPC. I really can't imagine this working on a console, but if anyone has ideas on how, I'm all ears.\n\n***Help***\n\nI need suggestions on how to improve this aswell as any features you can think of! I'm undecided about having a sentient alien race. On the one hand, it would be hella cool to hire/fight/aid an alien race, but on the other it seems unnecessary. Thoughts?\n\n---\n\nThis ideas pretty fresh in my head and I haven't really put too much thought in it, so I was looking for some suggestions and feedback.\n\nThanks!"

334u98,HyperCiv,"    Name\n        HyperCiv\n\n    Concept Overview\n        A Civilization-like strategy game played in hyperbolic geometry.\n\n    Plot\n        Start with a primitive civilization and expand -- but in hyperbolic geometry!\n\n    Setting\n        This game is played on a hyperbolic grid ((6,6,7)-tiling with two hexagons and one heptagon at every vertex would be easy and sufficient). The hyperbolic plane you play in is infinite. New sections are generated as you explore them (including inhabitants and their history). This is possible because in hyperbolic world it's not really possible to explore EVERYTHING -- there will be always places right next to your front door where you've never been and where anything can lurk.\n\n    Characters/Abilities\n        As this is a strategy game, there would be no specific characters.\n        However, there would be a variety of playable races.\n\n    Gameplay Mechanics\n        Basically, it's a Civilization-like simulation. However, the standard ideas of exploration or warfare are not applicable.\n        First of all, in order to introduce a more climatic variety in a world that is not really a planet and has no day/night cycle or seasons, there are random hot and cold poles -- places with higher or lower temperature than average which affect temperature of other tiles close to them.\n        Second important value is ""chaos""; the tiles also have a value on order/chaos scale (with ""order poles"" and ""chaos poles""). Highly ordered places are governed by simple, strong laws that don't have exceptions, while in more chaotic places the laws get more complicated and exceptions abound. In laymen's terms, ordered places have laws closer to ""laws of physics"", while chaotic places have ""laws of magic"". This allows for a ""kitchen sink"" setting where almost anything imaginable might show up. If your civilization wants to rely on computers, you would have problems with chaotic areas where they randomly stop working -- and if you want to rely on powerful wizards, mundane areas will be the bane of you.\n        The research system is also somewhat chaotic -- once you discover an ""idea"", you can research it and gain useful improvements of it, but new ""ideas"" are gained by semi-random ""breakthroughs"" -- you need to prepare the right conditions, and then a genius has to appear who connects the dots in exactly the right way to get your civilization to the next level. For this reason, it's better to research as much as you can and then adapt to breakthroughs you randomly find than to try and get one particular breakthrough.\n        For example, once you research Alchemy to the max level, you can get a breakthrough and discover Chemistry -- or you can discover Philosopher's Stone. Which you get depends on various circumstances (mainly on chaos level at the city that makes the breakthrough), but once you get one, the chance of getting the other drops drastically.\n\n    Standout Features\n        Infinite expandability -- new civilizations, units, terrains and ideas can be added ad infinitum without overwriting previous content. With huge extent of hyperbolic space, there's no danger of cluttering either.\n        Odd interactions of ideas -- your civilization, based on the particular combination of breakthroughs you discover, might end up raising herds of combat unicorns, enslave fairies in the wood and make them factory workers, magically teleport nuclear weapons inside your opponent's shield, use the fires of Hell as a cheap source of energy or develop a form of necromancy that works on broken androids.\n\n    Possible Platforms\n        PC/Tablet\n\n    Extra Features\n        A big problem for a hyperbolic game would be the good navigation; since hyperbolic geometry has an absolute scale, a minimap that would show more information is not really possible. Another thing is that hyperbolic geometry also doesn't allow for absolute system of cardinal directions, so it's very easy to get lost. Ways to center the view on particular points of interest are absolutely necessary.\n\n    How To Credit You\n        If someone would like to actually make this, I would like to be still able to contribute ideas.\n"
3340ny,Game ideas,"Hello, I'm a one person indie developer that searches for game ideas"
333rp6,Star Wars: Order 66,"**Name: 66** \n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n*A 3D game taking place in the end stages of the Clone Wars, you play as a Jedi scrambling to save other Jedi and indigenous populations from the sudden grip of Emperor Palpatine*\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou (A customizable character) would start out on one of the more distant planets in the galaxy (i.e. in the mid or outer rim, where the Republic grip is weaker) leading some clone troopers on an attack of a separatist outpost. After you win the battle (where you learn how to move, attack, the basics) the clone troopers turn on you and try to kill you. You would then fight your way back to your spaceship and escape the planet.\n\nOn this spaceship would be a helping droid (Maybe some R2D2/C-3PO mix) who assists you in mapping out your journey. It gives you the news from Coursant; that the Jedi have gone rouge and are threatening the Senate, and that Clones have been sent in to quell the rebellion. You realize immediately that it is not true but you want to confirm this with your former master, we'll call him Qui Gon Jinn (it's 12:30 AM, plz no h8), who happens to be stationed on a nearby planet.\n\nYou arrive on his planet to find that Order 66 is well underway. The scene is very chaotic, as the Order was initiated in the heat of battle against the Separatists. After sneaking around the field (Where you learn how to sneak), you find that Jinn has taken refuge in a cave or building nearby. You converse with Jinn, where he confirms this was not due to the Jedi and something much darker. You then would have to sneak back to your ship and formulate a plan of action.\n\nAt this point the game really starts to open up for you. Jinn acts as an adviser for you, recommending special people to be rescued or planets that should be saved from the Empire's grasp. Ultimately it will be up to you to decide on who to rescue and what planets will be saved. \n\nAfter you rescue some people (Not all will be Jedi, some will be political or local military leaders), Jinn will say that we can not remain in ignorance about what is really going on in Coursant, especially since the only news is the propaganda that the Emperor is spewing. He will take you on a secret daring raid on Coursant, where you infiltrate the highest offices and gather proof that Palpatine is really trying to become dictator. Unfortunately, you get caught and Jinn sacrifices himself to allow you time to escape back to where your group is hiding. \n\nOnce you return, you realize that the only way you can make use of this info (and avenge Jinn) is to find an Imperial Broadcasting station in your region and rely the proof to the entire sector, as only the station has the equipment powerful enough to reach all the star systems around. \n\nUnfortunately, the station is well guarded, and the only way to make it vulnerable enough to attack is to weaken the grip in the entire sector (i.e. turning more planets and people against the Empire). Once you have done that, then you can attack.\n\nAfter mobilizing friendly forces, you either:\n\n- Launch an all or nothing blitz assault on the planet, where there is a lot of action and fun but a reduced time until enemy reinforcements arrive and crush your attack.\n\n- OR sneak around and sabotage equipment so you can launch a series of small tactical groups in to take control. A little more difficult and time consuming but a total sneakfest for those who like it and more time (Due to damaged equipment).\n\nOnce you take control of the station and prevent reinforcements from arriving, you relay the truth and all the planets go to your side!... Not really. You still can try to liberate planets (With the help of planets you already saved), but they get progressively harder at the Empire is forced to consolidate more and more forces on fewer planets. \n\nAt this point, the fledgling Rebel Alliance (headed by the big names, Organa, Mon Mothma) steps in, and notices that you have basically single handedly liberated an entire sector from the Empire. They ask to use your system as a temporary base of operations and in exchange they allow you to become one of the leaders of the official Rebel Alliance. You accept, and then slowly finish the job of liberating and consolidating your hold on the sector.\n\n/novel\n\n**Setting:**\n\nThis takes place in the immediate days, weeks, and months following the execution of 66. You are in a sector of about 15-20 planets on the mid or outer rim (hence why you are able to take over planets with out the entire Empire army coming down on you) fighting Separatist and Empire forces. (I know I didn't talk about the Sepratists much, but they are still there in the beginning, however quickly cease to exist once Anakin takes out the leaders of the movement on Mustafar. Once that happens it is a race to capture planets between you and Empire forces) \n\nThe planets have differing environments and varying populations of different species. Some planets are friendly to you (mainly the ones with non-humanoid races), some are neutral (the ones with humanoid races or a mix), and some are loyal to the Empire (mostly human planets).\n\n**Characters:**\n\n*You* - You are the main protagonist of the story, and it is essentially your job to try and unite the planets against the rule of the empire. You have a mix of base skills that you level up by using said skills (Like Skyrim), and additional bonuses that you get from characters you save.\n\n*Qui Gon Jinn (Not final name)* - Your mentor. He functions mainly as an advisory role, helping you make decisions about what planets to help. While he is with you, you gain a bonus to your persuasion skills\n\n*Major Kerbil* - Main antagonist in the game. He is in charge of all the imperial forces in the sector, and he is not about to let it fall out of his grasp. You can expect counterattacks on worlds you have conquered previously as he tries to take back what he loses. He hates you.\n\n*Political/Military Leaders* - There are several of each for this group, and each confers their own advantages. Political Leaders can help consolidate your hold on a planet, and helps with diplomatic take overs. Military leaders help to unlock certain maneuvers and can help with the tide of the battle swinging in your favor.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Full range of movement for your character\n* Attacks, combos, the whole thing, as well as force-related abilities that you can use on troopers to fight them\n* A sneaking skill that can help you get around\n* A persuasion skill that can help you when you try to convince other planets and people to join your side\n* A branching dialogue system that comes up when you try to persuade P/M members to join your side. What you say in the conversation can affect how they react, i.e. if you are too forceful they will resent and reject your offer and go to the Empire. Persuading people is absolutely important as it allows you more options to take over planets and people both diplomatic and militarily.\n\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Open World - After saving Jinn, you can travel to many of the star systems in the sector. Of course, some are going to be harder than others, especially early game, but you are not stuck in a level type environment.\n\n* Planet Takeovers - So basically there are two ways to take over a planet: Diplomatically, or Militarily. Each has their ups and downs.  With diplomacy, you use your political leaders, and your own personal influence to help convince the world leaders that staying with or rolling over for the Empire is a bad idea, leading to them throwing the Empire out. While you preserve more infrastructure (There would still be a fight, but less damage would be done [the infrastructure would be shown as a percentage]), a disgruntled populace will have an easier time revolting against your rule, as they did not lose many people. With Military, you use other planets forces in conjunction with your leaders to remove all Imperial Forces from the world. You keep the populace more contained but it doesn't produce as much forces and resources you can use in the fight against the Empire.\n\n* Planet Takeover Pt. 2 - The Political/Military leaders vary in quality, and the more qualified your leaders are, the more options are opened up. Early Game you are stuck with more Diplomatic options since you have no military, but later on you can do raids and full out assaults.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* Probably the Xbox One and PS4 as (ideally) most of the action would be 3rd person instead of total war style battles, meaning a mouse is not required. Of course this would still be offered to PC users as well.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* You will not be successful in saving a planet (at least initially) every time. Sometimes you will get beaten to the punch by the clones, and you will arrive only to have found the population die hard loyal to the empire or the the clones have wiped out the indigenous population, preventing you from gaining their support. Not all planets will be like this, but the planets where this event occurs would change every time, to keep the player on his or her toes. I feel this adds to the tense atmosphere, as you never know what you will expect. Also, it gets progressively harder as time goes on due to order 66 taking effect.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nYou can put my real name in the credits (you would have to PM me though)\n\n- I'm sure there is some stuff I missed, but it's 2:15 AM at the time of finishing this post and I gotta go to bed. See you all tomorrow!"
332b8q,Expanding gameplay with the style from Icarus,"I was playing a fun little indie-game called Incarus. I really enjoyed the game and though simple and short, I played it 5 times through.  It was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone! (takes like 10-20 minutes to complete a game)\nI love the interface and visual style of the game, and thought it would go great with a larger game, adding more depth and more possibilities. If anyone is aware of a game like this (despite my search) then please let me know. If not, then I thought this would be the place to post the idea.\nThis is a very unspecific idea, but something I would love someone to make/expand on. Constructive and reasoned feedback is very much welcome.\n\nLink to Icarus: http://gamejolt.com/games/strategy-sim/icarus/29642/\n\n[Please excuse my writing. English is not my mother language.]"
3327hb,A horse riding game for ALL ages,"I want to take a moment to say something...this game concept is MY BABY. I've spent months cultivating this little concept into an idea that's truly magical (NO IM NOT A BRONY). Seeing this game made a reality would be a dream come true.\n(sadly I never came up with a name for it)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\nHave you ever met a person that mentions that when they played something like Ocarina of Time, they spent hours roaming the fields on Epona for fun? That's basically what this game is.\nThe game takes inspiration from the overworld of Shadow of the Colossus, as well as any game where you could spend hours running around either in animal form or on the back of an animal (Skyrim, OoT, TwiPri, etc.)\nThe main point is to enjoy yourself, and to that end, it should be suitable for ALL ages. Not just in a way that would allow a child to play it without being traumatized, but in a way that would make it so that an adult could enjoy without shame.\n\n**Plot:**\nA plot never seemed to suit this game. Some games just don't have them, really. (Bientot L'ete, various business tycoons, simulations, etc.) However, leaving a concept like this without any plot would likely only appeal to a small group of people, so I'll get into the possibility of plots in the game mechanics.\n\n**Setting:**\nThe setting is a large island in some unnamed fantasy world, with perhaps a few smaller islands nearby, with plenty of different biomes, including, but not limited to: Plains, forest, mountain, canyon, desert. Strewn across the biomes are herds of various horse types, each native to a specific biome.\n\nSomeone also mentioned the possibility of having the world procedurally generated, rather than a steadfast map. It's a possibility, I suppose. \n\nAs for era, probably medieval fantasy.\n\n**Characters:**\nThe only character is the one you construct at the beginning of the game, and those of any other players you may or may not play with through multiplayer. \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\nYou would start the game with your own 'base', which has a house, stables, and paddock, and one horse, that has no outstanding characteristics, and that you can only customize in a very basic way (since you haven't collected any special customization stuff yet). \n\nThe world is completely free-roam, with many special locations scattered across it. Some examples of special locations would be: an oasis, a forest spring, a cave with glowing crystals, overgrown ruins of a structure like a cathedral, perhaps a fairy circle or two, anything that stands out.\n\nIf you wanted more horses, you would have to go out and wrangle them yourself. If you wanted a certain type of horse which would have specific stats, you'd have to go find out where a horse like that would be (faster horses would likely be in the plains, bulkier horses would be in the mountains, etc).\n\nSome horses would be unique, and very difficult to get to. One such unique horse would be a unicorn, found in some tranquil, remote corner of the forest, that you would have to sneak up on. Another would be a pegasus, which you could only find in the mountains. You'd probably have to track down it's home/den, so that you could sneak up on it without it flying off. Capturing this horse would give you access to free-fly! There should probably be an alicorn somewhere one the map, too. Another possibility for a unique horse would be a kelpie, or water spirit, found in a river or pool, and perhaps some kind of fire elemental as well (likely found on a small, volcanic isle). \n\nIn addition to getting your horses, you would also be able to create dyes to change your horses' coat colors. To do this, you would collect various herbs and then combine them in a sort of potion brewing manner, which would allow you to choose 1-4 different plants at a time to manipulate the color in ANY way you wanted to. Pretty much ANY color should be possible, including bizarre and unnatural ones like cherry red, blue, green, and pink. \n\nExamples\n\n[red plant]=red dye\n\n[red plant]+[brown plant]= Maroon dye\n\n2[red plant]+1[brown plant]=deep red\n\n(Basically, mess around with http://trycolors.com/ and limit yourself to four 'drops', you'll get the gist)\n\nAnother possible mechanic would be one that would allow you to change a horse's coat pattern, however the only idea I could up with would be finding glassy, magical spheres hidden around the map that would contain different coat patterns, that you could permanently keep. The dyes you make could then be applied to different parts of the pattern. But this is kind of silly, so...I don't know.\n\nI mentioned that different horses breeds have different stats, but since this game is about freedom, I don't want people to be locked into a specific kind of horse forever. So the solution I have for this is the ability to collect ingredients that would allow you to brew stat-increasing potions. Using this, anything is possible with your horse's stats, really. So if you prefer the appearance of a horse breed that happens to be naturally slower, you can make it as fast as you need. It may take some time to gather enough ingredients to make it 'perfect', though.\n\nI said I'd mention the possibility of plot, so here's where that comes in. Basically, there'd be three modes (assuming there is a 'plot mode'). \n\nOne mode would be a peaceful free-roam mode. Just ride where ever you want, explore everything, and since the map is so big, who knows that you'll find if you look long enough.\n\nThe second mode would be a hunting mode. This would add creatures for you to find and attack, both hostile and non-hostile. (The non-hostile creatures might be available to hunt in peaceful mode too). It might look sort of like Monster Hunter, but with horses.\n\nThe third mode would be the 'campaign mode'. Whatever plot you wanted, that's where it would be. Like I said though, I have no ideas for plot.\n\n**Standout Features:**\nThe standout feature is freedom. As much freedom as possible. Enough to make a bald eagle weep.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\nPC is an absolute must. I imagine having oculus rift with this game would be an AMAZING experience, and steam workshop would be awesome too. It probably wouldn't be suited for any sort of mobile device, but I suppose that if there is/are suitable console(s), then those could work as well.\n\n**Extra Features:**\nA map editor, that would allow you make your own island. Map editors are ALWAYS a good idea.\nAlso, multiplayer, so you could explore the map with a friend or two. The ability to make a custom racing track at the base would also be a nice idea, simply for fun.\n\n**How To Credit Me: xRAINxOFxBLOODx.deviantart.com**\n\nOk, I've done my best to describe this. Ask me if you have any questions."

330y60,Mars,"Genre: First person adventure,  3D.\n\n[Action is set on Mars,  2 men were sent there as a part of Mars One]\nYear 2067. 40 years since  we’ve been sent here. Supplies are running out, so does my energy. Josh couldn’t cope with this any more and gave up. Yesterday, he walked away and never returned, I think he’s gone forever now.\n\n[Shows the box]\nIt all started when we found that strange box. I don’t know what to do... I, I feel like it’s controlling my mind, I feel it’s energy, it’s eating me from inside... [Fades to black screen slowly]\n\n[Flashback, a usual Mars day]\nIt happened on April 18, 2035. We had an order from Earth. A commander told us that they spotted some unusual activity near our base. Josh and I went down the hill to investigate that area. After hours of unsuccessful searching, we decided to return back, as it’s been getting dark already. Then, all of a sudden, a light above us appeared. The light was so bright and blinding that I couldn’t see the source of it. The last thing I remember was me falling down and losing my consciousness. On the next day, when we woke up, we did not remember anything and returned to the base in a peaceful silence. Guess what we saw in our “house”. A box. Contacting commander about this issue was no luck. Connection to Earth is gone. Completely. From now on, it’s just me and Josh. Two forgotten astronauts should now find their way to survive in this harsh and vast place.\n\nStrange things are happening. I hear voices. They whisper something to me, but I cannot understand them. I haven’t ever heard a language like this. Aliens? Ghosts? I don’t know.\n\nIt may be a good start for a story. The game should lead the player through story like in Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\n\n"

32x81k,I think i have the best idea for Ubisoft,Make a standalone farcry game like Blood Dragon but it will be based on the upcoming fighting/comedy/kickass movie Kung Fury
32x0lv,A video game based around the twisting of mobility,"Basically, this video game would be a multiplayer fps, much like your Halo's or CoD's, except for the fact that the major mechanic the game is based around the flip or twist of mobility in combat. \n\n\nWhat I mean is that your character begins the match in a suit of armor, much like a mech's, which is extremely mobile, giving you the ability to jump three stories high, run across walls, move twice the speed of a sprinting man, et cetera. However, you cannot actually shoot or engage in any physical combat while in this mobile mode and you can be killed by the slightest touch.\n\n\nInstead, to initiate combat, you must switch to an aggressive mode, where the suit sends all energy to to shields and moves parts from the legs to the armor, giving you actual protection and slowing you to a crawl.\n\n\nI came up with this idea, largely because of the simplified formulas that FPS's, such as Halo, are following now, where skill is actively discouraged to try and get noobs or young players to try it.\n\n\nBeing part of the original Halo era, I loved the skill based games, and I don't believe anyone is willing to go back to them as they seem rather dated in their mechanics.\n\n\nThis is what the whole power suit is designed around. You will have to actively manage speed and verticality with combat abilities. There will be no aiming mechanics besides basic aim assist for consoles to ensure aiming skill is not jeopardized. Shields will be extremely useful. Unlike most FPS's (I'm looking at you CoD!), your shield will ensure that one man cannot outgun 4 people simply by seeing them first and spraying. Unless caught without changing your suit's function, you will be able to (if you can react) attempt to turn the tide, and a significantly skilled player could take cover, change functions, rocket to the top of a building and get some distance before returning with an advantage.\n\n\nWeapons would spawn around the map as attachments. These you will place on top of your default auto cannons, which are quite weak.\n\nWhat do you think?"
32wwl4,Real Life Exploration Game,"Have you ever walked outside of your neckbeard cave and seen how beautiful real life forests are, the sounds the trees make... The textures on the ground? \n\nI want a game where it's just PURE exploration on a massive scale, everything handplaced to look like real life, realistically. No animals. Only sounds. Maybe some cool/creepy easter egg sounds but that's about it. "
32wh1t,#ab Punk vs Punk MOBA / RTS blend,"**Intro**\n\nAs a fan of RTS games and alternate timeline stories, I would love to see a game where alternate realities duke it out in a MOBA-style arena while minion flow and control is managed by players rather than computers. I will try to be as descriptive as possible and will gladly accept any feedback that this subreddit is willing to provide.\nI also hope that despite my occasional use of LoL-style lingo, this concept does not become a ripoff of that particular MOBA in any shape or form. The unique selling point will always be the asymmetric gameplay of RTS and MOBA combined.\n\n**The Concept**\n\nPlayers will be fighting with champions in a 5 on 5 match, with a sixth (and seventh) player controlling the opposite bases. These sixth and seventh players will use the income that the battling players generate to upgrade their minions and determine the minion flow as you would in an RTS. They will be able to focus minions towards a particular lane and will have to make sure that their base is properly defended, with the help of their MOBA'ing allies.\n\nThe 10 other players will fight for supremacy and lane control, they are allowed to select champions from any particular timeline, even if their current base leader is playing a different one.\n\n**The Timelines**\n\n*More will be added as they are suggested, and all material mentioned will be used for reference*\n\n* Steampunk *think* [Rise of Legends](http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/25/24889/vinci_-_regular.png)\n\n* Dieselpunk *think* [March of War](https://d3fr1lzgb9f26y.cloudfront.net/images/ScreenshotWithText_02.jpg)\n\n* Cyberpunk *think* [Command and Conquer](http://media.moddb.com/images/games/1/1/196/cac31.jpg)\n\n* Solarpunk *think* [this](https://41.media.tumblr.com/5efb9514568fb0af605455a65287acde/tumblr_na42u3YMgH1s1rw00o6_1280.jpg)\n\n* Atompunk *think* [this](http://abload.de/img/1400529077140wckvj.jpg)\n\n**Timeline Abilities**\n\n*Every timeline will have one unique gameplay mechanic based on a characteristic from their world.*\n*A few examples are:*\n\n* Steampunk *Gentleman's Warfare:* Straight up march and fight, like any other MOBA. Will most likely be the tutorial faction.\n\n* Dieselpunk *Blitzkrieg und Sitzkrieg:* Can replace destroyed turrets with (weaker) entrenched minions.\n\n* Cyberpunk *Hivemind:* Minions can halt their advance to power up turrets in lane. (Credit to my little brother for this idea!)\n\n* Atompunk *Monorail:* A monorail spans across half of the battlefield, troops can be evacuated and transported at will.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is everything I could think of at the moment, I will continue to add to this idea in the coming weeks, hopefully we can make some waves with the concept!\n\n~ Jochmen\n\n"
32w3g8,"Life (Title May Change), Someone Pick this up, will make alot of money.","My mates and I camped out at an illegal water tank and spent the night smoking green. Kind of Far North Queensland, we came up with an idea that would reflect the dark side of growing up as a teenager. Alot of inspiration from Bully (The Game) and the Grand Theft Auto franchise.\n\n• Before I continue, this idea is copyrighted. Entirely by myself and my partner •\n\nThe game revolves around a single player story line, (multiplayer features would implemented later when the game would be more budget able), the map would be somehwat revolutionary in a sense. This sort of first person, 3rd person game would make such an impact on gaming itself. Each major country in the world would \nhave a poll of which country/village/city would be replicated through the game.\n\nEXAMPLE - Australias poll, people have put down the cities, towns that they want the most.\n\nThe Top 3 at this current time is;\nMelbourne Sydney and Tropical hotspot; Cairns\n\nThese 3 would be implemented into a server, the game would be so stimulating and entertaining. Everyone living in small communities would experience bigger communities. The game would be like wild fire.\nThe city would then be created by a team mixed with developers and professional artists, and then various ages of artistic people from said area. The inner view of Cairns would be put into there, when the developers would ask questions on; What did the corner store cashier look like, and then familiarisation of common local/ \nwell known elements of your day to life.\n\nAnd then as the game would become more popular smaller communities can play together; ""Oi, Damien! Come play _____ tonight."" Like portraying your friends through this virtual aspect to basically play GTA online in a sense.\n\nBigger mega servers like New York would be packed with Touristic/ Fun/ Dark elements. We are going so fast already, haha. This is purely and mainly common speculation of how the game would go. Before I jump into 10 years of brutal technology and computer burning graphics let me begin on what I dream of now.\nThe game would base around growing up and the dark elements would portray how their lifestyles went. Everything is affected by what your character does, what the characters around you do, judging on your maturity of believing what you hear. How your character interacts with other characters, for example; if a father figure was abusive to the mother (you'd be playing child (14 years of age), would grow up hanging out with bad kids, his mom drinking and smoking alot). An then, you'd grow up from then. So if you were playing missions such as ""Meet Tom, 3 blocks down from the nearest star bucks to pick up the weed."" You'd have to take into account everything you had done, if you saw your teacher walking down the street you would duck into an alley to avoid questioning as to why your not at school.\n\nAnyway, this is just the beggining of my ideas, this is purely from me and my partner hasn't contributed. We will be sharing more soon, Also if you have any ideas, suggestions, videos please comment them!"
32vq7l,Deep in the Woods,"Name\n\n""Deep in the Woods""\n\nConcept Overview\n\nThe Traveler (i.e. the player character) must tend to a campfire to keep \n\naway the spirits by venturing into the darkness and collecting wood while \n\navoiding the spirits.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Traveler is traveling through a forest when night falls. He must survive \n\nuntil sunrise. (I'm not so sure about plot details, but I'd like to include \n\nsome dark stuff of the sort seen in the indie game ""Lakeview Cabin"", or \n\nmaybe some themes from ""ImScared"")\n\nSetting\n\nThe game takes place in a small clearing in a forest. Each forest location \n\nwould be different; in some, there may be small rivers, and in others, there \n\nmight be an abandoned cabin or a broken-down car. Such locations, while not \n\ncontributing much to gameplay, might contribute to the plot.\n\nCharacters/Abilities\n\nThe Traveler: the player character. He/she can run as well as walk (running \n\nmakes a lot of noise, walking makes a small amount of noise, and standing \n\nstill makes little to no noise). The Traveler may also cut down trees using \n\na hatchet and walk while carrying the yielded logs (attempting to run while \n\ncarrying logs will cause the player to drop the logs), or simply drop the \n\nlogs on the ground/ add them to the campfire. While not carrying logs, the \n\nTraveler may also look at a small mirror, through which spirits are visible. \n\nThe mirror may only be used to view the area directly behind the Traveler.\n\nThe Spirits: the main enemies. There is no way to combat or distract the \n\nimmaterial Spirits; they are only deterred from pursuing the Traveler when \n\nthe Traveler enters the radius of the campfire. When not in pursuit (which \n\ninitiates when the Traveler enters their detection radii, and ends when the \n\nTraveler enters the campfire radius), the Spirits will wander randomly \n\nabout. Spirits are usually invisible, and can only be detected when (a) A \n\nSpirit passes through a tree, in which case the spirit will briefly become \n\nvisible, (b) A Spirit in pursuit of the Traveler gets within a certain \n\n""hearing"" radius of the Traveler, in which case the Traveler will begin to \n\nhear whispering which grows louder as the Spirit gets closer, or when the \n\nTraveler turns in the direction that the whispering (and, hence, the Spirit) \n\nis coming from, or (c) the Traveler uses the Mirror (explained in the ""The \n\nTraveler"" section). When a Spirit gets within a certain ""fatal"" radius of \n\nthe Traveler, then the game is over.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\n\nThe player plays as the Traveler, trying to survive until sunrise. The game \n\nis over if either (a) a Spirit gets within a ""fatal"" radius, or (b) the \n\ncampfire goes out (in which case all of the spirits immediately detect the \n\nTraveler and rush in without a campfire to dissuade them)\n\nStandout Features\n\nThis game combines gameplay aspects from both Five Nights at Freddy's \n\n(huddling in the safezone while watching out for creeps) with that of Eyes \n\n(venturing into the dark in order to collect necessary items while watching \n\nout for creeps); both playstyles are intertwined in this adventure/survival \n\ngame. So it's kind of a mishmash of a lot of different games. I guess that \n\nDon't Starve has already done something a bit like this, but I want to \n\ndistill the experience to its very core: only a campfire, a small mirror, and your wits to survive until daylight comes.\n\nPossible Platforms\n\nPC would probably be easiest for development purposes. While playing the game on a mobile platform would provide less than ideal conditions for full enjoyment b/c of small screen and small controls, making a version for Android/IOS might be a possibility in the future.\n\nExtra Features\n\nBasic idea of the game is that you are forced to choose to face your fears by the circumstances of the situation. It is possible to make a methodical approach to the gathering of the wood with minimal risk, but really, the game has a largely random basis which makes it difficult for the player to predict when a creep will detect you; the ghosts wander with no set patterns and no outward indication except for tree-shimmers and whispering, so success largely depends on the player's ability to keep their cool after they've been detected, stop to listen where the whispering is coming from, and evade the source of the whispering while also keeping their sense of direction and finding their way back to the campfire. \nSo, the game doesn't reward reaction time as much as it does impulse control and cool-headedness. Less ""quick, run away!"" and more of a calm, methodical, caution-based approach. That's kind of the reason I think that this is a bit like FNAF, because the game is designed to keep the player jumpy, paranoid, always looking over their shoulder, stopping and listening for whispering, while keeping the actual jumpscares scarce. That feeling is what I want in my game, and if you have any suggestions on how I could make that feeling even more intense, please do share them!\n\nHow To Credit You\n\nI'd like to have my reddit username at the bottom of the credits section. Also, I'd still like to be able to suggest ideas during the development of the game.\n\nQuick note: I'm not really sure about the plot right now, even though I have the gameplay down pretty well. I feel like the spirits should have some sort of personal connection to the Traveler, to make the plot richer. At least, I feel like the spirits should have some veeery interesting stories to tell. Again, if you have any ideas, can I plz haz them? Thanks!"
32utxh,Beginner. I'm making a game and need some creativity in the form of some slurs.,"I'm making a game for TSA (Technology Student Association, related for school so has to be E10)\n\nThey're not going to be generic insults. They have to relate with the story line of our game. \n\nBasically it's set in a world where technology and magic coexist and are sort of competing for dominance and complete social acceptance of one or the other. \n\nThere are little villages that are composed of citizens with different POV's on the whole debate, towns and people that use magic discriminate against towns and people that prefer technology And vice versa.\n\nSo as you walk through the respective towns they will be insulting the other half of the population:\n\n""those damn magic users"" (more creative and E10)\n\n""those damn techy's"" (more creative and E10)\n\nAny ideas? Also, if you could point me to a subreddit that might be more suitable for this kind of thing... Point away!\n\nThanks in advanced!"
32rhol,Runaway Slave Video Game,"I'm new to this subreddit and this is my first time posting, so please bear with me if I make any formatting mistakes:\n\nI'm envisioning this as a 3-D Third Person Stealth Survival Horror, where you're a fugitive slave attempting to escape to freedom.\n\nit's set in Colonial America during Antebellum Slavery\nI was thinking you'd play as a a slave and then could switch over to an Abolitionist\nAs a slave, you're goal is to escape to freedom i.e. The North\nYou're running for your life, you're being hunted by slave catchers with dogs.\n\nSo stealth would play a major part, you're not a ninja, or some other powerful character, you're basically an average person in dire circumstances. Combat is not the focus it's a last resort kind of thing.\n\nSo the game starts off at your master's plantation, you spend a couple days, weeks, this would be the tutorial, showing the controls and rudimentary systems, etc. You could play minigames (Cutting Sugarcane, Tending Farm Animals, learning the Alphabet-This becomes essential because the signs on the roads would be nothing but chickenstratch until you learn letters, you learn all of them you can readall the signs, maybe learning how to swim, picking cotton, etc.) You can gather supplies at the plantation (stealing food, acquiring a compass, maybe stealing a machete/or other farm implement to use as a weapon).\n\n You could try to convince others to leave with you but it puts you at risk since anyone could be a traitor and rat you out to Master. Then you make a break for it one night, the rest of the game would be navigating through country roads, forests, swamps, towns, etc as you try to make it to a certain point on the map where you can escape.\n\nThe obstacles in your way would include slave catchers, slave owners, Watchmen, Dogs, Law Enforcement and natural hazards like wild animals, poor weather, sickness, and injuries. Also you would have to make hard decisions think The Walking Dead Telltale series, maybe you come across a fellow escapee who's injured you could use your own supplies to help them or abandoned them.\n\nAlso a gameplay mechanic would be one for the dogs who can smell you, you can use pepper, or poisoned meat to distract them off your scent trailor cover yourself with mud to mask your scent, as to not alert them.\n\nthe slave would also have to scavenge for resources in the wild(hunt animals for meat, gather berries, etc), find shelter (shed, cave, etc)and i was thinking of having a basic crafting system.\n\nAlso instead of a game over screen or permadeath I was thinking this: Each time you get captured your slave master punished you severely, so much that it affects your stats. Each punishment would get progressively worse: 1. Publicly Whipped(bring down the morale stat.), 2. You get branded with an R (Runaway) this will prevent your character from using a pass(forged or real) 3. You lose an Ear, hindering you're ability to hear your enemies as clearly 4. Mulitilation-Loss of a hand, or a foot. This will keep your character from being effective at navigating and combat.\n\nNow when you play as an Abolitionist the gameplay changes it's not about sneaking to freedom, it's more about the choices you have to make to help slaves achieve freedom.\nYour decisions affect who gets caught, who lives, who dies and who gets to freedom.\n\nThe abolitionists vary since he/she can travel more places without having to avoid slave catchers or the like. Also you get access to era-appropriate firearms and melee weapons(Axe, Sword, etc).\nYou can raid plantations, gather intelligence about situations and characters, and even just buy a slave their freedom(There would be an economy system in place but you cant just buy every slave)\n\nAlso The Abolitionist would have a covered wagon, he could transport slaves in, it would be a whole system, with checkpoints where you can pass a dialogue check, bribe the guards, or use your pistol/rifle just in case things get heavy.\n\nThis is an ""extremely controversial"" and ""story-based game"" rooted in true events of American Slavery, it's an interesting way to interactively explore a period of history that doesn't get it due. \n\nAlso, perhaps historical figures could factor in like Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, John Brown, William Lloyd.\n\nMaybe include Bleeding Kansas, a series of violent political confrontations in the United States involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery ""Border Ruffian"" elements, that took place in the Kansas Territory and the neighboring towns of the state of Missouri between 1854 and 1861.  \n\n"

32pxbp,1 I hope this doesn't sound wrong but I want to earn some money but I don't know how (xpost /r/gamedev),
32pj9s,Me and a friend had an idea for Greek Mythology based Binding of Isaac style dungeon crawler. Here is the transcript of our conversation:,"Me: I would love a dungeon crawling game like TBOI but based on Greek or Roman mythology\n\nHim: oh my god\nthat would be amazing\nthat should be the next game\n\nMe: You play as an ancient Greek hero like Perseus or Hercules and you fight through a succession of dungeons as you descend through hades (to find your dead GF or something like in the tale of Orpheus) and all the bosses are Greek monsters\n\nHim: Oh my god yes\n\nMe: Or Gods, generous lashings of deicide\n\nHim: and the whole orpheus can't look back or eurydices dies would make the final level amazing\nmaybe multiple greek myths as the levels/\n\nMe: OEDIPUS LEVEL\nHAS TO HAPPEN\n\nHim: orpheus saving eurydices from hades? and he can't look back getting out after the boss fight\n......oedipus fight? isn't that basically the entire of TBOI?\npls edmund mcmillen\n\nMe: Well less Freudian, as in the actual character of Oedipus\n\nHim: ahh ok\nthe final boss would still be mom \n\nMe: imagine the Hydra as a boss\n\nHim: oh my god\nthat would be amazing\nperseus and medusa, how would that work?\n\nMe: you can only face her direction for a few seconds?\nShe fires at you from her eyes and you have to reflect her projectiles back with your mirror shield. Basically like the Ganondorf fight\n\nHim: ahahah that would be amazing seriously\nwould combat be tears based or arrows or sword or what?\n\nMe: Depends on character i guess\nWe must find McMillen and pitch this xD\n\nHim: oh my god yes\n\nMe: Hercules beats down his foes with his huge bulging olive-oiled muscles\n\nHim: ahahahaha\n\nMe: olive oil as an item xD\nincreases attacks speed \nand makes you 100% more homoerotic\nHermes's Sandals +speed\n\nHim: that would seriously be fantastic\n\nHim: odysseus on his return from Troy\neach one of his trials is a different floor\nthe sirens gradually pull you closer to them, the gravitational effect is stronger the weaker they are\n\nMe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_of_invisibility This as an item\n\nHim: ahh yes\n\nMe: Minataur labyrinth would be epic\n\nHim: oh my god yes\nand the silk thread from ariadne has to guide you through\noh my god this would be the best game ever\n\nMe: Final boss: Cronus\n\nHim: oh my god yes\nyou play as prometheus having been set free from his rock\nand have to rally the other 11 titans\nto overthrow the greek gods\n\nMe: Promethus would be awesome as a playable character. You could use fire as a weapon and when in need you can summon an eagle to peck out your liver (becuase somehow that would be productive to your situation)\n\nHim: ohh my god yes\ni think promethus would be the ""powers up by taking damage"" character\nlike Eve\n\nMe: Yeah and the eagle follows you around just like the raven does with Eve\n\nHim: ahhh omg yes\n\nMe: Do you know anyone who can programme? I would actually be interested in creating this even if it's just inspiring someone else to do so.\n\n[and then he directed me here]\n\n\n\n\n"
32ome0,Year 2200 Concept,"Brief synopsis: It's been 200 years since the war that ravaged the world, the world has started to come back but it's still plagued by the same old world problems. You play as yourself either someone from the military to someone who has lived out in the wasteland all their life, you can ignite wars between rival fractions you can change the wasteland and build it in your own image. The wasteland is an unforgiving place full of death, how long can you survive the horrors outside.\n\nNuclear shelters the player can explore them\n\nNuclear war\n\nMutated animals/people/insects\n\ncustomisable weapons for example adding attachments\n\nimprovised weapons for example a pole and a knife combined with duct tape creates a spear\n\nimprovised armour you can

represent your fraction you can place your insignia on your clothing or armour\n\nsurvival is important in the game because anything can kill you from people to disease\n\nyou can choose to do what you want for example you can choose to be an outlaw or a vigilante the options are almost endless\n\nmake-shift transport for example mutated cows or mutated horses\n\nyou character can carry a certain amount without a backpack which also factors based on the players strength stat which means the stronger the player is the more they can carry without a backpack\n\nyou can build up communities over time from a small group to a colony\n\nprison system in-built communities the leader of community can create laws for the community and decides the punish the criminals receive\n\npick locking locked door to can access to certain areas of the building or to open up chests\n\nthe ability to hack intact pre-war computers to find information about pre-war tech and loot cashes\n\ncan find bunkers which have been used for medical/social experiments you can explore them and find out what happened there\n\npeople in a democratic/ dictatorship would have to make laws in the game or to keep it lawless and let criminals run free\n\npre-war traps are in some buildings for example bear traps and land mines\n\nsome buildings are rigged with traps by tribal characters for example swinging log that have spikes that would impale the player\n\nno cars are available due to no gas/petrol so you would have to find alternative methods of travel for example walking or riding an animal\n\ntanning animal skins which can be used to make clothing\n\ngangs these would torment the wasteland for example raiders, savages, cannibals and many other different gangs\n\nnot much

electronic devices\n\nYou can reset traps after they have been triggered\n\nMakeshift weapon attachment half of a binocular+duct tape+rifle=scoped rifle\n\nThere is no endgame\n\nCreating tattoos either during character creation or during the game (traditional method) if you create a tattoo in game a mini-game appears where you have to keep your arm steady or the tattoo wouldn't look right, also you would have to use what you can find to create the tattoo but certain materials have consequences such as a high chance for infection\n\nThe trailer for the game will consist of two parts, the first part is a mysterious figure washing his blood soaked hands in a bathroom of his home and the second part which will be put in between sections of the first part which are flashbacks of what the figure did. The song that would be put in the background would be Johnny Cash's ""God's Gonna Put You Down"" or The Heavy's ""Short Change Hero"" both of those songs reflect that the figure can keep washing his hands but he could never run from the invertible\n\nThe inventory system will be very different than other games because of the no hud system the inventory will be on a notepad which the player carries with them and it updates when they either use, discard or pick up an item"

32o8ub,Requesting game ideas,"I am a beginner indie dev and I want some ideas to make a game, I use Construct 2 so i can only make 2D or top-down perspectives"
32nvmg,Endless runner idea.,"Honestly the idea right now is not as insanely fleshed out as i'd like it to be...it's really more endless runner-like, but it's the best thing i can consider it as. It'd be like a character being sent out to run missions in alternate realities. It would have shooter qualities, fighting monster like in punch quest, but with more of an environment exploitive method. The character can basically warp the current space he's running in, flipping entire environments upside-down, tilting it left or right, vertically or horizontally, which in turn would affect objects within the area. Boxes fly off into space, or hit enemies, slow down or increase running speed by making the run uphill or down...stuff like that. Each run would have pit stops that you'd get to tweak out permanent and temporary character buffs and powers. I don't think you'd look at it like a typical sidescroller runner, more like a little bit angled seeing further down the open road...what do you guys think?"
32mnv6,First Person Strategy Game,"This is similar to something they did years ago, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade, where you get to play a soldier on the ground in a Command &amp; Conquer setting.\nIt was a decent game but could have been better. If the hardware is good enough now, you could play as just a normal GDI or Nod soldier fighting epic battles with hundreds of other soldiers and hardware(tanks).\n\nOr apply this concept to other popular strategy games, such as Age of Empires, Starcraft, Warcraft.\n\nFor a game like Age of Empires, you could start off as a soldier and work your way up the ranks, and then somehow become Emperor of whatever empire you are apart of.\n\nWhile this sounds like the perfect multiplayer game, the focus would be more on the singleplayer, with mission objectives to complete and different storylines.\n\nSomeone, anyone, please make this type of game!\n\n "

32lst4,"A football / Soccer game (Because y'know, those exist)","Anywhere from a Beginner to AAA company could make this, it just depends on how well.\n\nBasically I was playing FIFA and realized that it lacked any sort of actually career mode. The career mode in game is shoddy and needs work so I thought of a cool idea.\n\nYou start out on a playground or courtyard in college or high school, maybe a short cut scene, where you are asked to play football with friends. depending on how you do in this match will result in how you continue. If your team loses then you play more courtyard matches as a training tutorial, if you win you get another cut scene or a message from the school (or whatever's) coach asking you to join the school team. after a season with the school if you lose the league you play another season, if you win you get scouted to a local club depending upon whatever location you picked or on however you wish to put teams. you are then in their youth squad and play a season developing your skills until you later become of age and join their first squad, first as a substitute and then if you play well enough as a 1st team player. and then you can go on to move team, become an international footballer etc. but hopefully by that time you've seen enough variety to enjoy yourself. And depending on the developers you could also make a range of off pitch scenes where it affects fitness, moral, how much fans like you and general mood which all affect your player on the pitch.\n\nI know it's not the best idea but I thought it would be kinda cool to see some actual progression in a sports game and I can't submit the idea to EA so i'll show it to my peers. \n\nThanks for reading"

31rt1z,Hoboland: Multiplayer Urban Survival MMORPG type game,"**Hoboland: Multiplayer Urban Survival MMORPG type game**\n\n**Concept Overview**\n\nThis is an idea I had a year ago. You are a hobo, you live in a city, you build a shelter, start hobo camps, meet other hobos, start hobo families and mafias, build things from scratch. No zombies, no end of the world scenario, just you, a big highly populated city, and a bunch of other hobos.\n\n**Plot**\n\nGame like this don’t usually have plots, do they? Well, as stated above, you are a hobo, and your goal is to survive in a large city without being arrested.\n\n**Setting**\n\nVery large city, like New York, or San Francisco, or Sydney. The city will have malls, shops, apartments, office buildings, the works. And the city will be populated by npcs as well. There are no zombies or extraterrestrial creatures. Although you would have to avoid police, dogs, rich people, and other players. There is no end of the world scenario and the time period is set in modern day.\n\n**Characters**\n\nYou and other players.\n\nPolice - They will arrest you for various things, such as dumpster diving, loitering, murdering or harming NPCs, stealing/pickpocketing, and contraband.\n\nDogs - dogs with collars will attack you if you get near their territory, dogs without collars can be kept as pets and trained to help you defend yourself. Dogs cannot be killed by players, your only option is to run.\n\nOther animals - Pigeons, rats, mice, seagulls, and others will be killable for food and materials. Pigeon poop can be used to make throwable objects that will temporarily blind whoever it hits.\n\nRich people - and other certain NPCs such as shopkeepers, homeowners, parents, and witnesses will call the police if you do anything illegal.\n\n**Abilities**\n\nThese are a few I can think of off the top of my head\n\nDrunken Rage: Raises your strength and stamina by 20% for 10 minutes, but after that they drop to 50% and will take some time to recover (but can be sped up with food and water)\n\nSuper Stealth: Can be gained with certain (rare) items of clothing and makes you undetectable by NPCs\n\nHard Head: Can be gained by combining any hat item with a rare material and makes headshots to you 20% more likely to fail.\n\nFamily Bond: Can be used with up to 3 players registered in your Hobo Family. Combines the players health and strength stats if the three are participating in a hunting posse. Stays until the group is disbanded.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics**\n\nCharacter creation: Choose from a wide range hairstyles and colors, facial features, skin colors, gender, age (as low as 18 and as high as 60), and a smaller range of clothing. Also name your character. Your IGN will be displayed below your character’s name so multiple people can have the same name for their hobo.\n\nBasic MMORPG type stuff, build skills and stats, gather materials to make stuff, interact with other players and gain positives from being in a group, buffs/debuffs, servers you can play on, single player if you desire, multiple game modes.\n\n**Standout Features**\n\nHobo Communities: Once you’ve managed to claim an area and set up camp there, you can choose to register that area as your community, you will become the leader and you can register other players to be within your community and start your own little hobo government. You and your government can vote to demote, promote, give jobs to, and banish other players in the community.\n\nHobo Mafia: If communities are too much for you, you can start a Hobo Mafia and register other players to take part in raids, hunting, and standoffs with other mafias.\n\nHobo Families: can be achieved through Hobo Marriage and Hobo Adoption. Marry a player you’re particularly fond of (age and gender don’t matter) and/or adopt other players as your “children” (minimum of 6 years younger than your character). Your family can participate in raids and hunting, but not standoffs.\n\nPVP mode: For people who like to play survival and be able to fight other players.\n\nPVE mode: For people who just like the survival concept of the game. (Raiding is still allowed on unclaimed land. Mafias cannot be started in this mode.)\n\nMafia mode: Join a team to participate in a standoff. Has three experience levels.\n\nSingle player mode: For those who want to play a game without fear of losing progress.\n\n**Possible Platforms**\n\nPC, hands down. This might be too big for PS3/PS4/Xbox. Could also be available on steam so long as there is no early access.\n\n**Extra Features**\n\nDumpster Diving: dive for materials, you might find a rare item. There are 3 places you can dive, local businesses, commercial businesses, and malls. Local businesses have little chance of finding rare items, but little chance of getting caught by police or other NPCs, commercial businesses have a moderate chance of getting rare items and a moderate chance of getting caught, malls have a higher chance of getting rare items, but higher chances of getting caught.\n\nScavenging: rather than punching the shit out of trees and buildings to get items, you have to scavenge for them around dumps, construction zones, and houses. Or you can just raid another player.\n\nCrafting: No crafting table required, but it does help you craft faster. You start out with a set amount of recipes but as you build your crafting skill you unlock others.\n\nWeapons: You can’t exactly make flamethrowers, but you can make really funny looking, but usable, makeshift weapons. Anything can be used as a weapon, sticks, branches, pipes, rakes, planks of wood, rocks, yadda yadda yadda.\n\n**How To Credit Me**\n\nReddit: HatCoffee\n\nSteam: MagnetoMagica\n\nYoutube: StishStash\n\nTumblr: Unisex-Muffin"
31r1us,3D Liero (Like Worms but in real time).,"[Liero](http://liero.be/) is a game where it's just two worms in what looks like an ant farm. You each choose 5 weapons out of a LOT that you can choose from. To make it balanced, each weapon has a reload time between each shot.

31piat,Reforge: FPS with Fabrication,"**Name:** Reforge\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nA reasonably conventional first person shooter in the vein of Blacklight Retribution or CS:GO, likely TDM as well as CTF or control points, with a focus on a weapon fabrication mechanic.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe year is 2281, and the world is broken.\n\nFive months earlier, a spaceship known as the Arcera crash-landed in the Ural Mountains, detected by the International Defense Federation (IDF).\n\nThe Arcera, according to intelligence, was an alien colony ship, but little remains of it today - on crashing, it spread Shards across the globe.\n\nThe Shards, at first, were a boon - they radiated energy harvested easily with special coils, and flaked off a powerful but extremely strange metal termed ""Arcerium"".\n\nBut then, after months passed, the Shards began to explode, one by one - cities leveled, forests toppled - nothing could survive within their blasts.\n\nThe world collapsed into silence, but then rumbles began.\n\nThe IDF, attempting to bring humanity back into the light once more, assembled squads of engineer-soldiers to go into the ruins and retrieve materials and technology to rebuild the ruins of civilization.\n\nProblem is, someone beat them to it - the former residents returned and took advantage of the very same technology, arming and armoring themselves. Guardians, they call themselves.\n\nAnd now comes the crux of the problem: just prior to the explosions, a scientist discovered that Arcerium could be used to create devices capable of pulling a dead person's matter back to a chamber and reforging it into a live person once again.\n\nNow, both sides have this capability, limited only by the power the Shards can provide. Eternally reforging themselves, reforging weapons from the rubble of the world, on and on.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nPostapocalyptic  - ruined buildings, broken world. A few ideas for maps:\n\nJuncture - Train station split at an angle by a Shard. TDM or CTF would work well in a map like this.\n\nOperations - IDF forward base in a former residential district. TDM or control points would work excellently here.\n\nMall - Guardian stronghold in a heavily damaged and walled-up shopping mall. Again, could be nice for TDM or control points.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nAbout the same as any FPS - shoot people with a gun. Features that would be nice to have would be IFF (identify friend or foe) capability, a view-through-walls system similar to Blacklight: Retribution's Hyper Reality Visor or Titanfall's radar system, and a 4 player co-op mode as one faction facing off against waves of others in a large area you must roam to find resources to use.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nAll of your weapons, ammunition and armor are fabricated out of materials you obtain, each material lending different capabilities to different weapon components, armor, et cetera.\n\nDifferent materials would yield different stat bonus effects on different parts, enough to make a difference but not enough to give you a huge advantage over someone running ""stock"" materials.\n\n**Please note: If you want a chart of material benefits and downsides, even if you're making this into a mod instead of a full game (somehow), I will provide you with one - comment and/or send me a PM to get it.**\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nPC would be best for this, in my opinion (you'll be designing your weapon from parts) but consoles would likely also work.\n\nThis would NOT work well as a mobile app, unless it were a 2d top down shooter with different mechanics but the same ""build things from materials"" core feature.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nCredit Kubius for the material system."

One person, the ""president"" or leader, will design the cities, lay out roads, plot buildings and manage finances. Then you have people doing separate jobs. You have truck drivers who deliver resources, shop owners who fuel the economy, builders who build, farmers to provide food and resources, there are many opportunities.\n\nImagine a city begins, and the leader has plotted a house next to a road. Truck drivers deliver brick, mortar and building materials to the site. Then, builders come along with diggers and scaffolding, they build the house. Now lets say that someone playing a shop keeper can occupy the house. The builders and truck drivers then build factories and shops. People can work in these places.\n\nYou can pick any role at any time, the point is not to have a good character, but a good city. If your city or country needs food, maybe more people will be farmers, if it needs money, more shop keepers and factory workers.\n\nIt's the ultimate simulation game."

31l5di,A Zombie Apocalypse Game Like We've Never Seen.,"This is my first time here, so I apologize if I break any rules but I've had this idea floating around for a long lasting game that I think everyone has been clamoring for. I'll break down the game by plot and etc, but first I'll cite my inspirations: State of Decay, Skyrim, Simcity, Civilization, XCOM, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Star Wars the Old Republic, and Mass Effect.\n\n**Name:** Untitled.\n\n**Setting:** Deserts, Valleys, and Forests of Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n**Plot:** You play as a 22 year old senior college student (your major is up to you) living in an apartment near campus with your girlfriend/boyfriend when the unthinkable happens. A zombie apocalypse has spread through the streets of your city and the government has just lost all control. Quick thinking you pack up with your S/O and head to your parents house, carefully avoiding zombies and military along the way. Once there you're faced with the choice of leaving the city behind or staying until this all blows over. \n\n* If you choose to leave the city, you pack up and make the journey north of the city to find shelter in the wilderness where water is abundant and heat isn't an issue.\n\n* If you choose to stay in the city, you fortify your parents house and begin the long haul of waiting out the storm.\n\nThough you have the two choices of leaving or staying, you ultimately leave for the Northern Arizona area. The advantages of leaving early is that you lose less survivors to zombies, and you have a jump start on finding a new place to call home. While the advantage of staying is having a large stock pile of supplies built up making the trip a lot easier with less stops.\n\nLike I said ultimately you end up North, where you choose a fortress of your own choosing to survive the waves of zombies. Once your fortress is chosen, the object of the game is to simply survive through a mix of turn based strategy building, and first person/third person scavenging/combat. Through this time you can let more survivors in (depending on your fort's size) or raid survivors for more supplies. This is a long part of the game that consists of Skyrim like scouting/combat, SWTOR like relationships with characters, and Simcity/Civilization like building of your fortress. The months past, and your success is directly based upon your ability to prepare for the long haul, i.e. farms, doctors, weapons, tactics, defenses. During this part of the game it is also possible to completely abandon your fort for another of a larger size. \n\nAnyways, the story kicks back in when marauders amass at the walls(or lack of walls) of your new home. The marauders heavily outnumber you, so you have to be wise with your decision and charisma as a leader. The marauders demand supplies, weapons, and if you have done a good job of building a nice fort, your fort. Your choices are as follows:\n\n* Fight the marauders, and depending on the training, weapons, and numbers of your fellow survivors you either fail or succeed in driving the marauders back. ----If you fail you are driven out of your fort and have to settle somewhere else. ----If you succeed the marauder leader vows revenge and will comeback with better numbers.\n\n* Surrender to the Marauders, through your grace and trade, the Marauders kick you out leaving most of your family unharmed but you have to find a new home and others are killed, with those alive questioning your authority.\n\n* Barter. You barter for peace and keep the marauders away buying you time to leave and avoid a future conflict or raise a better army. --If you leave the marauders will come to your new home later than other options. --If you raise an army, the marauders will not accept another barter trade, war will ensue.\n\nNo matter what happens you will still continue with the same gameplay as before (new home or not) but different. After this you can no longer change your new fort's location. Through your conflict with the marauders, you choose to walk down two separate paths: The path of the Marauder, or the path of the Savior.\n\n* The path of the Marauder means you rule your fort with ruthlessness and blunt force. You are king and no one disobeys the king. You gather supplies from killing other survivors or growing your own, however your growing rates will be slowed. Instead of plows, your people sharpen swords or make bullets.\n\n* The path of the Savior means you plan to rebuild humanity, and out live the rotting corpses traveling the wilderness and highways. Though you are sole leader, your council of advisors dare to challenge you and a democracy similar to that of the Romans ensues. Depending on your decisions your people either love you or despise you. New supplies are either traded for or grown with forge, farming, and crafting buffs applied depending on how much your people love you. \n\nNo matter what you choose, your reputation as a marauder or a savior spreads and it's up to you whether you want traveling survivors to find you, (or) you find them, or fear you. Here you design a city name, civilization name, and city sigil. \n\nMore building, crafting, fortifying, and surviving as random hordes, marauders, or traveling survivors find you. It's up to your how to deal with them through ordering your own soldiers to deal with them or handling it yourself. More months past and your population grows, stays stagnant, or declines, and then the leader marauder returns or finds you again. This time with a larger army and there will be no surrender or petty trade, you will fight.\n\nAfter this meeting your scouting parties might be ambushed by marauders, and maybe even kidnapped for ransom. Your city banners, signs, and outposts might be raided.  Zombie hordes might be directed at your walls. \n\nHowever it's not till a main story mission comes available that a nearby national guard base remains untouched, full of weapons, that you and a trusted survivor scout it out. Obviously you're ambushed, and your trusted survivor is kidnapped and held ransom, for your entire fortress. You obviously can't make this deal so a daring rescue mission takes place to which you succeed. The marauder follows you back to your fort and war ensues.\n\nYou must succeed, failure to protect the fortress, results in losing the game. However, depending on how well armed, fortified, stocked, trained, and (if you're savior) your people love you, will dictate how much damage is caused to your fort. If your ratings are poor the entire city could nearly be burned to the ground. If your ratings are high, you could lose very little.\n\nAfter the battle you have a savior/marauder choice to capture or kill the lead marauder. If savior, you will let your people judge him, and if you have a high charisma/love you can convince the people to exile him, otherwise the people will vote for death and you shoot him on the spot. If marauder, you have the choice of placing his head on a spite, a warning for all who try to mess with you. Or you impale the leader Vlad the Impaler style and he's treated to a slow painful death of impalement/eaten by zombies.\n\nAfter the battle and your respective choices, life pretty much resumes. Building outposts, bolstering defenses or offenses, and surviving with various dangerous missions that you can assign to others or carry out your self. But soon enough your new society/brutal infamy attracts the attention of that of the remaining American government, who have been watching your movements via satellite in Gitmo.\n\nThe remaining American government, tries to hire you to build and a mass a great sanctuary for all those left alive in the name of a new United States. Although the zombies are still around and their decomposition is speeding up, the gov fears something else like survivors killing themselves. \n\n* As Savior you are either weary of trusting the new President, or you welcome them as a loyal citizen of the US. \n\n* As Marauder you either, tell the President to fuck off and that the surrounding area is yours. Or that with the right price, your patriotism could be swayed. \n\nNo matter your choice a new mission is given to regain an observatory on top of a mountain to make satellite transmissions possible. During this mission you are ambushed by new, evolved zombies resembling that of various animals, snakes, birds, canines, and felines. It appears the zombie virus is not a natural occurring thing. When you ask the president of such occurrence, he lies that the virus is naturally occurring.\n\nDuring this part of the game your mission line is relatively the same as before. Stockpile, build, fortify, and grow. However this time these new zombies can preform all the same annoyances of the previous marauders. Also based on how curious you are about the virus, a string of missions are available to explore the zombie virus.\n\nUnfortunately, as far as plot goes that's all I got. Sorry if it seems too long.\n\n**Characters/Abilities:**\nThis part draws inspiration from Skyrim and Mass Effect. When performing missions you usually have a squad of 4 with you, all with unique abilities.\n\n*You:* Your abilities depend on what kind of student you are. Engineer, Pre-Med, Biology, Business, Art, or Law, each have certain advantages. Once you choose Savior or Marauder, three tech trees for each path open up. All varying in a kind of combat, leadership, and knowledge. \n\n*Other Characters:* Other characters are divided into three categories, squadmate, scout, or survivor. \n\n* Squadmates are like that from Mass Effect, Tali, Garrus, etc... \n* Scout are those that go on scavenging, building, or farming missions. They all have unqiue expertise but don't fight along side you.\n* Survivors. These are the people that follow you, and work under your rule. They don't really stand out just work for you.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThis game can get confusing because it is meshing so many different features so I'll split them up for you.\n\n*Fortress/City/Sanctuary Overview:* This is the overview of your city. Basically you watch from an eye in the sky view as survivors and scouts harvest/craft/build right in front of your eyes. You can do many things from, harvest crops, craft weapons, build walls/houses/forges/warehouses. Once you choose something to build/craft/harvest, a number of turns until completion will appear and show you how many turns(or days) until that task is completed. Some tasks will take longer than others, building a house may take 4 turns while, harvesting a small field of corn takes 1. This is likely where you'll spend a good part of the game. \n\n*Survival Missions:* While in city overview you will be prompted with Survival missions that you must complete, blow it off and your people might starve or die. This is also where story missions will be prompted. If you have high enough level squad mates and trust them, you can assign them to carry out low level missions which will take you a number of turns. During these missions the gameplay changes to your ""first-person shooter"" gameplay.\n\n*Scouting:* If you choose to go scouting, you will free roam the landscape much like any GTA/Elder Scrolls/Fallout game. Fight anyone you encounter or find more survivors for your city with different expertise.\n\n*Command:* Command scouts to carry out missions within the city or outside it (much like the assassin side quests in AC: Brotherhood). These will take a certain amount of turns.\n\n*Advising:* This is a sub-window within the city overview. Here you will listen to citizens, make laws, create policy, and also enforce the laws. If savior, here is where a lot of love is created.\n\n*Combat:* For the most part the game will be backwards compatible between first person/third person much like Skyrim. You will have access to a variety of weapons just as:\n\n* Melee: Swords, shields, clubs, bats, axes, etc...\n* Firearms: Assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols, etc...\n* Bows: self explanatory\n\nSince I'm dreaming and I like games with endless capabilities, the weapons archive will be insanely large with custom weapons and attachments for weapons possible. What's the point of an M4 with a rail system if I can't have laser sights, flashlight, noob tube, and slushy machine all attached?\n\n**Standout features:**\n\nThe point of the game is to never run out of stuff to do. Survival missions will vary depending on where you are in the game and will also vary in difficulty and terrain. \n\nAnother feature is that of a zombie game that feels like survival and restarting civilization. Yes things will take time, Rome wasn't built in a day.\n\nMMO capabilities. Some missions your friends will be able to join you online, in order to help you, or just have fun. I'm debating of dreaming up a way that you and your friend can share the society.\n\nFurthermore, PVP gameplay will feature attacking and defending each other's fortress (with no real in-game effects) and other multiplayer game modes. PVE co-op gameplay will also feature, survival against hordes and marauders.\n\n**Platforms:** PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nDLC can make this game endless with add-ons to the story and gameplay.\n\n**Credit:**\n\nLike I said I drew inspiration from already existing games but if by some chance someone would like to make this please private message me. \n\nCriticism welcome, as well as any questions. I'm sure I left some things out as I just word vomit all over my keyboard.\n\nEDIT: My grammar so good"

31jw4g,FACTION - Team survival deathmatch,"I was trying to imagine my ""dream game"" the other day at work, at have been slowly writing it out for a few days now. Here it is, please let me know what you think. I would love feedback and suggestions on this and would love to hear which FACTION you find most appealing to you and why.\n\nFACTION is a team-based survival deathmatch game where small teams of survivors are pitted against each other in a large post-apocalyptic city. Players choose a faction (like Planetside 2) and create their character, and can create their own subgroups within a faction. This game is influenced by games like ARMA 3's Battle Royale and Wasteland gametypes, The Last of Us multiplayer, Dying Light, and Planetside 2. I am obsessed with ""factions"" in games and the idea that each has their own style, from their looks to their in-game music.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**SETTING** (my current ideas)\n\nFACTION takes place in an unnamed American city that has been destroyed, along with the rest of the world's cities, by an apocalyptic event (leaving this ambiguous for now). Very few humans have survived the event, and even more were lost to the violence that broke out after the event. The majority of survivors now are those that have banded together and armed themselves. Four factions were carved out of the violence, each with a different goal in mind, and each of them gunning to destroy the others. The factions are (names are work-in-progress) the Dead Kings (DK), Silent Guard (SG), Arisen Tempest (AT), and Zero Fate (ZF). The city itself has largely been destroyed, with only the biggest and sturdiest buildings still standing. Outside the city's urban center, there is an abandoned suburban residential area, industrial zone of bombed factories and docks, and countryside with winding dirt roads and burned forests. These areas make up the 4 ""zones"", with the city in the middle and 3 outside zones evenly encircling it. Ideally, the full map would be similar in size to ARMA 3's Altis, and/or Planetside 2's continents.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**GAMEPLAY** (much of this is work-in-progress)\n\nFACTION is a third-person shooter similar in gameplay to The Last of Us. Players are dropped somewhere in the city with their team and a small amount of supplies and have to traverse the environment to gather gear and ammunition, all while the other team (or teams, could be 2-4 teams) is doing the same. Three Game Modes: Skirmish (1-3 players per team, one zone), Battle (5-10 players per team, two zones), and Campaign (20-30 players per team, all 4 zones)  There are key locations in the city where the most valuable gear is found such as a police station, hospital, sporting-goods store, and a mall, as well as valuable tactical locations such as a church tower, courthouse, museum, or any other tall, defensible building. To prevent entire teams from hiding, there will be four ""sites"" or ""camps"" in each corner of the map that can be captured to win the game.\n\n* Movement in FACTION is important. Whether you're creeping through a possibly-occupied building or sprinting to help a wounded ally, the way that you move is essential. Movement ranges from a a silent prone-crawl, a quietly crouched sneak, a weapon-ready walk, a brisk jog, and an all-out sprint, each making more noise than the last. The slower, more heavily-armored teams will produce more sound when they move. Players can climb over walls, jump across rooftops, boost each other to reach higher, and move certain objects to gain access or tactical advantage.\n\n* Communication in FACTION is of utmost importance. With communicating, a team member may as well be alone. FACTION consists of multiple modes of communication. Players begin the round only able to communicate via proximity or with a loud emergency signal such as an air horn, whistle, duck-call, or car alarm. Players can find radios in the city which allow long range communication, but are also noisy and can be spied on if an enemy finds your radio channel. Satellite GPS systems can also be found, which gives players a live position on the map, and allows teams with multiple GPS systems to mark locations for each other. Maps could also possibly be included for players to draw rudimentary plans and mark areas of importance.\n\n* Health in FACTION is designed to be realistic. A player can be wounded without being killed, but upon death, that player is gone and may only spectate his teammates. Players are wounded after 1-3 shots (depending on the weapon) and must be treated. Small wounds can be self-treated and the player will return to full-capacity after treatment, but more serious wounds may require the help of a teammate and the player may be hindered even after treatment. While gunshot wounds and lacerations require bandages or staples, fractured or broken bones (from melee attacks, falling from heights, etc) will require tape and/or splints. *A shot to the head from a firearm (that is not a graze) is a one-shot-kill no matter what.* Shots to the heart or neck can also be OSK from high-powered weapons. Food and water are not direct factors in gameplay, though it could be incorporated as a means of collecting XP or points to spend on gear for your player/squad in between games.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**THE FACTIONS**\n\n**DEAD KINGS** (pretty satisfied with this name. suggestions welcome, needs to evoke street gang/criminal activity that has overthrown previous leadership)\n\n* *Color*: Blue\n\n* *Description*: Originally a prison gang, the Dead Kings amassed what was left of various street gangs into one unified, dominant gang. After removing the struggling police/military force from their failed attempt at governance, the Dead Kings aim to take control and rebuild what was destroyed, but reshape it as they see fit.\n\n* *Attire*: Baggy clothes, prisoner's jumps, jerseys, ball caps, and bandannas. Dead Kings members bear unique tattoos. Can't find any great examples, but here's a couple to an idea. [sample 1](https://americanmexorist.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/spray-painting-gangbanger_40171_600x450.jpg), [sample 2](http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01014/SNN3019KIDS-682_1014873a.jpg)\n\n* *Music*: Hip Hop. Specifically dark gangster rap beats of the 80s and 90s. [sample 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdInAweNti0) [sample 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4vB73ETtdk)\n\n* *Gameplay*: The DK start the game with pistols, compact automatics, deadly melee weapons such as knives and brass knuckles. Though they carry weaker, short-range arms, they start the game with more ammunition and medical supplies than the other factions, as they have control of the cities remaining resources. The DK move quickly but are lightly armored.\n\n**SILENT GUARD** (need suggestions for this name, needs to evoke protection, influenced by military)\n\n* *Color*: Green\n\n* *Description*: After the surviving police and military forces were outed by the Dead Kings, they took to the outskirts to survive in the wild. In doing so, they found that many were already living outside of the city to be away from the violence. Hunters, hikers, and survival experts joined forces with the exiled military to form a group dedicated to guarding the people of the city from afar, and eventually striking back at the Dead Kings.\n\n* *Attire*: Camouflage, military/police gear, ghillie suits, boonie hats, [shemaghs](http://prepforshtf.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Shemagh.jpg), camo painted faces. [sample 1](http://wallpaperus.org/wallpapers/06/213/snipers-2048x1536-wallpaper-951114.jpg), [sample 2](http://i.imgur.com/g3CSPw9.jpg), [sample 3](http://i80.servimg.com/u/f80/11/73/19/04/360a_a10.jpg)\n\n* *Music*: Southern rock/grunge (still nailing this one down) Bass and acoustic guitar. [sample 1](https://youtu.be/zJS_al-QhBw?t=3m4s), [sample 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1iSxyWIblE), [sample 3](https://youtu.be/WikMc0zTByo?t=1m30s)\n\n* *Gameplay*: The SG start the game with scoped, high-powered rifles and carbines, stun grenades, tear gas, small sidearms, and a basic knife. Although the SG begin with powerful armaments, they have very little ammo and must make every shot count. The SG have armored vests and heavy camouflage, but move slower as a result.\n\n**ARISEN TEMPEST** (need suggestions for this name badly, needs to evoke chaos and upheaval)\n\n* *Color*: Red\n\n* *Description*: Anarchism. Those that resented the police, the government, or just their lives in general now have the opportunity to be free from it all. The Arisen Tempest oppose all who would attempt to impose any form of control on their chaos. Made up of previous anarchist groups, bikers, metalheads, and all other types of people seeking absolute freedom.\n\n* *Attire*: Think Mad Max crossed with heavy metal. Grungy, worn black clothes. The AT wear unique masks ([example 1](http://slipknotvideos.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/2/5/25250526/2322981.jpg?405\n), [example 2](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6232/6259586964_86a365a0b0.jpg)) at all times. Players could have the ability to create their own masks.\n\n* *Music*: Metal. I can't nail down exactly what type of metal I want for the AT, it just needs to be fucking hardcore, but not be so extreme that nobody wants to hear it. Here's some samples of inspiration: [sample 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B-WbbkIZTI), [sample 2](https://youtu.be/1ojFcMz9iAc?t=20s), [sample 3](https://youtu.be/H3ymNHnHWnY?t=34s)\n\n* *Gameplay*: The AT begin the round with shotguns, revolvers, melee weapons such as bats and pipes, homemade explosives, and firebombs. The AT are light on their feet and lightly armored, which combined with their slow-but-powerful weapons, makes them ideal guerrilla fighters who employ ""hit-and-run"" type tactics.\n\n**ZERO FATE** (i like this name, but open to suggestions. needs evoke a grim, doomed feeling. i like the use of the letter ""z"" here)\n\n* *Color*: Yellow\n\n* *Description*: (could use help fleshing this one out) The Zero Fate believe in nothing. They have given up on the idea that any good can come of this dying world, and instead have chosen to separate from it entirely. When the time is right, they will eradicate it, wipe it clean. They are the outcasts and misfits, the unwanted and abandoned, those who felt no purpose or place before forming the ZF. (I have also played with idea that the ZF's intentions are unknown, though that might being strange if players will literally be joining the faction)\n\n* *Attire*: Heavy cold-weather clothes and gear, all ZF fighters wear custom-painted gas masks. Inspiration for their looks come from images like this: [sample 1](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/072/5/d/post_apocalyptic_soldiers_by_drnafario-d7a0k6m.jpg), [sample 2](http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/a4/1a/a41a0b_864655.jpg)\n\n* *Music*: Electronic. Dark drum and bass/trance/house. Emphasis on the dark. [Trance sample](https://youtu.be/71j-u6Cj4iA?t=54m38s), [DnB sample](https://youtu.be/B4TNdnOYPRA?t=1m22s)\n\n* *Gameplay*: The ZF begin the round armed with old rifles and machine guns, homemade flamethrowers, makeshift melee weapons, and chemical grenades. The ZF have collected and recycled a large amount of ammunition for their aging rifles and can attack from decent range, though these weapons are not as powerful as their modern counterparts. The ZF's power comes from their terrifying homemade flamethrowers and deadly gas grenades (which necessitate the use of gas masks). The heavy gear carried by the ZF provides good protection at the cost of movement speed."

31g6ol,Add a MMO flair and a Game flair.,"Although MMO's usually are in AAA, it's not neccesery (maple story), and we are seeing so much in here, mights aswell make it a flair. The Game flair would be of games made by ideas in this forum (if it even happens)."
31ftdn,A worthwhile digimon game,"You start off the game with making some choices that reflects your personality, quiz-wise (like the pokemon dungeon explorer games) or just through everday activities (like would you rather play sports, read a book or call a friend this afternoon).\nYour choiches would determine which baby digimon you would get.\n\nYou would then get a free choice of what area of the digiworld you would explore (for some reason like getting home or whatever).\nThe evolution/digivolved state(it's rookie state) of your digimon would then be determined by the element/starting area you first choose to explore and it's baby state, so the player could help 'form' their digimon.\n\nDifferent choices such as the amount of used consumables, distance walked, items found, battles fought and dialogue would with your digimon's current species determine the next digievolution."
31dxnc,The game of Joshua. Looking for ideas and opinions. Good read,"Start in the kingdom of heaven. An angel of God. During the time of Jesus during a great battle with sin. God sends Angels to wage war with the creatures of hell, however not in hell or a final battle of any sorts. Army fights to victory with the powers of God. After the battle Rafael the archangel wishes to help jesus with the battle of sin on earth. God will say no, Jesus must make the ultimate sacrifice for the end to sins power on earth. Rafeal will go to earth knowing he can help but will be punished by God for his disobedience. In the 1st war Rafael had a powerful bow and arrow and a sword and sheild, with wings and powers God bestowed to him. Rafael gets to earth and has no glowing garments or wings but a tunic and a dagger. While first in the dessert rafeal fights small demons to get near the city. Rafeal can eventually go between the world of sin(dream like) and the world of the Roman Empire. Weapons change between the worlds and enemies as well. Heavens enemies of sin are black and grotesque being varying in size and attack. The Roman Empire fights rafeal for his loyalty to Jesus. Roman soldiers and gladiators. Rafeal with fight Romans along side of john the apostle and others. Including Simon of Cyrene. Angelic powers are lessened during the fights of earth but become more intense during the fights of sin on earth. Satan will send fallen angels to lead creating boss fights. These Angels can also take over roman soldiers to create super human enemies in the regular world. Holy relics and Items of Jesus life become weapons with unmatched power. Weapons including the scourge, the hammer used to crucify Jesus, the nails in christs wrists which can be upgraded in different ways. The spear that pierced his side, other holy relics can be found through out the time rafeal is on the earth. When rafeal banishes sin he regains light lost from disobeying God regaining the powers go gave him. The initial bow, sword and sheild can be reclaimed. Weapons of the dark can be forged from defeated enemies and armour varies from roman, to angelic to demonic. Sythes are unholy weapons along with clubs and obsidian weapons. Spears, tridents and mythrill are angelic weapons and regular roman weapons can be upgraded with elemental damage. The Pharisees of the temple are also enemies corrupted by fallen angels. Rafeal will never see Jesus alive but in the end will get the crown of thorns and tear of Joshua to recreate the bow in the initial war scene. The veil of Christ can be received from Mary of magdelin and worn as armour of light. After Jesus banishes sin remaining on earth in his death a cut scene will show Jesus constant war with the evil of earth that couldn't have been witnessed by those on earth. After seeing this it is apparent that Rafael helped Jesus to banish the demons back to hell. With Jesus death and resurrection rafeal is forgiven by go and given his wings back. This grants rafeal passage to hell to continue fighting with the demons and fallen angels. This part of the game becomes co-op with other angels(multiplayer) helping to slay the demons of hell. Wage war with friends but also play the campaign of hell to slay as many of those who rebuke God as possible. \nAnybody that likes the sound of this can kik me at matt_baud\nI'm having a good time brainstorming ideas for a game like this so hmu if you wanna chat haha"
31bsga,Are there any games where you play as ghosts/demons/outworld entities?,"Well, if not.. that would be my idea. Some possibilities of such a game I've already thought about, in brief:\n\n-Being awaken without any knowledge of why we have stayed on earth after death, and having to figure out the rest\n\n-Having the ability to influence our environment, without being able to communicate directly. Like moving objects, drawing signs or even taking control over people in some situations, changing their faith.\n\n-Watch other people, stalk them or help them.\n\n-This kind of game best to be open world or at least to a certain extent (like smaller open areas).\n\n-Might propose philoshophical questions. Like there are more/worse restrictions than only physical. You can imprison the body, but you can't imprison the mind. Twisted. You can move anywhere freely, through walls, though you are still naked, void, lost...\n\nThat is it for starters. What I really like about it that it puts things into a whole different perspective, so that everyday situations can be still interesting and exciting. Also can allow great freedom, but not that wild or abstract idea to not be able to make. Can be made in various different styles from cartoony-friendlier to dark-occult.\n\nAlso the title is still a question. If there are they might be good for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\n"

31855d,Léon: The Genesis,"**Name:** Léon: The Genesis\n\n**Concept Overview:** \n\n* A third-person shooter where you play as Léon living through his troubled childhood and teenage years in which the problems from a  hard home life and attachments to Sicilian mafia lead to an escape to New York, starting the story of Léon: The Professional.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe story starts with Léon' at 6 years old, his mother dying while giving birth to his younger sister leaving his father to care for the family. This loss resulted in Léon raising his little sister and protecting her from his father's growing bitterness and anger towards her. His father's hatred comes from the similarities she has with her mother that reminds him of losing his wife, the one person that kept him happy. This instability lead to his father's alcoholism and poverty from gambling failures. To support his bad habit his father turns to local unsavory characters that loan him money. Léon's (now 12 with his sister of 6) father loses this money too causing the thugs to come after him and his family. In the dark of night their crops and barn were set on fire in retribution which spreads to their house where Léon's sister is sleeping. She dies as he tries to prevent his father in one last fiery drunken rage from entering the house to kill her for killing his wife at her birth, for ruining everything. To prevent this Léon has to shoot his own father in a tearful gut wrenching confrontation. The thugs leave seeing as this kid did their job for them and Léon moves on in life. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second chapter has Léon in school as a teenager, perhaps late teens. He was taken in by an orphanage after the fire. He is alone and outcast by the other students at his school and people in the town. He resorts to petty crime in an effort to collect enough money to go to America and start over. A member of the group of thugs catches him mid-theft and takes a liking to him. Léon tries to distance himself from this ""Fagin from Oliver Twist"" type character but this relationship grows as he offers Léon more money for more difficult crimes in support of the gang's business. At the same time this develops, he finds a romantic interest in one of the girls from school. They find opportunities to meet in an effort to hide their relationship. Little does either know, Léon's love interest is the daughter of the local gang's boss. These two paths meet where they confess their love for one another after finding his girlfriend pregnant. Her father puts two and two together seeing the up-and-coming talent in his organization is the same kid who's been sneaking around with his daughter. The boss gives Léon an ultimatum, leave and never come back or die. Léon leaves but cannot bear the thought of leaving his girlfriend and unborn child on their own. He sneaks into their house at night and pleads with her to come to America but she refuses to go with him. Her father (the local gang boss) finds the two of them in his own house and throws a fit. He sends his thugs to take him out but Léon shows his developed skills killing them all before beating her father and threatening to shoot him for ruining their life together. Léon's girlfriend pleads with him, saying she'll run away to America if he let's her father go. Léon agrees and they flee the house. On their way towards the boat as its ready to leave the docks, the boss/father attempts to shoot Léon from afar but misses and kills his daughter instead. She dies in Léon's arms as her father continues his pursuit towards them. Léon makes it to the boat before the boss catches him and sails to New York. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn New York Léon meets with Tony (Danny Aiello) in Little Italy who, like the thug in Sicily, takes a shine to him. He manipulates Léon into becoming a ""cleaner"" for their organization. The final scene shows Léon alone in his apartment training and drinking milk (a result from his father's alcoholism and abuse). He is doing the only thing he knew how, what he became so good at. Being alone. Being a killer.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nMost of this story takes place about 20 years earlier than the film on Léon's family farm in Sicily, an area with small farms dotting low rolling hills in the Sicilian countryside. This is a rural area not well lit at night or developed technologically. Not far from there is a small town, an outlet or hub for over seas trade of the local gang organization. It also has the school and orphanage Léon attends in the second chapter. A bit further away from there is a larger metropolitan city where his father goes to gamble the last of their money away. This larger city is where Léon commits the crimes contracted by the thug in the gang. The bosses house is in the small town near Léon's family farm, a perfect get away from the polizia and investigatore in the big city. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe final part of the story takes place as Léon makes it to New York and starts his career working for Tony. This setting is represented in the movie. \n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Léon himself, stealth, agility, moderate strength\n\n* Léon's father, no stealth, no agility, (too drunk all the time) but a high amount of strength from working the farm\n\n* Léon's mother, incidental character, no abilities, although, I envision her being french, which is a bit where the character of Léon in the film comes from and why Léon's father held her in such high regard\n\n* Léon's sister, incidental character, no abilities\n\n* Gang thug (""Fagin from Oliver Twist""), similar to Léon which is why he takes a liking to him\n\n* Léon's girlfriend, incidental character, no abilities\n\n* Gang Boss, some agility, but a high amount of strength, like Léon's father\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* WSAD, standard movement / shooting / inventory mechanics, although I don't envision the inventory being large or complicated, more like a collection apparatus to find keys/things to complete puzzles like locks or bomb making materials required to move the story along \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* What prompted this idea was having just watched the film Léon: The Professional and playing through the video game Max Payne. Marrying the style of the game to the characters in the movie seems compelling. What Léon: The Professional was missing is the back story, which can be captivating when told using interludes of the voice over graphic novel style that the Max Payne video game became known for. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC/consoles, platform could be anything I suppose. \n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* I'd like to see some environment puzzles having to do with Léon's skill building through crimes and dream sequences where he relives the fire on the farm and the death's of his family members. These flashbacks help build the idea that Léon cannot be loved or love anyone else because his life is destined for death and destruction. \n\n* I do like the idea of bullet time. The movie portrays Léon as being exceptionally cool under pressure with quick reflexes. Although, I'd be disappointed if this was done in a way that didn't feel like it added to the character's strength and survival during game play. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nIf you're serious about this then how about my reddit name and a reference to this sub? PM me I guess, if you actually want to credit me in real life. \n\n**My part in this?:**\n\nI feel a need to point out I am not a game developer. I am a software developer (reporting/big data) and I'd love to do something different in my career but find little options for remote work (a requirement for me). I can't imagine where I would start on something like this. So, it's more or less just an idea I had that I'd like to see happen in the world. I had started with the dev kit from Remedy when they released it for Max Payne but that was years ago and the only experience I have in game dev. I did not get far into it either. At the time, I didn't know how to write code. If you don't mind me learning, then ya, I'm in. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh, and my apologizes for any spelling, grammatical and tense errors. I spent my lunch hour writing this out and don't have anymore time to edit. "
317zo0,A good Vampire open world game,"i got an idea for a game( i am german so pls dont blame me for my english :D) :\nthe game takes place in a mix of new york and gotham and you are playing a guy who was once a cop.after your life is going just like s..t\nyou are going late in the night into a bar and you get rly drunk but the bar is a hideout for some crimical vampires which are rly bad ass.... after some shots you are getting in some fight with a vampire who will infect you after,the point of the game is now that you find the boss of the vampires and kill him to get normal because you got some nice abilities from the bite but also the bad site from a vampire like you get dmg from the sun . in the gameplay you are able to climb up some houses and maybe even scycrapers and i think this would be rly cool, it would be like a mix of batman and gta or something like that :D\n\nif theres something you dont like pls tell me ^^ but pls dont shitstorm this if you dont like it :D"
317tqv,"A game where the ""criminal"" and a cop work together for justice.","I know, the title sounds cliché. But I will explain my idea.\n\nSTORY IN A NUTSHELL\n-------------------------------\nYou play two characters. One of them is a guy who is sued for a crime he didn't commit. He escapes from prison and finds a good friend of his, what brings me to the second character. (the escape and stuff takes a while in the game.)\n\nThe other character is a cop who followed the case of the ""criminal""(his friend). While his friend is still in prison he is working on finding the real criminal so he can get his friend out of prison. This goes with breaking in to other suspect their houses, and gaining information on Crime Scenes. \n\nI know this is a very early stage of my idea, but if you can develop this game, I think lots of people will play it. If you have any criticism, I would love to hear it. \n\nLord_Samwise."
317l36,MMO idea,"Hi,\n\nI have an idea for a game but other than playing around with the unreal engine for a bit I haven’t really got the skills or cash to build it, anyways back to the idea.\n\nThe game would be a gritty realistic medieval MMO, based in or something similar to the game of thrones universe pulling in some other popular myths, legends and stories into the game.\n\nLike the game of thrones universe the main race is humans, and while there may be small pockets of giants or other mythic creatures but they would be rare. The game would be based an island like the UK or Westeros and split into different areas with their corresponding families/rulers.\n\nWhere it would differ from a traditional MMO is that you would not have any levels. Each time you complete a quest/mission you would be rewarded with respect from that area and maybe other rewards such as food, money, clothes, armour, weapons. As your respect increases in an area or skill you have access to better quests/missions.\n\nLike Dayz or H1Z1 the game would be a survival aspect, but instead of zombies there would be wild animals, mythic creatures, Human AI and other players trying to kill you. Being a survival means that hunting or finding eatable food etc, may be the difference between life and death.\n\nAnother difference would be that your character would only have a certain number of lives, and after they have been used that character would die. At this point you would need to create a new character which would inherit some of the respect you have earned, gold/items left in stores and banks and your family name.\n\nIf you steal or murder then your character would have negative respect, which would put a bounty on your head. You could then be hunter by other players.\n\nWell that's the general idea, what do you guys think?"
2zqmqe,Multiplayer Game Ideas?,"GUYS, Has anyone got an idea that a) isnt copyrighted and b) is a 3D Multiplayer Game??\nalso i would like it to involve as less violence (gun knives etcetra) if possible, like weapons could be cake or an old man you can summon that hits you with a cane or something IDK, Any CONCEPTS OR IDEAS FOR A GAME?"
2zqmcu,A Star Wars Action RPG,"My idea for a video game would be a 3D Star Wars Action RPG starting in 60 BBY then progressing all the way into 4 years before the battle of Yavin. \n\nThe game would start as the main character's future master as he and a team of other Jedi travel to Korriban, the main character's home (bear with me, some of you already know that Korriban is a dead planet at this age, but more will be revealed as the story progresses). The master who is originally a Pau'an Jedi Knight, discovers him as a child who is cared by former Sith Pureblood Slaves. The story progresses as most of the Jedi are killed and the main character's master escapes.\nYou then play as the main character as a youngling, where you learn to use the Force and wield a practice lightsaber (this is the part of the story where you learn basic controls). After passing the trials, you become and apprentice, where they take you to a stage where you fight other Padawans to impress your master (this is where you are taught more advanced moves, and for intimidation reasons, the main character uses a preset practice saber that has a red blade). After fighting a few opponents, a cutscene shows the main character losing the lightsaber and eventually winning against the last apprentice in unarmed combat. The story then progresses as you are the apprentice of the first character you played as, who is now a Jedi Master. Now as a teenager, you work with your master in several missions until he dies in combat and you are commended to Jedi Knight for fighting against waves of enemies. As you continue through the story of working for the Jedi Council, you are given a temporary apprentice, who then becomes a Jedi Knight as you rank up to a Jedi Master. Now in the main characters' late 30's, you are given another apprentice in the field of battle during the battle of Geonosis as the Clone Wars begins. You step into the shoes as a Master as you teach you apprentice more about the Jedi Code and testing the limits as a Jedi, from your apprentice being kidnapped by General Grievous to being caught in an ambush on Kashyyyk. The game later changes it's focus from fighting to a more dramatic controversy as your main character learns a secret from a hidden Sith Holocron in the Temple Library. As you play the game, your character begins to question the order until he finally snaps and turns against the people you have fought with. As a Dark Jedi, you try to find someone who can teach you the ways of the Sith, so you board the [i]Invisible Hand[/i] and face against Dooku, trying to reveal the true master of the Sith, you then meet Lord Sidious as a hologram who is reluctant to make you an apprentice. The game then flashes forward as it shows images of Order 66 being enacted. You are now one of Palpatine's most trusted bodyguards, you are sent on several missions to quell Rebel forces and punish ""wrongdoers"". Your missions continue until Sidious decides to betray you, using the Rule of Two as an excuse to execute you, you are then pitted against Vader where you, of course, lose and escape from the Death Star. Now as a fugitive you are wanted man where you are relentlessly pursued by Bounty Hunters and Imperial Officers. As you travel in a beat-up ship, you gain an astromech droid as an engineering companion and find out that your old apprentice is actually alive, forced to work as a slave for a Hutt, you diplomatically retrieve your old apprentice, knowing that any sort of violence will only attract attention. With your old apprentice, she does not trust you in any shape or form but will obey you as you have done her a favor of freedom. The game then changes as you then join the Rebellion and lead several missions against the Empire. Where the game ends after the destruction of the Second Death Star.\n\nThis Star Wars game takes place on some of the more important planets known to to the Lore: from the shining City of Coruscant to the Deserts of Tatooine to the dark thunderous environments of former Sith planets like Dromund-Kaas. The game mechanics will prevent access to some planets as Jedi and Sith. As a Jedi you'll be temporarily restricted from Separatist-planets such as Dantooine and Mandalore. As a Sith, you will have more freedom until you become a fugitive, where you are usually restricted from planets with very strong Imperial Influence like Imperial Coruscant. \n\nMost of the characters in this game will be the people from the movies, animated TV shows, and books such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, Ahsoka Tano, C-3PO, R2-D2, and of course, Yoda and Palpatine; but the more influential characters will be your master and apprentice. \nThe Master: A Pau'an Jedi who you play as in the beginning of the game, he is then the master of your main character until his death by enemy soldiers. He wields a yellow-bladed lightsaber and wears dark red Jedi clothing. Your Master is typically pragmatic and has the mindset of a merciful Grand Moff Tarken.\nThe Apprentice: a female Human Jedi who you receive in the mid-section of the game. She is usually childish and the main character is frequently annoyed by her behavior. As a Sith, your apprentice is more quiet and much less innocent than her original self. She uses a purple lightsaber and wears light armorweave clothing.\n\nGameplay mechanics: The game takes on the approach of Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor, Assassin's Creed, and Mass Effect. You are able fight with almost any weapon, albeit temporarily, and are able to block or fluidly counterattack when pressing a certain button, these counterattacks can chain into a multi-numbered combo, increasing damage as the combo rises. When using a blaster, you shoot in third-person mode as will be forced to drop the blaster when your ammunition runs out. Of course you will traditionally use your lightsaber, which you can completely customize it's hilt and color will limitless possibilities and freedom. When on a mission to capture targets of value and cannot find them, you are able to use Force Sense, in which the entire screen goes dark except for people, who are highlighted blue; targets, who are highlighted green; and hostiles, who are highlighted red. There are optional missions in which you must complete according to it's specifications, these missions can take place on different planets and you are able to use your ship to travel to these planets and complete. \nAs a Jedi or Sith, your influence around other unimportant NPCs are run by Charisma (Jedi) or Fear (Sith), these two things are the key to helping you level up faster and finish missions more quickly, some examples include a high Charisma level will allow you to freely use other peoples speeder in a chase mission, or a high Fear level will spread a crowd from a hiding target as they are aware of your presence. \nWhen using a lightsaber or other bladed weaponry, you are able to use each of all seven Lightsaber forms, each of them are able to be used according to a given situation; you can use Shii-Cho for fighting large numbers of enemies, Soresu to increase your blocking ability, Djem-So for strength, Ataru for speed, Makashi for fighting single opponents, Niman and Shien for ranged enemies, and Juyo against other Jedi and Sith. \nWith the Force, you can use abilities such as Force push, pull, lift, etc.. As a Jedi, you are limited to these choices. But as a Sith, you can use abilities such as Lightning, choke, Convection (which is the ability to set your hands aflame and deal more damage), cryokinesis (draining life w/ ice damage), etc. ad nauseam. \nEven though the game is open-world, it still has it's own restrictions, such as borders, war, contamination, destruction, and the threat of being insta-killed when exceeding the boundaries. \n\nAlthough the game bears a slight resemblance to the Old Republic games, the thing that makes it stand out is it's endless possibilities and paths you can make in the game.\n\nIf this were to be made into an actual game, I would like to see this on Xbox One, PS4, and PC; also on any future consoles if this this became a reality in the future.\n\nAnd lastly, if someone were to breath life into this game, I would like get a message of my approval (as long as this game wouldn't be made by EA or Activision), check the story for any changes, and to be credited with: ""Inspired by the idea of [my name]"" somewhere in the credits.\n\nMy God, this was a long post, if only I could make this much progress on my English essays...\n\n"
2zow52,An RPG that spites the player,"Starts off with you country bumpkin typical protagonist, slowly gather group of friends from hometown and across journeying cities to help fight against big bad terrorizing the land and research methods of defeating him including finding the pieces of the mythical 'light crystal', sad to destroy evil. During journey, hears numerous reports of group of heroic knights and their commander with a legendary reputation from the capital sent to defeat big bad. Complete generic rpg quests until light crystal pieces collected and one important sounding quest leads you into an obscure dark cavern near the big bads reputed lair. End up meeting and fighting big bad in cavern, light crystal exposed as a complete myth by the big bad, is useless and all the foolish humans have been believing a fake legend from the olden days, and is disposed. Things happen, and your group ends up fighting for the big bad's side. Complete numerous 'gray-morality' quests for the big bad's faction that make you question whether he really is evil and emphathise with him. Eventually, heroic knights arrive and you end up fighting them with the big bad and his servants. They show extreme power, destroy many servants and come very very close to defeating the big bad, but you exploit their weakness (known only to you by way of collecting the pieces of the light stone and being human) to help the big bad annihilate them. Big bad now turns on you, you've done his work for him, he reveals how the gray morality quests you completed were in fact for evil purposes, how you were a fool for emphathising with his cause, and how you helped him defeat the only threat left (the commander and knights) against his faction by betraying your own people. Big bad, in a shocking twist, permakills some unimportant characters of your party (eg black guy, nerd, fat guy) with his extreme power. Big bad captures female love interest best friend from home town and male best friend from home town, you escape. You fulfill a prophecy and gain a legendary sword said to be the savior of humans. You pursue big bad to his central lair, where he holds your friends captive. You defeat his minions and appear just too late, to watch your female love interest best friend permakilled and male best friend transformed into an evil big mook. You're forced to fight your male best friend, and defeat him while the big bad watches, using the power of the sword after a long an arduous moral dilemma for the sake of the future of humans. You then try to fight big bad with legendary sword, but he uses his previously unseen power (subtly hinted at by various manuscripts, elders and runestones throughout the game, so you don't feel cheated) to deflect the swords power and then permakills you. Darkness then falls on the kingdom and the now weakened human settlements are annihilated."
2zngjz,Kin of Terra Firma-A Environmental Game Idea Like No Other.,"Now, before I begin, I would like to point out that this is NOT, I repeat, NOT, a sappy save-the-trees, humanity and technology bad, animals good, style-thing. Sometimes animals have to die for humans to live. I love nature and accept that fact (though, I don't like killing for sport). But, still wanting to save the planet and after a pretty long meditation break, this is what I came up with. Each of the game,s take place in a different real-life biome that makes up the world. When someone starts the game, they choose a animal that lives in the biome and are given appropriate clothing (and possibly weapons) to reflect this. They are then put in the world and can engage in PVP, fight wars with your natural predators and kill your prey for gold, a combination of CPU's and possibly actual players. Magic is measured with a golden number at the top of the screen that starts at 35 and increases gradually with every level, though spells do bring it down to 0 quickly. Speaking of which, the spells you can use are associated with what your animal represents in different cultures. Weapons are very similar, though their would be variation. I would love for this game to be first person but seems more inclined toward the perspective that Smite and WOW used, though if not first-person, leaning toward the perspective The Witcher used. Your health is represented by a little bar next to your mana at the top of the screen, and you level up in the usual ways. On the topic of wars, they are won after either a certain amount of territory is claimed by a side or after a leader is killed, forcing either a CPU or player to take their place.\n\nEach animal's kingdom is different and unique, based off their ways of living in the real world. Humans may or may not be put in, though they are animals, so they can join in the fun, with their own kingdom, just maybe they should be focused on a little later, but that's just my opinion. Your character may/may not swim, it really depends on the species. This is one idea I will soon come back to and expand on. So, whadda you guys think? What are your suggestions, opinions and feedback? Should all the biomes just be put in one huge game or should it be a series?"
2zlhhr,Bio in MMO?,"I thought it would be great if there's an MMO in which players are personified human cells and classes are the kinds of cells. For example, one class is the red blood cell, another the white blood cell, and another the neuron. I was simply thinking that classes in MMOs are the same everywhere (not that it's bad) and this could be changed. For the purpose of familiarity, a white blood cell player for example, could represent a typical warrior as white blood cells serve as defense against antibodies in real life. Red blood cells can be like adventurers or traders while neurons can be... I don't know... wizards? In this way, classes should have skills related to the actual roles of the cells while being similar to pre-existing classes in other games. Players can then choose to become cancer cells or something of that sort that label them as antagonists but enable them to become super efficient in leveling. However, cancer cells should be allowed to be killed by parties of other cells. Towns can have the name of body organs... Items might be cell parts or other necessary things for cells like oxygen... Does this sound like a bad idea? Too nerdy? I think it would be great and not too childish if it has cool graphics and story."
2zkszp,Mobile runner game - unique idea,"Hey guys, I was thinking to make a mobile infinite runner game, but with a unique mechanic : you protect the runner.In all mobile games of this kind, or most of them, you are the runner and try to avoid the obstacles, but what if , in this game, you have to protect him ?Lets say that if he collides with a box, he dies.In order to protect him, you have to move the box out of his way(kind of a telekinesis).Or lets say a laser will shoot the runner in 2 seconds, in order to protect him, you must block the projectile with the box.\nWhat do you say about a game like this ? Also, if you have more ideas, i'd like to hear them."
2zkoqf,Bomberman CandyCrush Mix,"How about a multiplayer game where u can put bombs as in Bomberman but the effect is that the Candys, which act as walls do flip (the 2 neighbor fields flip each other). If there are 3 equal ones in a row afterwards, they explode and u can collect extras. The match winner could be either the one killing the others or removing the last candy."
2zfv62,Superhero MMO,"I'm surprised I haven't seen anything like this yet. The idea is exactly what it says in the title. An MMO where you create your own superhero, choose your powers (They'd start off weaker but upgradeable so you're not super OP) and choose a city sandbox to protect and fight crime. You could maybe earn money from rescues (I know superheroes aren't supposed to do it for the money, but whatever) to spend towards upgrading your hideout.\nAlternatively, you could become a villain and make your own evil lair, and the game could be more like a Real Time Strategy as you position your minions (which you can create &amp; upgrade) around the city to pull off crimes, or do them yourself of course.\nNow the MMO part of it would involve PvP against heroes and villains. Of course you could just fight each other face to face, or the heroes and villains have to try and infiltrate the other's hideout or lair respectively, so you can install traps in your hideout/lair and have the option to fight your intruders inside your base.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Could it work? Has anything like this been done before? Considering I'm only just learning the basics of game design, I'd be happy for anyone who can create such a complex thing to use this."
2zfjat,Upgrading Damage,"My favourite game is diablo2, the best thing about it was the insane level you could reach with your weapons and amour. The fact is you can reach a level with your weapons it can slow you pc down to the point that it will freeze up. I  might have an idea, using metric prefix symbols. For example instead of saying your charactor can do a level of 1000. you can use 1G and instead of a level of 100,000 you can say 1k and so on and so on. If you think this is better let me know :)  "

2zcypg,Dynamic World; Platformer take place both 2d and 3d.,"**Name:** It can be mario and mirror edge combined.(a la)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* Game mainly played on 2d (prefer side view than top view), but the story will wrap you in 3d world. Basically we want the 2d the be desirable for player, the 3d world miserable. So the story should be Players not doing something right at certain timer and if not they will end up wrapping in 3d world to seek finish line. 2d world is simplistic , no complex ai . But when player get into 3d the whole world change ; difficulties raised.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nMC is on solo mission , where he need to group up with members. The mission is impossible , but you have to get there (checkpoint) for the meet up. On Your way through you died , but you gained a second chance(by unknown person , its like a dream). You spawn in 3d world (wake up from sleep as it should be), MC should be confused with this situation but decide to put it aside to get to checkpoint. Upon the meet up , your team get ambushed and one of your member are betraying you. here You will be warp back to 2d world (and have a little conversation with unknown man who throw you into 3d world in weird dimension)to escape. So your job is to find your way through to complete your mission and get out safely.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nCommando? Fantasy- Vampire? Pirate?\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* MC - should be a man within 28yo. Not as muscular but agile. Should be skilled to survive.\n* abilities to unlock : suspend timer , level jumper radar , temporal 2d world. and based on settings.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* depend on setting.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* 2d to 3d transition zoom with 8bit to beautiful 3d model also detail resurface in real time.\n* 3d world are open world. As player get into 3d world , the timer is removed(maybe expired?) as long as player get to the finish line(check point) the game will progress to next level.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* 2 player local coop\n* level jump.\n* AI behavior generator.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\n"
2zbqpw,Tumblr in Control: A TiA-base RPG.,"I'm thinking an RPG-like game that perhaps feels like Zelda or Fallout 1&amp;2 or Divinity: Original Sin.\n\nYou are a White Cis Male^^^^^TM living in a time where Tumblr's ""most extreme"" SJW are running the world. A time of persectution and near extinction of White Cis Men^^^^^TM. \n\nThe run a ""Utopian"" Authoritarian SJW-ruled world. If you don't say the right thing in certain dialogs, you might be be in for a fight. If you happen to trigger them, they gain power, but lose intelligence. I was thinking about abilities such as ""Gender Fluid"" which could temporarily disguise you as something the SJW don't want to kill. Like a form of stealth. Tons of potential. Maybe you could unlock kin-types which would give you awesome shit. Like Dragon-kin makes you a dragon.\n\nI think a Divinity: OS feel would be better.\n\nWhat do you think?"
2z9je4,"Something like a two-player Sims game, with AR/VR elements, but also fighting.","My idea for gameplay would be something like this:\n\n* Player 1 designs the starting environment, based on where they live, their house/apartment/etc. as well as an avatar based on themselves (for maximum realism and immersion) and other character information (weapon styles, type of inventory, things like that)\n* After this point, Player 1 is playing in VR with an oculus/omni treadmill/etc. setup in first-person mode.\n\n* Player 2 can control P1's environment, changing the shape of their home, moving things around, generally doing the things that a player of The Sims would do.\n* Player 2's actions cost an in-game currency/loot items that Player 1 gets from killing monsters.\n* Player 1 and 2 have to work together to get Player 1's house in shape to progress to higher levels, which literally requires progressing to higher levels of the now-modified house.\n* Other players can chain into the game, modifying Player 2's home and forcing Player 2 to fight monsters in addition to helping Player 1 progress, although any number of players could join into one mass session.  Alternatively, Player 1 can connect in-game to Player 2 and do the same thing, although that introduces less variety and makes for a shorter game.\n\nMonsters, new weapons and items, etc. would be generated through some form of procedural generation that combines different items into more powerful/different/more useful items.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes this was kind of inspired by Sburb from Homestuck, but without the whole confusing plotline (although I'm sure the Homestuck fandom would mod the shit out of this kind of game to add back in all the confusing/weird elements)\n\nEdit: clarified a couple things"
2z84o5,video game based on free enterprise on pc(1996),
2z5zfa,D&amp;D in real life,"So the main idea is a game similar to dungeons and dragons where there is a master and multiple people that try and attain their goals. It will be a sandbox at the base with the master manipulating the environment to enact the outcomes of choices the player makes. The player starts out very young, but able to make conscious decisions. The end goal of the game is to make a goal and then attain it. This gives the player a basically infinite range of difficulty and also many choices. Their goal is to achieve this goal by whatever means they deem necessary. You can work with or against other players in order to get your goal. For example, if you want to become a real life pirate, or Brad Pitt's wife, it will be possible. There will also be skill trees formed by the master to get the player more opportunities. The player can change his or her goal at any time. The game is going to be very hard to actually produce, but the concept seemed cool to me."
2z40wi,Mage game mario stylie,"I was thinking of a mage game platformer where at the beginning you pick an element of mage to be, then you play through the levels collecting items to forge new spells and mage items/weapons. The main enemies work be blood mages but since society doesnt agree with mages you fight humans but without hurting them, you would mainly use defnsive or utility spells to stop them from hurting you. There would be different classes of spells that do different things, offensive, defensive, utilty, illusion and healing."
2z3rc2,Twisted Space FPS,"This idea is about creating an FPS where space is not continuous and used over and over again without the player having knowledge of this. This means u can have a small house from outside, but when u are inside its a huge palace. windows of the palace would then be connected to the windows of the house. so u could really watch and go outside there. \n\nOr from outside its a common brickwall with a door, but when opening the door there is a corridor which u dont see before from walking around. It could also be the entrance to a complete insane labyrinth with loops that are not dead ends - such as u walk in a circular corridor which not gets back to the beginning but at the end gets out elsewhere.\n\nThe game could also come with a sandbox, where u have a set of corridors, rooms etc that u can connect to create a complex network.\n\nThe idea can be realized with heavy use of simple portals which should not be visible as those. They are there to really confuse the player about where in space he is. \n\nIt should not be related to the game portal as the player should not recognize portals as such and also not have a portal gut. If this idea above was already realized in some game, plz let me know."
34i222,Modern Day Dragon Survival Game,"I'm not sure if this game has already been made, but here it is.\n\n**Inspiration:** Game of Thrones, State of Decay, How to Train your Dragon\n\n**Premise:** It has been thought that dragons have been extinct for thousands of years, but one day (maybe year 2016-2018) dragons awaken and started wreaking havoc all over the world.\n\n**Gameplay:** Sort of a State of Decay type of game. Open world with survival mechanics like hunger. You scavenge for food and items. You could also work with other survivors and build a refuge base and upgrade it. Weapons range from guns to sticks. You could also catch a baby dragon and try to raise it. Dragon Riders!\n\n**Story:** Well I haven't really thought of a solid story yet. But you could create your own character, although he/she would probably have a fixed job or smth.\n\nSo basically a game where you fight (well more like survive) dragons and maybe other people as well.\n\nI would be willing to make this game but I don't have a team, sadly."

34esab,A horror survival game with a unique monster mechanic.,"So I had an idea that might make horror survival a bit more tense. Essentially you would be chased by monsters (big surprise,I know) BUT here's the catch, they don't make any sound whatsoever. The only sound you'll hear from them is when the attack you (and by that I mean their teeth, claws, etc. make contact with your character,so the sound is actually coming from you. They don't roar or scream or anything, which means that you'd have to be on your toes and catch them in your line of sight before they get you.I figure that letting the environment's (preferably nature, because nature can be downright frightening)sounds freak the player out instead of the monster's sounds would be creepier.An even better idea would be that they also mute any sounds around them, such as music, which would let the player know when one's near.Plan B of course would be that your character is deaf,but I figured silent otherworldly creatures would be scarier. What do you think? Are there games out there that have this mechanic already? Also this is my first post on reddit, meaning I just made an account to post this so...hi reddit community!"
34eqq0,"a First Person Shooter without the ""Shooter""","You play as an unarmed person who must disarm and incapacitate various firearm-bearing hostiles. The player simply gets close (carefully timing the rush as not to get caught in enemy fire), aims the crosshairs at a hostile's vulnerable point/points, and clicks in a certain sequence of left and right mouse clicks. Some combinations of attacks on specific points might be more efficient at incapacitating a hostile than other attack combinations. Although many hostiles would carry guns, levels would be varied and unlike those of most FPSs; one level might be an airplane in the process of being hijacked, with the player playing as an air marshal taking the aircraft back by force; another might be a ""mall cop"" level where an armed attacker is rampaging. Not really sure about how the levels will be themed, but those are just some ideas. It's just the idea of unarmed combat that appeals to me (I drew some inspiration from SUPERHOT)"
34doi3,Bastion Star Forts,"This is based on a [post I made recently in /r/gamingsuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/31zkx1/i_want_to_build_bastion_forts/), but the lack of suggestions there, and still not coming up with anything on google, means someone will have to make this game so I can play it some day.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_fort\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_fort#/media/File:Fortbourtange.jpg\n\n**Name:**\n\nSomething with Bastions or Star Forts or Vauban perhaps? The obvious name would be ""Bastion"", but it was already taken by a game that isn't about bastions at all really.\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nYou build and defend (and possibly attack or lay siege to) Vauban-style bastion star forts.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nWell, it's a historical setting obviously. After guns were invented the old style medieval castles were of no military use, because it was easy to blast a hole in them. Instead big star-shaped forts based on bastions were constructed. They used very thick, low, walls of earth and stone shaped in clever ways so that an attacker could not approach from any direction without being under fire from multiple flanking bastions. Also they looked really awesome. Look them up on wikipedia above.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nThe player would be playing someone like Vauban, or one of the other more or less famous fortress designers of that era. But being more of a strategy game there is probably no in-game character you run around with.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauban\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nI imagine something like Stronghold, but because of the fantastic geometric shapes of star forts I am not sure you can design them on a tile-map. There is probably some tool to design walls with vectors, moving around vertices and setting the height and slope of various parts. Has to be some way to place buildings within the fort. Ideally there are randomly generated tactical maps where you have some goal to build a fort to defend something (a city, important road, port, bridge). After your fort is built there must be a mode to lay siege to it or defend it against other players/AI besieging it. There could be also more direct assaults, although a reasonably big bastion fort could only be taken by sieges that lasted from weeks to years, because of multiple layers of bastions that was impossible to quickly attack.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nWell, the bastion forts. They look awesome and there was a lot of interesting thinking in how to design them properly. They are much more interesting than boring old castles that get all the gaming attention.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nBeing a construction game obviously it would make sense to have online sharing of maps and online matches where you compete in defeating a fort as quickly as possible or something.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nNot required, I just want to play this game when it is done. Just make sure there is a DRM-free version I can buy for my Mac or Linux computers or Android tablets, please?"
34d875,"[Abstract] A ""programming game"" meets Watchdogs","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game\n\nA programming game that meets Watchdogs would replace the single-button hacking for everything, with a hugely diverse set of coding abilities for manipulating the game scene. The gamer will have a virtual sandbox for creating programs in Python or some language. As he levels, he will gain power over different elements like Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. \n\nI had to include *elements* to create different properties of the attacks and tools. Otherwise, the coding itself would be totally incomprehensible to the player. With elements, you gain the ability to manipulate certain elements of objects in the game world (including weapons) with code only as you level up. Think Borderlands, except you actually program the attack power for your weapons.\n\nWell, there isn't much more to say about my idea. Except that's I've figured out some basic mechanics to the game. \n\n* The game is scalable: every aspect is playable from just a terminal console, or you can go full 3D simulation with player control \n\n* ""codes"" can be used as weapons/tools and are found throughout the game or created\n\n* Codes (weapons/tools to progress the game) can be manually tweaked or programmed in order to manipulate the environment\n\n* Perhaps an AI mode where you do not control a player, but instead a computer system with far-reaching abilities\n\nIt doesn't feel like I'm covering everything, which is one reason I'll probably never make this game. Basically, it's an action sandbox that can sort of teach you programming.\n\n"

34akm6,Social Hire: play through a week on the job,"As someone currently looking for work, one of the common complaints I hear relates to finding someone that is a good ""social"" fit.  \nWhat if you created a game that could simulate a week on the job to determine if a potential new hire would make the same or similar decisions as a successful employee.  \nScoring could be done with a work ethic / morale point system.  \nEach action takes a certain number of points, forcing players to be realistic and not just select ""work until done"" or similar.  \nDoes the player take the time to talk to everyone in the team? Can they remember names and prioritize certain work?  \nOr do they simply just complete the work assigned and go home for the day without exploring?  \n  \nThis game would be targeted more towards corporate environs vs pure entertainment values."
34agvn,Explosive based keep'em up brawler.,"**Name**: Explosive Velocity, Could be better I thought about Blastkitball or Dodgebomb but its up to the developer.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Concept Overview**:\nIn a world where traditional sports have begun to bore the masses there was no place left to go but explosions! Each of those who wish to participate are to elect a representative to take to the ring. But that doesn't mean each match is fair, Neo-Lativa has brought in a ringer that knows no equal! It's up to the C4 alliance to band together to finish this with a Bang!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics**:\nA 2D arena based brawler. It would be a combination of Smash Bro's custom game [Duelist Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj2t4NkSJHU) with inspiration from Lethal League. The game would be very stage driven, with the stages deciding the mechanics of the particular fight; for example if you had to keep yourself up while trying to knock the opponent  down like in Duelist, or a stage where you have to knock the opponent out of a box with a hole on either side. Each character would have a unique explosive type and a unique special move or trait that activates for a short period. Roughly 8 characters with at least 12 stages. Online would be up to the developer but a great idea.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nButton layout would be based off an xbox 360 controller but allow for custom mapping:\nA being jump \nB being a basic generic attack that can hit in all 4 directions\nX to pull out an explosive\nY to throw, all characters can throw in all 4 directions but one would have a special that allows all 8.\nBoth bumpers would act like special attack/activate trait.\nLeft trigger would be an alternate jump button\nRight trigger would be an alternate hit button\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nGame modes would be Story, VS, Training, and Tournament.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nStory would go into dept about the C4 and their individual tales getting too and defeating Neo-Latvia's rep.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nVS would offer 1v1, 2v2, and ""Master Exploder"" a free for all mode where one player is randomly selected at the start as the ""Master Exploder"" and has unlimited use of their special attack/trait till they are killed and its transferred to the one who killed them. Its a point based game mode, where you get points the longer you are the Master Exploder leading up to something like 25, 50, 75, 100, etc.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTournament would allow you to select and save the game mode then have everyone select their character and input a name before randomly shuffling the brackets and running the tournament. The sizes that tournament would be up to the developer.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTraining would be a standard training mode but the only place where you can play solely against NPCs.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI have a lot of the characters written out but not in stone, I would post them but I don't want to make this post any longer since its already pretty wordy.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Possible Platforms**:\nPC for sure with other possible platforms being Ps4, Xbox one and PS Vita.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**How To Credit Me**:\nI wouldn't mind working with anyone who picks up the concept and helping them in any form. I'm an English major with a writing studies focus so I'm more then willing to help as much as possible. Alternatively I would like to be an alternate costume for Neo-Lativa's rep. "

349vjk,Combination Civilization and SimCity,"The game would play similarly to Sim City, or Cities: Skylines, but you would start in an ancient era in a country of your choosing. You plan the city as you would in Sim City, and the success of your city will effect your country. If you contribute well to your country new technologies will become available, such as electricity, cobblestone to paved roads, indoor plumbing, etc. and old tech becomes cheaper but outdated, so as the game progresses you move from running an ancient city, to medieval, renaissance, industrial, etc., up to a future tech city. You will have to compete with the other cities in your country in order to draw people, bring in money, and gain favor from your country's leaders (lower national taxes on your citizens, sway in their type of government, possibly becoming the nation's capitol)."

34691u,An RTS game where you control the aliens and attack earth,"First time on reddit. if an idea or game like this alredy is there please tell me\n\nStory: A highly developed alien race dropped an insect alike fast spreading species on earth to see how the humanitreact. You are that species and you want to ensure your survival and spreading. \n\nThe game starts of with a futuristic pod crashing in a forest. It opens its hatches and 1 single unit crawls out, the alien larva. (Feel free to post your design idea for the larva) Im thinking of a small animal, maybecthe size of a cat. 6 legs and 4 eyes 2 on each side of its head. Might look a bit like the Star Craft 2 zergling... Your larva cant do much! It has to grow but in order to do that it needs the recource ""Meat"" or ""Food"" which you get from killing living things. The larvas attack is very weak and the crashed pod has alredy atraccted people which are heading your way. Humans can act randomly if they see the larva some tend to run and some might try to stomp/punch/shoot/kill it, but groups have higher chances to attack. The larva has many skills 1 of these is stealth attack. It instantly kills any not armored target that is not aware of the larvas presence. So the first thing you do is hide in the bushes and wait for people to arrive. A group of 3-8 finnaly appear stay for a while and leave, except for 1-2 guys. And of course you kill them. Incase its one guy you sneak up and end his life but if its 2 the 2nd guy will run away as soon as you stealth kill 1 of them, but be careful, he will get help and thats why your larva can drag bodies. You drag your prey to a safe spot and eat it. The system works like this: every dead thing in the swarms reach counts as different ammouts of food depending on the creatures size (bunny 1x meat, deer 3x meat, wolf 3x meat, human 5x Meat, bear 6x meat)\nAnd as soon as a unit consumes it the points can be used by this unit to grow into something stronger. The larva can grow into a warrior type unit and a worker typd one and the game forces you to become a worker. Workers are essential to building your base / nest they can dig undergroundntunnels and rooms. You now have to dig 1 tier down and dig a 3x3 room. After your worker is done you have to mark a food storage area and go and get food. The workers abilites are various building abilities; hunt (aka stealth attack 2) insantly kills any unaware food source; Slime trail leave a trail tu lure pedestrians into an ambush; slime trap immobilizes prey for 12 seconds (glues them to the ground if they step on it) great combo with trail.\nYour mission is collect 45 meat and evolve into a princess...LOL... the princess can produce larvas and also dig rooms n' tunnels but is very vulnurable since it has no combat skills only melee attacks. With 100 meats the princess can grow into a queen (now the names make sense)  the queen can produce workers warriors and eggs act like units but cant move or attack. If ordered to move they will be dragged by the closest unit. Eggs can be hatched into princesses, spawners and hunters. The spawners are advanced builders with bigger and deeper tunneling various traps and most importantly they improve food efficiency by eating it and making ""alien honey"" or something. The hunters are stealthy creatures of the night. They instantly kill any not armored targets during  nighttime and can turn completely invisible for 20 seconds and have a ranged skill which makes tham shoot a spike at a target but if they are on the surface during daytime their movement speed is reduced by 2/3 their attack is reduced by 1/2 and they cant use skills.\n\nNow im too tired of writing...\nfeel free to comment"

343jh8,"Scar-Free roam, alternate reality, RPG","A world where genetic mutation and splicing was discovered in 1743 and has made human/animal crossbreeds a new breed of people. It takes place in the 1800s around the Victorian Era, and while humans are the majority of the population others have been made into beasts known as transfers. You play as Jack Hollins, a young man who signed up for the military to fight for a noble cause, but is put into a coma and tested to become a new breed of soldier. After 10 years of testing and procedures you have become a master fighter, better than most humans. You are now a transfer, half cat and half human, and you have a scar on the left side of you face, marking where your life was forever changed. You eventually escape the hands of you captors and go into the city of London, full of transfers and humans. There you work to remember who you were before you were taken, who did this to you, and how to stop them. \n\n It would look like assassins creed in a sense but you would be a cat human hybrid that could do more than a human. You would almost all resemble a cat physically but would have a few human influences. Like walking on two legs, talking, etc.; think of the khajiit from Skyrim but a little different. You would meet a group of others like you who were tested on, and explore a world where genetically altered people walk the streets. Major figures like Jack the Ripper would also be featured, like maybe you have to track and kill him and you could discover that he was a transfer. It would have a lot of stealth gameplay and I think it would be a really cool game. Could involve skill trees for using weapons or one for your hybrid abilities.\n\n"
34255p,Television Tycoon 2015,"In this game, you are a TV producer. Decide the path of your career, writing episodes and creating new series.\n\nYou start the game with a complete lack of reputation (this is a factor that creates hype for series/episodes and makes people more likely to hire you), and average proficiency in every attribute. As you go on through your career, your reputation goes up or down based on the quality of the episodes/series you write, and your attributes do the same based on more specific factors - every episode can be fine-tuned, to decide on factors such as the type of ending, introduction of characters, and more basic things such as episode length.\n\nOf course, you are not the only TV producer in the world. As such, you can hire writers, directors and actors/actresses. These people are real-life copies (much like the system that the 'Football Manager' series has going) and their attributes are based on what they have written in real life, with their reputation being decided on an average of all of their IMDB scores. Obviously, this would be somewhat strange for actors, as their ability should not be regarded by what series they starred in (although their reputation should), so that could be decided by popular opinion.\n"

33xt5u,Attack of the Rogue Tables (action game),"Just a disclaimer, I know that this idea is kind of weird and all, because I came up with the idea ""Rogue Tables"" out of nowhere and decided to make it into a game idea. This is the result:\nThe basic idea of the game is that all of your four-legged household furnishings (e.g. tables, chairs, wardrobes) have turned against you, and you must navigate an indoor environment while fighting against them using axes, shotguns, and various other weaponry. Enemies have certain weak spots, e.g., shoot the legs to immobilize them, or shoot the hinges (of a wardrobe) to keep it from attacking. When you defeat certain enemies, e.g. wardrobes or tables, you can collect the items that were on or in them, such as special padded clothing for armor, ammunition for a weapon, new weapons, or power-ups such as coffee or bacon. Locations in campaign mode may include: apartment complex, office building, Ikea's, matress store. I'm just kind of putting this idea out there for anyone who might be interested in developing it."

33wlhn,"""Editor"" horror game idea","Horror game idea. It's called editor. A family was found dead in their home with no sign of forced entry. Many many tapes were found and it is your job to go through them to see if you can find anything suspicious.  The majority of the game play is watching the movies and you have to find oddities. As the tapes get closer to the date of the murder it becomes obvious that it was a paranormal entity that has killed them. Other game play would include walking around the office, and being at home. As the game progresses, you take the videos home with you. And you start to notice things going wrong at your house as well. In the game you have a sanity meter and the more you watch the tapes, and the more oddities you identify the more it goes down. You can go back to any of the videos at anytime to view them again, and the lower your sanity, the more oddities you may notice that you had not before. Game endings depend on sanity, how many oddities you saw, how many times you viewed the tapes, how long you spent watching the tapes/at home or office. Videos would include like a birthday party going on and something moves on its own in the background and you then have to click on it to show you saw it. Also, a video of a minute of insignificant footage, but if you view it again with lower sanity there's someone just staring straight into the camera for instance."

30dak0,FPS game type inspired by Jet Li's The One,"**Name:** Singular\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n• Inspired by the Jet Li film The One, Singular is a multiplayer FPS based in several identical maps with one player in each map. A King of the Hill mechanic lets a player, the Singular, travel through other player's worlds at will, hunting each of his targets.\n\n**Plot:** (None worth speaking of.)\n\n**Setting:**\n\n• A single map set in a conventional modern day setting, save potential re-skinning by players. (Honestly, it's less important what it is, than how fun it is, right? So, something fun. Maybe a lab, or even small city area? Whatever.)\n\n**Characters:**\n\n• A single character, save potential re-skinning by players.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n• When a player is killed, each player's maximum health is raised.\n\n• The Singular has his health raised slightly more than other players. (Exact amount tbd with experimentation.)\n\n• The Singular can jump to another world through the use of three keys.

306k8u,Survival FPS battle royal game,"Alright, so I know this isn't a new idea, but it got certain elements that I am missing in a game .\nWe have all seen and read the hunger games books and movies right  ?\nWith that idea in mind, a game were you need to use your survival and killing techniques to survive and to defeat all the other players in the arena.\nI know we have seen games like H1Z1 and Arma III that got a battle royal mode, but with this game I want the battle royal to be the main focus, not just a gamemode.\nI am thinking graphics like Far Cry and dying light , with survival aspects from minecraft and h1z1. Another thing is that this game will be FPS only, which means you will always have the fear that someone might be sneaking up right behind you to stick a knife in your throat.\n\nI am thinking that you launch the game, and you will either start a game solo or invite your friends to play together with you. When you hit play you will search for a game with players of the same level as you . The map you will be playing on will be random , and all the different maps will have different climates and playstyles. What I am saying is that you will need to have a different strategy on every single map. I am also thinking that the players doesn't start in the middle of the map, but rather at the edge to prevent early deaths . There will still be loot in the middle though, so the choice is yours . \n\nI am still debating if you will start with basic supplies and maybe a p250 so the start doesn't get so boring, since I want this game to be kind of a survival shooter, which means more guns and knifes than bows and spears if you get what I am trying to say .\nThis game won't be using a lot of crafting, except maybe first aid kits, bandages and campfires , but rather a construct system .\nThe construct system means that the player got a choice to either keep the crappy handgun , or deconstruct it to get gunparts and materials.\nThe player could then find other guns and deconstruct them to then combine these parts to make an entirely new gun that fits your playstyle better.\nWe still keep the regular survival elements though . Players needs to find a good food source , get fresh water and bandages and medicines.\nLoot will be scattered randomly around the map, and the loot will become better the further you are traveling towards the center. The map will constantly be shrinking, and after a certain amount of time all remaining players will face off in the center. I want this game to be a shooter , but I also want the players to use weapons such as knifes, melee weapons such as axes, crossbows and mechanical bows . To promote these weapons, gunshots will be heard very loudly, which means that If you shoot someone without a silencer everyone and their mother will be able to hear and locate the sound . This means that if you don't want the other players to know your location you might want to sneak up on your target rather than putting a bullet through his head. This of course means that silencers are extremely valuable. Ammo will also be fairly rare, which means you will need to think twice before firing of your gun.\n\nAnother mechanic I have planned is loot crates dropped from the sky . Once or maybe twice a game these will fall and flashing red dots will start to appear on your minimap where the loot crates has landed. This gives players without much loot a new chance, but something to note is that when a crate is opened the dot will disappear. This means that played with a good amount of weapons could either camp the spot where the crates has landed , or go the spot where a dot has disappeared, since that means a player is nearby .\n\nSo I got a lot more of ideas, but this is just some.\nWould you guys play something like this ? Has it already been done ?\nI will gladly take your thought of the concept .\n"
305xlq,Modern Pro Wrestling game focusing on procedural storylines,"**Name:** (None in particular. A new WWE wrestling game, new game in an existing franchise, or new IP by any developer.)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A wrestling game that focuses as much on the plot and simulation of inane fun of pro wrestling as much as it does the fighting mechanics.\n\n* Marked as ""experienced"" rather than ""AAA"" because I think the most complex part is the wrestling. The rest is less about prowess and more about approach.\n\n**Plot:**\n\n* Procedural\n\n**Setting:** Wrestling events growing in spectacle/audience as you gain popularity.\n\n**Characters:** \n\n* Possibly existing wrestlers. Or stereotypical wrestling archetypes, possibly interlaced with a publisher's/developers known properties.\n\n* Customization on par with expected WWE wrestling games (high customization in characters, move sets, theme songs, introductory videos).\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Wrestling gameplay\n\n* Procedural storylines\n\n* Character/Event Customization modes\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Procedural plots -\n\nEach wrestler gets a data table indicating how they currently feel about other wrestlers. Also give each person a popularity meter with the faux audience, and how good/bad the audience views them, and this provides a lot of options for procedural storytelling.\n\nTag wrestlers with physical and personality traits that only matter behind the scenes, and things could get even more interesting. If you create a quick, small, luchadore-style wrestler with a zen attitude, the game can trend toward making your opponents either other luchadores with more chaotic styles, big/slow wrestlers, or a wrestler of mirrored style, and have the announcers comment on these things to build suspense.\n\nPlayers should be able to attack, insult, honor (press X to pay respect), challenge, offer to help, or ask for help from, other wrestlers. But to make it less of a random jumble by button pressing every chance you get? Only let a wrestler initiate with another wrestler if their target is 30 points or fewer below the initiator, or 10 or fewer points above the initiator AND currently has no nemesis. If you have a nemesis, you must beat them before targeting another wrestler above you. You could expand your popularity reach by raising your popularity, and accomplishments like winning the title. A champ might get a larger group of on-comers and a wider berth to mess with others.\n\nChanges resulting from behind the scenes events or post-match changes in popularity/appeal/health/etc can be handled by tags. If a player gains the ""evil"" tag, quickly buzz through every other wrestler's opinion of him and adjust accordingly. Games like Crusader Kings 2 sort through hundreds if not thousands of values in a second. Doing a few hundred post-match/event shouldn't lock a system up.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* Modern consoles, PC.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Multiplayer federations that allow players to wrestle each other, and several spectators to connect and watch, each with the ability to interrupt as their wrestler (within the confines of popularity, and likely X players at a time.)\n\n* Uploading of video/audio for use in character entrance/theme, character voice acting.\n\n* Wide ranges of DLC options (whole characters, collections of parts to use in customization)\n\n* Upload and share entire character packages with friends.\n\n* Maybe a management mode, where you see all wrestler's information detailed and try to put together good shows/plots for the audience?\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJeffool.\n\nJust another guy dreaming."

3035nl,Festival Manager,"The idea would be somewhat like a city builder/theme park builder, but instead of an endless game where you play until you're bored of that city/park, you have to design and build a festival. Each mission would then be a new and different festival or event.\n\nMusic festivals would be the obvious event type, but there could be motor races, sports tournaments, all sorts of things.\n\nThe player would have unlimited time and a certain budget to design the 'park' beforehand, placing stages, tents, camping areas, toilets, food and drinks stands, and all sorts of other types of facility, hire security and cleaners, design queuing areas and traffic flow systems. Once the player is happy with their design, the festival is built and the week begins. People trickle in at first, and build up towards maximum capacity at the weekend.\n\nAdvantages over a standard builder:\n\n - Distinct missions allow:\n* Regular change of challenge/scenery\n* The ability to test lots of new ideas and designs\n* The ability to easily classify performance on a mission, by average happiness, in/out time, funds raised etc.\n \n - Unlimited design time without people in the park (ability to undo etc. without penalty in first phase)\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?"
3020pl,Open World Driving/Racing Simulator,"So this is what I'm thinking. I think it would be amazing if there was a video game that allowed you to drive on the roads you drive every day. Google with their Google Earth has created basically a digital copy of the entire world - with a focus on all the roads. Obviously it doesn't make sense for a developer to create all of that from scratch... but if a script was created that could create the roads for you based on the Google Earth/Maps info, it would be easy to create a racing game where you can see how fast you can get to the other side of YOUR city in a Lamborghini. Maybe an online racing system as well - maybe time trials for point-to-point tracks. \n\nIn a less fun concept, it could also be useful for checking out the roads in a city you aren't familiar with.\n\nObviously you would need the help of the corporate giants for their map data, but it would be awesome I think.\n\nAlso may be legal issues with people claiming such a game inspired them to break the law..."

2zvcty,A Elite group command - Dual Strategy/RPG game - Jedi Order XCOM,"**Concept Overview:**\n\nI couldn't really give the idea justice in the title so bear with me. Essentially, it's about merging a  vaguely XCOM-like game* with a game version of some SF franchises. So instead of limiting itself to warfare and support like XCOM, it's more varied scenarios. For example, think of the various Star* franchises and the elite groups that roam their universe trying to do their things and dealing with problems, namely Star Trek (Starfleet and the Enterprise), Stargate (SGC and SG-1) and Star Wars(the Jedi Order and the Jedis) and try to apply a game to it. Of course games where you control a single ship/Jedi/elite group already exist, this game would be about controlling the entire faction. \n\n**for those who aren't familiar with it, it's a game combining a strategy part where you administrate funds, research, bases and a few elite troops, and a tactical RPG where you use those troops to fight aliens around the globe*\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nSo to give a example of gameplay, say you have a game themed on the Jedi Order. You can have a few bases around the galaxy, each one with possible upgrades, equipments and housing ships and Jedis. Each Jedi can be a usual RPG character with relevant attributes, skills, including proper role-playing characteristics (aggressiveness, problem-solving methods preferences, etc). Then some trouble/event shows up in the galaxy, say a planet is nearing civil war. You can then select a few Jedis to try to solve the problem, choosing depending on the available intel and what you expected solution is. \n\nThen your party arrive, then you get some extra intel and can to decide what is  be done. This is where the game can be done in various ways. Do you get to decide what to do or the party you sent decides if they are going to mediate or murder one of the faction leaders based on their RP characterists? If there is a fight, is there a tactical RPG like XCOM or just autoresolve? Making it autoresolve would probably make the game much easier to develop (I put the game as intermediate assuming simple combat mechanics at best, doing anything more would probably bump it to experienced), and allowing to focus on the more unique aspects of the game instead of what has been already done elsewhere, but controllable combat is still cool.\n\n\n**Setting**\n\nI focused on the mechanics, but the setting is variable. The most obvious and the one I mentioned are all galactic/multi-stellar level SF, but there is nothing that really prevents making a similar game about a order of peacemaking paladins on some fantasy medieval world, or something. \n\n**Plot**\n\nThe plot obviously depends on the setting. There isn't even a real *need* for a plot beyond the game world changing with your success or failure, but it can certainly be done, maybe including a need to shape the universe's event in a certain way, or simply expand your own power.\n\n**Extra Discussion**\n\nDepending on the above, there is a need for addition cause and effect of your choices, success and failure in dealing with events and the universe at large. Maybe a faction that you pissed off is getting more powerful and preparing for an attack against you?\n\nAs for what makes the game interesting, focus can be give to either the global or local level, or balanced. On the global level, choices on what sort of people to recruit, what events to prioritize, and what would be recognizable as strategical concerns, depending on the specific mechanics. On the local level, interesting and unique scenarios, with lots of variations, solving possibilities and consequences depending on the chosen party and previous choices.\n\nThe local level of gameplay can also be a more RPG style ""roll for diplomacy"" with focus on the mechanics, or each even can be a quase mini-visual novel. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nI dunno, it depends on the engine for eventual combat I guess.\n"
2zump3,3D Scifi Space MMORPG Idea (mashup of several games),"So I have this idea for a game that combines a few games that I like;\n\nFreelancer: Easy to use mouse flight and control system. \n\nDust514: I like the UI from this. simple, elegant, easy to navigate. I also like the skill system.\n\nBorderlands: I like the visual comic book style, cel-shaded characters but 3d backgrounds\n\nMass Effect: duh. this game is awesome, haha\n\nStar Citizen: I really only like the fact of how they build their ships; as a fully functioning unit where every part makes sense. \n\nStar Conflict: I really like these ship designs...would love to have similar style for the ships in this game (all original ideas of course)\n \n*So basically here's how it'd play out:*\n\nyou log in, create a new character. Using a variant on SPECIAL (Fallout), the class you choose affects different stats on the ship you serve.\n\nThen you begin on a space station. You follow a tutorial on the UI and then sign a contract with a captain (or if you chose the Captain class you start with a small vessel that needs a crew). After boarding the vessel, your job on board is determined by the class you've chosen (GUNNERs offer combat bonuses and can switch between different turrets, etc, ENGINEERs give armor/shield bonuses and have skills like Boost which give the ship extra speed for a few minutes).\n\nThere would be a story-line / quests for each captain to undertake, and a persistent, changeable universe like EVE but it would be at the start of human space colonization, so lots of planets to explore and mark for colonization. Each planet would be able to be scanned (similar to Mass Effect) for resources and potential mining. If a captain mined resources (found on planets, asteroids, nebulae) they could then sell them to ports for credits.\n\nEach ship would have several crew slots for captains to hire (bigger ships = more crew). Players would give bonuses to the ship, but if no players are present, the slots would be filled with AI characters that give no bonuses to the ship's CREDO.\n\n*CREDO*: \n\n*Cargo* - How much cargo space a ship has.\n*Range* - Fuel capacity.\n*Energy*- Power-plant capacity. Used to determine the amount and type of purchasable modules that can affect ship stats (like vehicle outfitting in DUST/EVE)\n*Defense* - Shields / armor plating rating, also countermeasures.\n*Offense* - Damage done by weapons. Determined by what type of guns/missiles/torpedoes mounted.\n\n*Spaceflight*:\n\nReal physics would apply, so ships would have to be designed\nto be fully functional (like Star Citizen) and if damage is taken, systems would fail. I think if the ship gets destroyed the crew would respawn back at the last station they were at? Not sure. discuss-able.\n\n*Docking*: The camera would move from behind the ship to rotating around whatever station the ship is docked at. If the crew boards the station, the camera would fade to black and go into First person mode, where the crew would appear in a lounge type establishment where they would have access to the Markets, Contracts, and other UI options.\n\n*Planets*:\nI'm thinking landing on a planet would be similar to a station, only you have the option to go exploring and looking for things like ruins, or harvesting/mining. Crew can join you on these adventures and potentially profit from the adventure.\n\n\n*Equipment*:\n\nweapons would be purchasable from vendors aboard stations, as would be equippable modules. The Captain would oversee any equipment/module purchases, because it would be HIS ship that the crew are serving on. Crew purchases would possibly be contracts, side jobs, or equipment for exploration.\n\n*Exploration*: Crew and captain would be able to disembark their ship on planets and go on expeditions to ruins, go mining, find artifacts using rentable/purchasable All-Terrain APC's (Like the Mako..go MAKO!) which, if owned, can be upgraded with different weapons/modules (think like your ship but smaller)\n\n\nSo basically this game could never happen. But a guy can dream, and if it ever did happen, I'd really love to work on it/get credit for it. :p\n\n"
2zu2vw,Tsunami Apocalypse Simulator,"Name: None really thought up\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nThe game idea comes from a video we watched of ""Cities: Skylines"" where the city got flooded and there was no way to use vehicles. \n[Video for reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDRpOk-_tLI)\n\n**Setting:**\n\nA city where there is pretty much an ocean that has flooded the city\n\n**Characters:**\n\nJust one character really not a huge deal \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nWe were thinking of maybe a procedurally generated environment where you would spawn on a random building after the flood in a big city and you would try to survive. Maybe an end game goal of something like the game ""Stranded Deep"" where you just try to build yourself up to a point of being self sufficient or some other end game goal, up to you.  \n\nMultiple ways to get around the city: swimming for short periods of time, making a raft, hang gliding for short periods of time, ziplines, anything that would be a fun way to get around\n\nHaving supplies in stores or in factories possibly where they are higher up maybe on a higher terrain possibly.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nA really big feature would be that it is a survival game in an abandoned city because of a tsunami.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nPC\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nMaybe another idea that could be done would be that you could have a multiplayer mode or a way so that if you meet up with other AI to survive like in the game ""State of Decay""\n\nAny other ideas would be great and we would love to see this maybe become a real thing.

2zsx2w,A Hunted Game,"With so many games about hunting animals and being the killer, I would like to see a game where the player plays as the hunted, such as a deer. The objective of the game would be simple: eat as much grass as you can, listen carefully to the environment so you don't get shot, and constantly scan the area for a hunted. It would be a very nerve racking game and would always end with the player being shot. You could also unlock characters such as a bear, elk, or moose. Hunters could also change between using crossbows, bows, and regular rifles."

2nj08n,Blow up the moon FPS,"Want to play a game that starts in a spaceport on futuristic earth. Think Halo, but your lives are very limited: back to the beginning when you fail. The main draw of the game is that each playthrough is unique and the map randomizes at the start of the game like dungeons in Diablo 2. There is no one single way to reach the goal, and some choices will lead you to a 'dead end'. The goal is to fight your way through the spaceport, hijack or hitch a ride on a ship: fly it yourself, stay stealth and hide during the trip, or go guns blazing and have a firefight the whole way there. Your choice will affect what happens and how the AI responds when you land at the moon base. \n\nFight your way through the base until you get to the reactor or weapons cache and blow up the moon.\n\nIdeally, the game would be co-op focused, but would scale difficulty accordingly. Blowing up the moon would be very difficult and making it all the way would be a rarity,  but it would still be considered an achievement making it to the moon base. Sometimes you could be doomed from the start unless very lucky or skilled based on how the map and AI randomizes. \n\nIdeally a full playthrough would be 2-6 hours. Maybe options to shorten certain parts of the map to reduce the duration for a quick play. Or maybe make it longer by having to get back to Earth. I don't know...scootytoss.  "

The world has devolved into 3 factions battling it out; a group of religious zealots who murder unbelievers and keep slaves, a rebellious group of ex-slaves who joined the other faction but rebelled and are run by a set of mega-corporations and live very free lives but live in the shadow of their corp and a group of people who claim to love freedom but bind people by loads of laws and treaties and conventions ect. \n\nSo you decide each one based off of their backstory and weaknesses or strengths. Then you spawn in and your helmet AI says "" Welcome to 'Insert faction military here' you have been found to be compatible with the nanite control and brain scan implant making you 1 out of 1000 people and worth 10x that. Proceed for basic training."". You then preform a basic training course which teaches you to shoot and other basic skills you need to survive.\n\nYou then leave the basic training area to a large campus where you learn the ropes of all of the main concepts and can fight in a mock battlefield Vs. Other players. Finally you leave campus and enter the capital city of your faction. The capital and the area around are patrolled by OP drones so you can't attack it easily. Then you enter the roads to other cities and as you leave the city you enter countryside  and hit other major cities before you reach the border of your faction, on 2 sides the factions meet and on the 3rd empty wilderness slowly takes over from the controlled space as the factions can't hold all this land so simply protect the central regions of their zones. These areas are now denoted by grid references rather than names and players can take control of areas here. Bandits patrol the area and the remains of old cities contain advanced enemies and brilliant base locations but the area is quite hard to fight for. You can also build your own outposts. If you can find them there are also high level bandits with specialised gear that works 10-15x better than the basic versions.\n\nThe combat class would be determined by your nanite combat suit and code core and your capabilities by sub-functions and your weapons by equipping them.\n\nOff the bat I can think of a few cores to work with\n\nCombat : can carry 2 sidearms , 1 main weapon , 8 grenades and has 2 sub function slots , combat helmet lets you identify threats automatically and the suit gives +3 defense and +3 damage with suit bonuses for weapons switching faster, reloading faster, grenades arming and throwing faster, weapons ADSing faster ect. \n\nMiner : can implant into a drill machine and interface directly. Gives a bonus to all mining systems and mining shields\n\nTank driver : can Interface with a tank , light tank and heavy tank. Buffs light tank blast radius, buffs tank damage and defense, and heavily buffs heavy tank defense.\n\nPilot : can interface with bombers and fighters. Buffs fighter top speed and agility, buffs bomber payload and defense\n\nSpy : has 1 sidearm and 1 SMG/ Sniper rifle and a cloak, can fit 4 sub- functions. Has a + buff to speed and a + buff to agility as well as a + buff to sound reduction. Suit buffs are ability to fit cloak and suit profile minimises target area. Helmet has NV view and ability to spot targets and hidden locations. Can hack various items and can launch scanner probes \n\nwilderness areas can be made edge areas by NPC pirates who will give you missions and shoot their enimies so if you become friendly (by doing missions ) they will protect you and corporations who made their money on the untapped riches of the wilderness turning it into faction drone protected areas.\n\nIf you do missions for NPCs they will reward you with certificates for access to faction items.\n\nAlso vehicles would be present and play a large part and there would be mining vehicles for resources, light tanks for Anti-Infantry storm raids, versatile heat equipped MBTs for assaults and Heavy tanks for sieges with large armor capacities and massive guns.

2p2ff5,A hyper realistic shooter,"Disclaimer - Very very brief Idea\n\nSeveral games have come close to this concept, such as Insurgency ,Arma (Ish). these all broke the mold of the annual call of duty and have exploded in the PC game marketplace, so whats different the realism, battlefield put down the paving stones by being one of the first to challenge call of dutys repetitive shooting style of game by adding realism, although IMO battlefield is a better game but, reason it hasnt taken over is because cod had the foothold in the console market whereas battlefield has the majority of the PC market\n\nNow on to the idea, the main inspirations are Insurgency, Arma, Battlefield.\nNow as the games going for realism graphics have to be 11/10 im talking 4x 980 sli mode here, crysis 3 4k ultra\nEach match can either be timed as in covert mission style, get in get out type operation the game would feature several military groups from around the world representing the most known countries UK - SAS, US - Seals, Army. basically any special force group from around the world, the scenarios would be pre set. each scenario is huge not arma size but battlefield map size + the location of these are set in the middle east as of present events I want it to stick to current affairs to be as realistic as possible.\n\nNow gameplay\n\n the bad guys in a scenario know where the military force is the lore is that they live there they know what goes on all they need to do is strategise and fight, if they have a hostage, protect the hostage, you get the idea. This would be achieved by the randomization of the spawns of both teams and before the game starts both teams get a cutscene like brief \n\n\nThe Baddies brief would include :\n\n\n-Enemy general location (like a red zone of their spawn area) not exactly on there spawn but they're in there \n\n\nsomewhere\n\n\n-opposing force what they're there to do, patrol, hostage rescue, etc \n\n\n-Opposing forces arsenal whats at their disposal, missile strikes, drones, weapons, vehicles \n\nthat's it all the bag guys need to do is fight, but they have the strategic upper hand as they can plan ahead set traps, ambushes, mines, decoys, you name it\nin terms of weapons they have lots of small ordinance where as the military have small amounts of higher quality explosives and equipment\n\n\non to the other side, the military briefing is a bit more indepth but less information \n\n\n: Expected terrorist group to be faced could be random but accurate to IRL each terrorist group would have a different expected play style adapted to what equipment is given them at the start of the game\n\n\n: nothing about location\n\n\n: nothing about weapons\n\n\n: backstory\n\nnow gameplay is fairly simple find and shoot, now no to little respawns dying would send you to a strategy hall to plan attacks and movement and call shots on the battle field spotting out of line enemy's and calling the positions this would hopefully add balance as the military good guys get the information in real time where as the terrorists info would have a delay\n\ngun play, hyper realism no reticle only iron sights and scopes, little to no HUD, bullet physics, building destruction physics, armour hit registration like CSGO but better 1 shot headshot, (Vital organs) + shot = dead military teams get unlimited VERY slow respawns in limbo get to send strategy calls and spot insurgents,\n\nVehicles are a seriously high commodity highly valuable on both sides insurgents have a higher amount of weak homemade gun trucks where as military have convoy vehicles, fast and Armoured but nothing a well disguised mine wouldn't take care of."
2ord6i,If anyone could offer thoughts.,"Okay, I've been thinking about a game that is first person 3v3. One person is the strategist, which they have magic powers, and ranged weaponry, and they control the strategy for their team, if other people listen to them is another problem. The second person is a knight, who could use a variety of weaponry, and they control the army for the team. The third person is the king, I haven't thought of a weaponry for them yet, but they are in control of everything if they wish to. If the king dies or surrenders the other team wins, which is the goal. While if the strategist or knight dies they can respawn as a weaker version trying to raise their rank back up, but if they surrender they have to find a way out or someone rescue them. And to build your army you have to collect resources. I could use some thoughts on this idea, if you think its stupid let me know why, and if there is a game like this already let me know please. \n\nThank you"
2pvmly,Farming game (harvest moon) gone wrong.,"**INTRODUCTION**\n\nIt starts a like harvest moon. But it gets incredibly big. When I was thinking of this game I was thing of the book Lord of the Flies (Having a small society on an Island, hunting tools become weapons against humans, survival of the fittest), game harvest moon (because it has to start simple and the mood of the game looks like a happy family game at the beginning) , the anime blood lad, hunter x hunter. \n\nI also thought of an old first person shooter game called ""Kingpin"". It is just a simple game, but there you could hire some muscle for money. Which brought to me the idea of ""Contracts"".\n\n\n**GAMEPLAY**\n\nThis game has a overhead perspective just like a harvest moon game. In this game you cannot steal. But you can kill. And you can claim unclaimed items. If you kill someone, his equipped tool will become yours. This game you can chat with other people. Talking to other people is very detailed. You have many options when talking:\n\n- asking about a person or (who is he, where is he, what is he doing).\n\n- asking about an item (what is it, where can i find it, what does it do)\n\n- asking about something they have or are giving to you (is this poisonous, what does it do) \n\n- asking who they are and what they are doing\n\n\n\n\nCONTRACTS\nIn this game you can make contracts. Contracts are made by 2 parties only. If a party consists of more than 1 person, each party member must accept the contract so the contract will be sealed. Contracts are made for max. half year. This means that talking to others are a very detailed thing in this game, like I explained above. \n\n\nContracts are made for: Normal trade, labor trade, information, slave (If you cannot fulfill a contract you will become a slave), group forming, etc.\n\n- Example: You give a 250 Gold to other party. The other party gives you no-lying, so they cannot lie to you during this contract. After that you can ask whether this food they give you is poisonous or not. (They must tell the truth, or be silent which is the same) No-lying contract is very useful for gaining trust or to be cautious.\n\nAUTOMATIC CONTRACTS\n\nYou can arrange your settings so that you automatically accept any contracts from that clan. So whenever your clan-leader makes a contract for your clan, you automatically accept them. \n\n\nALLIES AND ENEMIES\n\nYou can select some people to become your enemy. When you have to hem at eyesight they will flash red and you will get a warning. Also your allies will be having the color green. If you belong to a clan or clans and your clanleader has chosen some people as enemies and you accepted that you will see those people in red, even though you have never seen them before.\n\n\n\n\n---Accessories and tools--\nThis game you can equip 2 type of things. 1st is ""Tools"".\nTools are equipped to your hand and you need to press the button to activate it's use/power. \nYou can equip 1 tool at a time. \n2nd is the ""accessories"": When equipped their use/power will be automatically activated. \n\nSo if you have a helmet that gives you +2 defense, it will be activated all the time. But if you have a hammer, you need to press ""A"" to smash the hammer.\n\n- Some Accessories:\nA helmet, bracelets, **later on** wings (mechanic wing so you can fly), blue forcefield ring, distractor (any incoming projectile or harmful object will automatically evade it's direction), and many more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**SETTING** \n\nThe Beginning\n\nThe game starts on an Island. Your plane crashed and you end up on an Island with other survivors and  now you have a hut and some farming ground. Your ""clan"" has given up the idea of being rescued and now wants to continue. Some are hunting, some are fishing. Some are carpenters, and some are traders. So everyone has something to do to earn something. It is just a small economy of 30-40 people. \n\n\n\nLater on, you find out there are other people on this Island. Trade arises. Also a couple of people start extorting some villagers. This is how the story will progress slowly. The idea of just being a farmer, or something else and continuing this simple life will be a false, utopian idea. And this game proves it. You will gain some powers, you make enemies, you make your own weapons, strategies etc. This game is about making right choices, exploring, making tough decisions and having the right allies and contracts.

2pv7eh,LOOKING FOR LEAP MOTION GAME IDEAS!,Hey everyone!  I have recently purchased a leap motion and I wanted to start developing/integrating it with unity 3d games.  I am looking for some game ideas that would work well with the leap motion's system of gesture control and/or cool ideas in general for a leap motion controlled game!  Thanks!
2pkzrp,/r/WritingPrompts might be a great source for game story ideas.,"http://np.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/\n\nJust now was the first time I heard about this subreddit. It prompts people to write stories with certain elements. Since people *here* are probably looking for ideas, I thought it would be a good idea to mention *that* subreddit."
2pivd5,Synthesizing the various MMOs into one massive MMOFPS?,"I've been sitting on this concept since Everquest came on the scene, and decided to finally put it out there and see if maybe it's time to give up the ghost.\n\nWhat I was thinking of doing was architecting an entire planet the size of a small moon as a playing field, hopefully without the need for instancing or division, and opening up the space around the planet an appropriate radius of distance to allow each faction to have an indestructible manufacturing homeship important to sending down a lot of supplies and equipment at once via player-piloted dropships.  This would, hopefully, require fighters, bombers, interceptors and smaller-scale warships in space alone.  Kind of like what EVE is doing with Dust currently.\n\nPlayers on the ground and in the air would still be able to pull gear, vehicles and craft from permanent and player-made bases, but the dropship game would allow for a more massive amount of resources and vehicles to arrive anywhere on planet, including heavy manufacturing pieces for setting up hardened player-made bases that are significantly tougher and better armed than what an unsupplied player couldn't.\n\nRewards for capturing territory and permanent bases would include not only perks for that faction, but also additional and automatic streams of various resources to that faction.  Respawn would be along transmission lines, which can be broken if a territory is basically cut off from line-of-sight from an adjoining friendly territory.\n\nRespawn wouldn't rely on hard spawn points or respawn rooms.  Rather, when a player chooses to spawn into an available area, he or she gets to choose from a static 'blueprint' of that area and teleports in on the position they choose, whether on different levels of a building or not.  The static blueprint means you can pick where you want to come in at in an available area, but also keeps you from seeing what's nonstatic, like enemy or friendly players, so you can't just spawn in behind the last person to kill you, unless they happen to still be in the last place you left them.  May have to tweak this respawn system a bit so a respawn area is considered to be a 3D hemisphere around a friendly area, and if enemies are inside the available respawn area, an area a few times larger than the enemy-occupied territory will be unavailable, just to prevent revenge respawns.\n\nTypically, if you have a 3D hemisphere respawn area, it'd probably be best to go ahead and take out objective points and capture timers.  Instead, have capture and respawn availability be contested by how dominant a force is in an area for a related area of time.  Even if the enemy force doesn't get inside the base, if they clearly dominate the area, then the territory's respawn goes over to the dominate team.  No player still alive in the area when it switches over is automatically killed.  The dominant force will have to still wipe out the survivors, or just bottle them up and ignore them.\n\nI was thinking about adding the RPG element to this game: crafting and gathering.  Crafters would be able to make food, medicine, specialized and more distinct weapons, ammo, supplies, cosmetic armor and items, power sources, and furnishing for player-housing that can be exchanged between players across all factions in a marketplace for credits--which each faction awards each player for contributions to their faction.\n\nThe player doesn't need to use the marketplace.  Rather, he or she has a standard omnitool that serves as an adjustable weapon, plus enables them to use it as a melee weapon, and as a variable tool for medical and engineering purposes.  The kicker being that the omnitool costs no resources or currency for the player to deploy, and is incredibly adaptable, but not particularly powerful in one area or another without sacrificing from some other aspect of their omnitool's performance, whereas a purchasable weapon will be more specialized towards a strength or two, but be finite: it will require marketplace supplies and will eventually degrade to uselessness if the player doesn't repair it from kits available in the marketplace.  There'll obviously be a ratio slider on the omnitool so a player can sacrifice, say, accuracy for power, recharge rate for range, or short-range effectiveness for long-range effectiveness.  Each configuration is available via hotkey, and the omnitool can morph between configurations with a moderate delay, whereas you'd only be able to bring one or two marketplace weapons that can only do two things with an endurance limit.  The omnitool's melee selection is an instant attack, but not a one-hit kill on a full-health player.  If the player wants to bring a broad sword to a fight, he'd have to select it from his mousewheel menu before he could use it, but it'd hit harder than the omnitool, for instance.\n\nGatherers would feed the marketplace with at least two methods of obtaining resources that they have to actively pursue, and one passive collection method that they can set up and come back and check and collect from every so often.  The passive gathering method is slower and less efficient, but can also yield resources active gathering cannot.  There would be multiple gathering types, each with its own resource types to collect, and a player can choose what kind of crafting or gathering they want to do by returning to a major friendly base and changing their preference at no cost to the player.  To combat players hanging out well behind friendly lines, gathering rates will start at the normal 1x in friendly territory, but the gathering rate will grow to 2x in contested territories, and up the further into enemy territory a gatherer gets.  You want to encourage people to infiltrate and poach, instead of sitting on their asses mindlessly clicking around the game screen.\n\nPlayers will ideally have numerous kit slots to customize themselves with.  There is no real classes in this instance.  Rather, a player is given a resource weight limit, with varying pieces of gear taking up more weight than others, dependent on the effectiveness of that piece.  Certain slots will allow a player to double or even triple-up on a characteristic, like additional shields or extra ammo.\n\nFood, made by crafters, gives a longer duration boost to a player that persists through death, but the boost is small.  Meds will offer a very short term but dramatic buff to a player that incurs a cooldown before next use.  We'll probably end up seeing movement speed, scoped stability, cone-of-fire control and even meds that allow for a quick burst of supersensing, so that a player's hearing temporarily becomes almost echolocation, or endowing a player with temporary night vision.  Something like that.\n\nHousing...eh.  I don't know yet.  I'd like to encourage players to have a sanctuary on the ground to be able to hang out, play easy-accessible non-combat games in open parks with each other, strut their cosmetics and rewards to each other, craft, use the marketplace, work on building-up and maintaining their individual housing that everyone can see, and generally waste subscription time instead of feeling like it's all just a mindless shooting grind.\n\nI don't recommend a leveling system, or RPG-like stats.  I'd like to see everyone be on the same playing field as much as possible, for fairness sake.  Easy to play, as light as possible on computer requirements, maybe even cross-platform, with a subscription system that is basically pay-as-you-go.\n\nGenerally, I hate 'teh hardcore' gaming mindsets.  I'd rather have an experience everyone can enjoy that's not horribly punishing, and inviting of multiple play experiences.\n\nDamn, I'm long-winded.\n\nAnyways, there it is.\n\nSorry for the wall 'o text.\n  "

2pcx0s,Ideas for new gaming playstyles for PvP Genres?,"Lately I've been thinking about different types of playstyles for various games and I've noticed that there are 3 main concepts when it comes to most PvP Games, which go as following:\n\n- The player has both health and a shield which absorbs all of the damage which regenerates while out of combat.\n- The player has both health and armor which reduces the amount of incoming damage by a certain percentage.\n- The player has plenty of health which regenerates to the max while not taking damage.\n\nNow I've been trying to come up with a few other ideas for a project that I am working on where it would incorporate such playstyles, balance them out between each other and have the players pick whatever they find best, but I am having difficulty with actually coming up something that is fun, unique and interesting enough that the players might actually pick this sort of style. Right now the only additional idea I have to these styles is:\n\n- A cloak which depends on your actions. By default you are less visible than the normal player and you also have less health. By performing a lot of actions such as running, shooting, looking around even will make you more visible to everybody else, while walking slowly, crouching and just generally not moving will majorly decrease your visibility and overtime you can even reach full invisibility.\n\nAgain this is still just an idea and I have no idea how it would work out when it comes down to balancing it, but you can pretty much say the same thing about the other 3. In any case, what about you guys? You got anything interesting ideas that can be incorporated into a sort of playstyle?"
2msj4q,A new game mechanic for FPS console games.,"Wondering if there's any interest in this. What if we could use the L and R triggers to control your shooting-arm and head in an fps game? \n\nThe way it would work is the L trigger would control the lifting of the arm into a ready stance (by default your shooting arm would be facing the ground so if you don't use L trigger to aim you'll end up shooting at the ground). The L trigger would also use pressure sensitivity to control how fast your arm goes up, so if you half hold it your arm is half way up.\n\nThis mechanic would work well if the player could also control the Y axis of the characters head movement using the R trigger to raise and lower the characters head. By default you have a full axis view but using the R trigger lets you raise and lower the camera and fixes the screen on the position of the gun/weapon for fast aiming, like aiming at enemies under a grated floor.\n"

I think the whole idea of not knowing who's at the top, or if you're even working towards your faction's goals is pretty cool. Perhaps you could even have spies that could try to mess up the other factions's plans, but might end up helping it along by being fed false info. Of course, there's the matter of how many ranks, how many people per ranks, and if people can make their own factions, but I think that shouldn't be too hard to sort out. I'm not a game designer myself, but I'd really like to play this."
2mprb8,A classic 80's medieval fantasy game.,"So it's made to look like a 1980's style fantasy cartoon. Like He-man, or the animated movie Fire and Ice. Would be cool if everything was hand painted if that's even possible. Also a SOLID sound track, something techno and 80's like. I kinda like the beginning of ""Surrogate People"" by John Frusciante. It would focus around a main character defeating some evil wizard or something. I want it to feel classic and almost satire."
2mlew1,My Game Idea: Among The Lost (Action RGP Puzzle),"Among The Lost is a, hmmm how do I put this? A Action, RGP, Puzzle Samurai game, it has a little bit of everything. You fallow a famous Samurai named Marek who once lived in the small village, that at this point is nameless because I can't think of one :P. Marek lived with his wife (Also can't think up a name for) and his son Ben (Might change name later), in till one day when the volcano near the village erupted it forced everyone to leave the Village on boats. If I ever get the programing skills and art skills to make this game I imagine this scene to be very cool looking. Marek leaves his family's boat to check if everyone is alright when a wave comes, he is separated from his family and wakes up some place he has never been before. He is awoken by a pregnant woman named Anya who later teaches you the controls of the game and other useful skills. However when she has the baby it doesn't have a heart beat. She asks Marek to take her up to a church at the top of a hill to pray for her baby. Once they get up there Marek somehow brings the baby to life, then he finds out he has spiritual powers. Anyway long story short Marek goes of a journey to find his family defeat his nemesis (witch is a spirit. I have a name for him but I have no idea how to spell it.) The game will be largely centered around culture (mostly real life Japanese and Chinese),skill Trees, dialog choices and more. I have a great idea for the end of the game but! if I ever do get the skills to make this game I don't want to spoil it! I might say more about this game at a later date. Tell me if you like this idea, or if it sounds like another game. If it dose sound like another game, sorry! I wasn't trying to rip anyone off. Anyway see ya later (This is my first Reddit post so sorry if its a bit sloppy) Baiiiii! &lt;3                   "
2mjy6r,Action Figure Therapy: The Video Game,"Action Figure Therapy is a comedy channel on youtube. Here's their channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/actionfiguretherapy (Sorry if the link doesn't work). If you watch some of their videos I think you'll understand what I mean. Anyway, my idea is that you're the new guy at AFT headquarters, (fps, by the way) and you go out and do silly missions, like in one video they fought a bunch of pit bulls or terrorists. My idea is that they either still look like action figures, just animated (similar to borderlands) or full cartoon. You meet the Angry Ranger, Marine, Jungle, Snow and all the other ones. My thought was that depending on the mission you'd be with different characters. I also thought up the idea of calling in backup.\n10 kill streak: The medic\n20: The sniper\n30: Disgruntled Ninja Assassin\n40: The tank\n50: Super soldier\n60: Stanley, the African honey badger (if you watch the video ""Honey Badger Blood Orgy you'll know why).\nNote: It'd be pretty hard to die, so it's not too hard to get the kill streak.\n-Multiplayer-\nI figured if the campaign was too short we could add multiplayer. Each person can make their own action figure using a large variety of designs. Weapons would include: Snipers, machine guns, assault rifles, shotguns etc.\nThe maps could range from anything, from hardware depot, church or strip clubs. (All this makes sense if you see the videos).\n-Missions in the Campaign-\nMy idea would be that there is one main evil guy and a bunch of little side missions. Action figure therapy has information on business inquiries on it's channel and web site. http://actionfiguretherapy.com/ Please feel free to share your ideas and opinions. Thanks!"
2mg4ad,The Experiment: Multiplayer Co-op Deathmatch Puzzle Game?!,"It's a multiplayer co-op deathmatch puzzle game where each character is a subject of an experiment carried out in a lab. \n\nEach session of the game is an experiment. (Think various maps.) But only one person survives. (The session ends when everyone but one is dead.) But you have to coöperate with others to survive -up to a point. \n\nFor example, there are 10 subjects in a specific experiment and nine player characters spawn with a shotgun shell. And the other one spawns with a shotgun. \n\nThis requires lethal or non-lethal melee combat. (Punching, kicking etc) to obtain the limited resource (i.e. shotgun) \n\nOR; you need to activate an elevator to get the shotgun, but the elevator needs weight to operate. So after killing x amount of players you need to carry the dead bodies into it; but one person is not enough to carry it. You need at least two  to lift them.(plus x amount of dead bodies) Then; when the elevator comes down the fight for the shotgun begins.\n\nOR; (a 1 on 1 session) you spawn in a room divided into two by mirrored glass. Both players have one bullet and one pistol. Do you shoot? Do you wait for the other to shoot and break the glass so that you can go in and kill him/her? Or do you talk (like good friends) and agree that you two will leave your guns in a drawer (when loaded with both pistols) operates a mechanism that lowers the whole glass? Or do you just trick the other person into thinking that you put your gun in there? Do you know if it will operate without your pistol's weight? Can s/he just place some brick in it and fake it? Do you dare pulling this trick?\n\nSo it's like a gladiator fight (and some mind games) in a lab.\n\n"
2md9rc,Assassin's Creed : Greek Revolution (An idea for an upcoming Assassin's Creed),"Our Facebook page : www.facebook.com/acgreekrevo\n\nEnglish:\n\nAn idea for a new Assassin's Creed, which will take place in the Greek Revolution. The concept is quite simple, but we believe that the idea fits the franchise. Until now, the setting is in the mountains of Greece, where the assassin could climb, fight and parkour among the rocks and trees, much like the Assassin's Creed 3. The biggest battle of the game may be the battle of Messolonghi, where the Greeks fought against the Turks and a few Egyptians. The game will show the beatings the Greeks had to face , and generally the Greeks fighting. From missions, one of them could be the protagonist trying to save Athanasios Diakos, but fails, and because the Revolution contained about 1,000 battles, there are too many scenarios for missions and the history of the game. From weapons and more, there will be the standard Greek pistol, the cloves and various swords. Of course, the classic hidden blade in Assassin will not be missing.\nThe story and the character wants a lot more work, like all the rest, but we believe that the basis of the idea is pretty good for a possible game\n\nΕλληνικά :\n\nΜια ιδέα για ένα νέο Assassin's Creed, το οποίο θα διαδραματίζεται στην Ελληνική Επανάσταση. Το concept είναι αρκετά απλό, αλλά πιστεύουμε ότι η ιδέα ταιριάζει στο franchise. Μέχρι τώρα, το setting είναι στα βουνά της Ελλάδος, όπου ο πρωταγωνιστής θα μπορεί να σκαρφαλώνει, να πολεμάει και να κάνει παρκούρ ανάμεσα στα βράχια και στα δέντρα, περίπου σαν το Assassin's Creed 3. Η μεγαλύτερη μάχη του παιχνιδιού μπορεί να είναι η μάχη του Μεσολογγίου, όπου οι Έλληνες πολέμησαν ενάντια στους Τούρκους και μερικούς Αιγυπτίους. Το παιχνίδι θα δείχνει την ταλαιπωρία που ""έδερνε"" τους Κλέφτες και τους Αμαρτολούς, και γενικά τους Έλληνες που πολεμούσαν. Απο αποστολές, μια απο αυτές θα μπορούσε να είναι ο πρωταγωνιστής που προσπαθεί να σώσει τον Αθανάσιο Διάκο, αλλά αποτυγχάνει, και αφού η Επανάσταση περιείχε περίπου 1.000 μάχες, υπάρχουν πάρα πολλά σενάρια για αποστολές και για την ιστορία του παιχνιδιού. Από όπλα και άλλα, θα υπάρχει η τυπική Ελληνική πιστόλα, το καρυοφύλλι και διάφορα σπαθιά. Φυσικά, η κλασσική hidden blade του Assassin δεν θα λείπει. \nΗ ιστορία και ο χαρακτήρας θέλει πολλή δουλειά ακόμη, όπως και όλα τα υπόλοιπα, αλλά πιστεύουμε ότι η βάση της ιδέας είναι αρκετά καλή για ένα ενδεχόμενο παιχνίδι.\n\n"
2omrw4,A fairly sad action-adventure game I thought up a bit ago,"Main character girl wakes up in a shadowy place and vaguely feels it being familiar\n\n On her arm is a tattoo of the word ""Girl"" in a bunch of languages\n\nShe goes through with some magic or some shit fighting shady monsters, most of which are very human-like and they get harder and harder the farther in you go\n\nEventually there is an invincible enemy with blood and skulls and other freaky death shit on it and it wields a really really powerful weapon.\n\nMain Character Girl flees from invincible nightmare fuel into a train tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel there is a really bright light\n\nShe notices the monster isn't chasing her so she walks into the blinding light and covers her eyes a little\n\nThen someone shouts ""Clear!"" and Main Character Girl wakes up in a hospital surrounded by doctors, she is now more masculine and looks like a guy.\nThe tattoo's words are on her arm still but they're burned/cut into it instead of tattooed\n\nShe freaks out, pushes the doctors away, jumps out the window, and the game begins again\n\nBut this time things are even harder to beat, and when you reach the end of the tunnel the screen just gets brighter and brighter until you're whited out and then it shows a grave stone that reads ""Ryan Lockheart""  A girl comes by to it. puts down a rose, and puts a thing over ""Ryan"" That says ""Rain""\n\n Then... Main menu"

2oehni,RTS Voxel Based mining game...,Basically a modern version of the PC version of Lego Rock Raiders :D
2od2vc,Yet another MMORPG ... (idea),"I like MMORPG, I know they get sometimes boring, by grinding endles tons of the same looking mobs, but that hint of rpg and story makes me happy. I had this idea for a whilem if someone had similar idea.... Are you my soulmate?\n\nThe whole world is quite native american inspired, but surely with some greenish (or blueish) skin tones the whole could be made into alien world.\n\nSo after all the classical character build (hair face, tatoos etc.) \nYou will choose a faction: 3 so far \n\nThe prarie people: in tents living deer and buffalo hunting folks.\nThe farmers: Building simple clay-cobblestone buildings, as as the charactarization says it, farming skill is quite high-tho they hunt and fish as well\nThe citizens: (aztek-maya cities) They build giant stone cities, do bit farming, bit hunting, but they are also big in slave trade.\n\n\nThen you start the game with a intro, where is a classic family (Mother father, baby) depending on the gender of the character there will be an almost lookalike of your just constructed character (Mommy or daddy... you guessed you are the baby). As the story goes on (intro into the world-stories told by the parents-about gods, nature, sprits) you see that one of your parents (the one that looks like you) went on hunt (or collecting berries-I know bit gender roling) and didnt come back, only the corpse is found chopped up by a grizzly. There is whoole ritually inclueding the the ceromonial corpse burning.\n\nAs the story progress you learn to walk, talk (all the fun things), but still knee high. One day you hear a shriek... this is the point that you start actually play you go (after the game told you how to use the wasd) to a clearing when you see the impossible. A giant eagle captured and took away your remaining parent (I know bit of main character orphan clichee). \n\nStory video.. where the village (or tribe) elders promise to take care of you. Back in game: They train you in classics like hunting with bow arrow, spear, blowpipe, axe, man to man combat, and also crafting weaponary, and classic stuff like pottery, leather processing, sewing clothes and tents. (Had a thought that before you log out you should make a rest place if it is a simple campfire or build a simple tent when between settlements, so the char gets rested and can get some sweet experience boost when logging back) (Note on the pottery, not just for storing fluids-that reminds me an active thirst hunger meter option would make the game interesting, potions and such, but also to store stuff, if you are in a wood and got full inventory just drop a clay pot on the ground and store there some stuff, and come back for it later,and because evryone can acces such pots you have option to dig it-and hide it, you can mark the spot on your map, still someone lucky might find your pot and loot it).\nBy every level you gain you will rise in experience and knowledge, but also your appearance changes. Abou lvl 15 you finally grow into full character you have created so long time ago, plus it is time when you finnaly get to choose your name- the elders will gave you a co-name, dependeing in which area of your training you were at best (Bob-the keen eye-when your aim with bow is good, or Bob the strong if you defeated 15 mobs that were 2 lvl or higher over you and you didnt die etc.). After a cerenomy you are disclosed you have fate in the stars so you must undergo a final test to be recognized as a full member of the tribe.\n\nThe final mission in the starter area: you go into a ""Dungeon""- cave or really dark forest, where except the classical animal foes as bats angry rats and so you encounter special-dungeons limited foes- Spirits.\nAfter helping the spirits to enter their dimension, by bashing their heads with your weapons, you find the final Boss which when fighting you loose and end up in wierd dimennsion, where you find improsened friendly spirit (animal spirit with some nice neon tribal painting on it), you help it and together you escape the dimension and finally are back in the dungeon facing the boss, with joined forces you defeat him. And so you have aquired your spirit animal. (Note: as other spirits they are visibal only in dungeons and holy areas, otherwise its just another voice in your head - custom appearance of your animal can be changed only in the item store)\n\nAfter returning to elders you are called hero of the nation and send to the world for adventures (Tho the main one is to find the giant eagle and kick his ass), you gain new knowledges, like how to catch a horse in the wild and make it your mount, or how to get pet (finding a wolfs den, killing the mother and take one baby wolf-raising it). Every area in the world has few settlments, few dungeons-spirit areas. \n\nWhen killed you awaken in spirit ring (several in each area-entrance a holy trea) and back in world you have to go back to your body, a count down is set, and when you are killed again witih the limit, you awake on a burrial bed on a cemetery-with your body (only one in each region)\n\nWell thats the main idea so far-well SPOILER-(The eagle is the parent who got killed by spirit bear, and actually   was a spirit hiding in body of human and stayed because..love and stuff.. when you were old enough he took his soulmate to his home, leaving you in alone, so you could have the life of a mortal)\n\nNote: will repair typos later."
2oba8o,"Soldiers Mark (FPS, Open World)","The game has multiple points to it so i'll get started.\nThe game is based off of a fanfic i write and its one of those, What if this happen? that's the goal i'm trying to achieve here. The game would contain 3 modes, Campaign, Co-op (multiplayer campaign, still open world) and Multiplayer (closed areas). \nIf you are not a Brony or you dislike Bronies, please stop reading\nA Man by the name of John Michael Hunter, a former marine is killed on earth but is reborn on equestria, only to perform complicated tasks, that involve killing anyone or destroying anything, that poses a threat to canterlot.\nThe campaign would consist of multiple game mechanics making it difficult. The way your character feels, affects the gameplay, if you are hurt, it affect your gameplay.\nCo-op Consists of 2 players, which are the 2 main characters, its pretty much campaign but with a buddy. Open World makes the gameplay more expanded and more free feeling\nMultiplayer Consists of 6v6 to 12v12, all gun types available are gone by Type ### (AR, SR, SG, MG, Pistol, etc)\nfor more details, contact me on G+ under the name of MassBronyAssault, the only social media i use, also on Skype, iantit."
2oanq9,New game idea,"I love animals and nat geo wild...why not try making a game where you can pick your animal and start off as a cub and growing into an adult starting your own adventure. If you're a lion then you start a pride, wolves a pack, leopard your own adventures and ect. I'd go nuts on that game! "
2o4v64,Only The Fittest Will Survive (Survival/Survival Horror),"The year is 1608. You are a craftsman sailing the Atlantic to the colony of Jamestown Virginia. Your trek to seek the new world for a new life is halted though as a thundering storm rolls in. Your ship is tossed left and right through the oceans waves. You see your other shipmates get washed off the deck of the ship as you grab hold of the railing. One of your shipmates grabs the railing next to you as well in a panic. The ship begins to creak loudly as wind catches the sails with enough force the bottom of the main mast shatters. You see the mast coming down and grab your shipmates hand to pull him aside, but you are too late as the collapsing mast crushes him tossing the both of you into the sea. You are now violently being swung at debris and bodies under the water. You finally surface a ways away and climb aboard a plank you see floating in the water. Your vision is now blurry and you see your blood dripping in the water. You look to the distance and see the ship split in two sinking. The last thing you see is a final flash of lightning that lights the top of the ship ablaze as you faint from your head wound. When you finally wake up it is on the beach in the Americas. The sun is shinning and birds are chirping. You're not sure how long you've been here.  How you're alive or where anyone else is at. You don't know where Jamestown is or even what continent you're on. You only know your ship has been sunk and you are still holding onto the arm of your dead shipmate which you toss aside in disbelief. \n\nDon't worry. That was the intro. You're not dead....yet.  This game is a survival/survival horror where you are stranded on the continents of the Americas. Your goal. Live as long as you can. There is no story. There is no hope. There is no rescue. Do you honestly think someone will come searching for you? Look, this is the 1600s, people died all the time coming to the Americas so why think someone will come to save you? Your goal of this game? SURVIVE! That means various diseases, Starvation, Dehydration, Infection, Animals.,Native American tribes, Salt water poisoning, Food poisoning, Poisonness plants, Poisonness animals, etc. That's easier said than done though as when you die. Game over. Start again. I mean, if there was no risk there would be no reward right? Also, what's a game without a challenge?\n\nWhen on the ship your create your character. You can also switch between first and third person.\n\nThis game is based off a crafting system and basic survival skills. A spear is the oldest weapon in human history other than a rock. I suggest you make one after you scavenge the wreckage of your ship. Of course if after searching the wreckage of the ship you don't have a knife you'll have to find a sharp rock. Though, if you find a musket then good for you! Now just find a musket ball, gunpowder, and cloth to reload it! And make sure you use the items in the right order so it doesn't explode in your face. Also you'll have to wait 30 secs for the reload speed to fire it. Don't forget to clean it too. Like I said Reward=Most powerful weapon in the game. Risk=it's high maintenance. \n\nCrafting will feature A LOT of items, maybe 500+, but I'll make a short list of subcategories.\n\nWeaponry of the time period or previous periods. Also crude weaponry.\nShelter will consist of you imagine it you build it. (For example like Minecraft, but with real world physics.)\nFires.\nFood Processing.\nWater Processing.\nHealing items. (Ex: plants with anti-biotic properties, oils from certain foods, bandages for bleeding, splints for broken legs, etc.)\n\nThen there will be survival skills for your character that get better with use and increase your chance of survival.\n\nBlacksmithing.\nForaging.\nCooking.\nSheltermaking.\nFiremaking.\nWoodcutting.\nHunting.\nMedical.\nFighting.\n\nThere will be a huge list of enimies as well which some are harder to kill than others. And those Native Americans will find cover and not just stand in the open as you shoot them with arrows or throw spears at them. I'll list the enemies from strongest to weakest.\n\n-Grizzly Bear (When Columbus first discovered America their .50 cal musket balls only grazed their skulls and made them angrier.)\n-Black Bear (Bears are also really LOUD!!!)\n-Native Americans\n-Shark\n-Gray Wolf (travels in packs, don't walk into it's den)\n-Brown Wolf\n-Cougar\n-Panther\n-Grizzly and Black Bear Cub (The moms sure to be near by)\n-Moose (They are very territorial)\n-Various Poisonness Snakes\n-Buffalo\n-Etc. \n\nThere are also non-hostile creatures like,\n\n-Deer\n-Elk\n-Squirrel\n-Fish\n-Rabbit\n-Owl\n-Hawk\n-Eagle\n-Posom\n-Rat\n-Horse\n-Etc.\n\nSo you've built your shelter. Got some food. Made a fire and boiled water. Have a weapon. Your all set. When a Grizzly Bear attacks.  Your ears are enveloped in the loudest roar you've heard. She rips through your camp and chases you relentlessly. She's also faster than you and when She catches you...you're screwed. She rips through your chest in gory fashion and as you try and punch her with your fist she rips off you're arm and then the last thing you see is her jaws around your face and then...the screen goes red. Game Over.\n\nNext time you set up camp you are attacked by wolves. They tag team you and rip your throat out while one eats your insides in bloody and gory fashon as you can't do anything, but sit there and watch as you die. Game Over. \n\nNext time you are attacked by a Native American. You get into a fight to the death with him and end up disarming him with your superior combat skills and bashing his head in with the axe, but, I think there is a serious critical gash where he struck you in the leg. Better patch that up quickly, oh wait, you died of blood loss. Game Over.\n\nOr maybe you got really sick and had diarrhea so bad you died. Game Over. (This actually happened to people when they first moved to the Americas.)\n\nMaybe you should try online with a friend, just watch out for other players in the non-private servers. Also make sure you hide your stuff or soneone might loot your camp while offline. Maybe dig a hole and place a marker? \n\nThis is my video game idea. I hope you liked it and that someday it will become s reality. For Consoles and PC.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
2o4nn6,i have a few different ideas,"im currently using construct 2, i dont think ill be able to create these games i have in mind using this engine, but anyways\n\nFirst Game\n-----------------\nName: Hack Me ( if you have a better one feel free to suggest )\nType: Multi-Player Hacking Simulator\n\nso you load up the game and you have a virtual pc. you can from there access the (Fake) internet to find and download different programs kinda like (SLAVE HACK ) and with these programs you can steal bank accounts/ player info / IP addresses but a cool thing is that players can use there In Game Money to purchase domains (.com/ .net /.org  ect...) and upload their software and tools and virus's for other players to download and use real html to make their website\n\ni can get way more in-depth but i don't really feel like it unless people are interested in this sort of thing"
2o455a,Crazy NSFW Game Idea,I think a game where you go to the strip club as a really intoxicated man. And try to get in and give money to the girls and get private dances. But you have to walk similar to Octodad and have to not get kicked out would be funny and cool idea.
2r1074,Garden Terrors: A Horror Game,"Credit goes to R.L Stine,s Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes for part of the idea.\n\nIn this game, you play as a teenager that just moved to a new house rumored to be haunted with your family. Every night, you hear lots of noise and tiny footsteps coming from your backyard. Whenever you wake up, your parents get mad at you for a bad, horrible act of mischief that you never caused. Strangely, Lawn ornaments seem to be closer and closer to your house every day. One night, you decide to go outside and investigate. The ornaments act sort of like weeping angels, they move when your not looking. You must destroy all ornaments and hide the pieces after finding the hammer within a certain time limit that decreases each night. (First night is 30 minutes, second is 25, third is 20 etc.) \n\nWhen talking with your family, you can decide what to say Mass Effect-style. You can also purchase tools at the shop by earning money through chores."
2r0w16,Children of the Immortal Ones,"This game is a MMORPG. Basically, each player chooses a different god to be their parent (At the start there are Greek, Norse and Egyptian ones). Each god has different abilities to offer. When the player chooses a god, they start out in front of their parent,s shrine or engraving from real life in the ancient times of their people (Greek Demigods in Ancient Greece etc.) \n\nThey then fight invaders, criminals and mythological creatures from their people,s legends as they travel to places mentioned in these myths (Polyphemus,s Island, The Underworld etc.) There will be weapons that are appropriate to the time period and are in these stories.\n\nOver time, the game would be updated with more mythologies (Native American, Shinto, Babylonian, Mayan etc.) \n\nThe player can also help their people fight wars with the people of other players. Sort of like Smite."
2qwtle,Police Sim/Tactical Shooter,"A return to the tactical shooter/police Sim. \n\nIdea, take all the realism and training (range practice, procedures, sniper training etc from the original Police Quest SWAT and CQC shoot house from 4). Have a similar level cycle from the original swat where you play as each position in the team (or the option to skip to the next level), with additional tasks and objectives based on what role you are qualified for. Penalties for excessive use of force etc.\n\nA career progression mechanic where you start as a recruit and work your way up through the team to become Team Leader and then onto even more senior operational roles (I'm thinking something along the lines of mission planning like the original Rainbow Six games - where you plan an attack and direct AI to do the assault). The progression would not be linear, encouraging multiple playthroughs (save game+ type so experience would carry over). Alternatively a retry/replay mission option to achieve 100% result allowing single game progression to higher level qualifications. \n\nOnline would be cops vs bad guys, with the enemy team given random objectives (escape, take no prisoners, plant a bomb), the ability to set traps or take hostages, even a negotiator game where one player has to make contact with an enemy player (if they want to even negotiate) with bonuses for accepting or ignoring negotiations - trade something for something else; stop police from breaching etc. Negotiation sub game would have hidden objectives for both teams (police have something like, 'agree to their demands, but send in a team quietly' and enemy have 'talk to the police while the rest of the team sneaks out'.)"
2qtl83,One Universal Engine for User Generated Game Data,"I've always thought it would be great to have an engine that would allow a user/gamer to create a level in a game, but that level Data could be then used not only in the same game, but in other games.  Let me give you an example:  A gamer plays SimCity and after playing for a white the game is saved and uploaded to the servers/cloud.  That ""City"" could then be selected as a data set for a First Person Shooter game where the enemies (which were created on another game by a gamer) run rampant through the city.\n\nThis would allow for seemingly infinite levels on pretty much any game genre.  The biggest challenge is to unify/standardize the data so that it can be used in different scenarios.\n\nI never thought it could be done, but lately with games like LittleBig Planet, Minecraft, and other games where users/gamers create the levels/tools for others to play, I think the time has come to give this a try.\n\nI'm not a programmer, so I'm never going to pursue this, but I would love for someone (or a group of people) to attempt it."
2qtgi2,A hybrid rhythm game/bullet hell,"Boss fights only.\n\nAll shooting and effects from the boss are synced to the music.\n\nThe bosses are hard, and the fights are long.\n\nThe bosses have a number of forms, which is the number of phrases you want to include from the song.\n\nThe music will repeat a single phrase and all the synced moves until the boss' life bar reaches zero, then it moves on to the next phrase of the song and progresses to the next form.\n\nMaybe include a rudimentary editor so players can make their own bosses and sync their own music to create their own levels."
2qrwa5,Worlds at War-Golden age sci fi 4X,"I'm picturing a turn-based strategy game (or maybe paradox-style realtime-with-pause) set in a solar system that looks like how it was pictured in the 50's.  Venus would be a swampy jungle, Mars would be a drying, ancient world crossed by canals.  Earth would be locked in a continuing cold war.  \n\nStarting on earth, the USA, USSR, or maybe another large country or bloc.  You'd need to balance your geopolitical situation at home while expanding to explore and colonize/win influence on other worlds (moon, Venus, and Mars certainly, maybe some others too).  Each planet would also be inhabited, Mars by an ancient race of canal-builders, Venus by many patches of intelligent, symbiotic jungle ecosystems/hive minds.  You could play as either of these, for a rather different game.  \n\nI'd tweak the standard 4x formula somewhat.  For example, you'd have two main sliders to vary when playing a human nation: social control and economic control.  Push economic control lower, and you have a larger overall economy but less direct control over it.  You have less available to, eg, build government spaceships, but private AI controlled companies may invest in lunar colonies on their own.  Social control would interact with ""public opinion"".  Your people will be happiest when you are doing what they want...so if the public mood favors space exploration, launching rockets will make them happy.  If the public mood favors ""earth first"" it will piss them off.  Low social control gives you a greater happiness boost when you are doing what the people want, but little ability to control public opinion.  High social control gives you a greater ability to force public opinion, but lesser overall happiness.  \n\nThe other species would have their own sliders...for example, the alien jungle networks could favor ""tall"" or ""wide"" growth (high improvement of small terrain vs fast expansion) as well as favoring high diversity or low diversity ecosystems.  Still kicking around ideas for the martians, they might have a ""Stasis vs innovation"" axis.  \n\nI'd also change the research method a bit...you'd gain research in areas by doing things.  Send biologists to Venus to learn more about the jungle, launch more ships to gain more expertise in rocketbuilding, etc."
2qqkiz,Reaper's Revenge,"This game is first person.You play as Kal and the Frozen one from my last idea.\n\nThe frozen one breaks you out of prison.You find yourself in a seemingly endless void.A portal appears and you jump in.You find yourself in hell,near a huge castle.You go inside and see Satan.He looks at you and attacks you.(Switch to frozen one)You fight with Kal to kill Satan.After he dies,you rule hell.(Switch to Kal)You are returned to Earth in modern times.From then it is like Gta.You can switch between Kal and the frozen one."
2qq689,Reaper,"You play as a man named Kal,who was killed and possessed by death.He fights through bad spirits and demons until he is free.Then he wants revenge.\n\nPlot:Kal is a normal assassin in 1500.He is hunting an unnamed target,who he believes to be running from him when the target is actually running from Death.Kal hears a noise and turns around,seeing a cloaked figure holding a big scythe.Kal beats Death in h2h combat but Death kills him with his scythe.(Cutscene)Kal wakes up in a dark place and the only thing he can see is Death.He attacks Death(End Cutscene)A fight happens.When Kal loses all health,(Cutscene)Death raises his hand,releasing purple energy into Kal.Kal screams in pain.Death laughs and Kal slumps to the ground.Seconds later he gets up and his eyes are pure purple.You look through his eyes as he kills lots of people.He narrates,saying he was forced to watch as Death gave him two small scythes,as he killed lots of people and innocent spirits.Death raises his hand,and Kal,who calls himself reaper,disappears and appears in a low level of Hell.He looks around.Lava flows in rivers,and the ground is obsidian.(End Cutscene)\nDemons attack and Kal kills them all.He climbs to a higher level.It looked like a paradise,but when he touches the water,it burns him.When he goes near a tree,it changes the level to look like the last one.(Cutscene)Satan appears to Kal and tells him about how he knows Death will betray him.Kal ask what does it have to do with him.Satan says that if Kal kills Death,he will be free from Hell.Kal agrees.Satan gives him black armor,a big sword and the ability to throw a fireball(first spell)Kal puts on the armor,puts the sword on his belt and Demons come.(End Cutscene)Kal kills them all.He goes into a building,opens a chest,which holds a pair of glove that when they touch something they steal its soul.He puts them on.He kills a Hellhound(Boss).He sees Death and calls out to him.Death jumps at him.Kal jumps to meet him.He lands 50 hits with his scythes before Death destroys them.He attacks Death with his fist.Death is extremely weakened.Kal tries to steal Death's soul but finds out he doesn't have one.He takes ou the sword,stabs death and burns him.Kal yells to the air that he did what was asked of him and wants freedom.Satan appears,and taps Kal,who appears in a dungeon.He is tortured,swearing that he will have revenge on Death.\n(Roll Credits)\nKal looks at  a pair of chains binding him.They are freezing.A figure appears.He is made of ice.He smashes the chains and says he will help Kal get vengeance.Kal asks who he is.The figure says that he is The Frozen One."
2qpyx2,Harry Potter Universe Telltale Game,I thought about this after watching a hp movie marathon. Imagine all the possibilities.

2qngrw,Does this Pokemon-style superhero game exist?,"I had an idea for a Pokemon-style game where you act as some kind of overwatch commander in charge of a bunch of superheroes. \n\nThere's an Earth map in front of you and you get alerted to an attack on a location by a super-criminal and are presented with his/her profile, complete with power set and suggested response strategy.\n\nYou look at cards that each show a member of your stable of heroes, their power type/weakness, .etc and then you dispatch them accordingly to deal with different threats. Then, after a certain amount of time you're told whether or not that response was successful.\n\nI guess, technically, it would be a Pokemon/card game-style game. Does something like this exist?"
2qlbqc,Survival Game Idea,"Hello, as for a Facebook user who follows PCGamer, you may have noticed one of their latest posts about survival games. It got me thinking about what I would love in a survival game, if any programmer/game developer wants to make this game, I would pay great amounts if it was done right, anyway to the ideas.\n\n1. Procedural land generation.\nThis one is pretty self explanatory, world generation that is randomly generated and can have a set of structures that generate within the world. The generation would be random, and large enough to spend a lot of time exploring. A seed system would be amazing as well, to post them to the world to see and/or use.\n\n2. Creatures\nAs for creatures, it is said in the PCGamer post that most survival games have something like zombies, cannibals, and such. But I think this game doesn't even need that. Nature has its own challenges to face. As long as the game is realistic, and not over the top, then it would make it much better in my opinion. As for actual creatures, realistic and actual existing creatures would add to the realism factor of the game. Which is what the game should be directed towards. \n\n3. Core Mechanics\nA few games have unrealistic mechanics, which can ruin the game in certain aspects. Some things I think would make a survival game much more realistic, yet enjoyable would be:\nRealistic Gravity. This one is pretty self explanatory.\nRealistic Hunger/Thirst. Again, another self explanatory one.\nTemperature. Hypothermia, heat stroke, you name it. Not many games implement this feature for some reason.\n\n4. Material gathering. As for the material gathering, I would think that you wouldn't be able to punch trees. *cough cough Minecraft cough*\nMaking realistic material gathering sort of goes under the realistic game core mechanics, but I thought this one was a little bit more important.\n\n5. Multiplayer support. I have found games that have most of these mechanics, but aren't multiplayer. I want to be able to play with my friends on this game, pretty self explanatory.\n\nSo, there are my ideas for a game. If anybody knows of a game that has all these categories, mail me the web page to the game. Or even if some programmers are reading this and would create this game, I would so very much appreciate this game being created.\n\n"
2qklrx,An idea for a first person shooter!!!,"The game is called War In Sight. It has a story mode, free play mode, vs. mode and, werewolves mode. The story mode is about a Classified mission being done by the Marines. Only 350 corps are chosen to go. They have to kill a man named Carlos Miladosin (MIL-A-DOSE-IN). He is a drug dealer,murderer and, robber. The free play mode is just you being a normal guy or girl (you can customize your character) dealing with the bad city you live in. VS. mode is kinda like the multiplayer mode in Call of Duty and Battlefield mixed together. Werewolves mode, i got this idea from Call of Duty's Zombies mode. You have to find your way to a safety point with hairy monsters in the area."
2mbd6i,Coils the Snake!,So i was just playing around learning Box2D for the first time and I ended up making this kinda cute little snake game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiORsS2k-8s Its actually surprisingly fun to play around with so I decided to continue development. This'll be my first game using a physics engine. I was just wondering if /r/gameideas had any ideas for what direction to take it. Thanks in advance for any ideas you might provide! :D

2m0ayj,Unity 2D/3D Programmer here. Willing to make a game idea of yours!,"Provided you can come up with a relatively simple idea (something that shouldn't take more than 2-3 weeks to make), I'd be more than happy to make some of your guys/gals ideas. If your idea gets made, I'd of course be willing to give you a cut of any profits. :D\n\nAnyway, use this thread to come up with ideas, or to find other members to come up with an idea with."
2lyswu,Player Characterization Idea,"Okay, so this is really more of a stem for the first part of a game than a full-fledged idea, and even then it's more of a 'I wonder if this will work?' but still:\n\nIf a game began in first person, without you seeing your character's body at all, but you hear their dialogue and can look around, but can't control where they're moving. This goes on for say 10-30 minutes of the game, then suddenly your character loses their personality for some reason (I'll explain an idea I had while writing this later) and then the game is in third person, and you are given complete control of the players actions, could you influence the player's decisions on how they played based purely on those first few minutes of characterized gameplay?\n\nSo, for example, imagine [Batman: Arkham Asylum] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum), where in the beginning The Joker is being carted off, tied down, and is essentially dragged through the first area of Arkham Asylum. Imagine if that was the player's character, let's call him Jeff, and Jeff is a real nutjob of a guy. All he likes to do is kill people, he goes on and on and on in this first scene talking about how he just loves to be a real psycho - But he mentions, rather heavily, that he doesn't like to kill women or children, let's say. Then, later on, when we get to the end of this first section, the player gets a lobotomy. Then, they wake up far later, and for the rest of the game you can see Jeff, because you are in third not first person, and he never speaks or reflects on his actions again. It's all on the player. Could that game condition the player to behave as that character would? Could a game train people to be their own versions of Jeff?\n\nJust a thought, please tell me yours :)"
2luf93,"Uneasy Alliance, a 5 player kinda co-op fantasy maze game.","-Concept and game play-\n\n\n\nA team of 5 players must reach the end of a maze before the time runs out. the catch is one of the players is secretly trying to make you lose. One player must assume the role of The Construct, a massive machine built by a lost civilization to fight evil. \n\n\n\nThe Construct is the most powerful member of the group, the Construct is required to defeat the boss at the end of the maze and kill the evil as party members can not hurt each other due to magic weapons (it makes sense with the story). The construct is also the only member of the group who knows where the evil is, so the group must follow him. The Construct is immune to most types of damage like electricity,fire,poison, but is still susceptible to physical damage. The construct lacks eyes and sees a simple geometric view of the world around it. The construct sees enemies as evil spirits or their true form, the other party members see dark spawn or corrupted. The other party members must call out traps or other dangers so the Construct can avoid them. The Construct is also vulnerable to attacks from the rear. If a enemy attacks the construct from behind it climbs atop it and the construct is unable to attack it, when this happens the other members of the party must remove it or it will keep attacking in till the construct is destroyed.\n\n\n\nThe evil is randomly selected from the 4 party members. The evil's ultimate goal is to stop the construct from reaching him. The evil has total control over the maze and can open passages, set traps for the construct and party. The evil can also command minions telling them where to attack or stand. The evil however must be careful with his minions as they do not attack him by default. His minions know he is corrupted and avoid him, the Evil must sometimes kill his own minions or risk exposure. The evil cannot directly kill the other party members, the party members weapons have been enchanted to prevent use on other party members so the evil must abandon his weapon to kill other party members directly; but party members would surely notice if you abandoned your party sword and is a evil move as pure party members would never consider it(you can only drop your party weapon if your evil). The evil can also intentionally lead the party the wrong way or the construct into a trap; but so can a pure party member who is just stupid. If the construct makes it to the boss, the evil has one last chance to stop the construct. The evil can reveal himself and take direct control of the boss (you don't have to do this, you will still lose unless you weakened the construct, you cant just not do anything the entire game then nuke it with the boss. think of the boss as that little bit of extra damage to finish it off) the party member you controlled is killed.\n\n\n\nThe Other party members are for support and should try to figure out who the corrupted member is. The party must stay together, even though the dark spawn are weak the corrupted are just as strong as a individual party member and in one v one situations are difficult as they block and parry. Two party members are recommended to easily kill corrupted mortals. I envision sending large groups of hundreds of dark spawn and 10-20 corrupted at a time so teamwork to quickly kill hard targets is a must.\n\n\n\nThe maze I imagined to be randomly generated with tile sets. I would like to have several groups of sets that would be tied to locations in the story and would be varied. Some sort fairness randomization would be needed to give the evil some chances to kill the construct.\n\n\n\n\n-Story and Setting-\n\nUneasy Alliance takes place in the fantasy world on Tyrnna. Tyrnna was been torn by war for as long as anyone can remember and slowly the number of races has died out as the weaker races who were not fit for warfare died out. \n\n\n\nOnly three races still remain. The sudo-roman humans, whose king has been corrupted and very castle became a fortress of evil. The Orcs have lived the same way for hundreds of years. they thrived of the warfare and the world of the Orcs is filled with warlords and tribal conflicts. the Orcs hate other Orcs as much as they hate elves. The elves; pushed to the brink of extension by their Orc neighbors the elves were forced to retreat into the ruins of the very civilization they destroyed and it changed them forever. The Elves emerged from the ruins savage and unrelenting as a brutal army retook elevish lands from the Orc warlords.\n\n\n\nThe story begins when, one human general and right hand of the king named Marco Fadius Adjutor saw forces of evil building. plans to build an army of corrupted from all races and the artifact needed to do it. Marco realizes that the evil is counting on the endless warfare to give him the power he needs. Marco also learns that the evil has a physical body, and is the works of a powerful sorcerer known as The Mancer. Marco while researching The Mancer stumbles across a forgotten prophecy. The prophecy speaks of endless war where evil keeps pulling at the strings and corrupting the leaders into more wars, that when the wars end only the army of the dead will remain and evil will easily conquer the mortal world. Marco thinks all is lost but finds hope in one line of the prophecy. ""The machine slumbers till everything's end"". Marco brings this prophecy to his friend Octavianus Encratis who has elvish connections and Marco begins to orchestrate a summit between high ranking officials of all races. The    Summit is a success. After delivering a rousing speech and granting concessions to the Orcs and elves he arranges a temporary armistice, this is the first time anyone can remember not actively being at war. \n\n\n\nMarco uses this peace time to travel to the Dead Isle a archipelago to the far north of Tyrnna. It takes several weeks to travel too and is often hard to find. Marco talks to a savage elf who gives him a map and diagrams of a machine they found in the Dwarven ruins. The Dead Isle is covered in unknown ruins. More ruins are visible under the sea but massive creatures prevent any further exploration. Marco is looking for the slumbering machine according to the prophecy and hopes it matches the schematics from the Dwarven ruins as it would be a effective weapon to combat evil.\nMarco succeeds at finding the machine and the schematics match, Marco called it the most ""advanced construct from a ancient forgotten age."" The construct however would not wake. After examining the schematics for several minuets, Marco determines it needs a power source and offers his own life. The Construct accepts and Marco is never seen again. The construct then walked into the sea and appeared in Tyrnna weeks later. \n\n\n\nOctavianus learning of the fate of his good friend believes that Marco is now the Construct and sets into action a plan left by Marco in just such a event. Octavianus recalls a second Summit. This Summit was summoned much difficulty. In the weeks after the armistices, the forces of evil needed blood to grow and the lack of warfare required the Mancer be more aggressive. Members of all races were being attacked by dark spawn and corrupted and its armies were stretched thin. As they grew weaker, the forces of evil grew stronger. The Summit is more serious however seems willing to compromise. Octavianus in accordance to the plan tells the summit that a new army is needed. A Vanguard to support the construct and assist its mission to destroy the Mancer. Octavianus reads a speech writen by the late Marco Fadius Adjutor. \n\n\n\n""Men, Elves, Orcs, Hear me. We are the last mortals on Trynna. We ourselfs have committed the same evils we now fear. The races that did not adapt to warfare we destroyed. We have been embroiled in a war were we have slain countless elves, orcs and humans. We may never get over the hate we feel for one other, but for now we must yield. We must turn our aggression to a worthy foe. A foe whom we have been engaged with the entire time. The evil has existed in Tynna for so long that is manifests in pools on the ground and runs in the vanes of mortals. Evil is still growing. Even our king as fallen to it. How long before the elvish rulers fall or the warlords become corrupted? Our king is in the embrace of a magics so strong that we alone can not stop it, the same as you would be. I propose the creation of a new order. A union with humans, elves and orcs. The torch of a bright future. a future above wars and away from corruption of the unseen evil. They will be our vanguard against the unrelenting current of evil. The vanguard will be our new weapon to combat evil, and we will be victorious. We must be victorious.""\n\n\n\nMarcos words inspired the summit and a joint task force named vanguard was formed and Octavianus was placed in charge of it, as he had report with elves and orcs. The three races sent their most good and pure warriors, as any warriors who were impure would most surely be corrupted by proximity to the void stone. The Construct is always walking to a void stone. void stones are amplifiers of corruption and were built by the mercer. Void stones allow the Mercer to corrupt from afar and channel dark magics. The Construct must destroy all void stones to weaken the Mercer, then the construct can attack him directly. When the Construct finds a void stone it almost seems to wait for the Vanguard to find it before it begins to attack. The downside to attacking void stones is even pure warriors can change, its just a lower chance. So Vanguard are instructed to be wary of each other when assaulting a void stone and the Vanguard enchants its weapons and armor to prevent a Vanguard from killing another. \n\n"
2qgfdf,Original tower defence game ideas?,"I love to play tower defence games. Bloons Tower Defence 2 was my childhood back in the days with my friends. We'd play it for countless hours, trying new strategies every time and never get bored. I've just started making video games right now and I am trying to make a sort of unique tower defence game. Do any of you guys have ideas or aspects of a tower defence game that would be fun and unique? Very different? Thanks :) "
2qg1r3,Almost Paradise,"This will be a survival, sandbox game where you have very weak, latent magical powers. The game will be extremely peaceful and forgiving, with only minor penalties for certain things. There will be hunger and thirst to manage. The game is set on a mostly fresh set of archipelago with very little civilisation, like one or two abandoned tents, wagons or small villages. The beauty of the game is that there is no fighting whatsoever. You do have the option of killing the peaceful alien creatures around the area for meat, but they put up little resistance- However, one major penalty eventually arises: If you repeatedly kill animals without leaving breeding pairs, chop down trees without replanting, and tear up random holes in the land, the Guardian appears. The Guardian will literally be unkillable, and will stalk you relentlessly, slow you down, etc. and when you get caught by it, you spawn on a new archipelago without anything. Getting caught by the Guardian is the only way to die- Starving, dehydration, getting wounded will simply give temporary debuffs until you remedy the cause of the effect. Magical powers will simply slowly upgrade themselves, and depending on your actions, you will go into a different elemental alignment. \n\nEdit: Thanks /u/Aidanranger for this suggestion: There will be a karma system- Killing off animals and such causes the music to disappear, animals cower in fear, and the world turns duller and greyer. The Guardian appears when all colour is drained from the world. However, planting plants, breeding and taming animals, performing helpful magic, etc. would increase your karma, and as a reward the music gets more cheerful and peaceful, the colours get more vibrant, and creatures will fly around from tree to tree.\n\n\nWould you play this?"
2qextu,A game with 'mercenary gameplay'. Would you play this game? Any suggestions?,"Hi, I'm new to reddit. Anyway, I'm a beginner indie dev and I created this idea for a game I will make.\n\nYou play as a mercenary in a world at war. The game is a shooter with optional stealth and hacking, either a sidescroller or top down.\n\n You recieve missions from the different factions, and you earn money, loot, EXP and other bonuses. But heres the twist: You can work for both sides in a war, betray the factions, sabbotage and steal, sell data you find and can change the story by your choices is gameplay, such as killing main characters.\n\nYou live in a hub are and have places to explore, the game is slightly randomised and you can level up and customise your mercenary and your weapons.\n\nThe game will be in a futuristic setting with lazers and cyborgs, hoverbikes and spaceships.\n\nAnyway, would anyone play this sort of game, and do you have any suggestions?"
2qeoec,History/Education,"How about a game based on real life historical events?  I don't game at ALL, but in watching the Halo trailer it occurred to me that taking in any of these storylines is very complex- why not just use all that brainpower to teach a real event? "
2qeo0k,Space shooter with a twist,"The game would be a mix of Darius and FTL, where you build/prepare your ship and then enter a side scrolling space shooter. I have started to come up with a plot, and I will try to use Unity to make it. What do you people of the internet think?"
2qc3lb,First Person Sim City Mayor,"You aren't just a god overlooking a city, you're a first-person mayor. You can walk out of the mayor office, to the board room, to fight city council, to your mayor's mansion, convention center, etc. Can even go to procedurally generated houses, apartments, offices, etc. Bike through your parks, drive on your highways, ride the bus, commuter rail, and subway. Switch to godmode and oversee the development of your city. \n\nKinda like if GTA V was about politics and not gangsters. \n\n"

2q99v3,A fully instanced MMO consisting solely of dungeons and pvp.,"I love the idea of mmo's, I download a new one every week it feels like. I never stay with them though, because it always feels like they're trying to force me to play a traditional rpg. The thing is, an mmo is never going to do solo play as well as a dedicated rpg. Wow isn't Skyrim, it's not even The legend of Dragoon or FFIV.\n\nSo let's get rid of the barrens. Let's ditch days of real time spent killing wolves in a forest by yourself so you can, someday, play with your friends. I want a client like Lol's with a character select screen like Wow's. You've got a list of your characters, you choose one, and you choose a game type. I want to keep the dungeons and the raids (which would finally be worth the cost of making,) I want to keep the pvp. Just ditch the world around it.\n\nI'm supposed to care about my character in a traditional mmo because of the history I've built playing through the story. But the stories are ALWAYS going to be weak, they're ALWAYS going to be generic. YAY! All five of my dark elves had a breakthrough moment when they rescued princess IDGAF!\n\nSpend the resources instead on a character creator half as deep as Champions Online was, spend that time balancing a large number of skills so that we can have something that feels unique. I will create a history for my hero if I can build what's in my head, I don't need to kill 30 grizzled forest bears to feel connected. Look at Minecraft; we can make our own worlds, let us do it.\n\nIf we can make our own worlds, we don't need yours. I mean sure, give us things to play, give us a content creator like Neverwinter's, a few pvp maps, some dungeons and some raids, and then leave us alone. It's a lot of features to ask for, sure, (Large character creator, freeform skills, user content creation,) but then again the dev's don't have to create however many square miles of filler.\n\nI know I rambled and I probably accidentally left some massive holes here, but if anyone's curious how I'd resolve a particular issue I've probably already thought of it and simply failed to remember to address it here. So go ahead and ask."
2q86k6,A cooperative RPG experience. I am offering funding for a co-op forum.,"So I had this idea for a game. It is centered around collaborative content set within D&amp;amp;D kind of rule set(not exactly, merely that there are some rules, but they can be bent and molded because they are semi vague.)\n\nWhat I am thinking is a text based(or simple 2d or 3d) game centered around a community driven cause. Too make the ultimate RPG. We would need a forum only accessible by developers around an idea. \n\nSo you choose your character after a basic tutorial from a number of peers(the other playable characters) and go into the world.\n\nSo for the basics here is what I am thinking. We start out with X amount of writers for each playable character(1 or 2 each character). For an example lets say everybody starts in a monk monastery in the mountains attacked by a hoard of monsters after Y amount of training(choose your character after a short introduction to every playable character). \n\nSo lets say we have 10 acolytes and you choose one after a short introduction. Every storyline is made by a different person in a pre-established base world. The overarching threat could be whatever, even differing between characters(X wants to get together with his/her family, Y wants to stop the end of the world).\n\nEvery writer focuses on their own story, with every other story having little or nothing to do with the other stories. You might have seen decision trees for visual novels such as [fate stay night](http://www.neoneko.net/downloads/Flowchart.pdf) only with multiple writers. Imagine that tree branching x10 or x20 depending on amount of contributing writers/and or playable characters. \n\nThis would require the following people with the basics for the following skill sets[or a specialization].\n\nA basic understanding of game development programming, text based or more.\n\nX amount of writers for different storylines and an ability to write for a specific purpose(you have to interact with the people who put it into the game).\n\nAn overseer of the worlds rules and physics. Such as the limit of magical powers or the ""realism"" of 1v100 combat for an example. Basically a ""is this story realistic within the world we created and the advancement of your character"" kinda guy/gal(s).\n\nA webdev who creates a forum where the writers can discuss ideas and ask the programmers about whether choice X or action Y is possible. Basically a discussion center where programmers have ultimate say on mechanics and writers have ultimate say on direction.\n\nIf I see real interest in this I would gladly fund a forum for the developers and also contribute wherever necessary, be it story or internet connection of guy/gal X low on funds.\n\nWould you be interested in this? Comment below for constructive criticisms or enrollment. "

2q1e0z,"Is my story concept for a game worth being made (despite my obvious lack of skill), and what do you take from it ?","I've spent about a year exploring how to 3d model , make music and to program. To no avail my skills in either are amateur at best making cheap work-a-rounds by using things like ""Mixamo.com"" for animating models , free use base models for character's bodies and using free use texture as well. But one thing I know I can do is craft a compelling narrative that would make a my title worthwhile to play.\n\nNow I am gonna take a simple approach to explaining this as to not bore anyone ( Probably already have haven't I ? ). The description of the prologue and (in theory) first 2-4 hours of game is as follows :\n\nTitle: The False Hero (Subject to change)\n\nGenre: Third Person Adventure\n\n""The False Hero"" takes place on Thion an alien world that is home to a humanoid race that is split into 16 factions that each have a specific ""Ability"".\n\n[Side note]Their powers aren't referred to as abilities instead are described by the faction they belong to (Ex: Person with the power to manipulate is ice is referred to as ""Crymori"").\n\nThese factions in this point of history are at peace. The character you play as (Mirora Valyka) is a high ranking military officer in the faction of Spectras. This character's beliefs aren't in tune with success of her homeland , but instead with the well being of the people of Thion as a whole.\n\nValyka's beliefs are not an issue early in the game but when the Chancellor of Spectras begins preparation to attack Teshden a neighbor state. Valyka is motivated to maintain the current age's peace and leaves to warn the queen of the Teshrin. The Queen amused by the claim leaves on her own to the capital of Spectras destroying every Spectran temple in the city. The actions of the Queen alone had caused the Chancellor to back down from invading Teshden.\n\nLabelled a traitor and offered no sanctum in Teshden ( As only people of Teshrin origin may live there) Valyka must traverse to the center of the continent to the city of Thald a neutral city where people of all types are welcome.\n\nBefore she can reach the city she must escape Spectras and prevent capture from her homeland and its allies. She travels on old trade routes , ancient ruins and through small villages to remain unseen through her journey.\nEarly into her travels Valyka finds a small child being chased by a horde of anger villagers screaming ""Kill the abomination!""

2q0up3,Survival Game about an astronaut stranded on an unknown planet,"You play as an astronaut whose shuttle has crashed on a planet similar to Earth that they have no knowledge of. You salvage remaining ship parts to find some equipment that you can use to examine food and animal parts you find. This would be used to make medicine, equipment, or more saturating food.\n\nTo make tools you would have to use small rocks or durable animal parts (like teeth, hooves or bones). These tools would be used to make hunting, gathering materials, and building shelter easier.\n\nWhen exploring the planet’s surface, the player would not have to bring much food, if any at all. I would like the planet the player is stranded on to be abundant with food. If the player becomes hungry, there will most likely be several food sources around them. Fruit from trees/bushes and animals in the area.\n\nWhen players research an object, they would track the findings in their journal. Things like taste, sweetness, growth time, texture, and if it harmful to certain species (If that species has been researched), and conditions required for it to grow. Farming would be a big aspect of the game.\n\nWhenever a player starts a new game, the game world would look completely different from the last playthrough. Different climates, creatures, foods and biomes. I was thinking that this can be done well  by having a random color selected for certain sections of terrain generation. For example; when generating a new world, red may be chosen for stone, white for dirt, orange for grass/leaves, and brown for the sky.\n"
2pzv8j,Okay this is never going to happen,"If I remember correctly, they had a concept for a skate game to load in your own skateboard to play with (don't quote me on this). I was just talking with my friend and I had a great idea for a zombie survival game. Well with that same concept in mind, could they create a zombie game in which you could only play with things found around your house?"

2o0a3h,"Programmer and 3D Modeller here, needing ideas for a game!","Hey guys, I know some of you will ask why I did not want to just look through the feed and see what fits me, well it is because I want to see people talk to me, not to the whole world, make it a little personal. Comment any ideas, and if I like them I will reply and we can PM. If you have the best idea I will try to make your game. (Do not make it super complex)"
2nyj2j,"Perfect Game In My Opinion ""Different""","The idea is simple, as I have not noticed a single game that will be able to pull something like this off. The game will have a world where there should be 200.000 different fictional characters with different face features families and houses. \nThe game should be open world to the fullest. For example having the ability to go in each of the houses, hotels,shops,etc... that the game will have. Each of the houses will look differently with pictures of their owners on walls. And you can steal things from their houses , More like the game Thief but not like that :D.\n\nThe most interesting thing is that whatever you do in the game you will not be able to go back to it for example you kill 1 person of the 200.000 there will be only 199.999 people left in that town , and you'll have people moving in and out of the city each time, People having little kids. \n\nWhen you start the game you will find yourself being a 20 year old man with a regular job  in a regular house in a regular city, You will have two choices : Be the most wanted man in town or the most re-known. For example donating for charities or helping a granny cross the street or getting a cat out of a tree. Anything that can be done in real life. \n\nMoreover, when you reach the most re-known reputation , people will interview you on the street and investors will invest in you give money, houses , whores and whatever your dirty ass needs. \n\nFor the most wanted man in town , you will be able to rob people in plain street , stealing cars , killing people. When you get to this stage the Photo will be everywhere around that town and people who see you will recognize you and call the police , If a police car sees you its a 100% chance that they will start chasing you. \n\nCustomizable,  there will be a customization process to bypass the most wanted man in town, for example Using : Shades , hoodies , gloves and other things that will make people not recognize you. \n\nIf you think this game will be good or not please give an opinion as I have a shit ton of more ideas on how to make the ""Perfect game"" \nSorry for my English.\n\n"
2ns185,Badass Game About Eskimos,"I don't know if this is just me, but I would TOTALLY play a badass, graphically intense, Far Cry-Esque game about Eskimos. Traveling from Canada to Alaska and all the way up to Greenland with fishing, slaying Polar Bears and living in Igloos with your Eskimo Brothers. I don't know about anyone else, but I think this a very underused topic in entertainment."
2nr77v,Game based around music...,"So, I got this idea. What is the most used thing in a game? The music (besides animation of course). So, I got this idea to make a game around the music.\n\nYou will be able to turn the music up and down. Which gives you high jump (it will probably be a platform game) with slow music, and speed with high music. This will be some kind of puzzle game. When to go speed up the music, and when to not. Also, the music could at some points speed up and down by itself. So you'll need to time things correctly to win.\n\nWhat do you think? Worst idea ever? Improvements?"
2nqroy,"Hybridizing MMO, FPS, RTS and RPG","I started on this idea when Everquest was going full steam as the first big MMO.  \n\nI like MMOs, because they were the next obvious step in multiplayer.  I liked that Planetside managed to integrated FPS and MMO, whereas Battlefield and Call of Duty only offered instances on separate servers, rather than full, interlocking worlds of constant war.\n\nI got tired of MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, because once you hit level cap once and fully gear out, you've finished the game.  The rest is just repeating the same thing over and over, which is just terminal game design.\n\nSo, Planetside beat me to the large-scale, open-world MMOFPS.  Fine.  I just don't think they took it large enough, though.  I think Planetside limited their game by instancing their world into four continents and a VR zone.  PS just feels like a larger Battlefield 2142, still.\n\nI really think the next step in MMOs is to remove the separation of RPG, RTS and FPS into one game, in one uninstanced, open sandbox world.  And I say 'world' literally, as my idea was to have at least one entirely rendered planet as a continuous battlefield, with a resource system that includes a heavy investment in dropships and satellite networks centered around massive manufacturing spaceships outside of orbit, so there's actually not only an EVE Online-like use of spacecraft and orbital transport, but also a need for space dominance around the planet.  You'll not only need dedicated dropship pilots to get resources to the fight on planet, but you'll also need commanders to try and keep a handle on things, fighter pilots to protect dropships and warships, bombers, orbital fire-support ships, dreadnaughts, frigates and so on and so forth.\n\nIn atmosphere, you'd have your typical selection of aerospace assets deployable from orbit, aerial aircraft carriers and ground bases.  Vehicles can be spawned from ground bases in limited numbers, but dropships can bring in lots all at once from orbit or from other dedicated manufacturing bases.  The infantry game I don't want to go into too much detail about, because that's where the core trade secret would come from, but the lore behind the game is that due to an apocalyptic war against a xenocidal species, humanity unlocked matter-to-energy and energy-to-mass conversion, and likewise integrated millions of human personalities into effectively immortal and eternally replicable chimera super-soldiers.\n\nThe war takes place on the xenos' homeworld, which humanity reached through a temporary warpgate, sending in its super-soldiers and supporting fleet to completely exterminate the enemy.  Problem is, the warpgate did close behind the fleet, and the situation on Earth after the war ended deteriorated into in-fighting as the alliance-of-necessity that humanity had become fractured into multiple factions.  The Earth factions each wanted to bring back the fleets and their soldiers to take control over Earth, but fighting degraded Earth's capability so far they couldn't reopen the wargate, stranding the fleets on the xenos homeworld, hundreds of light-years from Earth.\n\nHaving no connection to Earth besides a place of origin, the super-soldiers, timeless beings, and their fleet waited a decade for contact to reestablish, each spending their time in their own individual and often eccentric pursuits on an alien world that is biologically still quite active.\n\nAfter a decade of no-contact, the soldiers gather together to try and decide what to do next, if anything.  They could simply offline themselves for millennia while waiting for contact, or they could do something.  Being pure soldiers, they naturally detest politics, and decide the last thing they want to do is get involved in Earth politics again...but not everyone wants to go into effective stasis for what may be an eternity.\n\nSo, being immortal and painless, having an infinity of resources at their grasp and the godlike capability to shape matter and energy at their fingertips, the soldiers that decide to continue awareness choose to do what any soldiers would do when war is their very existence and ultimately meaningless: They make a macabre game out of it.\n\nSo starts the rather tongue-in-cheek and entertaining Boredom War.  Split into five factions: Blue, Red, Green, Brown and Purple, as their are five manufacturing warships to correspond to each faction, the active soldiers split-up into whichever faction they like, often changing factions whenever they're bored or looking for greener grass, and just exercise their martial skills in a sort of Forever War that keeps them occupied until something more interesting comes along.\n\nThis isn't a serious, grime, blood and grit war.  It's not some dystopia.  Hate and faction pride is non-existant.  It's just something to do to pass the time for a bunch of soldiers with nothing better to do.  Rewards are given to control of territory, and each faction awards credits to individual soldiers as incentive for helping that faction, and currency to buy resources like vehicles, accessories, and even non-combat pets and mounts.\n\nThe factions maintain a cross-faction marketplace, where soldiers can buy and sell items to one another.  There's the basic omnitool that costs nothing for a soldier to deploy, but isn't incredibly exceptional in any one field of use.  The omnitool is an adaptable piece of energy/matter that can be everything from an assault rifle, to a sniper rifle, to a anti-tank weapon and even melee weapons of various shapes and sizes.  Soldiers spend their credits on physical weapons, batteries, energy cells, scopes, stocks, extended magazines and various other, limited use pieces of kit that can expand and increase their combat capabilities.  The buyable gear is typically more specialized at one task than another weapon or the basic omnitool, but has limits in terms of ammo and durability that the omnitool lacks.  The buyable kit is also crafted, by soldiers (read: players) and sold by players on the market, along with non-combat items like cosmetics, non-combat pets, mounts and various other items that add a bit of dark humor flavor to the game and a break from the usual kill'em all that is the standard FPS fare nowadays.\n\nThere are no classes in this game.  Rather, a player has a resource limit to his soldier, wherein he's free to pick and choose from a variety of kit slots, individual traits, specializations and perks.  A soldier could carry a repair tool and a medic kit, if he so chooses, although the resource cost compared to their allotment would mean his choices after that are very limited, because core abilities would require a heavy investment in resources, just for balance issues.\n\nThere are professions based on the resourceless ""Profession"" kit slot a soldier carriers, meaning he or she can change their profession simply by changing their loadout.  There are pure crafting professions, such as Cooks, who produce food and medicinal boosters for purchase that give long-term but not incredibly overpowered improvements to individual soldiers that persist through 'death', and boosts are basically injection drugs with a PG-friendly moniker that provide very short term but substantial increase to a soldier's capability.  The Cook, for instance, has to buy ingredients and material from the gathering professions, though.  There are multiple gathering professions that provide a wide-array of material gathered on the planet surface and in the space around the planet that they can sell on the market to the crafting professions. \n\nOne such gatherer is the Scavenger, who primarily gathers meat from the variety of animals present on the planet, and can dig around in the ground and around plants for other creatures and various forms of herbs.  The Scavenger, like all the gatherers, can set up passive and automatic collection equipment that he or she has to simply go back and check on every now and then to collect his bounty.  The Scavenger typically collects resources such as tree sap passively from a probe he can plant in any tree he or she finds.  Tree sap being essential to crafting for things such as sugar, and as a compound in medicines.\n\nAnother gatherer is the Colonist, who has a unique method for the gatherers.  The Colonist sets up solar array to passively collect solar energy, and can place corks in bodies of water that not only collect the energy difference between the hot and cold temperatures, but if the body of water is a river or stream, or any other moving water, including the ocean, he can collect energy generated by micro-turbines in the corks.  The Colonist is unique in gathering, because he doesn't have to check on his gear to collect his material, since his kit uses collected energy to wirelessly beam energy resources to him, allowing the Colonist to run off and join a battle or do whatever else he wants.  The Colonist's major drawback is that when night falls, his energy collection rate goes down dramatically, with the exception of his micro-turbines.  However, the Colonist is the only one that can collect energy, which is critical for any crafted weapon or piece of kit that relies on it, which there are many.  The basic crafting kit actually requires a battery just to sustain crafting, so the Colonist is always needed.  The Colonist can collect energy in space, as well, using gear planted out in the middle of nowhere or on asteroids and other celestial bodies to collect energy, thus, just like every other profession, the Colonist has ground and space capability.\n\nFrontiersman are also unique, but for different reasons.  The F-man collects building materials such as cement, building stones, wood and cloth from the wild, and can craft them by himself to feed the housing market's need.\n\nThere are major cities hubs in weapon-locked regions of the world that are open to everyone.  Inside these dome-protect cities are vast tracts of living space, wherein everything from standard and personalizable barracks for the poor can be used as personal space, to houses and flats purchased through credits, up to mansions and even massive guild halls.  Each abode is instanced off and accessible through the door, on a very simply invite-list the owner can preset to let anyone in that they want to visit their pad.  Furnishings are available through the market to pimp out a house, including the exterior.  The owner has to maintain it, though, by choosing to manually or automatically set his place to purchase basic material needed for repairs.  A place will degrade over time if not repaired, and if after 60 days the place is still abandoned, the place goes back up on the market, with all material and basic cost of purchase being refunded to the user, since real-life might mean someone can't help but lose his place.  The only penalty here is having to find a new place.  This isn't a user-unfriendly game.  In fact, every attempt is made to make it open and accessible to everyone.\n\nHanging around your house or the city conveys a building benefit to the player, as they're considered to be resting, which adds an additional benefit to the player akin to food.  Although no combat vehicles are allow in the city, your mounts, commonly restricted to no-additional movement increase in the war zone, is given a speed boost to make them like vanity cars for moving around the city.  The city itself has benches, tables, gazebos and etc. and the wide parks host open games of chess and other variations of classic board games on a massive and spectatable scale that a player only has to step on a pad to signal readiness to play.  This is to help foster a sense of community, and give players something to do besides wage war and work their professions.  It's like major city hubs in MMORPG: Give players a reason to show off their cosmetics and interact with other people, and they'll waste hours of their life doing exactly that.  Which, although I won't go into the pay-to-play aspects (secret!), the more a player plays, the more he'll end up paying, but not to a point of being more than about 15 dollars a month for the really, really hardcore, 12-hour a day player.  In fact, if you play maybe an hour a day, this game'll be pretty cheap for you.\n\nWorld of Warcraft hit on an idea that should be basic to all games that want to expand their playerbase to as many people as possible, and I'd want this for this idea: Make the bare minimum computing power necessary to play this game a fair bit behind the curve, but allow a slider so that higher-power rigs can get their money's worth out of the game.  Each user gets about as equal an experience out of it as they're willing to invest in their hardware.\n\nCover will be an important aspect of the game.  Your player will be able to interact with the environment and use it to protect themselves and effectively fire from cover.  Bullets will have varying degrees of penetrating power, to punch through cover.  The omnitool will have to be really specialized for power to punch through a wall, but a lot of the buyable weapons will have penetration as a common capability, making spending your credits worth it.\n\nLikewise, the omnitool, the basic weapon and modular piece of kit in the game, will be fully customizable using a ratio slider accessible through the player's menu.  You may have to give up power for accuracy, or range for recharge rate, but the player will ultimately be able to create the weapons they want to fit their needs, all available in multiple hotkey and mousewheel slots so the player can switch between presets on the fly.  This quick-change ability is unique to the omnitool, which can change much faster than the buyable weapons, and even allows the user to instantly take a melee swipe at someone, rather than having to mousewheel to a buyable melee weapon.  Indeed, you can go the entire gaming experience with nothing but the basic omnitool and do fine.  You'll just miss out on the increased focus and general coolness buyable weapons bring.\n\nAnyways, this was a long post, but I've spent something like a decade thinking about it.  Now that we're to the point broadband is essentially basic, and computing power has hit an acceptable rate, this game seems like its time is coming or has come.  \n"

2nmj1s,Space Ship Shooter/Simulation/MMORPG/Team Game,"5-6 man crew.  So imagine you and your closest friends are the crew of a spaceship. You're each in charge of a system (Engines, shields, piloting, navigation, weapons, ship maintenance). This game would have to be a 3D flyer so the pilot can actually fly through space. You rack up experience as you work on your system. Upgrade ship parts, make guilds or fleets. Quests could be deliveries, bounty hunting, etc. All of space except for specific cities is pvp.  The cities would be safe zones and different outputs would be neutral territory. When you destroy a ship, you can salvage it for parts and scrap. It would need a huge universe with different factions, races, and aliens. Player actions would affect the zones or sectors they are in.\n\nGod this game would be so cool. Obviously you would need to get all 5 people to play at the same time. Maybe when the player isn't there the ai takes over. I don't know. Eventually they could each probably get their own ship after your group has earned enough money to buy a ship but they would need their crew to be present per ship. \n\nLiterally a 2nd life in space with your best mates, you vs the rest of the universe."

You tell them no but your dad use to be a proffesional hacker. He was the one who hacked the Japanese Military's systems in 1985. Nobody did that in real life  though. You tell them all about the story and the story mode is that you are the guys dad and you hack into Japanese systems. Sameguns but now you can use guns from the revolutionary war. You can also buy new guns with shocks. Shocks are things you can earn by wiining in multiplayer games and getting classified case files. Shocks can also charge a hacking system called the Brainer. The brainer can control someone's mind. But you can only use it for a certain amount of time. Shocks can charge it. Would you play this?"

2rdj8z,Spy ARG idea I've had percolating for a while,"Basically its a real time spy ARG. It would have basically three main components. A phone app, a website, and the back end.\n\nHow I picture gameplay working is like this; A player logs into the app, and gets assigned a mission. The mission is to retrieve a package thats been left in a specific location then take it to a cafe to review and dispose of it, the drop may contain story info or some part of a more complex main mission. Another player from an opposing team has received intel about the drop and will by trying to intercept it. If pickup fails for either player they will have a secondary objective. Maybe following the player that picked it up, maybe photographing their face, trying to scoop the package to redeem the primary mission. During all of this there may be other players surveilling the first ones.\n\nThe phone app is how people would opt into the game when they want to play. You activate the app and it would be manage gameplay. It's where you would access mission data, missions would be things like surveillance, dead drops, meet ups, scouting, etc. Do other game related things like taking pictures, video, audio recordings, or whatever data collection the game had you doing.\n\nThe website would have people reviewing the data that operatives collect, building new missions, providing intel, etc.\n\nThe back end would be a set of algorithms that assign people missions based on location, available players, and some other criteria.\n\nI realize that there are some hurdles to be hurdled execution wise but I think its an interesting and doable concept. I've got some story elements thought out, and plans for an alpha trial that I've been working on that I think I could make work.\n\nSo what do you think? All input, criticism, and commentary is welcome.\n"
2rd1wz,I need help with ideas for buildings to put into a city building game that I want to make in the near future as I learn JS.,"This is probably a tried and over done game idea but I really want to give it a try. I'm thinking a European middle ages style town set up, so think things like city walls and fortifications.\n\n\nI've been playing a lot of Evony lately (Bring on the hate...) and these are some buildings I think that definitely need to be in a city:\n\n**Resource Gathering Fields**\n\n* Lumber Mill (Wood)\n\n* Farm plots (Food)\n\n* Quarry/Mines (Stone and other building materials)\n\n* Forges (Process stone and ores into iron)\n\n* *Any other ideas for resources?*\n\n**In-town buildings**\n\n* City Hall or Town Hall (or other names- central administration that represents the 'level' of your town)\n\n* Walls (Primary defenses. Can be equipped with further defenses. Evony has oil traps, abatis, archer towers, rolling logs, and rockfalls, but I'm definitely up for further ideas)\n\n* Cottages (For population, which is required to train troops and work on resource fields. In Evony, they are 'cottages' no matter what their level (1-10). I'd like to see 'upgrade able' cottages that can be represented by town homes, etc. ideas welcome..)\n\n* Barracks (To train troops)\n\n* Rally Spots (To send out troops from- to attack surrounding towns or resource buff fields)\n\n* Market (To buy and sell resources. In Evony, the prices for selling and buying each resource is based off of real world supply/demand on the server. This would be a single player game, but I'd still like dynamic prices.)\n\n* Academy (To research different methods and technologies that increase and buff different aspects in the game. In Evony there are 19 techs that range from increasing production of resources, to decreasing build times, to increasing army attack stats, etc.)\n\n*There are other buildings in Evony that I definitely think need to be implemented in some form or fashion to the game, but in different ways because upon research, several buildings would not have existed in a real life medieval city, or would have served different purposes. Here are some that I think need to be added, but are not necessarily within Evony (I'm not trying to totally rip off the game, just drawing inspiration from it):*\n\n* Hospitals. As your city grows, and more resources are being pumped out, the chances of accidents arise and pollution levels may rise. There needs to be a way to heal the sick.\n\n* Churches (Or temples. I'm not sure if I want to the game to have a central pagan religion, or a monotheistic one. What do you think?) Churches levels can affect the 'favorance' that the patron god of the city has upon your city and may bless your city or curse your city. This can affect natural things like crop output, river levels, etc, and things like population health. If a pagan religion is pursued in the game, different temples can be built that be dedicated to different gods who control different aspects important of your city. Cover all your bases, you know?\n\n* Storehouses. These are in Evony but the way that they are implemented leads to nobody building them in their city because they just aren't useful, especially in late game. I'm thinking the higher level a storehouse is, the more resources it can save in the event of a famine or etc.\n\n* Guildhalls. These could attract different people to your city that portray different attributes. The level of the guildhall could affect the number of notable people who visit at a time. This is partly implemented in Evony as 'Feasting Halls' and heroes, though upon some quick research, feasting halls are more of a Norse thing. Each hero is Evony has three different stats- Attack, Intelligence, and Politics. Heroes can be assigned as Mayors and mayors with a high politic level decrease building times more than heroes with lower politic levels. Attack heroes decrease troop training time, and intelligence heroes decrease research time. I'd like to see this implemented with more variety because you reach a point in Evony where you've researched all the techs to max level, and built all your buildings to desired levels, so all you have left is to train troops to wage war with one another. This means that heroes with high attack essentially become the only useful heroes. I need suggestions for different stats that these visitors could have? And also another name for 'heroes,' as well as another name for 'mayor' (Maybe Lord or something?)\n\n*I need more ideas for buildings because this feels like it would make for an empty city.\nHere are buildings that would be cool to have in a city, but I'm not sure what purpose they would serve:*\n\n* Bath House\n\n* Libraries\n\n* Prisons (Did these exist for the run-of-the-mill serfs and peasants of Middle Age Europe, or were they mainly just dungeons for the township's enemy's?)\n\n* Gate House\n\n* Wells and Public Fountains\n\n* Theaters (Kinda like Shakespeare's Globe Theater, but more 'primitive'?)\n\nSo, what do you think reddit? Any ideas? I'm also up for idea for pretty much any aspect of the game, but I figured buildings and resources would be a good place to start."
2rauk2,Business sim where you play as an infamous company and have to get the most reckless profit,"You would do things like put your workers and consumers at risk, make hypocritical remarks, and use fake studies to fight off resistance. Once your profit bar gets to 100,000,000, you win. You could play as 3 different companies, LJN, Monsanto, and PeTA, each with different methods. Could work out in the end as a good social commentary about big companies that just want profit. Then there would be a DLC adding Good Mode where you have to make the profit bar go DOWN by building a fan base and making your evil company bankrupt."

2ra3cg,An idea for another first person shooter!!! (This time its better sorry the other one sucked),Okay my other FPS idea apparently was worthless so here's a new fresh one!! It is called WarGround.Campaign and Multiplayer are definitely included. But I added something different. Time travel mode. In certain games (yes there will be sequels if you guys like this idea) where you can go to time travel mode. In this game you can time travel to WW2 and play missions there. Hope you guys like this idea!
2r9ngf,Horror movie murderer game where you are in the shoes of Jason from Friday the 13th or the Strangers!!,"I always thought ""how the fuck does the murderer go about murdering a family reunion at a house or people in the middle of a lost cabin?"" So I thought how cool it would be to be the murderer or group of murderers. For example, the movie The Strangers, if there was a game like that it could be like gta 5 in the sense that you could switch between characters and how you would enter the house or prevent them for leaving it or something. I think that would make for a cool game. You could make a murder psychological or gory or super stealthy and clean. It would be a cool game. Like every mission would be a reference to a different movie. One could be like Friday the 13th and the next could be like my bloody valentine. It would be a nice change from the generic first person shooters and third person adventure games like uncharted or assassins creed. I'm not dissing games like that but it's cool when there's games like dark souls or splinter cell to add variety."
2r7zz9,Need abstract ideas for 2d side-scrolling sorta flappy-reminiscent game,"Alright so I'm pretty sure everyone knows about the flappy bird game with double pipes spawned at random positions moving towards a bird that has to go through them. \nI'm not doing that. (everyone is tired of it by now)\nWhat I am doing is using the format of it to make a game that has other types of obstacles (not just double pipes) moving at something that has to avoid them. I've made 5 levels already and everything looks really nice, just I was sorta planning for 30 different levels. I mean, from my point of view, tubes can only have a handful of orientations.\nSo that's why I'm here. I need to some awesome abstract ideas so I could implement them. \n"
2r7sb8,A realistic version of Spore...,"Basically a ultra-realistic-based-on-science version of Spore... what more needs saying?\n\n[edit]\n\nHere's an idea ive been thinking about for a while... I think that the best way to make this would be to split it up into 3 interlocked games to ensure that each stage can be fully fleshed out and made enjoyable. \n\n- One game for the cell/creature/tribal stage (an evolutional survival game)\n\n- One game for the civilization stage (a mix between Civilization V and Europa Universalis IV)\n\n- One game for the Space stage (what Spore did but bigger, better and more realistic)\n\nThe goal in the **Evolutional Survival Game** would be simply to create and craft your species and adapt it to survive long enough and evolve enough to reach the tribal stage (which is also part of the Evolution Survival Game)\n\n The goal in the **Civilization stage** is to win Civ 5-esque victories, the victory you win here would determine your starting 'archetype' (for lack of a better word) for the space stage\n\n The goal in the **Space Stage**... well, I guess it would be a you pick your own goals kind of game. Your archetype (again... for lack of a better word) would guide you in your early decision making, but even that could change based on what you do...\n\n\nThe main thing I didn't like about spore was that it was to cutesy-wootsy... (cells don't have eyes!!)\n\n\n"
2r5xij,A Wolrd Sized MMO,"Basically Its all mechanics and such for the game devs. Very little to make visual wise on the servers. Only textures and the world itself. Basically Like Mabinogi meets Minecraft meets archeage. The Skill system, The Sandbox and the looks. Make a completely uncivilized planet for players to make civilizations. The Npcs come after we make ,villages, towns, cities and such. As we progress in the game we can create tech and so on. Magic is present in the world so people can be wizard researchers as well. They can be necromancers or some type of summoner or alchemist where they made a lair populated by their creations guarding their stuff and so on away from would be thieves and do gooders. Warriors can build Forts with each other and make Templar like factions. You can make caves, rivers even. Run a shop, run your competitor's into the ground. Have a NPC take over while you go do adventure stuff. Build a House. Watch KKK wanna be's burn it down. Build A house out of mud, watch the big bad wolf blow it down. Build a house out of brick and mortar, Watch Trolls blow it up. Build A house out of oil by products, Watch america start playing this game."
2r5jxw,Local Co-op with Real Time Splitting Screens.,"A games that best played with 4 players , at least 2. Puzzle , Action , Adventure games alike to Lara Croft games.\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nEach player can split infinitely without restriction of shared camera. And the game will dynamically split and combine in real time when each player are close or spread far. The games should be able to control this features , when certain situation met , players will be given some indication that split screen is disabled or rules changes for the designated challenges(e.g. create team of two , isolated 1 players or anything you can imagine). With this feature , it allow dev to create more complicated puzzle and more variation compared to restriction of every local coop games without split screen.\n\n\n\nI cant think of it Cons beside it will make screen for each players appear smaller and inconsistent . But no worry , its something we should discuss about here."
2r5j84,"Thyne Treasures - Free roam RPG, bring back treasure home, horde it, watch it grow.","Think about the loveliest treasures you've ever seen in movies and cartoons. Finn and Jakes treasury, the Cyclops treasure in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, that Daffy Duck episode with a genie and a vast treasure chamber.\nSure, you can gather a bunch of gems and skulls and drop it all on a table like I used to do in Oblivion, but that's just not satisfactory.\n\nFor some time I've been wishing that there'd be a game where you'd quest like any RPG you've ever played, and you gain cash and sometimes treasure items, which could be anything like gems, artifacts, a jade figurine, king's crown or apple, a golden mask, anything and everything, shinies! And then you'd have your treasury somewhere, where you drop choose to drop everything off and it'd automatically build into a pile with lots of coins and all the nice artifacts clearly visible and spectatable from any angle you should wish, you greedy bastard.\n\nOf course you gotta spend some for your in game equipment and such, and even sell an expensive item if you want that extra bit of cash, but in the end you wanna see your treasure grow!! Maybe this is what I'll do in Everquest Next, just make physical objects of all the gold I gather? "
2r4tgw,Looking for game ideas that can be done in a 2d engine?!,"I use Stencyl to make games.\n\nI want to make games, but i have no ideas.\n\nHelp!"
2r2n6u,Just dreamed about that RTS,"So this is on one hand a classic RTS you can play with factions, buildings ans unities. But it take place un a computer world ( tron world's in my dream), So you can use a console while gaming to do a lot of things:\n\n-program scripts for building construction, optimisation, personalised AI of your soldiers.\n\n-hack the ennemy to get his soldiers/ressources, destroyers wall etc...\n\n-dev some custom weapons, soldiers.\n\nUsing console take you time, So it's notre always the best choice. The problem is how to make dev part interesting/non repetitive so you had to really do some search Every time and not writting text you have learned before."
